Speaker 1: Okay.  My name is Larry Crowe, and I'm the interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: William Alfred Massey.  That's, M-A-S-S-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I think--I have to ask my mother.  I think the middle name, Alfred, is, maybe--might have been her grandfather.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think he attended Alabama A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 4th, 1956, in Jefferson City, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: I guess my current title now is the Edwin S. Wilsey Professor of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's March 8th, 2013.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Oh, we're in the basement of Sherrerd Hall on the campus of Princeton University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25970
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warmup, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is:  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I'm notorious for liking steamed crab legs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: You have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Let's say I like spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Probably Paris.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: What I use a lot is, "Think outside the hypercube."
Speaker 1: Okay.  (laughs)  All right.  I like that too.
Story_ID: 25971
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately, and then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please? Juliette, and that's, J-U-L-I-E-T-T-E, McCauley, middle name, so, M-C-C-A-U-L-E-Y, Massey.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess it's easy now, because I know she just had her ninetieth birthday.  So I guess that takes us back to 1923.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them or are there any stories about them that have passed down in the family?
Speaker 1: Well, one story I just happen to know.  When people talk about what helped you get to where you are, you know, how much of it is luck, how much of it is just, you know, making decisions.  And I found it's really a mixture of both because her father had decided not to--he could have attended college, but he decided not to and he worked for the Post Office, you know, to earn a living.  But by making that sacrifice, he sent his baby sister--paid for her to go to college.  And she became a school teacher, and this was my great-aunt Cleo.  And so I noticed over the years when I was growing up, when my mom wanted to--me and my dad were going to purchase a home, you know, she would ask Aunt Cleo to ask her out with money for the loan; and then certainly when I was--they were about to send me to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], you know, she would call Aunt Cleo to help out.  So it was, you know, her father had sacrificed to help, you know, his baby sister; in turn, his baby sister, you know, made financial sacrifices to help us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it's a tight-knit family in terms of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Type of interaction.  So, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 1: Oh, it's--I have to check.  But I think it's Bryant McCauley.  I'm not--I'm not sure.  I didn't really know him well.  He, unfortunately, had passed away when my mother was very young, so I never really knew him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you think it's Bryant?
Speaker 1: I think so.  But I could check on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Now, what about your--any stories about your grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Right.  I knew that--I think she had grown up in Nashville [Tennessee] and then moved to Chattanooga.  And after her first husband passed away, then she remarried and it was a fellow--my mother always referred to him as Mr. Rogers.  I think his name was Augustus Rogers.  And she would tell me about how he had worked--well, over in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I think he had worked as a blacksmith.  And there was the famous rail line called the Incline he had worked on until they started to unionize, and then he was no longer, you know, no longer had a job there.  And so I had known him until, I think he lived until I'd first year started at--in college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So she married him after your grandfather passed.  He died real early.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, are there any--is your mother's family from Tennessee, basically, as far as you know?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, that's about how far back as we can go with her?
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: And, let's see.  Are there any stories about Emancipation or slavery or that sort of thing on that side of the family?
Speaker 1: I don't know of any stories that far back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I just heard stories about how they were living around Lookout Mountain in, you know, near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and, you know, I mean, they had--they interacted with, you know, various people, you know, the way, you know.  Sounds like they had a pretty solid middle-class life.
Story_ID: 25972
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother want to do when she was growing up?  Did she have any aspirations?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  I think--well, she ended up going to college at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], and then she majored in home economics.  So she had first taught college, taught home economics at, I think, Texas A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, College Station, Texas].  Oh, no.  Excuse no.  Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas].  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Texas Southern University.  That's where she first started.  And, in fact, she made some good friends there.  You know, this was like the early--the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].  She's still friends with--two good friends of hers, Thelma Williams and Evelyn Thornton.  You know, they're, you know, they're still all alive, and they still talk to each other and know a lot about us before we were ever born.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: And then she--oh, yeah, I think she had gotten a master--my mother got a master's degree, I think, at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], you know, in home economics, and then she was teaching college level.  And then she left there to take a job at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, which is where she met Dad.  That's Richard Massey.
Story_ID: 25973
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's go to him then.  Can you, yeah, your father's full name is Richard Massey?
Speaker 2: Right.  Middle name Devereaux.
Speaker 1: Devereaux.  Okay.  That's D-?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  D-E_V_E_R_E_A_U_X.
Speaker 1: E-A-U-X.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  And Richard Devereaux Massey, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, let's see, earlier.  So I think it was--I'm going to guess around 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think he grew up in South Carolina, but primarily lived in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  What can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't really know as much, because when I was a kid we spent more time, you know, in St. Louis [Missouri].  We'd always hop in the car, spring break, you know, or Thanksgiving, drive down to Chattanooga [Tennessee], see my mother's [Juliette McCauley] family.  Didn't really visit my father's side as much.  I do know one interesting tidbit I just sort of picked up years later, which is that, when I was kid, I remember waking, you know, getting up Saturday morning and Dad would always volunteer to cook breakfast, you know, for Saturday morning.  And what he used to make was, he'd take like a glass pan and put corned beef hash in it, and he'll mash it all up in the pan, crack open some eggs and put that in the oven and bake it.  We used to have that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I didn't think much of it until about, it might have been like twenty, twenty-five years later.  I'm going to a conference in Germany and there's a place where they primarily serve fish, and I'm allergic to fish, so I ask for an alternate dish, and then they bring me exactly the dish my father always made.  And then--well, by this time, unfortunately, my father passed away so I couldn't ask him about it, and so I asked my mother, "What did my, you know, paternal grandmother, what did she do for a living?"  And then my mother said that, "Well, I think she worked as a cook for a German family."
Speaker 1: There it is, full circle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a name for that dish?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  So your dad was born in--was raised in South Carolina.  So no stories on this side of the family about what his parents did for a living, do you think?
Speaker 2: Not sure.  Because I never knew--I never knew his father.
Speaker 1: He didn't talk about what his dad did for a living?
Speaker 2: No.  And then his mother probably passed when I was, like, in fifth or sixth grade.  I didn't really get to know her as well.
Speaker 1: And so you didn't go back and visit--he didn't go visit that much with the family?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, yeah, because we went--I remember going there once.  It's just the regular--it was a visit, and then the next time we went because his older brother passed away, and didn't really--went there after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 25974
Speaker 1: Now, did your dad serve in the war?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, that's how he ended up at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri], because of the G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he serve overseas?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was at Lincoln University on a G.I. Bill, and what was his aim?
Speaker 2: Well, he became a teacher, a high school teacher.  So what happened back then is that they both decided to come to--move to St. Louis [Missouri], like, when I was about four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--that part I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what was he?  He became a teacher.  Did he have a specialty like your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, journalism and, I guess, history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But later in high school he became a guidance counselor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then, and my mother was a home economics teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So they met at Lincoln University, and they decided to move to St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And was that for a job in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think back in those days, I guess, married couples could not both have jobs at a university.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, he--so your mother, I know she was teaching there, but he was a student, right, until he got his--or was he teaching at Lincoln, too?
Speaker 2: I think he was working as an administrator at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had graduated by that time?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So I take it they taught school in the St. Louis area?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25975
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about their personalities, what they were like, what kind of sense of humor they had, what they were interested in, how they looked, how they walked, talked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, a mixture of both, because my father [Richard Massey] had a camera, and so he was always taking photos.  And so I'm always, you know, I like photography.  And then, well, back in those days he would--if he thought--saw any interesting articles, you know, he would--like newspaper clippings, cut things out; newspapers, magazines, maybe Xerox them and send them to people.  And I probably do--well, I do that know, but I use the internet and just send email; so I don't make--I don't make physical newspaper clippings.  And I think my mother [Juliette McCauley] actually had an interest in science, you know, like her.  One of her good friends, Thelma Williams, became a chemist, and she always thought--of the different era, if she had to do it over again, she might have gone into chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So it seems like your father was very much interested in current events and history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One fact, at church he would organize what he called "Contemporary Issues," you know, have students discuss issues of the day.
Story_ID: 25976
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One older brother, so Richard Massey, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And a sister, a younger sister?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No sister?  Oh, just one younger brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean older brother?
Speaker 2: Older brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So your household growing up just consisted of you four?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there were no grandparents living with you or cousins or uncles?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what part of--side of town did you grow up on in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Well, sort of the North St. Louis.  It's--I found St. Louis has changed a lot since I was growing up.  The--first we moved to, it was like an apartment on Enright, near the intersection of Enright and Newstead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, years later I found that, I think--well, decades earlier, I think, maybe Redd Foxx [John Elroy Sanford, comedian and actor] may have grown up in that same neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For some reason, a lot of black comedians came from St. Louis, you know, from Redd Foxx to--there's Dick Gregory to Cedric The Entertainer.  And then we--so I--about nursery school is when I got to St. Louis; and then about third grade, we moved from the apartment to our first house.  And I know it was the corner of Shreve and Farland, and--
Speaker 1: Was that out of the traditional black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all were pioneers--housing pioneers, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, every--the whole neighborhood, I mean, there was a lot of black families that owned their homes.  I remember the neighbors we had on both sides, you know, both black.
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you were saying you moved into a neighborhood that was outside of the normal black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  It was like North St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a fact, I think St. Louis, at the time, was very grey--it was a large, black middle-class community.  Well, they--but they all still lived in northern St. Louis.  This was before they moved to the suburbs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So that's a traditional black community in St. Louis, I mean, the one that was, you know, existed when you were coming up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because St. Louis had a gifted program, and then--so, from fifth to eighth grade, I went to this special school, you know, for the gifted.  And given the dynamics of St. Louis, this ended up being a predominantly black program.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Because what happened is that, white kids who may qualify for that either had parents who had a lot of money and then would send them to a Catholic private school, or they would just move out to the suburbs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25977
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back to--okay.  So when you--do you have an earliest childhood memory? Yeah, I guess, of being in--well, in Jefferson City [Missouri], so I was there until four o'clock--before--until I was four years old.  And I remember, you know, just things like T.V., they were showing, like, 'What's My Line', or just kind of walking around the--outside the house, you know.  And there was a steep incline that went, you know, like a road that went up to some other houses.  It was right next to the campus.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25978
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  When you consider like the places you grew up in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was going on, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I know I can, in St. Louis [Missouri], well, one distinct smell they don't really have today is in the autumn, when people would rake all their leaves into the street and then they would burn the leaves.  But now, that's, you know, no one does that any more.  Sights and sounds.  What I think about St. Louis is that how in the summer it just got very hot.  In fact, it was so hot there, because I know it's funny, when I came to New Jersey that if it hits the 90s [degrees Farenheit], New Jersey considers it to be a heat wave; and in St. Louis, we didn't call it a heat wave until it hit the hundreds.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, St. Louis is hot in the summer.  I don't know what it is; if it's the humidity or what.
Speaker 2: Right.  I remember as kids we would, you know, play outside, not think about it; or before we got an air-conditioner, I remember my father got this large fan, you know, I mean, a really--like an industrial-sized fan just to blow air through at night to keep things cool.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The summers in St. Louis, the heat is different.  I don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: You're right.  You're right.
Speaker 1: I can identify with it.  I've been there a lot of times, so.  Any other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  Trying to think of other things (pause).  Nothing that comes to mind.  Sights and sounds.  Yeah, those are things that, I guess, stuck with me the most.  But, you know, like walking, you know, well, I guess things like going past the bakery; the smells there (pause).  But, yeah, that's about it.
Story_ID: 25979
Speaker 1: What were you interested in growing up? Well, I noticed in grade school I was interested in--well, it was looking at how you would organize things or make patterns or, you know, noticing that--I saw a magazine, and they just had like a cataloging of birds.  And I thought that was interesting, like you could--you know, I remember getting copies of the pages and pasting them in the little construction paper booklet, you know, so.  You know, different ways of organizing birds in their categories, or insects, or somehow with me and my brother--when I think of the toys we enjoyed the most, well, you know, we had lots of toys come and go, but I think we had the most fun we've ever had was when my parents bought a new washer and dryer.  And so the most fun we had was the box those washers and dryers came in.  You know, we turned that into a clubhouse.  You know, we just did lots of things.  So, we kind of, like, or they gave us a toy that lasted the longest, were just wooden blocks; you know, things we could just piece together and build anything we want.
Speaker 2: So the thing that you would use your imagination with and things that you can actually construct?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you ever have an Erector Set or a--that's thing with the sticks and the--
Speaker 1: Oh.  Erector Sets.  Well, actually, I was--this was like the pre-.  I remember we had these building blocks; well, we had these plastic--
Speaker 2: Yeah, something called 'Lincoln Logs', and--
Speaker 1: Well, there were Lincoln Logs.  There was another one.  This is like pre-Lego.  There was another set of bricks, plastic bricks that you would assemble.  Yeah, we were, you know, had gotten into those also.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then things like drawing, you know.  I had gotten interested in comic books, you know, we were, you know, trying to draw super heroes, and--.
Speaker 2: Did you have favorite characters?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, I think at the time I probably leaned more toward, I guess, DC Comics; you know, Superman; you know, Batman, Flash; and then my brother got into Marvel Comics, and then, you know, Fantastic Four.  And so we ended up buying both.
Story_ID: 25980
Speaker 1: Okay. We were just saying, in the break, that a friend of yours has a theory that the character of Steve Urkel and--what was the name of that show?  Was that--
Speaker 2: 'Family Matters'.
Speaker 1: 'Family Matters', yeah.  Jaleel White played the role of Steve Urkel, the nerd.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, that's my first Ph.D. student, Robert Hampshire, who was the last student I mentored in the Bell Lab Fellowship Programs, so.  I bring this up because Robert is now in his early, early 30s, and so he always told me that that was the seminal moment that set black science back an entire generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, no offense to Jaleel White, but it's just that character was just not a, you know, it just didn't set a good image.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He had a weird kind of a way of presenting himself, but I thought--my kids would watch, because that's the only reason we thought that--I always wondered why people were so annoyed with him all the time rather than fascinated by the fact that he could create like a meta-transporter in the garage (laughs) and stuff.  It doesn't seem like--I know it was a comedy show but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was he--to think in real life that somebody could do that, you know, you would just be--people would just be astonished, you know, rather than, you know, annoyed.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I think that's--it gets to a bigger issue about the lack of respect for knowledge, thinking, science, rational thought; that sort of pervades all of society.  You know, because you'll hear people say, "Well, I'm not into math because it's too abstract."  And I always tell them, "Do you think a football game is reality?"  You know, that's an abstraction also.  You know, so it's just a question of some abstractions you like, some you don't.
Speaker 1: Some you can understand and some you don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for whatever reason.  Yes, so.  And also, on the comic book question--well, in popular culture--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, a lot of comic book characters are scientists, and (unclear), and you were mentioning that the character that Greg Morris played on 'Mission Impossible'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was a positive example of scientists on television, black scientists.  Maybe the only example I can think of right now of black scientists.
Speaker 2: Well, then if--but I mean one thing I've found, I give this sort of T.V. trivia; so I give like a tough trivia question.  I say that, "In the 1990s, there was an hour-long drama that featured a black man in a leadership role, and he also had a very close relationship with his son.  Name the show."
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I can do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it's 'Deep Space Nine'.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Avery Brooks, but I'm strange anyway (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs). But people--a lot of people find it very hard to come up with that answer, because they say "There was a show like that?"  I just can't--I mean, and it's--at least it happened, but it's sort of sad in a way that, to have such a show you've got to go into the fantasy world of science fiction just to see a black man in a leadership role having a warm relationship with his son and the context of a hour-long drama.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  That was--I was dedicated to that show, you know, because of that, and was upset that there weren't enough stories about him and his son.   You remember the 'Star Trek' series from the '60s [1960s], you would have been a kid watching this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because I was a teenager, where William Marshal played a black scientist whose computer took over the Enterprise.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Well, actually, my brother was ahead of the curve, because when I was a kid he liked 'Star Trek', when it first came out.  And I think, for some reason, I was more interested in the show 'Bewitched'.  Well, I think that I liked the special effects.  But later in college, I started realizing, you know, that this was a, you know, superior show.  And even now I look--well, some many things have changed 'til people take it for granted; like for example, in a show, you know, like a lawyer show today, you could easily have a plot where the guy's about to be hit with some major lawsuit, and he's going to have to go to trial, and the prosecuting attorney that's going to try to convict him turns out to be his ex-girlfriend.  I mean, this kind of plot line, it's not a big deal today.  But, the first show that had a plot line like that, you know, I guess we're almost going back almost 50 years ago; not Perry Mason, 'Star Trek'.  You know, back in the '60s [1960s], you wouldn't have a woman in the role of a prosecuting attorney.  But in 'Star Trek', well, this is the future, it's science fiction; why not?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's interesting that we were projected to actually be in the future, considering what was going on in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know.  So I thought it was interesting that we were actually in the future (laughs), you know, on T.V., you know--
Speaker 2: Well, what's amazing is that, given how much turmoil that went on in the '60s [1960s], how come a time when, you know, we were living through it, we were worrying about if the whole world was going to die in a nuclear holocaust.  But now, when we look back on this time, how come that seems like such a time of optimism in vision.  I don't see in that same level of vision, you know, today.
Story_ID: 25981
Speaker 1: So, what--well, what else did you like to do while I'm at it?  Now, you were interested in collecting--well, you said patterns in order--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And sorting things, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, picked up things like origami; you know, working with construction paper; drawing things; what else.  And then we, as a kid we used to play--rather, I would play games--well, play Army.  In fact, it kind of shows you how, you know, when people wonder about the effect that toys will have on their kids, I say that, don't worry too much because--I remember a toy I really wanted for Christmas and I got was called 'Johnny Seven', and this was like seven guns in one (laughs), you know.  He'd--it'll be a little pistol, it would be like a machine gun, it was a grenade launcher, you know, lots of other things; and my brother got a 'Sonic Blaster', so it was a like a bazooka that shot compressed air.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we would get like little pop tents and, you know, the helmets. camouflaged helmets and do all the stuff.  And then when we got older, we had no interest in joining the military.
Speaker 1: You're right there.  There was a lot of the proliferation of gun toys in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it didn't necessary mean that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One fact, when you think of the look of the, you now, the Black Panthers in the '60s [1960s], that was really patterned after the look of the 'Green Berets'.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Except, you know, the black leather jacket and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25982
Speaker 1: Now, when did you start school or what was your first school?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you say school, you mean grade school or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, grade school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is--I think it's at Field Branch [St. Louis, Missouri].  So I was there from like kindergarten to the third grade.
Speaker 1: It's called Field Branch?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because there was--well, you know, '60s [1960s] baby boom; so, too many kids to fit into Field School, so there was a branch school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --called Field Branch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  So--
Speaker 2: Then we moved.
Speaker 1: Now, is that an all-black school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then you moved when you were--
Speaker 2: Then we moved to another residential area in St. Louis.  That's when we had the house that was on the corner of Shreve and Farland.  And one year I was at a school called Scullin, S-C-U-L-L-I-N.  I was just there for one year, and then I was put in this gifted program, and that was a school called Walnut Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was there for, like, fifth through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: So this was a gifted program.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you--they tested you in, I guess, in the fourth grade?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At Scullin?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the results of your test?  I mean in terms of what you (simultaneous) excelled in (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know what they were.  I mean, I don't know what the results were.  You know, I was never really told, but, you know, I was just one day taking these tests, and then they come and tell me, "Well, next year you're going to be going to Walnut Park."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you excited about going or did you say, "Well, I got to leave my friends?"
Speaker 2: Well, it was--yeah, I was excited because by then I'd only been there--at Scullin I had only been there for a year.  So it wasn't--you know, so it wasn't like I was with people I'd known since nursery school or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you scored high enough--did anyone else from your school, from Scullin, go over to Walnut Park?
Speaker 2: Good question.  Not sure.  There might have been one other person, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So if we were to go back in time and see your activities in school, would we predict that you were going to grow up and become a mathematician?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly by about seventh grade.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a good student all along, I take it, until, you know.
Speaker 2: I think around sixth or seventh grade, I was just sort of bored with the math courses.  I wasn't doing too well.  But then I realized there's some seminal event in seventh grade where--since it was a gifted program, they gave us--you know, the '60s [1960s] is the days of new math.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: And for all of society, people said that the whole program was a disaster.  But the problem was, there was not--it was a shortage of teachers who trained to do it.  And so--well, being in the gifted programs, so we had access to the teachers who had the right training.
Speaker 1: Now, what did the new math consist of and what made it new?
Speaker 2: I think they just put in a lot more advance topics that they--you wouldn't normally have in, I guess, the old curriculum.  Yeah, things like talking about binary numbers or, you know, looking at number systems and different bases, or talking about geometry.  I remember, fifth grade, they were talking about, "These are points, these are line segments, this is a plane."  And I remember in the seventh grade we were doing some abstract reasoning, which I didn't realize that was really like algebra.  And I remember we had this test where I got, like, 90 percent on it.  And then there was another student, I think her name was Jackie--maybe Jackie Mason; you know, she got, like, 70 percent.  And everybody else just flunked the exam.  Okay.  And so at that point, I knew math was for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Since you could outdo everybody in that class (laughs)?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Was that the seminal event?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I guess the others--the other thing was just, since I liked to draw, I noticed that--well, I remember trying to draw comic book character, and they never quite looked right.  And then I picked up a book out of a library and realized what I didn't really understand was proportion.  And so once I got the proportions right, then they started looking--the characters looked a little more, you know, realistic.  And then through drawing I got into, I guess, would now be like, you know, graphic arts.  So when I found that with a compass and straightedge, you could draw like a regular hexagon.  So that also got me excited about mathematics.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, when you said you liked to draw, at some point I was going to come back into that and ask what kind of things, you know, things you drew.  There are, you know, comic book art is full of--some of the artists really can draw technical stuff in perspective, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I wonder if you were drawing those, you know, those kinds of perspectives.
Speaker 2: I never really drew--yes, I never did like that type--well, back then, I guess, it would be like mechanical drawing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Never, never really did that.
Speaker 1: Are you familiar with Jack Kirby?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, Jack Kirby from Marvel was excellent in drawing perspective, and big machines, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --things like that.  You could--
Speaker 2: Turn them around.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could almost turn them around on the page, you know, you'd see them being like that.  He was better at that than drawing people, actually (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.  I know my brother liked to make physical models of cars.  He would take balsa wood and sand it, and paint it in a glossy way that you'd look at this and think it was made out of plastic rather than being wood.
Speaker 1: That's quite a--is he an engineer now or is he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, now that he had been working in--well, St. Louis [Missouri] at the junior college.  You know, he's been like a tech--working a technical staff, working with the equipment; he's also been a tutor--students in math, math topics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 25983
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you were growing, was your brother basically your best friend, growing up?  I mean, did you have like a--or both you all had like a wider selection of key people that you dealt with?
Speaker 2: Well, we had key people that we knew, well, we knew when we were in nursery.  I guess some of them we've known since nursery school.  There's Andrew Chandler, because his father was a good friend of my parents [Juliette McCauley and Richard Massey], you know, so we knew each other in Jefferson City [Missouri]; and then we both moved to St. Louis [Missouri], and years later, I didn't realize that his, you know, Andrew's father, you know, was Andrew Chandler, Sr., well, we knew him as a plumber.  But we didn't know is that he was one of the first black plumbers to break into the union, you know, in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And, I'd like to mention another friend.  When we first moved to St. Louis, his name is Kevin Smoot.  And then Kevin was--started nursery school about the same time we did in St. Louis, and then he had a younger brother, Jerod.  And he was just two doors down.  And we still--you know, we still talk to him today also.
Story_ID: 25984
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you mention Andrew Chandler's [Massey's childhood friend] father and the plumbers, do you remember from growing up the political activity going on around St. Louis [Missouri]?  I mean, were you (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I had no--
Speaker 1: Were your parents involved in any of the social change activities or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, they weren't directly involved.  I mean, I had no--a lot of things were going on.  I just no awareness of it, because--in fact, I remember--see, by the time, for example, Martin Luther King was assassinated, I was in, maybe, like, seventh grade.  So, and then I remember in the late-'60s [1960s] hearing the news about riots going on in various cities, and I kept looking outside my house and saying, "Okay, where is this happening?"  Now, it wasn't until decades later when I saw, like, 'Eyes on the Prize', that I discovered that St. Louis had never quite erupted the way towns like Detroit [Michigan], Durham [North Carolina], Newark [New Jersey], or Los Angeles [California] had, you know, had erupted.  I mean, you know, there, you know, it's not like there wasn't, you know, I'm sure there was racism in St. Louis, but it wasn't quite as--maybe, I don't know what was happening there that made it less--cause less turmoil.  Well, I mean in the sense of people having, you know, causing riots.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think there were riots in East St. Louis, weren't there, right around about the same period of time?
Speaker 2: There might have been, right.
Speaker 1: Right across the river.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right across the river.  Right.
Speaker 1: It seems like a dynamic, and I don't if this is completely right, but a lot of eco--you know, poor black people lived across in East St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, I guess--I would think the neighborhoods there would be more economically depressed.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Because--also, see, politically, East St. Louis is isolated because being across the river means that they are not a part of Missouri; they're part of Illinois.  And then it was they were totally depended, I guess, they're heyday was like the '50s [1950s]; you know, sort of like an industrial town.  And then when the industries leave, there's nothing left.  In fact, they still haven't, I guess, recovered.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I don't think they will either unless something new changes there, you know.  It's like Gary [Indiana] and a lot of other places.  But, so, now, how were you--you were, what, let's see--you would have been--so, when Dr. King was killed you would have been, like, twelve or so?
Speaker 2: Maybe a little younger; maybe about eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  Do you remember that incident?  I mean, do you know--you remember what you were doing or what your family was doing when that happened?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't strike me as much as--well, actually, in third grade I remember exactly what was going on when [President] John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that seemed to have a bigger--well, because I remember it was like a rainy day at school, and so, that meant we couldn't go out for lunch; we had to have lunch indoors.  And then suddenly all of the teachers come in crying.  You know, they were talking about him being assassinated.  Martin Luther King, I don't--it's hard to say because maybe--well, it could in part be because we just heard about it.  You know, there was no visual to see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know they covered it in the news; but, of course, they couldn't show it like they did the Kennedy assassination--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where someone actually shot a film of it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, in fact, it is one of those that looking--I remember ten years later seeing in retrospect of '68 [1968], and I did not realize how much--well, I mean, I kind of knew these things went on, but I didn't kind of put it all together.  You know, like, two months later, Bobby [Robert] Kennedy was going to be shot, and then there were, you know, the riots at the Democratic Convention in Chicago [Illinois].  You know, there were a lot of things that's happening, but I just didn't really--yeah, wasn't really aware of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you would've been about eleven then?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: So you were kind of immersed in whatever you were doing at that time (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25985
Speaker 1: Do you think when you grew up you were different from other kids in terms of what you were interested in or anything, or you were about the same?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Depends on--
Speaker 1: They wouldn't have noticed that either.
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on where, you know.  It's that--it's that in the city of St. Louis [Missouri]---. Well, this issue comes up a lot because--well, not with me personally, but I read a lot about this whole theory of the 'acting white syndrome'.  Okay.  And there is a debate where some scholars try to claim this is--this happens; some try to claim it doesn't really happen.  And I've--well, I worry about the ones who say it never happens, because I think--I'll be blunt.  I think they're being intellectually dishonest, because it really does--it really takes place; it really goes on.  And then they start developing what I consider propaganda to a certain--suggest that the people who bring up the issue.  You know, I don't know.  They're doing it so they can get to be on Fox News or, you know, serve the interest of other groups.  But it is reality, but I can tell you from my personal life, you know, I can see how some people might think it doesn't go on, because if you'll ask me--from growing up through ninth grade, if you'd ask me if there was such a thing, I would tell you know, okay.  You know, like, my guy in the Marvel Comics, well, my brother was into it already.  My parents [Juliette McCauley and Richard Massey] had us, me and my brother, take piano lessons, and the son of the piano teacher, you know.  So my brother and I would take turns, the other one would be talking to the piano teacher, you know, son.  He had Marvel Comics, we'd look at those; he played chess.  He taught us how to play chess.  I played chess with other kids in the city of St. Louis, you know the gifted program; and then I spent one year, ninth grade, at Northwest High School in St. Louis, and I was on the chess team.  Okay.  So that was fun.  But then tenth grade we moved to suburbia.  And so I'm going to University City High School; well, at the time it was called University City Senior High School.  And then I joined the chess team, and, you know, I'm able to join.  All the other kids on the team are white, but they accepted me, you know, I play on the team.  But then around tenth grade I start noticing that some of the black kids think I'm a sellout because I'm playing chess.  Like this is a, you know, like a white man's game.  And I had learned chess from other black kids in the city of St. Louis, so it was like--so, there was just no question that there was this type of, you know, dysfunctional behavior going on at the suburban school.  But at the same time, I was at schools in the city of St. Louis where I didn't see that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know.  So, it's not like it's going to happen absolutely everywhere, okay.  But it does go on.  And then even, you know, even today, you know, where, you know, you're at a so-called allegedly higher intellectual level, you know, you'll have people who call themselves black intellectuals and try to claim that what scientists do has nothing to do with black intellectual thought, you know.  And I just tell them, like, yeah, right.  You know, math is the language of all science technology and commerce.  You know, that clearly has nothing to do with black people, you know.  And, but I think it's just that--I think what happened is, I look back on some of those kids, they had just felt overwhelmed by the suburban school; there was a large Jewish community.  It was called University City, meaning they were right next to Washington University, so a lot of professors' kids going to the school.  So they felt like intellectual thought was something they just had to concede to these other groups.  And so--which is okay until you get a black kid who wants to do the same stuff; and so this sort of messes up the program.
Speaker 1: And so, you think it's the shock, the cultural shock of being put in that environment.  So you think it's a lot of students dislike the environment, and so they--I mean they feel threatened by it, and so they just this "white stuff," and this is--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Yeah.  Now, I can, you know--now, I can see it as a defense mechanism.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, when you're a kid--you know, when you're a kid and they're--you know, you're outnumbered by them, you know, it's hard to be--it's hard to have this larger view.  But I think that was basically it.  They really didn't know what hit them.  I'd come from this, you know, gifted program from the city, and I could, you know--there were black students I was going to school with in that program who, you know, they became councilman, politicians in St. Louis; one's become an editor of 'Business Week' magazine.  You know, a lot of them went on to do lots of things.  One became--I think--my--the high school in the city, I think one person became an opera singer.  But I think, well, in fact, someone had told me that one advantage of, you know, since I went to majority schools for college, one advantage of going to an all black school is that you can have a bunch of black kids at a black school can decide to play 'Dungeons and Dragons', and no one's going to tell them only white people do that, yeah. You know, they can just play it and have not to, you know to worry about that.  But I think sometimes in a mixed environment, a lot of black kids become very self conscious over what's, you know, what's real, what's not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25986
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a Presbyterian Church, Cote Brillante Presbyterian Church.
Speaker 1: Cote Brillante.
Speaker 2: What I'd say, C-O-T-E.
Speaker 1: C-O-T; Cote Brillante.
Speaker 2: B-R-I-L-L-A-N-T-E.
Speaker 1: Presbyterian Church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I heard of that before actually, but I--you know, I've always been--.  Do you have any idea what was meant by Cote Brillante?  Does that have something to do with Joseph or something or what?
Speaker 2: Origin of the name, I'm not really sure.  I do know that--well, the minister I knew, who is--well, actually, he had founded--he had already started a church around the time I was born, so I'm about the age of the church.  And he just recently passed away two or three years ago.  His name was William--Reverend William Gillespie.  And he had just become a very--he was just a highly respected figure in St. Louis [Missouri].  In fact, he was so respected that, you know, because I've heard other people make jokes about ministers, or what they may be hypocrites and what they do behind the scenes; but he always, you know, he always seemed to be the real thing, you know.  Like, I remember my mother's [Juliette McCauley] friends at church, you know, they, long ago they gave up gossiping about him.  You know, the only way they could have any fun was to gossip about his kids, because there was nothing--they never found anything about him that was not--it was always about board (unclear), you know, it was about his person, because I remember seeing a cable show where they were interviewing him and talking about the years of church, and your first thought when you look at him is that, you know, my God, can someone buy this poor man a better suit; you know, like, you know, someone who didn't know he absolutely not showy, not flashy.  You know, he was just somebody who really had substance.  And, in fact, some people say he might not have had the most exciting sermons in the world, but it was just his integrity that people found attractive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he did--did he do community acts--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  He would always make, I guess, what doctors would say, "Oh, he always make house calls."  You know, he was always visiting people in the hospitals, you know, trying to, you know, do things in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, when I grew up it was a community church, you know, because most of the members all lived--they really were like walking distance from the church.  But as everybody--well, a common dynamic, I guess, of black communities is--black middleclass communities became more prosperous, successful and people started moving out to the suburbs.
Story_ID: 25987
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, go on and tell us some more about--
Speaker 2: Well, I think what was Harris Teacher's College, which I think is now called Harris Stowe College, which is right next door to St. (Louis) [unclear] University; so I think there is a building there named after Reverend Gillespie.
Speaker 1: So he was your pastor growing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have any special role in the church as a youth?  Did they have, like, youth committees and things?
Speaker 2: Well, for me, the most involvement was in, like, Cub Scouts.  And I remember Mrs. Erma Sweet, who was my Dean Mother.  And, in fact, her son was also, you know, the same age as ours, so, me and my brother, Wendell Sweet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go to Boy Scouts?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I went through, like, a year; but that didn't last too long.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you into sports at all while growing up?
Speaker 2: We were--well--in grade school just informally; like, we did--my father [Richard Massey] put together, like, a little softball league, you know, team.  You know, so we would play a little softball.  Otherwise, you know, we would just do things, like, you know, backyard--you know, backyard football or play with frisbees.  Now, high school I got into--well, out in University City [High School]--got into gymnastics.  I didn't do tumbling or anything.  It was more of side horse.  And, I guess that was the main sport I did in high school.
Story_ID: 25988
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any favorite teachers in school at any level; any teachers that made a big difference in how you approached your work in school?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Well, I think in--well, definitely in high school I had teachers who--well, I got a good grounding in, what, trigonometry.  So I took that in the tenth grade.  There was a teacher, Jerry McSpadden, who had an interesting approach to teaching, because he would give us these, I guess they would be weekly quizzes; and so, weekly quizzes, weekly homework, you know, problem sets.  And so, the idea was, if you could score over 90 percent on the quiz, then you didn't have to do the homework.  And then once your score on the quiz dropped below 90 percent, then you had to do, you know, the homework.  Also, I remembered he wanted us to do an in-class exam--well, something everyone would have really disliked--trigonometric identities.  And he wanted us to do this, you know, closed notes; you know, I mean no notes, no book.  And my first reaction was, this is insane.  But then I thought about it some more, and then I realized one of the big tricks with math is that you don't memorize the formula.  You memorize how to derive the formula, and that's a lot easier.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Do you think most people approach it that way?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact, in high school I found the big advantage I had for doing well in math courses is that I actually bothered remembering what was taught the previous semester.  You know, most people, after the course is over, they just want to forget it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your parents [Juliette McCauley and Richard Massey], were they able to help you with math?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  They always said, like, after high school geometry, they just said I was on my own.  And, but I think a big advantage I got from my parents--what I found later that some black kids aren't as quite as lucky.  The way I put it is that, you know, my parents never really knew what the hell I was doing.  But they respected whatever the hell it was I was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I found a lot of black kids don't even get that.
Speaker 1: That is something.  So they gave you the attention, and they provided, like, a framework for you to do your work, to do your best?
Speaker 2: Right.  And, you know, they, you know, being in the school system, they just kept it out an eye for, you know, what place has a better school; you know, schools and stuff like that because--you know; because at the time going to University City High School, it was a great bargain, because I really got, like, a prep school training at a public school, you know, because of the large Jewish community, large number of professors' sons and daughters.  There were a lot of people who were going to make sure this school had, you know, good programs.  So, for example, there was a physics teacher I had at high school named John Wieggers (ph. splg.), and I was able to place out of freshman physics at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], you know, from a course he taught me in my last year in high school.  You know, he did this course on physics for calculus.
Speaker 1: So was calculus formally taught as a subject in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I talked to friends in high school where, as I said before, because it's sort of funny; when a high school kid is interested in math, you know, as you go through trigonometry, calculus is out there looming as this big, you know, big subject.  But then when you finally learn it, it's kind of like, "Is that it?"  Of course, I found out why later when I went to college at Princeton because I was only learning, you know, to manipulate formulas; so, what they called "cookbook calculus."  And so I wasn't proving anything.  And then when you're trying to prove things, that's a whole 'nother order.
Speaker 1: "Clipbook calculus."
Speaker 2: Well, you know, so it's a "cookbook" because you're just following recipes, you know; do this, do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you're not really getting into "why are you doing this," or "what do we know will give us the result we want" or "how do these things--."  "You'll see an interesting property, does it always hold?"
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't really learn how to apply it at the clipbook level; you've learned to formulate--
Speaker 2: Well, it's on two levels; that you don't--you may not learn how to apply it.  Well, you may not learn the underlying theory, and you may not learn how to apply either.  So I was lucky I took a physics course that used calculus, so I got to see how calculus was actually used.  And that's a problem with mathematics; well, what's really--there's a difference in what's called math and what math really is.  And math really is, is really spread across a lot of different disciplines.  You know, I think what's called math I would say is more what one calls pure math.  But there is, you know, like our department, Operations Research and Financial Engineering, that's really, you know, everybody here is really a mathematician.  You know, mathematics, you know, was the beginning, the underpinnings of computer science.  So, computer science, operations research, you know finance, statistics; you know, all of these are different aspects of mathematics.  You know, they just emphasis a different part of it.
Story_ID: 25989
Speaker 1: So in high school now, were you--did you attend any special summer programs in mathematics or science?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I always had an intrinsic interest in it, because I would just--I'd spend the summer just learning about stuff on my own.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, I know that there are so many summer programs I hear about these days when they used scientists around the country--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you know, to get different kinds of upward bound programs and other things.  But you weren't in any of that in the summers?
Speaker 2: In fact, I was joking with a friend of mine that, you know, being at Bell Labs, we provided all these summer enrichment programs, and I was joking with a friend of mine, it's like, well, when I, you know, spent summers even in college, you know, like, I was doing things like, you know, working for a airline catering service, you know, putting the silverware in the little plastic bags--
Speaker 1: That's a non-developmental-type job (laughs).
Speaker 2: Right.  And I found it was very beneficial in the following sense, that I was spending a summer doing this and just hating it, and thinking to myself, "Okay.  I can put up with this for a few weeks."  But I'm saying to myself, "Oh, my God.  There are people who spend their whole life doing stuff like this.  I don't want to do this."  You know, I mean, so when I went back to school, I said, "Boy, I can't wait to get back to school and get back into those courses."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was a great motivator for me to take school seriously.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, when it was time to graduate from high school, did you graduate with special honors or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, in my junior year I had gotten what was called the "Harvard Book Award," you know, where faculty there had voted for, I guess, a student who would be given an award by a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] representative.
Speaker 1: So what is the 'Harvard Book Award' for?
Speaker 2: I guess, in terms of, you know, in terms of doing well academically; maybe showing promise, you know, to being a scholar in the future.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that had nothing to do with the number of books you read (laughs) or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Not like that.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  So, when they say "book awards," they presented me with a book from Harvard.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And I guess from their end it was a way of recruiting, you know, recruiting students there to come to Harvard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And also, I was on the chess team, and then I'd gotten--I picked up a trophy for, I think it may have been second-place runner-up citywide on the--it was called the "Second Board," because you have a five-man team and I was, like, the number two person that year.  And then the various math competitions.  I'd gone to one that, I guess at the University of Illinois at Edwardsville they had, like, a math competition.  And I went to win also at the University of Missouri at Rolla.  So I won some awards for that. And then what's called the 'National Achievement Scholar', which was sort of the minority version of National Merit Scholars.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is it called the 'National Minority Achievement Award' or was it 'National Achievement'?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I think it's called 'National Achievement'.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So that's--all right.
Story_ID: 25990
Speaker 1: So, now, you end up going to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], but--so what was your counseling like?  Were you being steered towards Princeton or did you do it on your own?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I wouldn't call it steering.  It was more, you know, I think the conversation I had with my mom [Juliette McCauley].  She said, "You like math, right?"  I said, "Yep."  "Well, you know, Princeton's number one in math.  You want to go there?"  I said, "Sure."  I mean (laughs) that was about it.
Speaker 1: That's all it was to it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And did you--at the time, did you have any idea of--did you know of any black people that went to ivy league schools?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were you aware that it was an ivy league school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And I kind of felt this was my chance to see the, you know, the East Coast, growing up in St. Louis [Missouri].  Actually, though, when I got here I remember I was a little disappointed because, I figured, you know, you grow up thinking that "Okay.  I out here in St. Louis, but out there, the East Coast, now, that's the cultural mecca."  And I remember first coming to New York City, I could turn on the radio and I would have all this, you know, great music just kind of pouring out of every channel.  And I turn on the radio and all the channels sound just like the ones here in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 25991
Speaker 1: Was Princeton, New Jersey very similar to St. Louis [Missouri], I mean, in a lot of ways or too many ways?
Speaker 2: Well, in a strange way.  Since my high school, you know, University City was--well, looking back on it, was extraordinarily integrated for that time.  It's almost the closest I've seen, I guess, is like that this movie Denzel Washington was in, 'Remember the Titans'.  Not quite that level of tension though.  Well, it could have been.  I didn't, you know, as a student I might not have been aware of it.  But, it was a very integrated school.  So there was a level diversity probably so much so that when I went to Princeton I really felt I was taking a step backwards in terms of cultural diversity and enlightenment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was more segregated as such here--at Princeton than it was in your high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I don't know if segregation is the word, but it was just--everybody wanted to stay in their own little camps.  And it was hard to straddle different--.  I mean, being there at the time I used to describe it that every door you opened, you close the door behind you.  Yeah, that's what moving around Princeton seemed to be like.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, Princeton; this is where [Albert] Einstein, you know, taught.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As its tradition--I mean, were you aware of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you knew exactly where you were going.  And, well, you hadn't been here before, right, before you started school?
Speaker 2: No.  Right.  It was the first time I ever saw New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Juliette McCauley and Richard Massey] come out here with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because for a lot of parents the summer after junior in high school, that's the summer of the college trip.  So we drove out here, walked around campus, and I sort of liked it.  It seemed more low-key than--I remember going by Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and, you know, I didn't like that as much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Were there any other--were there any black professors here when you got here in the math department?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  No.  I mean, in fact, you know, I was there in 1970--well, I started there in fall of 1973, you know.  Princeton wasn't going to get their--well; Princeton got their first math professor in the 1990s.  You know, roughly twenty years later.  Actually, it was like, one of those assistant professors was Arlie Petters [also a HistorMakers], who was someone I mentored in the Bell Labs Fellowship Program.  And they weren't going to get their first black professor in engineering till about 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, was there a black student organization on campus in general?
Speaker 2: Well, there was but I never quite knew what to do with them, because I think that everybody there was into--well, you know, it was like the Black Student Union, Black Power, and this organizing.  But everybody wasn't majoring in, like, sociology or political science, or you know, one of those fields where you do something real to help your people; you know, that was sort of the ideas of the time.
Speaker 1: Was that the rhetoric then, the way people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then didn't consider, like, science and mathematics as relevant to helping the black community?
Speaker 2: That might have been part of it.  I don't know.  But, it just wasn't something--if they thought about it at all, maybe it was just something that was too hard to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it wasn't--because, well, one thing I find that gets played nowadays because, was certain debates with--a certain impression of our country.  It gives me flashbacks to things I really didn't like about the '70s [1970s] in terms of black culture.  I call it the "age of," I call, "afro-fascism," okay; that if you do not fit into my narrow, limited conception of what black people are about, then you are not really black."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was that the rhetoric of the students in those days, I mean, that were here in liberal arts?
Speaker 2: In general.  I mean, that's the dominant--okay.  Let's put it this way; no one was going to worry about being ridiculed thinking this way.  Let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you take any courses in the black studies department?  I know they had one by then, right?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact, by bias, of course, one of the appeals to me of math and science is that I could take as few humanities courses as possible.  Now much later when I got into becoming a researcher, then I start to realize it, you know, it actually is important to know how to communicate your ideas and write your journal papers.  So I've been reacquainted with, you know, the narrative structure and things like that.  But, just in general I wasn't looking for courses like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because I know you had to take some liberal arts.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I'm probably the only person that ever got out of the philosophy requirement by taking a course in mathematical logic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was mandatory, American history, English; that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, what was--oh.  I think the social sciences, I took economics courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Arts and humanities, well, I took, like, a writing course.  I think I took one on film.  And then there were language requirements in French, where, again, you know, I had taken the French classes, they were just things I was just trying to get, you know, get over, and hopefully, I was never to see again.  But a couple of years later, I find I'm doing a senior thesis, and I'm--the book I'm basing it on is all written in French; or, you know, or a decade later, I would collaborate with a fellow, Francois Bertrelli (ph.) who was based in Paris; and I would do like a little mini sabbatical from Bell Labs, spend like six weeks in Paris.  You know, so, you know, I was thinking, I said, "Boy, if I'd only known, you know, stuff like, you know, opportunities like this would be coming, you know, I would have taken French a little more seriously, you know, when I was younger."  But, of course, I think a part of the problem though when I was learning French first in grade school, learning French in St. Louis, Missouri, so what French speakers I'm going to run into to practice my French on.  So, it just seemed, like, just an abstract exercise.
Speaker 2: You just didn't (unclear) city founded by the French (laughs)?
Speaker 1: That's right.  Well, a city founded by the French, but it's full of mispronounced French names (laughs), like, there's a suburb called--well, the French would call it probably Crev Cur (ph.), but we call it Creve Coeur (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I've got stories about Detroit [Michigan] for you about that (laughs).
Speaker 1: Right (laughs).
Speaker 2: Different names about even the name Detroit.  Okay.  All right.  Well, who were some of the--now, what was it like, now, were you the only black person, student in the math department, undergrad [undergraduate] when you started here?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, when I was a freshman, I met a black fellow who was a senior math major.  But that was probably the last black person I ever saw.
Speaker 2: There were no black instructors or professors?
Speaker 1: No.  No grad students.  Later, I didn't meet him at the time, but I saw, like, a photo of--because I was taking my physics courses--you may have even interviewed, Sekazi Mtingwa [also a HistoryMaker].  But he was--he got his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton.  You know, because I finished my undergraduate degree in '77 [1977].  He got his Ph.D. in '76 [1976].  So I saw photos, so I certainly made a mental--I didn't really run into him, but I made a mental note that he was there.  And I would meet him maybe about ten years later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, in fact, he has--he says he has a distinction he really doesn't want, which is that he's the last black person to ever get a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University, and this was 1976, okay.  Now, there's lots of black people getting Ph.D.s at other schools; notably, Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], in more recent times.  But, yeah, it was not clear why that's going on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, did you ever--did you encounter, like, an attitude from people in the math department--I mean, did you ever encounter an attitude of, like, why were you were there?
Speaker 1: Well, I remember when I was signing up for courses, that it was interesting that I didn't get that from the faculty I ran into.  But I remember, like, a college student who was, you know, taking care of the cards, and, you know, processing those for freshmen; yeah, he seemed to be more worried about this than the faculty I was talking to.  But what helped me was just having--okay; so when I took this course with my high school teacher, John Wieggers, we took an exam at the end of the course, and so we got official credit from St. Louis University, you know, for doing it.  So that helped me to place out of freshmen physics.  Because originally I thought, "Well, I want to be a math major, not a physics major, so maybe I'll just place out of freshman math and start sophomore."  And I think that was just more ego, because I figured, well, I want to be a math major; and then, in physics, I'd say, "Well, I'll just take maybe freshman physics and maybe that'll be an easy course."  But I got good advice from a young professor I met.  His name is Steven Wilson, who was a math professor who was advising students.  And he told me to switch it around.  "Don't run out to the advanced math course, take--there was like an honors freshman math course, take that and place out of physics and take sophomore-level physics."  And all that turned out to be great advice.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This was Steven Wilson?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25992
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we're talking about Steve Wilson [at Princeton University, where Massey got his B.S. degree in mathematics] giving you good advice.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any other good advisors in the department for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  Well, I had good class.  Like, I remember being exposed to a first course taught by Bernard Fox, who had tragically, he passed away, I guess, right after the semester was over.  And I remember taking his class.  We'd go away for the holidays, we come back to find he passed away.  And then I--and then, one thing I remember about him and to say something about mathematics, because I remember meeting someone about ten years later, you know.  It was like one that gives this sort of argument.  This is when "Afrocentricism" became a big word and people wanted to lecture about how you could get more black kids to understand stuff by making Afrocentric, you know, all these cultural, I mean--.  And I tried to tell this person this is really silly argument, you know, because if it's the barrier that's cultural, then why are Asian students doing so well in American schools.  And he tried to argue that, you know, the logical thinking that's more Eurocentric or something like that.  And I told him, "Look, I was in a course, you know, a calculus course at Princeton, and I remember the day the professor just stopped the class cold to talk about, you know, logic, you know, and how, negating logical statements.  Now, he didn't stop the class because he thought I didn't understand it.  He stopped the class because he thought nobody understood it.  So, this was not something that was intrinsic to anybody's culture.  This is something that just had to be taught.  And so I think a lot of times you hear a lot of these ideas that just kind of get created.  What Rachel Maddow [political commentator] likes to call "fact-free opinion."  It's not really based on anything, it just satisfies his emotional need, that this sounds more authentically black or it's more culturally satisfying.  But I find a lot of our--I mean, I think when it comes to black issues, I wouldn't say--I mean, we definitely do have issues, we do have problems; but I think the number one problem is simply we have no forum to talk about what our problems are.  You know, there's not really an honest discussion of any of these issues, you know, even among ourselves.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like that's something we can solve, right?  Don't you think?
Speaker 2: You would think so.  You know, because I told somebody about how, you know, when being that, it's no fun being a black intellectual if you're into mathematics because I would say things like look at the homicide rate; you know, black homicide rate.  When twenty black men are killed, nineteen of them are killed by other black men, okay.  So, we can obsess all we want to about the one other person that's killing a black person, but if we address the issue of us killing each other, we reduce our homicide rate by a factor of twenty.  Not twenty percent, a factor of twenty.  And where's the discussion, where's the candlelight vigils, where's the, you know.  And, but everybody avoids this like they almost think it's a harder problem.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.  I think it's the way you stated it, it sounds like it would be simple, but it's not because of the--you have (laughs), well, you've got a different--it's different because the one you're talking about, however a person died, well, usually the protests are about people, when people actually are--for instance, when the police shot Amadou Diallo 40-something times.  That was a case of authority--.
Speaker 2: Authority gone wrong.
Speaker 1: Yeah, authority gone wrong.  So it was like a public, you know--(simultaneous)(unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I'm saying, so what I'm saying though is that there's no problem having those protests.  I'm just saying that when you look at the numbers when we kill each other, we should be twenty-times or really nineteen-times as outraged.
Speaker 1: Well, people are outraged, and they have these street vigils all the time.  In every city and in the city I'm from they know how, because there's one every month.  Reverends are on the corner; politicians, they come and they talk about the fact, basically violence; young black men killing other young black men over money from narcotic sales and other things that gang affiliation does.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it's a, you know, and it's actually covered by the news a lot of times.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it's a different kind of--you know, so you need--in order to stop that, don't you need a different kind of a program than you do to--I think, so it's different.
Speaker 2: Oh, I absolutely agree. I'm just saying that--I'm not saying I have a solution.  I'm just saying that the first step to solving a problem is to recognize that there is a problem.  And sometimes--in the past these issues have been swept under the rug, and I think having those vigils, having those protests is certainly a good step towards finding what the, you know, what the solution is, because I'm not saying that I know the answer to everything.  I'm just saying that I know that when you're wrestling with a hard problem, the first step in solving it is trying to understand what is the problem.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I think a fundamental thing you raise in that question is, can the black community control its--I guess the education of youth, the cultural orientation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --their orientation toward life and death--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with each other; and all those factors, you know.  And so far the answer is no.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I think--well, to be controversial, I read--sometimes I jump on Prince George's County [Maryland], and only because I read a statistic that this has the highest per capita income of, you know, black people of any city in the country.  But no one brags about the educational system and the black kids in Prince George's County.  And I just give them a hard time because if they have the highest per capita income, you know, of black people in the country, let's face it; if they can't get their act together, who can.
Speaker 1: You know, priorities are not--are still not where they ought to be.
Speaker 2: Well, and the now--and we also have to understand why, why is that.  I mean, I'm not really sure, you know, because when you look at the information it just looks very strange, but it still goes on.  So why is it that everybody just sort of--well, what I call the pretending the 2,000 pound pink elephant is not tap dancing on the table.  We'll just pretend it's not there.  Why does that go on?
Story_ID: 25993
Speaker 1: Do you think, as a mathematician, that statistics that you hear in the media and from, you know, activists and politicians, and, you know, and the clergymen and stuff are used properly?
Speaker 2: I think a lot of them are used improperly.  Now, I don't--okay.  It's not data I have on my fingertips, but, you know, informally, you'll hear people say there are more black men in prison than are in college, okay.  Now, before we actually get into the numbers and the reality situation, this statement alone is misleading.  But why?  Black men going to college is primarily an activity for black men between the ages of 18 and 25.  Black men being in prison is an activity of black men from ages of 18 to 60 years or older.  So, the fact that any bunch--group of black men between the ages of 18 and 60 years doing anything in more numbers than 18 to 25 is, that doesn't really tell you a whole lot.  And that's even before we get--and, the original number I told you, that might not even be true.  We don't--we're not really sure.  But you're making--you're comparing apples and oranges on top of that.  But also, so much of these numbers and if you just control for being between the ages of 18 and 25; number of black men in college outnumber the black men in prison, like, 8 to 1.  So, it would be nice to have that information at hand so we can really say, what's really going on, but you got to compare the right things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's dramatically different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: From what, you know.
Speaker 2: Or one game I heard you can play with statistics, too; you can say that, "Oh, on the whole, white, percentage of whites; more white people vote than black people.  However, if you control for income level, okay; black people in a given income level vote in the higher percentage of white people of the same income level.  So what we're not really observing the difference in white and black people; we're really observing a difference between, you know, rich people and poor people; you know, poor people tend to vote less often than rich people.  And so since black people are disproportionally poor, okay; but that's what you're seeing, but that's all you're seeing; you know, because at the same time, black people of a given income level are voting in higher numbers than white people of the same income level.  Yes, so, it's very easy to give out confusing information with statistics if things are just not organized properly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've often thought that, you know, some of these stats are not what they, you know--when you hear them, you say, "Is that really what they really thing," or is it really being spun the way it should be spun; is that really what the standards illustrate?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, just recently, like [President Barack] Obama's election.  You'll hear a statement that says, "Women elected Barack Obama," you know.  And the majority of women did vote for Barack Obama; that's a true statement.  It's subtly misleading because it makes people think that white women voted for Barack Obama.  Well, it turns out that's not true.  The majority of white women voted for [Mitt] Romney [Republican presidential candidate in 2012].  It's--but the reason women in general voted for Obama, well, it starts with the 96 percent vote, support from black women, you know.  So they turned out in very large numbers to vote for him.  And so it's really minority women that pushed it over.  So Barack Obama is someone who won the American vote, but lost the white American vote.  You know, he won the women's vote, but he lost the white women's vote.  He won the Catholic vote, he lost the white Catholic vote.  In fact, I think the only white group he won outright was under the age of forty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25994
Speaker 1: When--so when you're at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], what were you learning in math that was exciting for you?
Speaker 2: Exciting.  Well, I think it was algebra; and here in college level, algebra would mean things like groups, group theory--well, big three groups, rings and modules.  And then I took my first theory course or abstract algebra course, was taught by a visiting professor from Germany.  I think his name is Klaus Dietrich (ph.).  And what I found was, the way Germans are--the German training, you know, mathematics, is more--I'm not sure whether it's scholarly in sense of historical.  They can give you lots of--the kind of historical background about why are you looking at this type of mathematics.  And because we're here in course and group theory, and he starts talking about high school geometry and congruent triangles.  And at first you say, "Well, wait a minute.  What does have to do with groups?"  And then he says, "Well, how do you make triangles congruent?  You move one triangle over here, you sit it on top of the other one, they look the same.  Okay.  And it's that transformation, they're called ridge motions, that gives you this equivalence.  Well, it turns out those transformations have the properties of a group.  And so that's you study it.  And this is not in the book.  So this is something that you just got from the lecture.  And then--that was sophomore year.  In junior year, I was going to do, like, at Princeton, you start taking a junior seminar where that means five students get together, and then we're responsible for covering the material in the book.  You know, the teacher just sits back, lets us lecture on all the material, and we systematically work on all the problems.  You know, we divide up all the problems in the book among the five of us.  So, each of us, during the week we work on solving our two problems; but then we get together for a meeting, we walk away by taking notes with the solution to, like, ten problems.  So we were able to systematically cover the book through the whole year.  And this was--so here's the return of Steve Wilson, who was the guy who gave me the good advice in freshman year; and he was supervising the seminar.  And also I took a course in abstract algebra, Galois Theory; which was, you know, very beautiful mathematics.  And there's also a little history to it as well, because, you know, Galois was a young mathematician who developed this theory.  Then at about the age twenty-one, he got into a political argument with someone.  You know, he had a duel with him, and then he was, you know, he was killed.
Speaker 1: Now, about what period of time did he live?
Speaker 2: Oh, this must have been, I'm guessing in the 18th century.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Galois was--was he--
Speaker 2: French.
Speaker 1: French.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh.  So I had this joke about how--well, for black kids now, I call Galois the, I guess, the Tupac Shakur [rapper and actor] of algebraists.
Speaker 1: Hope he didn't have to be shot forty times.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25995
Speaker 1: But, and so I sort of specialized in--in fact, I ended up doing a senior thesis in abstract algebra with--well, Bernard Dwork, who, after I took the classes with Ralph Fox, and I took this honors, the algebra course with Bernard Dwork, freshman year [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]; and I did my senior thesis with him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the thesis is called 'Galois Connections on Local Fields'?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Can you explain that for us?
Speaker 1: Oh, I could.  It's like studying--a couple of things going on.  You have the integers.  And integers are called the ring, meaning that--well, let's back up.  A group.  You can think of a group as something where you can do addition and subtraction, but that's it; you know, no multiplication or division.  Now, a ring is like the integers where you can add them, you can subtract them, and you can multiply them; but you can't always divide.  You know, if you divide one by two, you don't get another integer.  But now the ideal object is what's called the field, where you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  And so, like, all fractions would be a field, because there's (unclear) in all those operations.  And then you get into what are called, say like number fields, because what the rational numbers are lacking; for example, thanks to Pythagoras [Greek mathematician; Pythagoras theorem], you know, you have two isosceles right triangles, and the two sides are (unclear) unit length.  The length of the hypotenuse has to be square to the two.  But now, this caused the Greeks a lot of problems because they thought everything, you know, ideal in nature was a fraction; you know, golden ratios, and things like that.  But it turns out square of two is not a fraction, and you can prove it's not one.  And so now what do you do?  And so what you have to do is, you know, add on--add things, square roots like that to irrational numbers.  So you create a new field, but you call--a bigger field with, like, an extension.  And, but now you get into issues about whether a case is squared to two.  You know, there's the positive numbers, like, squared to two; but there's the number, which is also squared to--you know, if you square that, that'll also be two.  Now, what's the connection between these two?  You know, if you just map a square root to its negative, that preserves all the properties of your field.  Well, these transformations are like your, you know, like your groups.  And so what Galois did is that he wanted to look at problems, like, finding roots of quadratic equations, which is a problem with finding these fields.  But he wanted to turn all this into something simpler, the problem with groups.  And so that's the whole story of Galois Theory, where he could turn field theory problems into group theory problems.  And so, but then you just go through the elaborate, you know, analysis of building these integers up into rational numbers, fractions of, you know, a field of fractions.  Then you look at the Galois, a field extension of that, you look at the Galois groups acting on that field; you look at prime numbers in the ring of your integers; you look at--there's a ring of algebraic integers for your field extension.  You equate numbers (unclear) the prime, you get these smaller fields and then this bigger group acting on the bigger fields induces some acts, you know, the smaller fields.  And so you get a lot of interesting structures, and at the end of the day it's supposed to tell you something more about numbers that you might not have known before.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So that was your senior thesis?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25996
Speaker 1: And you graduated [from Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] in 1977, magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Now had you been involved in the Bell Cooperative Research Fellowship Program?
Speaker 2: Not just yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I got the award in my senior year at Princeton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So right after I left Princeton.
Speaker 1: That summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the summer of '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You got involved in that.  And so, your parents [Juliette McCauley and Richard Massey] come for graduation and everything?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father grabbed every program he could, laminated them (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So summer at Bell Labs [New Jersey].  Is this your first experience at Bell Labs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about Bell Labs.
Speaker 2: Oh.  It was--up to that point, I wasn't really sure what I was going to do career wise, because in the mid-'70s [1970s] they were telling us, you know, because of the baby boom and Sputnik, in the '60s [1960s] schools had hired lots of faculty.  And so by the '70s [1970s], they're saying, "Well, all that faculty we hired, they're still there.  Also, after the baby boom you had a baby bust, so the number--we know the number of college students is going to drop, so there might not be any academic jobs for you."  And I wasn't sure what I was going to do at that point.  I mean, I knew I liked what's called pure math, and which, at the time, I thought you could only do in an academic setting.  But I figured, "Okay.  I'll just--I know I'm going to grad [graduate] school, so I'll just stick with pure math as an undergrad and maybe switch over to applied math later," you know.  How that was going to happen, where, I had no idea.  But then I found out about this Bell Labs Fellowship Program, and then I found out there was something called industrial research.  And then I figured, "Well, if an industrial research group doesn't know what applied math is, who does?"  And so, what I found was a great, well, a context; a different way of looking at mathematics.  Because if you look at the history of the math department at Princeton University, well, what were they doing in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s]?  They were developing fields, like, say, topology; algebraic topology, and I think they made their name off of that, that discipline.  You now, they made sure they were, like, the forefront of that field.  And, you know, all of this work would be considered major advances in the field of pure mathematics.  Well, what was going on at Bell Laboratories?  Well, their math group wasn't--you know they were inventing fields like information theory, coding theory, okay.  You know, you wouldn't necessarily call this mainstream, [quote] "mathematics."  But this was certainly fundamentally important mathematics for--to facilitate communications, you know, advancing communication theory.  And so, it was just interesting to see how math could be used in a different context, where, you know, here's a definite goal you want to have.  You know, let's have better communications.  And this is how I came to hear about queueing theory, because it was another field that was invented by the telephone system, you know, for to facilitate the efficient design of the telephone network.  You know, how many telephone trunk lines do you need?  And the question is, what's enough.  And so, if you have too many lines--well, if you have too few lines--excuse me, that every time you pick up the--a customer picks up a phone they get a busy signal.  You know, you might see this where it's an earthquake in Los Angeles [California], you want to call up your friend to see how they're doing in Los Angeles; unfortunately, everyone else is thinking the same thing, and the lines get overwhelmed, and you've have "I'm sorry, all circuits are busy."  Now, if you experience that every time you picked up your phone, you wouldn't be happy with the service.  So, when you're designing a system, you want to design it in a way that you know what's the minimum amount of lines that you need to avoid that problem.  And now, of course, how do you quantify this problem?  What's it mean, do you just absolutely want this never to happen?  Not necessarily.  But if it happens too often, people will be upset.  So what's the threshold, you know.  Maybe it's like 0.1 percent of the time.  If it doesn't happen more than that, people will be happy.  So what you're talking about is a probability.  You know, what's the probability of this event occurring.  And once you understand that probability is a function of the capacity of the system, what's the smallest capacity needed to push that probability below that threshold?  So it's sort of a mixture of probabilistic modeling and then optimization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this math turns out to be the cornerstone of operations research.
Story_ID: 25997
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you spent the summer at Bell Labs in the Cooperative Research Fellowship Program [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is that--that's sponsored by ABLE, the organization over there?
Speaker 2: (Coughing.)  Well, I think it was--it may have been watched by ABLE.  I mean, you know, many programs--well, I think Jim Mitchell [James Mitchell, also a HistoryMaker] and Jim West [James West] can give you a better sense of it than I can.  But the impression I got was in the '60s [1960s], you know, there was a, you know, a critical mass of black scientists was starting to develop.  You know, up till then it was, like, Linc Hawkins, was just there by himself, the '60s [1960s].  So you couple that with--at the time, the phone company was a monopoly, and then when you're a monopoly, you're little more sensitive to, you know, public perceptions.  And, I guess a third thing was, starting in '68 [1968], you know, you had riots in Newark, New Jersey, and Plainfield, New Jersey, which is, like, you know, two or three miles away.  So I think there was a lot of increased sensitivity to these sort of outreach issues.  And then they said, "Well, we want to see more--you know, there are more black scientists out there, and, you know, we want you to create programs, you know, to bring more of them in."  So the fellowship I was in started--it started in 1972.  I think I was--I think I'd got awarded, what, in 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, some of the Bell Lab employees are--so--
Speaker 2: As members of ABLE; so, like--
Speaker 1: Linc Hawkins [chemist] and James West [physicist], and--
Speaker 2: Jim Mitchell, Earl Shaw [physicist].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So other people involved.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25998
Speaker 1: So, you went on to graduate school, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  So, the Bell Lab Scholarship paid for my Ph.D. training at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, what was that like?  So, you went straight through it, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To the Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was your project at Stanford in?
Speaker 2: Oh, so the title of my Ph.D. thesis was 'Non-Stationary Queues'.  And that's, Q-U-E-U-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a queue--well, it's sort of a British-English word for waiting line.  So I'd say if an American had through this up, it would have been called waiting line theory, you know, rather than queueing theory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And how that arose--well, you know, the first queueing theory problem, it was published 1917, and what it involved was, you know, if you take these seven digits--okay.  Well, let's ignore area codes.  So, take American telephone numbering system and you look at the last seven digits.  Well, the first three is a label for what's called the central office.  And the last four digits is really the label of your phone, and in the good old days of land line telephony, you know that little wire from your phone that kind of went through the neighborhood, maybe a mile away there was, like, a central office would, you know, connect to it.  Now, I think, of course, in reality, you know, this is a gross simplification of what goes on, but that's a rough idea of what's happening.  And what connects your phone to the central office is called the local loop.  And sometimes you see this where if you take--if you're at a business and there's just many offices with telephones in one building, to call someone else you may not dial, you know, certainly not ten, maybe not even seven; it might just be four, and if you're just doing four, that means you're just bouncing off of the same central office.  It's just when you try to call out, you know, from there to someplace else that you transfer from one central office to another one.  Now those central offices are connected by what are called trunk lines.  And here is the big issue, that--see, if you're a local loop, there is no issue.  You got a phone; you need a local loop to connect it to the central office, because that's sort of a personal or private resource.  But the trunk lines are sort of shared public resources that, when I make a call I'm only using a trunk line to talk to some other person.  But once we hang up and no longer--we're no longer talking, that trunk line will be used by some other pair of people having conversation.  So it's not clear how many of them you need because no one's going to use one forever.  You know, it's sort of, you know, that we're talking about shared resources here.  And so that's why it's not clear what does it mean to have just enough trunk lines.  And--well, the way you can get a sense of it is you figure out, well, first, how often are people making telephone calls.  Second, when they make the connection, how long are they talking?  And since you can't really come up with a perfect, accurate, predictive model of human behavior.  That's why the math leans heavily on probability.  You know, the best you can do is get an aggregate behavior, do statistical analysis and figure out what's the probability.  You know, with the average--you know, what's the typical number of people who make a call, what's the average number, what's the standard deviation on it.  And so, you use a lot of probability theory to develop, you know, queueing theory.  In fact, it would be called a part of the field of applied probability.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was sort of fascinated by that in the sense that I figure I'd learned a lot of algebra at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey]. Oh, in pure math, okay, the big--the three big fields would be real analysis, complex analysis, abstract algebra.  And the word "analysis" would mean, things involving, like, limits, integrals.  So I felt like for grad school, okay, I'd, you know, I'd seen a lot of abstract algebra; why not see more the side of analysis.  And then probability is built on analysis.  So I figured, you know, probability would be an interesting field.  So I, you know, I learned about that.  So my training at Stanford was in pure mathematics.  But I then, you know, took the pure training and applied it to some problems in queueing theory.
Story_ID: 25999
Speaker 1: And so this is also while being at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], this is where I met Joseph Keller [mathematician].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That would be my thesis advisor.
Speaker 2: Now, Keller, it says here, contributed to the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller method. (Unclear) (Laughing).  I don't know.  Anyway, what's his significance then?
Speaker 1: It's hard to nail down.  I mean, he's done so many things, and he made big contributions in his field of geometric optics.  But if you deal with him, you know, day-to-day you'll find that he--he really thinks about applied math, you know, in a very good way; and that he's very good at looking at real phenomena and figuring how to describe it mathematically.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I remember he--I heard he used to give these lectures when he was at Courant Institute at NYU [New York University].  And he would just look at how curtains hang; how curtains that were hanging, he'd look at that as a problem of wave propagation.  So he's just always thinking about, you know, these sort of issues.  And then--now, of course, he works in applied mathematics, you know, in geometric optics.  Now, as I also mentioned, in the academic world, when they use the word "applied mathematics," that would--I would translate that into mathematical science.  And, because I kind of developed this philosophy of, you know, of developing a big picture of math just to get a sense of where his operations research fit with all this.  So I think of mathematics as a study of information patterns.  And you use those information patterns as a language to describe things.  So what people would call pure math, I would call mathematical mathematics; basically, using information patterns to describe information patterns.  Now, you really do that all the time where, like, in grade school you might have done arithmetic and look at properties, and, and you know, numbers in doing arithmetic.  And then you want to have a deeper understanding of these number patterns you're experiencing.  Well, you would call that--you'd call that high school algebra.  And so algebra, in some ways, is sort of the information--you know, number patterns of number patterns.  So that's how you develop theory, you know, by doing that sort of self-referencing.  But now, it's a language, so you can talk about other things.  So you could use math to talk about natural systems, you know, or literally talk about the world.  But what's the study of natural systems?  That's really science.  So this is like a--if you develop a language of information patterns for describing natural systems.  That's what people call applied math, now we just call it mathematical science.  I'll give you an example of that.  Isaac Newton was trying to understand the motions of the planets, and he found algebra and geometry just wasn't doing it for him.  So he felt he had to extend the mathematics and create new tools, so he did; it's better known as calculus.  And so you'll find that calculus differential equations is sort of the natural language of physics.  So that's when I say I would describe Joe Keller as a master of mathematical science.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know in '88 [1988] he was awarded the United States National Medical of Science, and the Wolf Prize later on.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And lots of other prizes.  So were you close to Keller?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because what he did, he gave me a great topic to study, and, in fact, I'd been studying different manifestations of it, you know, my entire career.
Speaker 2: So this is a key theory of--
Speaker 1: Well, see, this is what the interesting thing is, that he works in applied mathematics or what we call mathematical science.  Queueing here is a part of operations research, and I would call that, well, you know, say, a telephone system; that's not a natural system, it was created by men.  And you could think of engineering as a study of man-made systems.  So I would work in what I call mathematical engineering.  And so, these are the, you know, you're developing mathematical tools to help you--that facilitate the building of things.  Now, I would say, though, this is the language of engineering.  You know, I'm not saying operations research is engineering, but it works as the language of it.  But, as I say, it's not an area he works in.  But I found what's good about, you know, working with other people is that--in other fields, because he had developed mathematical techniques in his field that, you know, mathematical science had turned to be very useful for the math I was trying to develop in mathematical engineering.  An advantage of working with someone who's not in the field; if you work with someone who's in the field, they would tell you, "Well, these are what we consider the tough problems that everyone's trying to work on.  Why don't you work on this."  But if you work with someone who's not in the field, they would say, "Well, all the people that feel--seem to avoid this topic, so why don't we address this topic.  And here's some new tools for addressing that topic."  And the big topic was, when you look at the theory of queueing, you know, you're talking about customers arriving at a certain rate, and maybe they finished--they complete their calls at a given rate.  But these rates are mathematically viewed as static.  You assume things are just running like this for all times, and you just wait it just gets into some stay states; equilibrium system and you just study that, you know.  And you got a nice set of equations you could solve to stay those problems.  The only problem is that that's just not realistic, because in real life there will be more people making calls at, you know, two o'clock in the afternoon than at five o'clock in the morning.  And so in real life you have this, what are called varying rates or I like to call them dynamic rates.  But you got the static equilibrium analysis that's very useful when people do it, but you got--but reality is you have (unclear) dynamic rates.  And so what he put me on a path to tackle is, you know, these types of problems, you know, because you need a different type of--see, the mathematics that worked for the equilibrium analysis doesn't work for the dynamic rate problems, so you got to come up with new types of techniques.  And this is where you really the mathematical training to figure out what the techniques ought to be and, you know, see how they work.
Story_ID: 26000
Speaker 1: Now, how were things at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California]?  Were you comfortable there?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, because in a way I've been inoculated from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], because I'd told people, well students at Princeton, that Princeton is really like a graduate prep school; that if you make it through here, you've really seen all they can throw at you in grad school.  So I really didn't find it to be very surprising.  And I found qualifying exams pretty easy to get through.  And then on top of that, I had this Bell Labs Fellowship; I had met people over the summer; I began to develop a whole network of contacts outside of Stanford.
Speaker 1: Now, your work in Bell Labs [New Jersey] over the summer, when you were explaining queueing theory, you were describing it in terms of phone numbers; did your work over the summer at Bell Labs influence your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Right.  I worked on--the first summer I was there, I worked with Dr. John Morrison, who in our collaboration that summer--so I left Princeton; I hadn't started at Stanford yet, but it ended up becoming a journal paper that became my first publication.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is something you wrote before you even started school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, in fact, that's what I found appealing about industrial research right off the bat, which is that, I find academics to have too much of a hierarchy.  You know, there's full professors, assistant professors, lecturers, post-docs, grad students; you know, undergraduates.  You know, Bell Labs didn't seem to, you know, in terms of the world of research, it didn't seem to be so obsessed with that.  And so--you know, so I'm feeling like an equal right off, you know, just walking into Bell Labs, you know, right before I even started grad school.
Story_ID: 26001
Speaker 1: Now, you're familiar with, you know, a list of mathematicians in your generation (unclear).  Are you familiar with Idris Assani?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Johnny Brown, Nathaniel Dean?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Carl Graham?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Overtoun Jenda?
Speaker 2: Not him as much.  All the others, this conference I ran, CAARMS; Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences.  So all of the other people you mentioned have all spoken at that conference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you know them back when you were at Stanford, this group?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I didn't meet, let's see; who would have been the first person I would have met.  It wasn't really too much later in the late '80s [1980s], I started to meet (coughs) some of the other people.  Nathaniel Dean was working at Bellcore, which was the spin-off of Bell Labs that was connected with the local phone companies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so he worked there for a while before he took the academic route.
Story_ID: 26002
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 1981 when you finished Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], did you have any doubt that you were going to be working for Bell Labs [New Jersey]? (laughs)
Speaker 2: Oh, no doubt.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Because it just seemed like such a, you know, a congenial environment.  Also, I just got a chance to work on exciting problems, because I found that by focusing on this applied area looking at specific time varying queue, I as address the issues--the general theory of Markov processes didn't seem to be (touch it?).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you contributed something new to the field of mathematics--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --over in this dissertation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Just studying--there was a classic queueing model with people who are very familiar with constant rates.  And so I developed the sort of approximate or asymptotic theory when you had time-varying rates.  And then from this new insight I could show--well, basically show that you could, if you analyze things the old way, you might make a mistake a come in, you know, come with a misleading conclusion.  Because you think of--well, okay.  So you think of--well, we'll make it simple; where the service rate is constant, so that doesn't change; you just have (unclear) rate.  And you think of it, it's like water coming to a bucket at a certain rate, and it goes out--let's make it easy; it goes out at a unit rate.  It drains in unit rate, water comes in, okay.  Now, if the water rate is always less than the unit rate, then the bucket never fills up.  And that's kind of like steady-state behavior.  But if the water, incoming rate, exceeds the draining rate, then the bucket will fill up; and then over time, it'll just go all the way up to infinity.  So that's sort of the static situation.  But what happens if the input rate changes in time?  Well, what will happen is that, it may start off being less than the unit rate but later it becomes higher; but later it'll drop back down.  And so, the actual level goes up, but it's not going to go all the way up to infinity, it's going to come back down.  So the big question is:  When does it come back down to zero?  And people used to think, Well, this is what's going to happen when the input rate--the first time the input rate is less than the draining rate.  Of course, if you try that, you'll realize that's not true.  You know, it's sort of--kind of like turning on the bathtub and the water is coming in faster than the draining rate.  The minute you turn off the faucet, you know, the water level doesn't drop to zero immediately; it's going to take some time.  And so what I showed is that, to talk about stay-state behavior, you have to wait until the time it takes for that part to drain out.  And then what I was really surprised about, this is just a couple years ago, I didn't realize that this phenomenon really describes what's been going on with our economy.  You know, when people say, you know, after this recession that they--we started a "recovery," the recovery that didn't feel like a recovery?  What does that mean?  Well, what economists call a recovery is like when you suddenly turn off the faucet and the, you know, the rate at which jobs are disappearing becomes smaller than the rate at which jobs are being created (coughs).  That's called a recovery.  But this backlog of unemployed people, that doesn't suddenly disappear.  So economists may say, when the input rate is less than the draining rate, you know, in terms of, you know, lost jobs, that's a recovery.  But everyday people are not going to feel like it's a recovery until, you know, that level of water drops back down to zero.  And that's kind of where we are right now.  You know, we're getting closer, but we're waiting for that to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 26003
Speaker 1: So at Bell [Bell Labs, New Jersey]--now, you worked with--did you--I know, during your tenure there you wrote over fifty papers.  But did your theory, from what I understand, from what I've come to figure out, had something to do with the pricing of--
Speaker 2: Well, I'd got into that later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when I was sort of the, I guess, what I call my '80s [1980s] period--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, in terms of my career, I understand that there's more of just kind of flexing mathematic muscles.  You know, it was, like, there were these classical queueing models, and I'd come up these new techniques there, you know, not just individual queues, but also queueing network.  Found a way to analyze these in more detail, you know, and was a special lab physicist on dynamic rates.  In the '90s [1990s], I started, along with the company, focusing more on applications.  And then I said, well, why not study more--.  Well, rather than do a mathematical analysis of pre-existing queueing models, you know, which kind of grew from looking at communication systems--well, we're talking about developing lots of new communication systems now, you know, from the, like, wireless communications to--well, we'll call them ATM rates--asynchronous transfer model.  Why not study those and try to be there and create the new mathematical model.  And so I found that we had done that, had a great--techniques could be useful for trying to create those models.  And in the interest of interacting with various people there, you know, it's like, I think it started with Steve Eiken and Ward Whitt (ph.) where, Steve was collecting lots of data, telephone traffic, and then we could see this time-varying behavior and then, with Ward, we were trying to study these sort of systems to look at what's called in telephone language, "offered load,"   so the number of telephone lines that people are requesting, (opposed?) to carry a load, which is the number of telephone lines they get.  And it turns out mathematically you can do the simpler analysis for the offered load traffic.  And we showed all these interesting effects, you know, of time-varying behavior.  And so that led to--, the work I did with Ward, that kind of led to a patent we did on server staffing, like a call center, you know, trying to figure, you know--if you know that the demand for this--you know, the center is going to vary over time; how do you staff the right amount of agents at the right time to handle this traffic?
Story_ID: 26004
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, what is Jackson (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, Jackson networks.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So that was this model I was talking about.  Sometimes that's called the MMI Queue, where you have--it's sort of a code for--the Ms don't mean what you think they mean, you know, in a sense that--it is like a pause and arrival process.  So it's sort of like, well, where's the M, you know it is.  Well, there's--they use the M because it's like a mark-off process, you know.  So it's--which is a stochastic progress where the future--given the present, the future (unclear) and only depends on the present and not the distant past.  So there's no memory of the past.  So what's going on right now tells you its future behavior.  And those are easier to study mathematically.  And so I say, MM1, the second M stands for exponential service time.  That's only because that has a memory-less property, and it's like one server.  But now, Jackson network; well the idea is that you show up at this server, you stand in line, you leave, and now you may enter another queue, you know, and stand there, you know.  So now you get the interaction between these queues, and you put this together, you call this a network.  And how Jackson's name got into this is that, well, clearly if you're leaving one queue and then you go to another queue, there's going to be some correlation between how many people are at each site.  But Jackson came up with this surprising result.  Like in--you look in the steady-state behavior.  All the different sites act as if they're independent of each other.  Now, some papers Ward [Whitt; ph.] and I did later, we saw that what intuitively what's happening is that, the reason it looks that way is:  no person can be two places at the same time.  So if you look at a snapshot, you know, of all the different sites at the same time, every site is going to have different people; so they, you know, so it's not a big surprise that they act independent of each other.  But mathematically this is very surprising.  This was the beginning of, I guess, queueing network theory, that that was actually the easy way to study a network, because a lot of times you don't get that lucky when you studying multidimensional systems.  You know, in a lot of fields, it's easy to study one thing; and it's hard to, you know, analyze a lot of things interacting with each other.
Story_ID: 26005
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Bell Labs [New Jersey], from what we've heard from others, I guess it's true that they give you a lot of latitude in research--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and things and to take off on an idea in a direction that may not immediately be solving a problem.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And another feature is that you're able to have a collegial relationship with others that are--were working on different problems and your ideas intersect at points where it may not be expected, but you know, people say, "Oh, there's something I never thought of."
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: So this is the overall culture of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And within that culture, some culture is the African American science culture there, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in that immediately?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because what happened is that since, at the time--well, wasn't really planning this, it just sort of happened this way.  I mean, I was not the first African-American mathematician to work there.  There was a fellow Eldon McIntyre, who was the first. E-L-D-O-N.  And then I think it's, M-C--
Speaker 1: I-N-T-Y-R-E (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I-E-A-R.  McIntyre, right. I-N-T-Y-R-E.
Speaker 1: -R-e?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Eldon McIntyre.  I guess he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Eldon, yeah.  Eldon or we just called him Don; Don McIntyre.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I met him during the summers I was there.  Unfortunately, as it turned out, he ended up no longer working there by the time I got there full time.  Then a couple years after Don got there, there was a fellow named Wesley Thompson.  Oh, I should mention--so Don got his Ph.D. in mathematics from Courant Institute [NYU] in applied math, and then--
Speaker 1: Now, that's in--
Speaker 2: New York City.
Speaker 1: New York City.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is where Joe Keller [Joseph Keller, prominent mathematician; Massey's doctoral advisor at Stanford University] used to be--was a mainstay a Courant Institute.  I was just lucky that when I--at the time I was going to start doing a thesis, he left Courant Institute to join the faculty at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  And, now, Wesley Thompson got a Ph.D. in statistics from [University of California] Berkeley.  In fact, his thesis advisor was David Blackwell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, David Blackwell, now this is an important figure--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --in black mathematics.  Explain the significance of David Blackwell and take your time (laughs).
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, let's see.  It's hard to say where to start because he was certainly the most prolific black mathematician of our time; was certainly of the twentieth century.  He now only published a lot, but he made a lot of seminal contributions to a lot of fields; you know, a lot of mathematical contributions.  So, he would call himself a statistician.  And then he had a, let's see, it was a number of Ph.D.s he had; maybe around sixty-five Ph.D. students during his career.  Unfortunately, very few of them were black.  I think Wesley Thompson was one--you know, maybe about two; you know, Wesley Thompson was one of them.  Then--of course, another tragedy at the time is that about a month before I was about to start working at Bell Labs, Wesley Thomson had died in a, you know, he had drowned in a swimming pool accident.  So, you know, because I remember the--all the time I was a grad student, I was thinking to myself, you know, "Wow.  Bell Labs could be a place I could go.  I wouldn't have to be the only black person."  But through lots of unfortunate circumstances, when I started I was the only black person here.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Okay.  But, but you did have a chance to interact with the others (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And work on various projects?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Story_ID: 26006
Speaker 1: Now, when you look at your career at Bell Labs [New Jersey], what would you consider to be the, I guess, the outstanding milestone (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--well, okay.  It goes in a couple of directions in terms of my research.  Certainly, having an environment where you can just start taking your thesis and spinning it off into different papers, and, you know, and then the ideas there point in certain directions, and you have the latitude to pursue them, you know.  So that was certainly great.  And I remember coming up with a lot of interesting ideas of, you know, from studying Jackson networks, that became--they grew into areas, like, what's called "stochastic ordering," where the idea is that, if you increase the arrival rate for a queueing system, you expect to have a longer, you know, a longer line; you know, more people standing in line, okay.  But the problem is that, mathematically, the number of people standing in line is a random variable, not a, you know, deterministic value.  So what does it mean for a random variable to be larger?  And so you can rigorize that by defining a notion of what's called stochastic ordering.  And what I discovered was the--when you look at queueing networks instead of this individual queues, the notion of what you call an "ordering" becomes a lot more complicated.  And so I found, like, upper bounds for Jackson networks, primarily because everyone thought stochastic ordering meant it had to be something of like a sample path comparison.  And I showed where there are weaker ordering that are still valid that give you extra insight.  Okay.  So I just kind of pointed out there are lots of different ways of looking at these comparisons when you're talking about--well, mostly dimensional setting, I guess--you see, in one dimension, you know, if you have two points, then you always know which one is bigger.  That's called a totally ordered space.  But multi-dimensions is not necessarily--it's not going to be that straightforward.  And so those are called partially ordered spaces.  So, starting with queueing theory, communications, Jackson networks, suddenly I'm publishing a paper.  This is the one where I looked at, you know, some sort of stochastic ordering for Markov processes on partially ordered spaces, you know.  I developed that to a theory.  In fact, it's funny where this--how this happens because I'd done a paper--in studying of Jackson network, I developed a technique that I thought would help prove this result for the network.  And that technique didn't work.  But the failure of that technique for the original problem led to this deeper theory that developed from this whole paper.  So that's what's interesting about research, is that you don't know--you don't know what's going to lead to what, because sometimes I find you learn more when things go wrong than when things go right.
Speaker 1: You ever been in a situation where something went right, but it led you the wrong--you know, it actually--that a procedure went right, but it was leading you in the wrong direction?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I'm trying to think of--I mean, I can't think of something, you know, some really blatantly--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's possible though that you could (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Because what I found what I did, the way I developed generality, I just look at a simple concrete model and study that in great detail, because you may think--well, I guess an example of, you know, one thing I was always looking at is that--remember I was talking about how the arrival rate had to be less than the server's rate to get a stable system?  But for the time varying case, that's not how you establish stability.  Okay.  So I saw a lot of papers where people would just look at, you know, the rates over time and think, "Well, when the arrival rate peaks, that's when I should have the peak number of servers."  It turns that's wrong, because they're not picking up a lag effect where, you know, it's just that if you're running a restaurant and you see a long line of people standing outside your restaurant, if you're a waiter, that doesn't mean you're busy right now; it means you'll be busy later, you know, after all the people get in, sit down and order their food.  And so a lot of times people don't realize that there these lag effects, so you just can't take the old static analysis, make everything a function a time, and then you have the dynamic analysis.  So, yes, so I kind of spent a lot of time--and the nature of research is just kind of rethinking things, you know, like, people might have thought things went this way, but when you look at the more general framework, it really doesn't work this way; it kind of works that way.
Story_ID: 26007
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did your research, I guess, add, I guess--how did it advance your field of study?
Speaker 2: Well, I know it did advance the theory of--sometimes they call it time-varying queues or I like to call them dynamic rate queues.  So we advanced that field.  And what I've been doing recently is that once you have that understanding, can you design systems more efficiently this way?  You know, like, so control the system and then develop policies for, you know, profit maximization, you know, as you change the dynamics of the system over time.  And sometimes that's called dynamic, optimization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is when the applied part of the work is--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because what I--overtime what I also learned about is how to--you know, at first I learned the mathematical tools, and then I started to looking more into why were the--the relationship between these tools and telecommunication problems; you know, how--why are we using this mathematics to describe this situation.  And then once you have that understanding, what can you do with it?  You know, like, can you--you know, usually, probability--probabilistic analysis just sort of tells you what's going on, but you need to look at things like optimization to figure out--I mean, the reason optimization is good is that, if you do something, you want to do strategically the best thing.  And optimization is a way of helping you to figure out what the best thing is.
Story_ID: 26008
Speaker 1: Now what else at Bell [Bell Labs, New Jersey] would you say you see as-- or is that, you know--(simultaneous) what is your major contributions to Bell over the last (simultaneous)(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I guess--well, land lines are time-varying queues.  So I guess what else happened--well, we got, you know, the patent for server staffing.  In general--well, I guess--let me switch directions because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's this one side, the professional side; but there's a whole 'nother side of being in a place with such a critical mass of black scientists, which was just--I didn't--I mean, since that's all I knew at the time, I didn't realize how, I mean, it was a great place to be at, I just didn't realize how special it was.  And so, for example, knowing these black chemists and black physicists, black physicists had a group called 'the National Society of Black Physicists', you know, NSBP.  Black chemists had a group called NOBCCHE, 'National Organization for Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers'.  And I remember in the '90s [1990s] I said, well, physicists are having these conferences, you know.  They would have their independent standalone conferences once a year where all these black physicists get together and talk about, you know, their research; you know, share ideas.  Chemists would do something similar.  And then in the '90s [1990s], I was saying, the physicists had been doing this, the chemists had been doing this; they've been doing these things since the 1970's; what's going on here in math?  And so that's how I got interested in developing what I call the CAARMS conference, where CAARMS, shorthand for 'Conference for African-American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences'.  You know, I sort of--basically, it's just being influenced by all these black physicists and chemists.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you--from what I--my notes, you came up with the idea in 1990, right; is that true, around 1990?
Speaker 2: Probably near late mid-'90s [1990s].  But the first conference probably happened, yeah, like, in '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: You know, because one thing I had done at Princeton [University]--at Bell Labs, probably, you know, about '89 [1989] or '90 [1990], I just got this idea of why not have all the black scientists, we just meet for lunch once every two weeks, and we just talk about what we do.  And the reason I found that very useful is that we're all these different disciplines, you know; from mathematics to physics to electrical engineering to computer science to chemistry, chemical engineering.  But all these disciplines are in the service of telecommunications.  And so by listening to everybody talking, you just get a better sense of the bigger picture of, you know, there're so many different aspects of the telephone system.  And then you got to see how each discipline fit into, you know, advancing that area.
Speaker 1: So the names I have here of the conference organizers, were these all Bell Labs employees: Raymond Johnson, William Thurston, James Turner?
Speaker 2: No.  Bill Thurston, unfortunately, he passed away just a couple years ago.  He was the--again, at the time, he was the director of the Mathematical and Science Research Institute at Berkeley [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about Turner?
Speaker 2: Well, see; where was Turner at that time?  Think he was at--well, see, yeah.  He's been so many different places.  Let's see, which one was this.  At one point it was at Virginia.  No, by this time he might have been at--maybe he was at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And Johnson?
Speaker 2: Back then, I guess Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, how--what did you have to do to get this conference off the ground?  Who funded it?
Speaker 2: Well, part of it was Bill Thurston.  He hosted the event and he contributed some money.  And then I got, you know, I guess, Arnold Pensi (ph.) asked Bell Laboratory to contribute money to the conference; and then I think James Turner had some, you know, grant money from the [U.S.] Department of Energy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you gathered together, like, all the professionals in the field or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, a good subset.  I mean in the sense of a--
Speaker 1: Not all, but I mean a lot of them.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then, you know, like, David Blackwell and Janice Wilkins (ph.) both attended the conference.  And I think after David Blackwell, I guess Janice Wilkins would be considered the other, you know, major black giant in mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you've written about the--well, the CAARMS conference is going on now; you're getting ready to have--or you just had CAARMS (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) (unclear) eighteen.
Speaker 1: --Eighteen, right.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) (unclear), the nineteenth one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So this has been a pretty regular--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.  And do undergraduate students attend this conference?
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean, it's more--among undergraduates it's--well, among students, it's probably more primarily grad students, but we certainly get a significant number of undergrads.
Speaker 1: About many show--people show up?
Speaker 2: In general, our numbers have always been, like--say like, maybe eighty people; maybe half of them are researchers, half are students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, one thing we've changed a lot of over the years, is just increasing--doing more to get students involved, because I think the very first conference, we--students just sort of sat there listening to us give lectures.  And then about the second one, we said, "Well, why not have them do poster presentations?"  And then a few years later, it was like, "Well, why not have them--while they're doing--having them do posters, why don't we give out prizes or awards?"  At first we were afraid of doing that since they're so into disciplinary as a conference.  You know, how do you compare apples and oranges.  Here's a solution:  Give an award for the best apple, and give an award for the best orange (laughs).  So we had many, you know, like four different types of awards in all the different angles or aspects of mathematics.  And then after we got these awards, then it was like, "Well, are students just going to, you know, present?  Do they ever get to stand up, give a talk?"  And the reason I hesitated about that, like, you know, we had, like, maybe 10 to 11 speakers give talks.  But we had twenty students do posters.  We're not going to have twenty students give lectures.  You know, there just wouldn't be time.  And then, okay.  And then it's a--if we just do a subset of them, then who do we pick?  Then it occurred to me, "Well, we just gave four of them awards.  So why don't we have them give, you know--".  You know the first day, we have the poster session; the next day the banquet, we give out the awards.  Probably the morning of the third day we have the winners give, like, shorter presentations, maybe like twenty minutes.  And so, yeah, we didn't come up all this overnight.  This has kind of slowly evolved over the years.  And then the final new twist we added was, rather than them just quietly sitting there and that afternoon, boom, all of them do their posters, have these sort of, what I call, like, flash presentations; that they serve--each one stands up, and we have, like, a countdown clock; and for two minutes with no slides, no pictures, they just tell us who they are, where they're from, what their project is, and why did you come and see my poster.  And so, that way we get them.  So, I've been happy about finding ways, you now, interesting ways to get them more engaged.  You know, they all get their cast to stand up and give a presentation; they all the chance to talk about their posters; you know, some of them win prizes and they get noted for their work; they get to make oral presentations also.  And so we just kind of integrate that through, you know, the whole conference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26009
Speaker 1: Now, in 1997, you won the W. F. Lincoln-Hawkins Mentoring Excellence Award--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Bell Laboratories [New Jersey].  Now, so you were--you mentioned earlier kind of mentoring Arlie Petters [also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was a student, a grad [graduate] student at Bell Labs.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: So, tell us about your activities as a mentor.
Speaker 2: So what really got me started there was, during the summers we had students visiting.  And so, maybe in the mid-'80s [1980s] I started to run like a little summer--well, when I was an undergrad at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], I remember liking the seminar format where students work on different problems and present them to other, you know, to each other.  So I started organizing some of the students together to run, like, a little seminar over the summer.  And then I used the book that I used for my honors calculus course, you know, that I had with Ralph Foxx.  And I found this to be, you know, this could be a lot of fun, get away, you know, to those students; and they walk away learning something.  And that was another fun part about Bell Labs; like, some scientists would just give, like, a little impromptu seminar on, like, quantum mechanics, and it's just a way of, you know, learning about things.  And so, then I got into becoming a mentor, I guess, about the mid-'80s [1980s] sort of by accident, because I had a friend who was on the committee and thought this person should have been considered, but really wasn't.  And the problem was, he was working in math physics.  So he was read as a physicist, where, you know--but he wasn't in the lab, you know, wasn't doing experiments.  So, yeah, he didn't make it on that line.  But then I looked at the papers and I saw that he should have been read as a mathematician because he was developing all these mathematical techniques.  And I read phrase that caught my eye when I first read it, you know--Clifford algebras, okay.  Now, these are, like, Lee algebras; these are things that go on in symmetry issues in physics.  These are not things people, undergrads, discuss, you know--you know, in little schools from New York.  So I kind of got into it feeling that, you know, they'll lobby for this person to be properly considered and, you know, properly evaluated, and then he won the award and then I ended up becoming the mentor.  And then I went on to--after Arlie [Petters]--see if I got everybody.  Then the guy who was my mentor, James McKenna, you know, who is now my department head.  With a breakup of the company, he left to go to Bellcore.  And so, at the time, he had mentored someone in the women's program, named Andrea Brupatosi (ph.). So I became officially her mentor; and so the woman's program.  And so that was the '80s [1980s].  And then in the '90s [1990s], you know, I guess, then it was Jimmy Davis, Nathaniel Greer (ph.), Otis Jennings, Harold Figueroa, and Robert Hampshire [now on the faculty of the School of Public Policy and Information Systems at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Well, with Robert, that's kind of spilling over to the next decade; so it's like, he officially got it.  I met him in '99 [1999], but I officially became his mentor in 2001, right as I was leaving.
Story_ID: 26010
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the transition, I guess, from Bell Labs [New Jersey] to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and the oil pricing.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't the oil pricing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was looking at the idea of adding a pricing structure to queueing systems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But now, a couple of things had happened, because--well, it's funny in a way, because Bell Labs, before the '80s [1980s]--well, basically before divestiture, okay, when AT&T [telecommunications company] was still a monopoly; there was a large social science component to Bell Laboratories.  You had people in psychology, you had people in economics; but, of course, a lot of the economists, the reason they were publishing cutting edge papers is also to try to tell people the advantages of having, you know, advantages of having a monopoly.  Of course, after AT&T was no longer a monopoly, then there wasn't much, you know.  We didn't have that research, so they kind of discontinued a lot of research in psychology and economics, you know, in the mid-'80s [1980s].  But now we speed ahead about fifteen years, and then I meet a fellow named Steve Lanning, who was working in communications and services.  See, what happened by the end of the '90s [1990s], okay, now the internet has been built.  Okay.  So, before, the internet was viewed from the lens of--it's like we're building a highway, okay.  So you need electrical engineers to help you build these devices.  Back in the late '80s [1980s], you met a lot of electrical engineering professors at queueing theory conferences.  But by the end of the '90s [1990s], the internet had been built to a large extent, but to a point that people were talking about how to do commerce over the web, you know.  So how to use this infrastructure to deliver goods and services.  So, suddenly, you know, at Bell Labs they were discovering--rediscovering an interest in economics.  And I started talking to Steven Lanning. He brought in a new Ph.D., hired a new Ph.D.; his name is Qiong (unclear).  You know, it's, Q-I-O-N-G.  And they kind of--it was with them I was exploring, you know, I didn't realize it was like a natural marriage between economics and queueing theory.  Because you use queueing to figure out about how many people are using certain levels of services at certain times.  And then I realized that price sort of maps into like a mechanism of controlling demand.  So, you can use price to control that arrival rate; and if you use price to control that arrival rate, you can adjust it to certain levels of congestion pricing.  You know, you have these probabilities of all circuits being busy, so you say, where you have a lot of congestion, just raise the price; it is a way you can make more money because all you're doing is scaring away the people you don't have resources for anyway.  So that's why (unclear); in fact, I remember one summer just talking about this stuff and just batting ideas around, and that was the key: take it what I got from them, you know, this notion; notion of--because at first I thought, "Well, why we just pretend they're infinite number of resources, we can write down exact formulas like that.  Let's optimize that and see if that's a good estimate of the optimal price for the actual system."  But then they said, "Well, there's a problem there."  And then, "What's the problem?"  And then, you know, "What did you have?"  "Working towards developing a language to understand what's going on."  And then they brought the story about congestion pricing, and then I--okay, then I understood, you know, what they were going for.  But in looking at all these issues, I started to realizing the connections between, also probability and optimization, because, up to now, I was just happy to study the probabilistic side of things.  Because with probabilistic models, you're kind of in math/science mode; you're just describing the behavior.  You know, you're--if you have forecast, you're in a way, well, you're predicting behavior.  But predicting behavior is not the same as controlling behavior.  Now, how do you design this system?  What's the cheapest to do that, what's the right price for these services?  And so, you know--so, with working with them, I started to--it got me into thinking about those ideas; and this the was--a friend of mine that I had when I left Bell Labs and went to Princeton [University].  And so, working with Robert [Hampshire; Massey's student who is now on the faculty of the School of Public Policy and Information Sciences at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], we sort of explored those ideas.  And being at Princeton and working with the Ph.D. students gave me a chance to learn more about these whole ideas of optimization and combine them with ideas I had in probability theory.
Speaker 1: Now, were things--had basically kind of, I mean, I know Bell Labs got less and less like itself--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as time went on.  When you left, was it really--was it still like the Bell Labs that you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember when I knew I had to leave was--you know, when I first got there, it was sort of--the agreement was sort of you could do any type of math you want; you just have to make the case that it had some connection with, you know, with communications.  Now, that was the '80s [1980s].  In the '90s [1990s], it got modified where there's all this cutting edge new type of communication systems we want to look at and design.  "Why don't you make yourself useful in those fields."  And so we could develop, you know, kind of redirect the theory or develop theory that helps understand those systems better.  But by the late-'90s [1990s], it became something like, you know--last year, we thought that this would be a hot area, you know, like call centers, okay, that we're selling these switches, you know, the central office switches, and people can use them to design their own call centers, so this should be a good area.  So you get interested in the area, and then a year later you discover, "Well, hey, guess what?  We can figure out how to make money, you know, selling our product in this area."  So, "We're pulling out of this and we don't want--we want you to do research on something else."  And here was a point where I was being discouraged to get into an area, not because the world had lost interest in the field; it's just people on the business side of my company can't figure out how to sell products in that field.  And then I just realized, you know, when it comes to that, industrial research doesn't really work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it kind of changed the character?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So the Princeton offer then was attractive.  You came to Princeton as a--did you come here as the Edwin S. Wilsey Professor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wilsey.
Speaker 1: Wilsey.  I'm sorry.
Story_ID: 26011
Speaker 1: Edwin S. Wilsey Professor of Operations Research and Financial Engineering [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and essentially you became the first tenured African American mathematician at an Ivy League university [in 2001].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, how I got there--actually, this goes back to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  So I finished up my Ph.D. thesis.  So I talked to my faculty, you know, Ph.D. advisor, Joe Keller [Joseph Keller, prominent mathematical scientist], say, "Well, okay, I finished my thesis.  I guess want to publish it or maybe chop it up in pieces, publish pieces of it; what do I do?"  And he said, "Well, why don't you just make up copies, you know, so the (zany?) ones.  So you just go to a copy shop and make a lot of Xerox copies of it.  And then you just mail the manuscript to different editors."  One of them was Erhan Cinlar, C-I-N-L-A-R; oh, and then there's a little (making a hand motion)--under the "C," there's a little cedilla.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he liked, you know, so in terms of the paper, not only did he like the paper, I had barely gotten to Bell Labs--you know, I maybe got there by October 1st, and maybe, like, one or two weeks later, I'm getting a letter from him inviting me to come to--at the time, he was at Northwestern University [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --me to come there and give a lecture.  So that was my first, you know, professional lecture.  And so, he, you know, through being the editor of the journal where I sent, you know, paper for my thesis, got it published there.  He had always been very helpful with my career.  And if it had been up to him, he would have--okay.  Okay.  The fact that I didn't set foot on Princeton's campus until 2001 was really my fault, you know.  If it had been up to him, I would have been there ten years earlier.  Yeah, because he really worked hard at recruiting me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but at--but in 2001--or it was really 2000 when they called me.  This is at a time where he had left Northwestern, he had joined the faculty at Princeton University, and inside of the civil engineering program, he had grown an operations research Program.  And just about 2000, they had just broken apart and created, you know, like a--it was a department by itself, so they had room to grow.  So they called me up and asked me if I wanted to join the faculty.  And, of course, this is the part where, you know, Bell Labs, like I was saying, was, you know, was not what it used to be.  And so, I said, this is like--it was sort of like the right offer at the right time.

Speaker 1: So, now you continued to do research at a higher level here [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] according to all the paper citations I have on you in this album.  I'm not sure it's not comprehensive.  But can you just kind of summarize what your research has been here?
Speaker 2: Well, here it was getting into--well, moving over from the world of--well, at Bell Labs [New Jersey], they were called queueing theory performance modeling.  So, what I call modeling is that, sort of the deliverable for a model is a forecast, you know.  So a good model gives you--enables you to predict what goes on with the actual system.  So I didn't do a lot of that.  As I got to Princeton, I started moving into the area of decision-making.  So, now the deliverable is, instead of a forecast, the deliverable is a policy.  And so--and then for communications, there seems to be three different natural types of, well, areas we would develop decision-making policies, and just for alliteration sake since, you know, performance begins with the letter P, these three I called--well, first I just thought there were two, you know, provisioning and pricing.  And so, now, if you're not obsessed with using the letter P, then provisioning; another way of saying provisioning will be design, you know; having just enough resources to make your customers happy.  Pricing is--would be sort of like control, you know; how to--you use prices and mechanism to control the demand for the services, and then, you know, this gives you a way of--well, you have two things where, on one hand you want to maximum your profit, but on the other hand you don't want to violate the constraints of creating bad service.  So you want to keep congestion constrained to be no higher than this level.  So what's fun about, you know, being in an executive setting and having Ph.D. students, so you're, you know--so this is kind of the setting I gave to Robert [Hampshire; Massey's student who is now on the faculty of the School of Public Policy and Information Sciences at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and I kind of had this nice picture, you know, of performance and then--performance for modeling, but then for issues of decision-making, the two Ps, you know, pricing, provisioning.  Then a few months into it, he comes back to me and says, "Shouldn't there be a third P here?"  "What do you mean?"  "Well, I think there should be one on--but--well, later we were going to call it "prioritization."  And you only think of that when you have multiple classes of customers.  So you don't assume all the class--customers are the same.  You know, they have different needs, they have--they can afford different levels of service; and so, how do you allocate these resources.  What's the fairest way to allocate these resources among the different classes of customers?  You know, so that's another issue, you know, paper we're still--what we developed, we have the paper but that's--one of my outstanding papers we need to finish up and write up and kick out the door.  But we got some from out of the thesis, you know; through collaboration, we got some of the papers, you know, from it.  And, so now what I'm doing with Jamal, is that we have these--well, it's an essential object that's called the dynamical system, which is the solution of ordinary differential equations.  In the twenty-first century, thanks to the computers, these are easing things to solve.  So, if you can formulate some more complicated system in terms of dynamical systems, you almost feel you have a closed form solution.  And we used--with Robert I used this to approximate average behavior of these random systems.  And then we would control that average behavior, so we'll see average profit through the average revenue.  And so what's the strategy that optimizes that?  But now, when you look at more stochastic systems--well, I have colleagues who were in finance.  They worry a lot about decisions under risk.  Because things aren't completely deterministic.  There's a certain randomness involved.  So there's a risk that occurs.  But how do you maximize in the face of that type of risk?  And so, it turns out you got to understand things like the variance standard deviation, and it turns out the formulas, we have to approximate those; (unclear) approximate those aren't quite as good as the ones that approximate the mean.  So with Jamal, his thesis is developing new techniques.  I guess he would say it's involving stuff like skewness approximation, cumulate moments; and give better estimates of the variants.  So we could extend this sort of decision-making to, you know, deal with more uncertainty.  You know, like, you want to maximize your profit, but you only want to take this level of risk.  You know, how do you, you know, how do you do that?  And then, now I have a most recent student, Jerome--major move I'm making now is that, up to now, everything has been related to communication, communication services; but I found writing up this, you know, in the act of writing up these papers I've done with Robert or, you know, having do up his thesis, I just realized that, when you look at communication services--okay, so--and, of course, when you're no longer working for a phone company, you know, you feel free to thinking about things outside of telephony.  But what's communication services from a business perspective?  It's sort of the leasing of shared resources.  You know, with your cell phone.  You don't buy a radio channel.  You know, in effect, you're paying for the leasing of it through the rate of your conversation.  And so, that's what we're studying in general, so like Robert is in a department of--I guess it's the School of Public Policy and Management [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And, well, once I made this discovery, I was happy, you know, so I was telling Robert, you know, "You'll be happy to know that a set of tools--," since he's an expert in, you know, he trained to be an expert in queueing theory, "--a set of tools that help you study, you know, the leasing of shared resources, you know, may come in, you know, handy when you're looking at issues of public policy."  And so, he's looked at them and applied to areas of transportation.  Now, recently, what I've been doing is, a new area a lot of people in operations and research are getting excited by is health care, you know, because, like, in health care, you don't--you go to the hospital, you don't buy a hospital bed; you lease it for the duration of your stay.  And then you have a lot more issues of, you know, coordination of different types of resources.  So you have this whole elaborate choreograph of resources that all come to bear on your specific, you know, issue.  And so, there's a lot of--there's a lot of room for queueing analysis, you know, there, because the problems are a lot more complex than--a lot of problems that's on the communication systems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26013
Speaker 1: Now, you're a member of NAM, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  National Association of Mathematicians.  Right.
Speaker 1: We interviewed Dr. [Johnny] Houston [also a HistoryMaker] last--week before last.
Speaker 2: Oh, Johnny Houston, yeah.
Speaker 1: Johnny Houston (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he's done some history on the history of blacks in mathematics, but you've also written about the African American legacy at Bell Labs [New Jersey], right, and you had some interesting things to say about it.
Speaker 2: Well, that's--it's something I should write, but so far it's been a talk or a lecture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I know you equate the experience at Bell Labs as being similar to the Harlem Renaissance?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In a sense of a gathering of, you know, black scientists, they're all, you know, excelling in their fields; you know, interacting, working together.  That's the sort of the other thing that attracted me to working there in the first place; that, yeah, "Hey, it was possible to be at a place and do this and not quote, be the only one."  And what I also liked about it, the experience was, here was a high achieving collection of black individuals that were also determined to, you know, leave a legacy for the next generation, you know.  So there's a whole 'nother wave of black scientists who got their--you know, they might have spent one summer there as an undergraduate; they might have gotten a Bell Labs Fellowship, you know, worked there.  You know, sort of take someone like, you know, Robert [Hampshire; Massey's student; currently on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz School of Public Policy and Management, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] or Arlie Petters [also a HistoryMaker] You know, neither of them ever worked at Bell Labs as a researcher.  But they spent summers there, and now they're both successful, you know, professors at top universities.  And so, you know, so it's a feeling like they, you know, the contributions of the previous generation, you know, it's had an impact on, you know, what few black scientists you may see at universities across the country.  Bell Labs has had a very large impact.  You know, like, right now, we have--you can point to two, you know, like, two deans of schools of engineering; you know, Gary May [also a HistoryMaker] at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], and Lance Collins at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  And they both had Bell Labs Fellowships.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or the first--I think of, well, you've interviewed Sossina [Haile; also a HistoryMaker] and then Steve Mayo, the first--Steve was the first African American to ever get tenure at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California].  Sossina was the first black woman to ever get tenure at Cal Tech.  And they both had Bell Labs Fellowships.  Okay.  So, the program has had a far-reaching impact on black science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To qualify that, given the nature of Bell Labs, I would say that non-biological sciences because we, you know, we didn't have fellowships in biological fields.
Story_ID: 26014
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were the recipient of the 2008 Black Engineer of the Year Award at the conference in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You also won, and I saw this in your office, The Blackwell/Tapia Prize [named after mathematicians David Blackwell and Richard Tapia], too, which is--now, that's given by the--is this given by NAM [National Association of Mathematicians]--
Speaker 2: No, it was a committee created by--well, Carlos Castillo-Chavez was the originator of the Blackwell/Tapia conferences.  And then, you know, the first one, I think, it was 2000.  And then 2002, he decided to have--start having a prize for that.  And I think he got, like--I'm not sure about the whole setup, but it may be a consortium of all the math research institutes.  They sort of take turns hosting the event.  And then there's a committee, you know.  Part of it is one where winners kind of rotate on and off the committee; helps select the next winner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I should also mention my most--well, relatively hot off the press, just two months ago I was one of the inaugural fellows for the American Mathematical Society [AMS].  Because, the AMS for short, because they hadn't--a professional institute, they hadn't really had any historically, fellows.  Finally, they realized they were--I guess they were putting their math colleagues at many universities at a disadvantage, a political disadvantage; whereas, you know, some electrical engineering professor could say they're a fellow of the IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers].  And if the dean sees that, but doesn't see a comparable award for the math person.  So, you know, so one thing, I'm happy about it, just getting--well, the validation as a mathematician, you know, like, an Inaugural Fellow for the American Mathematical Society.  Then in 2006, I was made Fellow of the, what's called, INFORMS, or the Institute for Operations Research and Managerial Sciences.
Story_ID: 26015
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking earlier about how many black--the low number of black Ph.D.s and people you know, like David Blackwell [mathematician], graduate.  And you've got--you graduated a couple--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I've--so far--well, it depends on how you count.  Okay, in terms of Ph.D.s from Princeton, I've Robert [Hampshire; Massey's student who is now on the faculty of the School of Public Policy and Information Sciences at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and Jamal should be finishing up next couple of months.  But I was also advisor to other people; Rodney Wallace got his Ph.D. from George Washington University [Washington, District of Columbia].  Technically, I was a co--yeah, co-advisor.  And then, I met Ridley from University of Maryland.  It's a math department there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  University of Maryland.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was co-advisor with them.  And then--and so in that spirit, Jerome, who when he gets his Ph.D., it'll be from Binghamton University [Binghamton, New York], but I'll be his--really principal advisor; I say co-advisor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Then (unclear) happy about recently we had a selection of new grad students for our department, and I was able to recruit two African American students to apply, and they both got accepted into our department.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the first time this has happened, right?  Have two--
Speaker 2: Two at the same time, yes.  In fact, just last year we had our first, you know, Jamal and Robert were African Americans.  Last year, we had our first African student--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was from Ghana.  So, these two, I hope they both accept (unclear) and come here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26016
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what would you consider to be your scientific and mathematical legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, certainly to study all aspects of queueing systems from the perspective of dynamic rates.  You know, like, when you add on time-varying behavior, that opens up a whole new area of possibilities.  And then later, I just learned--well, first when I was looking at those systems, I didn't realize the probability that I was also really studying a lot of work--things in dynamical systems.  And then I found dynamic, optimization; it's--you know, so I moved on to those areas.  So there's this mixture of looking stochastic processes, looking at dynamical systems, looking at dynamic, optimization of those systems.  And I was happy just having these experiences; just have a deeper understanding, not just math but operations research; you know, what's the field about.  And I've--I think I was very fortunate because I've been having various experiences.  I got to see math from the point of view, you know, theory; you know, my training at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey]. But since I took physics when I was also at Princeton, I got to see it from the world of what I call mathematical science or, you know, how do you do model making.  And certainly working with someone like Joe Keller [Joseph Keller; Massey's doctoral advisor; prominent mathematical scientist]; gave me a better sense of (unclear) applied math; and then all the years at Bell Labs.  You know, mathematics is a man made systems.  So I got a lot--see a lot of real live operations research and, you know, the design of these things.  So I've been very happy with my, well, career in every sense; that it's been very intellectually satisfying, but at the same time, I was able to, you know, introduce more black students to the field and get them involved in the world of mathematics.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that I found is consistent in most of these interviews with scientists that the NSF [National Science Foundation] has funded is that, just about all of you black scientists are involved in some way in mentoring, recruiting more students to the field. Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, you know, you've certainly done a lot in (unclear) that.
Speaker 1: Well, in fact, I like to suggest that, it may be controversial, say, you know, black scholars in, you know, other fields, I think they need to do more work, because I think they're not doing enough of that, you know, because I've heard some just think that, "Well, if I'm successful and I get all these great prizes, I'm being a role model inspiring other people," and, no, it's more than that.  You know, you have to actually (weigh leaving?) to help the next generations.  You know, what do you do?  You help the next generation succeed.  You know, it's not about just having a grand career, making lots of money, or a claim for yourself, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you--the scientists and mathematicians are certainly organized around it in a higher level than everyone else.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They maybe have more resources to work, but I don't know.  But they certainly have done more.
Story_ID: 26017
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, again, is there any major thing that you wish you hadn't done or would go back and change?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  Wish I had done. Not career-wise, not really.  I mean, because I went to this conference in Stockholm [Sweden] my last year.  And I organized a session, you know, so some other black students, well, black students; I mean, they're, these guys are in their thirties, but then, I mean, they're researchers, pack of researchers.  And, you know, like, then they had lots of fund there, and they off-hours they wanted to all these parties.  But by the time you got to night, I was just dead tired.  I just wanted to sleep.  They, you know dragged me to all these clubs, and I'm thinking to myself, "Now, if I just bothered being a mentor, bring in the next generation, I could've just come to this conference and be the only black person here, and I wouldn't be having this problem right now."  And so, I say--so I realized--then I realized you just got to live with what you've done in your life (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, tell us about your family, now.  Do you have a--you didn't tell us about getting married on the way, but did you--(unclear), do you have any children? (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, who do you consider your family at Princeton [New Jersey] then or do you even think of it in those terms?
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's sort of a network of students--well, I met them when they were students and now they've gotten older and we've become colleagues, and, you know, I still see family out in St. Louis [Missouri] also.  But it's just--and then I say, knowing, you know, having good friends you can talk to, you know, people you can talk to all the time, you know, you visiting different places.  I mean, it's sort of a collaboration of research; gives you a good excuse to travel places, visit people and get a chance to do things.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Now, let me just point out that though you a Massey, you are not related to Dr. Samuel Massey or Dr. Walter Massey [also HistoryMakers], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So as far as we know, there's no relationship?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Different parts of the country.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then in talking to Walter Massey, I didn't, you know, there was no--he said his family grew up in Mississippi.  And I know my father's [Richard Massey] family grew up in North Carolina and South Carolina.  So, you know, there's no immediate connection.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And Samuel Massey, you've never heard of any connection with him?
Speaker 1: Don't think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, is anything I haven't talked about we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 1: Let's see.  I guess--some of the topics we got into, okay.  So we talked about CAARMS [Conference of African American Researchers in Mathematical Sciences] and Bell Labs [New Jersey], Princeton [University, New Jersey].  I think certainly the math part has been covered.
Story_ID: 26018
Speaker 1: Well, here's a question I haven't asked, and I think we still have a little time to ask it.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, I listen to the rhetoric and I see how people behave, and I see a major contradiction.  I mean, you know, people like for you to throw out that word "crisis," but if we are in a crisis, somebody forgot to tell us we're in a crisis, because we don't act like we're in the middle of a crisis.  And, now, there're two ways you can look at that, you know; one could be--well, maybe the people are saying it's a crisis or just over reacting and things are better than you think they are.  But there's another possibility that we just put out heads on the sand and things are really worst than they really are.  And so I see a lack of seriousness and talking about issues.  Maybe it's because, you know, because I come from a technical training that I see a complex issue is not one to run away from.  You just sort of break it down into smaller pieces, and maybe systematically study those.  And, but also not worry about the fact that you may never--you may not solve it all at once, you may never solve the whole thing; but you ought to start somewhere.  And, I think, you know, thanks to, I guess, a legacy of, say, like, a [President] Barack Obama.  I think one statement or the great gift he's made to the black community is through elected twice, okay.  He's basically telling the African American community, you know, you don't have to wait until the last racist dies before you can achieve something, you know; you can do that now.  It's not like things are wonderful, it's not like racism's gone, but that's no excuse for not achieving something.  And I think the other part you need to realize is that, when you achieve something, what are doing to help the next generation?  And I don't get a sense of--we seem to be distracted by too many trivial concerns, and we're not really dealing with that issue; you know, like, what--where are we--well, can we even get in a room and talk about issues without, you know, T.V. cameras, you know.  Just that's harder than you think, because I see a lot of people, when they have meaningful dialogues on race, and it's only with the T.V. camera's on.  Yeah.  The minute the camera's off, you know, they don't want to talk to another black person.  And so I think we need to, you know, talk to each more, you know, when it's not for the public's spectacle.
Story_ID: 26019
Speaker 1: Now, does CAARMS [Conference of African American Researchers in Mathematical Sciences] or NAM [National Association of Mathematicians] or any of the black organizations, scientific organizations, actually discuss social issues in their meetings at all, do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, we do to some extent, but I found, though, it's so are--okay.  So, I'll speak for CAARMS.  It's so rare to have a forum where black mathematicians talk about math or realizing by, you know, because I always tell students, you know, the coin of the realm, you know, in academics is being a good researcher.  You know, that's the way you can get the grants, that's the way you can bring the money, that's how you can support other students.  And so at some point, if you getting in with other math people, you really need to talk about the mathematics and excel at that.  You know, it seems obvious--well, it was obvious, I guess, at Bell Labs [New Jersey].  I had to, later when I left Bell Labs, consciously think about that, because I was seeing that all the time.  You know, Jim West invented the modern day microphone, okay.  And I saw how he leveraged his success of inventing that microphone to do things or to help the next generation.  And I don't see--you know, we don't necessarily have to sit and have--to have a meaningful discussion, we don't have to necessarily discuss whatever is the hot issue, because maybe the source of the problem of some of these issues is that, you know, people don't have jobs, but it's really is there a lack of jobs or is a lack of--you know, there're people who're looking for, you know, to hire people, but with a certain set of skills.  You know, how many of these issues would go away if they, you know, lot of students had better skills; I don't know.  But certainly attaining these skills will help you.  You know, I've had a career where I get to shape, you know, my life the way I wanted to, you know, to shape it, you know, because I was able to move from--you know, when Bell Labs falls apart, I have to quote, settle to--from being a full professor at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey], okay.  You can only make moves like that if you have the right skill set.  And so I guess I'm saying we should--oh, I guess one thing I would say is that, you know, I remember somebody in black studies was one to know, well, okay, you do all the science; what does this have to do with black culture?  You know, what are black scientists--what role are they playing in black culture?  And my answer to them is, you know, "We're the ones who redefined it."  I mean, that's our contribution.
Speaker 1: You mean through technology and--
Speaker 2: Well, through technology or just getting, you know--.  When Robert [Hampshire; Massey's student who is now on the faculty of the School of Public Policy and Information Sciences at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] got his Ph.D., he was the first African American to ever get a Ph.D., in operations research from Princeton University.  I claim that's redefining black culture, you know.  That's never happened before.  And in terms of what black people are capable of--not capable of, we're rewriting that every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  On top of the occasional "let's invent, you know, the modern day microphone," you know, which also has a big impact.  But, you know, so, we, you know, well, we can come at it in two different ways, because, you know, because there's no shortage of celebration of black people who use microphones, okay.  But there's the analogous celebration for the person who helped to invent it?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Most people don't know, I'm sure (laughs).
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yeah.  And then that's another case in point, because I remember looking through, let's see, I guess, Encarta Africana, okay.  And I kept looking for Jim West, Jim West, Jim West, Jim West.  Okay.  Somebody who, working with other black scientists at that time, helped to bring about these fellowship programs, outreach programs that paid for my Ph.D., Arlie Petters's [also a HistoryMaker] Ph.D., Gary May's Ph.D., Kevin Kornegay [also HistoryMakers] Ph.D.; you know, on and on down the line.  "Oh, by the way, he also invented the modern day microphone."  Does that rate any mention in Encarta Africana?  No.  Now, you can say, "Okay.  It's a finite book.  You can't fit everybody in there."  But I had thumbed through it and I see there is room to talk about RuPaul [actor].  Okay.  So, I look at things like that and I see, you know, a profound lack of seriousness when it comes to, if we really want to talk about black issues.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It seems like it's a lack of communication to me, you know  (unclear) (simultaneous) knowing about these things.
Speaker 2: True.  I used to think that until I came here.  And then I found it's not--the lack of communication is not that passive.  I think sometimes it's more, you know, they aggressive don't want to know or they don't actively think it's not important or it could be, maybe, I think I'm more, you know; as long as the camera's on me, I'll be--(you're just?) important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what it is.  But I do know that there's no, you know, there should be more of a seriousness about these issues.  If, you know, we're going to talk about communication, we're talking about improving our situation, you know--you know, there should be, you know, people who are, you know, allegedly on the same side.  You know, there should be more, you know, communication there.
Story_ID: 26020
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess that, you know, the obvious thing is that, you know, I enjoyed mathematics; I think I've made contributions in the field of mathematics; and I tried to help a lot of other black students get involved in, not just mathematics, but other technical fields or just, you know, try to help them out, succeed in general.  And, I think those are the things I'd like to be known for.
