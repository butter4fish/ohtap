Evan Faulkenbury: Alright, today is March 14, 2015. My name is Evan Faulkenbury with the SOHP and I am interviewing Katherine Roberts at the Love House at UNC-Chapel Hill. So first off, Kathy, thanks for being here.        Katherine Roberts: You're welcome.        EF: Do you go by Kathy?        KR: I do.        EF: Okay. Excellent. Well the first thing I want to ask about is for you to tell me about your childhood.         KR: Okay. I put on the form just now, it asks place of birth, I wrote down Knoxville, Tennessee, because that's where I was born. But I don't often think about that because we didn't stay there very long. My dad was in the military, so we moved around a lot. I was born in Knoxville and then four month later we moved to Japan and lived there for about a year and a half. He was in the Air Force. Then we moved to Hawaii and lived there for a couple of years and he got transferred to Virginia and was with the cadets at Virginia Tech. [He] led the ROTC folks there and worked with that program, and so we lived in Blacksburg, Virginia for three years or so. And then we moved again to Texas and lived in west Texas at Webb Air Force base, which I think is closed now, for a couple of years. And then we moved to New Jersey and he was stationed at a place called McGuire Air Force base, which I think has been joined with Fort Dix at this point, which was an Army post there. I think it's a combined military installation. So we had a combination of dwelling situations. Some of them were military installations and some of them were in, we would live in town and my dad would go to work wherever that would be. So a variety of living situations. When he was about forty-eight he retired from the military, and I was twelve and he did not have a job. I can remember, this was before computers or anything like that, so I can remember my mom typing endlessly on her old typewriter cover letters for him to try and find a job, to find one by the time it was time to leave. So we moved to Tennessee where my mom's family was and perched there for a while. Us kids started school. We lived in Sewanee.         EF: Yeah.        KR: We got on the bus. We used to ride on the bus. We got on the bus [and] went down the mountain to public school and that lasted a couple of months, and he got a job in West Virginia teaching ROTC in a public high school in West Virginia. So we moved, again. I was about twelve or thirteen when we moved to West Virginia and my parents are still there. I went to junior high and high school in West Virginia. Parkersburg, West Virginia. Went to Parkersburg South high school. Graduated from there in 1985. So that's the childhood.         EF: Okay. So that's a lot of moving around.        KR: That's a lot of trotting. I know.         EF: What are some of your earliest memories of some of those, I guess, early states? Like you said, you bounced from Hawaii to Virginia to Texas to New Jersey, I think.        KR: Yeah.         EF: So that's quite a bit before you were twelve, before you moved to Tennessee.        KR: Yeah. Exactly.        EF: What are some of your more formative memories of some of those places?         KR: You know what's funny, it's hard when you're really little, it's hard to know what is a memory and what is from family photo albums. What's your real memory?         EF: Yes.        KR: I don't have anything from Japan, except for family stories. One family story about Japan is that I had a Japanese babysitter. My mom was a stay-at-home mom, but she had a babysitter too who spent a lot of time with me and spoke nothing but Japanese to me. So one of the family stories is that my first words were in Japanese and not in English, so that's fun. But then in Hawaii, I guess I remember a little bit. The geography of childhood is so tiny. I remember the back alley and the way the ground felt, it was kind of sandy, and going to the beach. We used to go to the beach on Saturdays. My dad had this hibachi, one of those old-fashioned brazier things. I remember that thing and him hauling that. We had a green Plymouth we'd all ride to the beach in, stuff like that. I don't remember much else from Hawaii. In Virginia, I guess I remember the world expanding a little bit and having range. We lived in a little suburban neighborhood, not far from Virginia Tech's campus. Having some range between friend's houses. So being able to--I was three, four, and five at the time--so being able to walk.         EF: Yeah.        KR: To see little friends. It was so verdant. It was so green and beautiful.         EF: Yeah, Blacksburg is mountainous.         KR: It's so lovely. It really is, especially in the spring and the summer. It was beautiful. Memories of that and swimming at the pool after work with my dad. We had a dog that would get loose. My parents were not conscientious of the dog tied up to a stake in the yard or was loose, and people would call us to come and get it. I think my mother was really happy there and so I remember that as a happy time. Then we moved to Texas, which was like another planet.        EF: Sure. West Texas you said.         KR: West Texas. It was tumbleweeds and mesas. It was really dry. So that was jarring for everybody. But as a kid, we seemed to have a lot of range of motion. That might be how I am remembering it, but we walked everywhere. We walked to school. We lived on a military base there so we had a lot of kids around and we were outside a lot.        EF: Right.        KR: We were outside all the time. My sister and I used to catch and collect horned toads.         EF: Oh, wow.        KR: We'd make these little houses for them out of shoeboxes with elaborate doors and windows and stuff. We'd set up these penthouses on the back porch.        EF: Wow.         KR: And put all these little horned toads in it and in the morning they'd be gone. Stuff like that. We had a dog and we had a cat. We had kittens. You know, little childhood memories. But I do remember being outside a lot and my sister got a little horse while we were there, so she was learning how to ride. We used to go out to this farm outside of the base and ride horses and everybody wore cowboy boots. My dad got a pick-up truck. We used to ride in the back of that. But I do remember walking a lot and playing outside. I don't know if we walked off the base. It seems like there was a fence around it, but we had a relationship with a horse on the other side of the fence we used to go and feed and talk to and stuff. I have two siblings. I have an older sister and a younger brother. We're pretty close in age. Younger brother is three years younger and my older sister is about two years older than me. So we had a lot of friends. We had a lot of childhood activity. I don't remember being lonely, at all. Where did we go from there? We went to New Jersey. Those were the golden years of childhood. That was on a big Air Force base, and when you come into the years of nine, ten, and eleven, you're a grown kid, but you're not an adolescent yet. So there was really a lot of autonomy and freedom. We used to ride our bikes over to the pool, and we had these little military ID cards, so we could go from the residential part of the base and show our ID cards to the guard at the gate to get onto the administrative part of the base where the pool was, where the movie theater was and all of that stuff. We did all of that on bikes and on foot and stuff. Walked to school again, there. People had a lot of kids, I remember. My dad was an officer, so we lived in officer housing which is a little bit different. Bases are pretty hierarchical. There's enlisted housing, which is smaller and is in a different--. There are two kinds of neighborhoods. The houses were still close together even though they were larger houses. I can remember one next-door neighbor that had six kids and the other on had four. The ones across the street had three. Nobody had two children. Everybody had at least three children.         EF: Yeah. Right.        KR: So there were a lot of kids.        EF: Sounds like it.        KR: So those are good memories. When my dad left the military, a little bit under duress. He wasn't promoted so he left and was not prepared for that transition. That marks the transition into adolescence for me. So that marked a very stressful time. I can remember the stress, being in a temporary situation in Sewanee. We rented this brick, ranch house. It didn't have any furniture because our furniture was somewhere in transit. Slept on the floor on mattresses. My grandparents were there, but for some reason we didn't live with them. My parents thought we were going to stay and my dad was looking for a job around there, and that didn't work out. So that was a stressful time. And then we got to West Virginia, and that was really bizarre because we moved from really this transient lifestyle with other transients, being around a lot of other military families, to being in Parkersburg, West Virginia, which was very rooted. West Virginia is a very rooted place.         EF: Yes.
KR: It doesn't have a lot of transience. More so now than then, but for the first time I went to school that sat next to their cousin in class. I had seen my cousins twice. So it was very different. People had Sunday dinner with their grandparents. So that was being a fish out of water. Yeah.        EF: You moved to Parkersville when you were twelve.        KR: Parkersburg.        EF: Parkersburg. You were there for junior high and high school.
KR: And in high school, yeah. My parents are still there in the same house. So that has become home base, and that's where we always go home to. Yeah, they bought a house and it's almost like they tried to replicate the military setting. So they bought a house that actually looked like the house we had lived in on the military base in New Jersey. It was in a subdivision outside of town. Cut off from everything. You couldn&#8217;t get anywhere but by car. It was very different for us. We used to have a lot of autonomy and mobility. I could walk to junior high, so I used to walk down this two-lane road and across this busy road. It was not set up for walking, but we walked, the kids from that neighborhood. I did walk to school then. Then high school, I rode with my dad. He drove. Every morning he drove his pick-up truck and a bunch of neighborhood kids would pile in the truck and we'd all ride to school with my dad.         EF: Well let me back up. I want to return to those teenage years in West Virginia. But before then, I wanted to rewind a little bit and ask if you could explain your relationship a bit more with your mother and your father.         KR: Yeah, so. That's a good question. My mother is Southern, so she was a displaced Southerner. Which I know people talk about now, but I didn't know what that was at the time.        EF: From Tennessee.         KR: From, well, yes from Tennessee. Her dad was a civil engineer so they moved around a bit. They had a little transience, but they moved around the South. She was born in Little Rock, lived in Mountain Home, and then moved to Winchester, which is right outside of Sewanee. He would work on these dam projects, TVA. She was kind of in exile, right? It's almost like being raised by an immigrant. Right? There's a lot of code switching that goes on. But in the military that was different because there were other Southerners, of course, to encounter. And military families have a very consistent way of raising their children, a lot of them. So maybe because I was a kid, it wasn't as glaring, but to be in this very civilian, very different environment in West Virginia and realize--I know I'm jumping forward again--but that was what threw into relief my relationship with my parents. We had to do a lot of code switching because in the house there were a lot of rules and codes and manners and all this other stuff that we were expected to toe the line. Outside of that, there was a very different way of being. I'd notice my friend's families were much looser. My friends wanted to call my mom by her first name, which was a big no-no.         EF: Right.        KR: So little things like that. But my relationship to my parents always felt good to me, but I only realized later that it was probably more, I'd say, old-fashioned or formal. I don't know, it's not formal. It was, I don't know how to describe it. We were close. We did lots of stuff as a family together and we still are. They&#8217;re aging so they're not as mobile as they once were, but yeah, we did a lot of vacationing together and things like that.         EF: And what was your father's position in the military?        KR: He was in the Air Force but he wasn't a pilot. He was in transportation, so he was over cargo and stuff like that. The stuff that came and went.        EF: And he was an officer?        KR: He was an officer. He had gone to the University of the South and got his undergraduate there and when I was born in Knoxville, he was at UT getting his masters in transportation, which I don't know if you can still do that. But the military sent him back to school to do that. So that was his area. I never really oversaw the details of it.        EF: I understand. Well let's go back to West Virginia.        KR: Yeah.        EF: And if you could, you mentioned a little bit about how different it was in school there. But if you could elaborate and tell me a little bit more about junior high and high school in Parkersburg?        KR: Gosh, does anybody really like to talk about junior high? That was such a bust.        EF: That's true.         KR: Those were some tough years because I was a newcomer and I was an adolescent, but I made some good friends. Some people I'm still in touch with on Facebook. Yeah, so junior high was, I don't know, it was what it was. I played a few sports, made some friends with people that were local. Again, things were so different spatially. They were so spread out. Kids lived really all different places.        EF: Sure.        KR: And we couldn't drive yet, although we did have a friend who used to steal his dad's van when we were fourteen. His dad worked nights. So he slept all day and we took the van and went down to the lake. There was a lake near our house. Why this was able to go on, I have no idea. They would pull into the driveway, pick me up, and we'd go run around. So we did our share of that. I went to the pool and stuff and hung out. High school, things picked up and they do for all kids because I got a job, I became a lifeguard and I would work at the city pool in the summers. I had some of my own spending money, and then I got my license and we started driving and made some good friends who came from other parts of town. It was a big feeder school. Yeah, we had some fun. I look back on that and as you grow and experience the world and meet other people and hear about what other people's experiences were like, I probably wasn't involved in very much. I played tennis at school. I didn't really get involved in school government, maybe one year or something. But it was mostly all about the friends. We did a lot of drinking and driving around and parking up gravel roads. There wasn't really that much to do. We went to the drive-in some. We had a drive-in still. Basketball games, those were big, and football games. Just kind of hanging out. Yeah. Nothing too spectacular, really, on that front. I remember those years fondly. I feel like there is this hiccup for junior high. Kind of forgettable.         EF: Not uncommon.        KR: I had this sense as while I was there that I really was moving on. I did not embed too much because I was interested in doing other stuff with my life, and I was always in the back of my mind that I was going to leave.        EF: I was going to ask, what was it like after moving to West Virginia and moving every few years, I guess up until that point, all of a sudden being rooted to one place? How did you respond to that?        KR: I think that it was odd. At the time I was really that aware of it, because you are really interested in the intricacies of your relationships at that age. So all of that was exciting enough to keep me occupied, but I definitely wanted to go when I graduated. I applied to the University of Mississippi. It was the only school I applied to. Got in and left and didn't look back.        EF: I want to ask about that, but before I do, could you also tell me about your relationship with your siblings? Your older sister and younger brother, I think?        KR: Yeah. I had a good relationship with them. My sister and I were really close. People thought we were twins when we were little because I was tall and she was a little bit short. We look a lot a like. My grandmother would send us matching outfits, so people thought we were twins and we were very close. My brother is three years younger than me and six years younger than her, so he was a lot younger than she was. I remember us as very close particularly in the Texas years when we were all children together. Now, when we moved to New Jersey, she became a teenager and he and I were more tumbling around with the same kids and she was off being a teenager. And then she and I came back together as I became a teenager and she went off to college in Ohio. So she wasn't that far away and would come home. He and I, we didn't really run around together because I guess he was enough younger that we didn't have the same friends at all.        EF: Sure, three years.         KR: Yeah, three years was a big difference then. He has stayed in West Virginia. Still lives in West Virginia in the same town and she now lives in Wisconsin. We've all stayed scattered. Out into the world. He did not leave. He went to college in West Virginia and then moved back to Parkersburg, so he stayed there, but she and I moved on and never went back. I did go back, actually, after I went into the Peace Corps after I was in college. I did go back. Not to Parkersburg, but to a small community just east of Parkersburg in Ritchie County. A rural county there. I got a job there out of the Peace Corps.         EF: Great.        KR: So I went back to West Virginia for a little while.         EF: Well, I would like to know what brought you to the University of Mississippi for college?        KR: Well, a lot of people ask me that question, and it's a good question because I could have gone to [West Virginia University] and it would have probably been easier and cheaper and who knows. But I wanted to go away and my mom's mom's family is from Mississippi, so there was family in the area. My uncle, my great uncle lives in Memphis and we went down to see him one Easter, and he said, "Why don't we ride on down to Ole Miss and take a look at it?" I said, "Okay." You know, it's springtime. Ole Miss in the spring, I don't know if you've ever been there, but it was quite seductive. So I went ahead and applied and got in and went. They had a good English department. I was an English major. That was another kind of culture shock because I did the whole sorority thing. "Well, you're going down there, you need to do what everybody else does so that you'll fit in." So I did. It lasted about a year and a half and got out of that scene. But that was, that was quite an experience. Very strange.        EF: You say it was strange. In what way?        KR: Well, first of all, going through rush at Ole Miss was weird.        EF: Yeah. Sure.         KR: And most of those girls were Southern and from Mississippi, and if they weren't from Mississippi they were from somewhere in the South.        EF: Right.        KR: I didn't really think of myself as a Southerner in that regard.        EF: Yeah. Sure.        KR: So there was that. There were a lot of codes of conduct that I was trying to figure out and get a handle on. A lot of them had been to private schools.        EF: Right.        KR: So they had this way of talking about their worlds that was so different because they had had such different experiences. They had lived very segregated lives, too, you know, racially. They were all white. So, I remember having a conversation with a girl form--where was she from--somewhere in Mississippi. Maybe it was Tennessee. Trying to find common ground, we had both been lifeguards. I said, "Oh gosh. Yeah, I was a lifeguard too." I was trying to commiserate with her. The city pool that I worked at was this big public pool that had parents that would drop their kids off all day, and you basically would have to babysit them. She looked at me and she said, "Oh, I didn't lifeguard at a public pool." Well, you were a lifeguard but what else is there? So I was not in a country club world, a club world. I didn't know about that stuff. Also, again, in the military you're not part of that world either.        EF: Yeah. Sure.        KR: It's not as though that didn't exist in places, I just didn't have access to it. So that was all new. So I did the sorority thing for a while and it was silly. I didn't really identify with it. Going to meetings and going to parties. What did they call them, swaps. At Ole Miss they're called swaps. On Thursday nights, they would swap. A sorority would swap with a fraternity and have a like a dedicated party between them. It was drinking, partying mess. After a while I got out of that and did my own thing, and I really started enjoying Oxford and what all that had to offer, and made some great friends and ended up having a good experience. But it was after getting out of that world.         EF: What was Oxford like?        KR: Oxford was great. Actually I overlapped with Bill Ferris there.        EF: Oh really?        KR: Yeah, we were there at the same time. I didn't know him, but we've talked about that since. Oxford in the mid to late 1980s. It was not a retirement community yet and didn't have all those--I haven't been there in ten years, but I have heard that it has really changed, and there has been a lot of development and keyhole neighborhoods and stuff. Commercial strips. But it didn't have much of that at the time. So really, it was an interesting town. In some ways it felt familiar. It was walkable. I always lived close to town. I walked and biked everywhere and there was that square, so there was a hub of activity. There were some cool bars that we liked to go to. Heard a lot of good music and the Hoka Theatre was still there, this crazy movie theatre slash coffee house. Kind of ahead of its time. So it was a really fun place to be for me at that time.         EF: And what was the English department like?        KR: The English department was great. Actually, the writer's scene was really good in Oxford. Willie Morris was the writer in residence at the time and Barry Hannah was there too. I didn't take a class with Willie, but I was friends with Willie. He used to hang out at the same bar that I used to hang out, and he held this writers series where he would invite all of his buddies, like William Styron and Paul Matheson.         EF: Wow, yeah.        KR: People would come and they would be in a room in the library at Ole Miss, which was small at the time, and they would give a reading and we would all go out and there would be drinks afterwards. I loved it.
EF: Yeah, I'm sure.        KR: It was great. I took a class with Barry Hannah and that was fun. So I felt like there was a lot going on. There were readings and there was Square Books, [which] is a famous bookstore now, but it was small at the time. I remember Richard Howorth, talking to him. How many years ago was that? Thirty years ago. He had this small bookstore up these stairs overlooking the square, and I remember stumbling in there. I was nineteen, twenty. So I was a green person but so curious and then he expanded that. I think he expanded before I left and opened this beautiful bookstore on the corner of the square, and it's two stories and it has this big veranda, at least last time I was there it did. And you could buy coffee. It was so neat. So that was all a part of it. He would invite people in. Ellen Gilchrist, people and writers. Alice Walker would come and read. So for a kid like me, who really deep down that's what I liked and was starting to find my path, it was a great place to be.         EF: And what made you want to be an English major?        KR: I don't know. Looking back on all of that, I don't think I knew what else to do. I certainly didn't have any encouragement in the sciences. There wasn't a big push for much of anything except that my parents expected us to go to college. Nobody pushed anything in particular. We enjoyed reading. We were good readers. Kind of upper level English classes in high school and stuff like that, so I gravitated towards that. Looking back on that I wish I had been guided towards anthropology earlier on, but that's probably what I would have done and gotten on with it. But I didn't really even know about stuff like that. I made my way to that. I doubled majored in English and art history, so through art history I got some archeology classes and stuff like that, but English was a good fit then. Yeah.        EF: So after graduation, you did the Peace Corps?        KR: I did. There was a year between graduating from Ole Miss and joining the Peace Corps. In that interim, I got a job at Virginia Tech. I actually went back to Blacksburg and worked in their research division doing--I wrote about--I was an information officer. Do you know what those are? People that write about the research at the university.         EF: I see. Yeah.        KR: Press releases and stuff like that.        EF: Sure.        KR: Kind of writing about innovative things that faculty were doing. So I got that job, and it was a short-term contract because they were looking for somebody, a career person, to take that job. Somebody had left. It was a good opportunity, actually. I was twenty-two, twenty-three. Walked in there and was able to get a lot of good writing experience at that job, and ended up doing a little freelance writing for the Roanoke Times, which was fun. All of that I was doing while I was waiting for my Peace Corps application to get processed and figure out where I was going to go. I got assigned to Cameroon.         EF: Yeah. Did you pick it or--you said assigned.        KR: I said I'd like to go to Africa, and so that was a pretty big swath and so that's where I ended up.        EF: Well, tell me about Cameroon and the time you spent there.         KR: Yeah, that was great. That was a huge, formative experience. I had studied high school French and college French, so I had French as a second language. Didn't really speak it. Cameroon is a Francophone country, so I was in the Francophone region so I got to learn French pretty fluently. I taught for the first time. I taught English in this government high school and lived in a civil servant issued house by myself. Up there, I lived in northern Cameroon near the border with Chad. So the sub-Saharan region. It was very dry and sandy. It was like an exploding experience, learning this language and all these cultural experiences and teaching, being a teacher for the first time, meeting all these kinds of different people -- both Peace Corps volunteers, who some of whom have become lifetime friends, as well as Cameroonians also some of whom are lifelong friends -- and everything in between. Dutch linguists coming through and missionaries. It was a really interesting time. At the same time, it was also a very quiet experience because it was off the beaten path.         EF: Sure.        KR: We had really simple stuff to do.        EF: Right.        KR: That wasn't the stimulating--it wasn't the setting so much, the infrastructure so much but the ideas and things to think about. It was a great experience. I think I actually met my first anthropologist there.         EF: Oh really?        KR: When I think back on that time, that was probably the first little seed that was planted about ethnography and that kind of research. She was working on her dissertation and was living in a Fulani village and studying women's culture and the layout of people's compounds. I was like, "Oh you can do that? That's really cool." So that was probably a little seed that was planted at that time and didn't end up doing any of that for a long time.        EF: Well, that's related to the next question I wanted to ask. How did Cameroon shape what came next in your life?        KR: Yeah, well, I ended up going back to West Virginia. Why did I do that? I don't even remember now why I did that. I went back to West Virginia. At the time, the Peace Corps had this thing called the Hotline. This was also before the Internet. It was a paper newsletter that you would get mailed that had jobs. You would hear--so they said, who knows if that was actually the case--but they said that Peace Corps volunteers had preferential access to these jobs. So in other words, you knew about them before other people. Sort of a way of helping you get reestablished. And in one of the Hotlines, there was this job advertised in Ritchie County, West Virginia, which I knew was right next door to my county, and it was for a community development organization that was starting. So I applied to it at the same time I applied for a reporting job at the newspaper in Parkersburg. I didn't have anywhere else to go. I mean, other people were more sophisticated. They applied to law school from the Peace Corps or grad school. I don't know why I didn't have those sights, but I didn't. Anyway, I went back home and I applied for this job with the newspaper and I applied for this job with the community development organization. I got the newspaper job at the same time they offered me the jobs on the same day. I took the community development job. So I moved to Ritchie County and directed this organization called the Family Resource Network, and it was an effort on the part of Gaston Caperton, who was the governor at the time, to try and consolidate social services. Things were very fragmented and there were a lot of needs that were falling through the cracks. So these family resource networks were supposed to be a clearinghouse, and we were supposed to figure out local needs. What were the most pressing local needs, and what were the services that were available to people, and how could we make that a smoother process? I don't know. I think that the Family Resource Network might even still be there. But it has taken on different iterations. So anyway, I directed that. It involved a lot of--I had two staff members and me, and it involved a lot of grant writing on my part, that's mostly what I did. And we ran some community--we had a lot of community meetings to try and figure out what were the most pressing needs. There was no daycare in the entire county. They wanted to do a health center in the school so that kids could have access to healthcare and stuff like that. So we worked on those for a couple of years working on that. And I decided to leave. I left on my own accord. My contract wasn't up. I was just ready to go. I moved to Louisiana. Mostly because I re-established a relationship with somebody I had dated in college and that's where he was. I moved down there to be closer to him and in the process applied to graduate school at what was then University of Southwestern Louisiana. It is now the University of Louisiana.         EF: At Lafayette?        KR: At Lafayette. Yeah.        EF: Okay.        KR: So I got into the English department there, and that's where I discovered folklore because they had a minor in folklore. Marsha Godeaux was there and [I] took classes with her. I was going to do creative writing and I didn't. I can't remember why I didn't, but I joined the broader masters in English program and took these folklore classes and loved it. I went ahead and got the degree, the masters degree in English with a concentration in folklore, and then went on to do contract folklore work down there [be]cause there was a big critical mass of folklorist down there. And cultural tourism is such a big deal and there were jobs for folklorists. The division of arts in Louisiana had a folklorist. Nada Owens was the folklorist for the state. They had a state folklorist. She was a great mentor to all of us young folklorists. She would help us get RFPs or make sure that we got the requests for the proposals and help us walk through how to apply for grant funding, and was really good at getting funding from the NEA and the humanities council. So there was work to be had. There was contract work to be had, and I did some of that. At the same time it was hard to make a living. I was patching together a lot of part time jobs to make ends meet. I had this background from the Peace Corps of teaching English, ESL, so there was a program at U of L in ESL, so I taught a little bit in that and they asked me if I wanted to coordinate that program. So I became their fulltime TSOL person in the modern languages department.        EF: Right there on campus?        KR: Right there on campus. So it was a fulltime position. I only had a master&#8217;s degree, but I started working towards a PhD, taking graduate classes. I took a Creole class, it was great. Creole language class. It was the only one I had ever been taught. Louisiana Creole. I took a class with Barry Ancelet, Cajun culture. Taking one class at a time thinking that I would probably get a PhD down there. And then I ended up going--why did I do that? I applied for a Fulbright.         EF: Yes.        KR: I guess I got itchy feet. I saw this Fulbright program that was for junior lecturers, or something like that. It was for people doing what I was doing, instructors at a university working on a PhD. I don't even know if they still have that program, so I thought I'd apply for that. I applied to one in Mexico and one in Morocco, and I got the Morocco one and I went. I kept a placeholder in my job. Somebody else took my job at UL for a while, and I lived in Morocco for a year and taught in an English department there. It was at that point when I realized, I really don't want to be teaching English anymore. I don't want to be doing this. I want to be an ethnographer. That's what I want to do. I spent all my waking hours learning Arabic and talking to people and had all these project ideas and was gathering stuff, stories, and perspectives from people. So I applied to the PhD program at UL, which had a full ride scholarship, like a fellowship that I applied for, and I also applied to IU [Indiana University] because I knew Patricia Sawin was helpful in that. She's on the faculty here in American Studies, but she was also at UL at the time as a professor of folklore. I remember calling, "I'm about to call her from Morocco." Maybe I emailed her, and I said, "I'm applying to PhD school and I'm applying to UL." She was still there at the time.        EF: Yeah.        KR: "And I'm applying. I'm wondering if I should apply to IU." She wrote me back and goes, "Oh yeah. You should apply to IU." So I did and I got in at both places. UL offered me a full ride, like a fellowship. I wouldn't have had to taken any debt over and IU didn't offer me jack, but I got in.         EF: Right.        KR: I took the leap. From Morocco, I went to Louisiana, packed up my car and moved to Bloomington. Took six years to get a PhD and a ton of debt [laughs].         EF: For sure. I can imagine.        KR: What the heck.        EF: Wow. Well, there are a few questions from that story that I want to get a little more information about. First, can you tell me a little bit more about Morocco?         KR: Yeah. That was interesting.        EF: Yeah. Were you there for one year?        KR: I was there for a year, yeah.        EF: And what impact did that have?        KR: That had this kind of impact. I had done some world traveling after the Peace Corps while I lived in Louisiana for five years. I went to Guatemala one summer and studied Spanish and traveled around a little bit, and went to Thailand for a visit and maybe did Europe one time. Of course, I had been in the Peace Corp for two years. So I had these international experiences that I always enjoyed and everything. By the time I got to Morocco, I was thirty-two. I remember I got off the plane and I got to my apartment. I got off an airplane, landed in this country I had never seen before, and got on the train and rode to Mohammedia, which is the town I was going to live in.        EF: Okay.        KR: I got off the train and somebody had found me an apartment on a concrete block, like a Soviet looking block.         EF: Right.        KR: Apartment complex. I walked in there and threw my stuff on the bed and I thought, &#8220;Why in the hell did I do this.&#8221; I'd been there and done it. I guess that was the point in telling you about the other international experiences, I felt like, &#8220;This is going to be exhausting.&#8221; And it was. So by that time in my life I wanted to be focusing and getting on with it. I had started to feel the push to do that. Kind of a late bloomer. I thought, "Man, I have ten more months of this. Alright." So I taught at the school and that was weird. Nobody understood my accent and I was allowed to speak in English because it was an English department and that's why they wanted me there. But, they couldn't understand me and it was a very different culture. I mean, I had been to Africa before, but I hadn't been to North Africa. They just sat there and stared at me, my students. I had never really had that experience before. It got better. I stuck it out and it got better. And I learned Arabic and that busted open the whole world around me.         EF: Right.        KR: And then the teaching was a way to make money. Go teach and then spend every waking hour with my Moroccan neighbors who were mostly housewives who didn't speak English or French.         EF: Right. Arabic only.        KR: So I forced myself to visit people. That was my goal, was to learn the language. So I would come home from teaching and I would have lunch and have siesta and go visiting. I would knock on their doors and I would sit down. They were so generous with me and so hospitable, and they would make tea and they would talk torturously, to me, in Arabic. I would listen. I studied. I had a tutor and then I started being able to talk to them and communicate with them. I loved it. Just loved it. Just loved them to death. Loved every minute I spent with them and everything that they taught me and everything that I learned from them was so valuable. I made friends with the gardener at my university and he invited me home, and it turns out he lived in a shantytown, which was this squatter settlement. Squatter, they'd been there for two generations. So I spent a lot of time there learning about their situation and their lives. I went to weddings. Moroccan weddings are like three days long.        EF: Wow.        KR: They're a big deal. I did stuff like that. I felt like I had thrown myself onto the tide of whatever would come my way. It was great. It was a great place to be. It was funny, towards the end of my time there, maybe the last four months I was there, one of my colleagues at the university said, "You've really changed! You almost seem Moroccan.&#8221; I think what he meant was that I had relaxed. I had figured, a little bit, things out. I was having more fun. When I first got there I was like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know if I can do this." But yeah, it was good. I think when I applied to IU, in my narrative I said I was going to do Berber architecture, which I didn't do. But that was the topic. My research topic was Morocco. Almost the entire way through. I went back to study Arabic every summer with these FLAS [Foreign Language and Area Studies] Grants from the federal government. So that paid for my education, in part. I went back to Tangier, I went back to Fes. I studied Arabic and lived there and had this research agenda on these shantytowns. Actually, I wanted to talk about inclusion/exclusion in the North African city, basically. So I learned a lot about the city, the history of urban development in North Africa and the Arab world. It was really interesting. And then was reading up on squatter communities around the world.        EF: Right.        KR: And I put together a proposal and applied for a Fulbright, got the Fulbright. Got two Fulbrights to do that dissertation research, and then I didn't want to do it. It was like slamming the brakes on. That makes it sound like it came out of the blue, but all the while I was doing it, I was losing steam. It was too much. It was two feet in two continents.        EF: Right.        KR: And it was too much. Again, just as I had that inkling when I threw my bags down in my apartment in Morocco and I was like, "I shouldn't. But now I'm here and I've got to be here." I was starting to feel through my thirties that I wanted something more. I wanted a partner and I wanted a family. Now, now I'm an international scholar. Great! And I'm all alone and it didn't feel that fun. I turned down those Fulbrights and went back to West Virginia and did a research topic there that I had been wanting to do, actually. I wanted to write a little article about these cellar houses, these little food storage buildings. And that turned into my dissertation. So I didn't lose too much time. I lost maybe a year. And then in 2005, December of 2005, this job here was advertised. A job in the American Studies--actually, it was not in the American Studies department. It was with the Folklore curriculum. It used to be a curriculum and then all of the faculty had lines in whatever department. So Patricia [Sawin] and Glenn [Hinson] were in Anthropology and Bill [Ferris] was in History. I think Marcie [Cohen Ferris] was the first Folklore hire, actually in American Studies. And American Studies was a curriculum. Anyway, all of that stuff was separate, but the Folklore curriculum advertised a job for a folklorist who did material culture, built environment, spatial things, blah blah blah. It had my name written all over it and I applied for it and I got an interview. So I came down for the interview. And I still wasn't done with my dissertation and I was offered the job that summer. I still wasn't done. I took it and we came. By that time I was married and I finished writing that fall. It was really harrowing. I'm jumping ahead, probably.        EF: That's okay.        KR: That was the fast track to the future. Welcome to the future.        EF: Well, I do have a few more questions back then. This might bring you back to Louisiana. But what drew you to folklore specifically?        KR: I liked, because I had spent all this time studying literature and really didn't mind all of that, it didn't resonate with me as much. I didn't know that it didn't resonate with me until I took Marsha's class on folklore in literature. So it was a folklore and literature class. We read Ernest Gaines and we read--I remember him mostly. We read other people, but I remember reading him and we talked all about the culture and we talked about foodways because he describes food in such detail, in such resonance. We talked about the houses that people lived in and I realized, in my mind it clicked with me. Those were the things that were interesting to me. It wasn't just the books, it wasn't just literature for itself, it was really the context. I tribute this to my military upbringing, being able to travel so much and being forced to travel so much and observing. Constantly observing and trying to figure out, military kids are good at that, trying to figure out what's expected of them. What's the culture and how do I need to code switch? What do I need to do to fit in? I'll figure it out.         EF: Right.        KR: So that, maybe that internal system identified with that way of looking at literature and ultimately studying cultural phenomena.         EF: Well, thanks for the explanation. I want to really go back in time now and up from childhood on through, I didn't want to interrupt since you were on a roll there. You were telling me about so much, but if you could go back and tell me about what religious background you grew up with in your family and how that evolved overtime.        KR: Yeah, well, I was raised Episcopalian. We went to Episcopal churches wherever we were, I think. As far as I can remember back, which would be Virginia, when I was three, four, and five. We went to an Episcopal church there. We went to one in Texas, we went to one in New Jersey, and we went to one in West Virginia. I don't know what they did in Japan and Hawaii. I think they might have gone to non-denominational military chapels.         EF: Oh yeah. Sure.        KR: Yeah, so there are those but I don't remember those. So I was raised Episcopalian. We went to church every Sunday and I went to Sunday school, and I'm going to say, and I might be wrong, but that was the extent of it for me. It did not play--when I think back and it may have been different at the time--but when I think back it didn't play a huge roll in my life. I think partly it is because the relationships in those settings, those church settings, were not proxemics, because as people who are military people who are living on military bases, seeking out a theology, a theological connection, an ideological connection in some way, you lift yourself up out of your physical environment, and you go to church with other people who share a theological perspective. So there was no contact with those people other than on Sunday mornings. I didn't see them any other time of the week. So I didn't really build relationships with people at church. I never did. My parents might tell you a different story about that. They might have felt more connected and we may have had more to do with those people than I remember. I don't remember that. Even in West Virginia, where they still are and still attend the church that I attended as an adolescent and as a teenager, I didn't feel warmly connected at all. Again, we would drive up out of our South Parkersburg neighborhood, driving to church, it was a fifteen minute drive, we'd get there go to church with these folks. A couple of them went to school with me on the south side of town. Other than that they all went to different schools, they lived in different parts of town and I never saw them. So I didn't feel connected. I really didn't feel connected.         EF: As you became an adult, went to college, lived in Cameroon, came back, Louisiana, all around, did you seek out religion on your own?        KR: I did. I did seek out religion on my own, and I mostly sought out the Episcopal church. So I went to church in Oxford at the little whatever it is there, St. Peter or whatever, this old gothic-y one. They all are. Gothic looking church. Went to church there, and for me, I liked a lot of the intellectual aspect of the Episcopal church. I liked the sermon and there would be intellectual Bible studies and stuff like that, so it was like going to class. I did that, participated in that. I don't carry anybody with me from that time, though. I'm not in touch with any of the priest or any of the fellow congregants. That's not a part of my life. I did the same thing on and off. In Louisiana I went to an Episcopal church, not constantly, but on and off. St. Barnibus. In Bloomington, I was actually married in the Episcopal church in Bloomington. My favorite worship experience, though, happened in Bloomington and it was with Mennonites. One person I worked with, she was Mennonite, and she invited me to their worship service, which was on a Sunday evening, or maybe a Saturday evening, and it was in people's home because there was no Mennonite church in Bloomington. There was no structure to go to. These were mostly young Mennonites but there were a couple of older ones, too, that would meet at each other's houses and I guess they had a passage. We read a bible passage and talk about it. We'd share some food. Again, they were pretty intellectual and progressive and talked critically about what we were reading and I loved that. I think it had to do with two things. I think it had to proxemics, those were people in my life that I saw and had relationships with that went beyond the contained experience, and it was stripped bare. It was stripped of a lot of ritual and a lot of iconography. I feel like looking back, the Episcopal experience was very focused on that kind of ritual and formality. People really like it. I liked it too, at some juncture, but it started to become the point and a lot of people, there were a lot of converts in the Episcopal denominations that I went to, that had converted from being Baptist or Methodist or whatever who were enamored with the incense and all that stuff, and I thought that was empty to me. I got tired of it.
EF: Well, on a related note, what did you believe about God growing up, and how has that evolved at Indiana going towards--?        KR: Not much about God, really. God was a man and God was somebody--. I remember being ten or eleven and trying to pray to God. I was probably in New Jersey and I was probably scared to death about this transition my family was about to have, and seeing God like a gray haired man in robes, right? What else are you going to see? Envisioning giving him a hug or something. How do you get close to God? I don't know. Any kind of God. My parents weren't particularly--. I always kind of longed for a fundamentalist experience, especially in West Virginia where I would go to Baptist churches with my friends and stuff like where there was black and white.         EF: Yeah.        KR: Life is short and hell is long, that kind of message. We didn't get that one at all and I didn't get it at home, really, either. It was very, very--. The reasons we did things weren't because of Christianity. There was not a Christian message behind our values, even though they may have been informed by Christian tenants. There wasn't a lot of Christian talk at home.        EF: If not there, where were your family values rooted? Was it more political?        KR: Definitely wasn't political, no. My parents are conservative. They would vote Republican. But there wasn&#8217;t a lot of political talk at home. It was about behaving right. That's why I think it's kind of this combination of Southern and military. When my friends came over, you make eye contact and you say hello. And then, you knew not to interrupt me and we're polite and kind to others, but it was really focused on social behavior.        EF: Can you tell me a little more about the Mennonite church and how you became really involved there in Indiana, and then coming to Chapel Hill?        KR: Yeah, well, I wasn't really involved in Indiana. I worshiped with them a few times and it really resonated with me.
EF: I see. Sure.         KR: And it was towards the end of my time in Indiana. So it was when I came here that, actually, it was one of my students in a class at UNC. It was a material culture class, he wrote his paper on the space where we worshipped, where the Mennonites worshiped.        EF: Right.        KR: The Quaker space, because they rented that space for a while.         EF: Just off campus, I'm sure.        KR: Just down Raleigh Road. I remember that's how I learned about it. He said, "I'm going to do this congregation." I think he was a religious studies major, so he was interested in how that Quaker house was transformed by the Mennonites in the evening. Those are really great papers. A great student. But that's how I learned there are Mennonites here. When we were looking around, we tried the Episcopal church again, and I tried a couple other churches here and I couldn't relate. I tried this. I was pregnant with my daughter, it was about six and a half years ago, I went to a service in the summertime and sat in the Quaker space, which part of it was Quaker not attributable to Mennonites. So it was in the round and there was no hierarchy and there was a comment time. Someone gave a sermon, it wasn't even a preacher. It was very lay run. I don't know if all Mennonite churches are like that, but this one is like that. So someone gave a sermon and afterwards, it was this comment period where people said what they heard, and it wasn't a discussion so it wasn't polemic, it didn't get polemic, it was just, "This is what I heard." It was a comment period and people offered their petitions for prayers, and there was somebody standing at the front, as much as there was a front. People were sitting in a horseshoe and offered their--. So that person heard their petitions and wrote them down and offered a prayer for everybody&#8217;s concerns. Everybody that felt like sharing. And I really liked that. I felt like that is kind of the point. So I started going and I dragged my spouse into that, David. I say dragged because he doesn't really care that much about church. It has not been a priority for him. He came and we've been going there ever since, so that was six and a half years ago, almost seven years ago. I really liked the small congregation. I liked the fact that it was not hierarchical. I grew up in a very hierarchical world. There is somebody in charge and you need to figure out how to talk to that person, how to ask for what you need, and how to not step on toes. That was my upbringing. That was my church experience too. There was a priest up there and there were these other people dressed in ritually specific garb, and then we talk here and don't talk there and all this other stuff. So there is definitely a program at the Mennonite church, the one that we go to. There's a prayer, there's a response. So it's familiar enough, but it was very participatory and I liked that.        EF: Right. How did, if it did, how did your religious beliefs and experience in the Mennonite church inform your own academic research as you're here at Chapel Hill and you're working on material culture? Did it have a relationship or not?        KR: I don't think so. I don't know. I never thought about that. I don't know.         EF: Fair enough.         KR: I don't know if it did, really.        EF: Okay.        KR: I have always worked, within my research, I have always worked with people of faith. People that I work with tend to be--that's not true. I did a lot of interviews with a homesteading group in West Virginia who wouldn't probably identify as people of traditional type faith. But other than that, I've always worked with people who have a faith tradition. Muslim or Christian. So I'm very used to listening to people talk about God and to talk about blessings and to attribute their motives to God, so I'm very used to accepting that as a fact. A social fact or whatever you call it. So the religion, some academics are real wigged out by religion and the other worlds and the metaphysical, and I'm just not. I never have been. I was already, before I came to this church, I was already that kind of a researcher. I was always working with people who--. Maybe it's not working with people who anything. I feel like I have been open to peoples' experiences. I have always been a phenomenologist. Do you know what that is?         EF: I think I've heard the term.        KR: It's the study of experience, really. You study an experience and you're acknowledging people's experiences as data. It's not, "I'm going to listen to your experience, and then I'm going to really explain it a way or I'm going to compare it against the facts," but the experience is the fact. So that's always been my perspective. So I don't really differentiate between a religious experience and a metaphysical experience and an actual one.        EF: Right. Do you think that those are ideals that are really rooted in folklore and the study of folklore?        KR: They might be. Yeah. They might be.        EF: Can you tell me a little bit about your current research and your current work at UNC?        KR: Well, my current work, I had a fairly big watershed experience about two years ago. I resigned from my tenure track job, so I no longer have my tenure line in the American Studies department, because a lot of things happened to me between the ages of thirty-seven, which is when I got married, I got married very late, and then I resigned when I was forty-five. So between the ages of thirty-seven and forty-five, I got married, I had a series of miscarriages, which were very traumatic, I finished a PhD, I got a tenure track job, and then I had two children. For years and years and years, I had been by myself having these experiences filtered through my own self, and now suddenly my life, enriched, I mean lots of good things, and it was very compressed into a very compressed time period. And so, I had one child and then twenty months later I had another child. You can attest to this. You don't know how you're going to feel until you have children. You have no idea what kind of parent you're going to be, how you're going to raise them or what, and I realized as I [was] trekking along that I wasn't going to be able to balance the two. I wasn't going to be able to strike the balance that I wanted. I really wanted to spend a lot of time with my kids. So I made the choice to pull away from the tenure track because it was very demanding. I loved that job, but it was very demanding and it was going to demand a lot of creative energy, which is what I try to give to my family. So I resigned from that job, and I now am a visiting lecturer. So I teach one class a semester, which has been a great balance. But that was a huge shift.         EF: Yeah, sure.        KR: A big change. So now, I'm teaching, as my husband says, "a la carte."         EF: That's a good one.        KR: And so I'm teaching classes that I have taught before. One is about housing. So I teach a class on the American house, which is fun.        EF: Right.        KR: And then I teach one about landscapes. So you've heard all the story about my life, so it's probably no surprise that I'm teaching those two classes. I tell my students a little about my life so that they can know how I came to those topics. The topic of home and situated-ness and what it says about you and how you feel where you are is very important to me, and so is the look of the land and what it communicates to us. So that's what those two classes are about in a nutshell. My research agenda has shifted to looking at--I live in a suburban neighborhood in Chapel Hill--so I'm interested in suburbia. So I'm developing a new course on suburbia for next year and am writing. I took on a larger research project. I'm not sure what form that is going to take in writing, but on suburban landscapes and the experience of suburban landscapes. That's as much as I really know about it. It's slow going because I'm home with my kids a lot.         EF: Absolutely. Could you tell me a little bit more about that, I guess, the physical and emotional demands of tenure track life while you're beginning a family and going through so much.        KR: Well, for me it was a hard balance to strike. I guess, because right off the bat I decided, my husband and I decided on, we didn't actually have a conversation about this, but we came to the idea that we wanted to be the primary caregivers for our children. And so we tag teamed and we had a fill in babysitter. So somebody came fifteen hours a week, let's say, and otherwise it was him and me. He had a job, a less stable job than I had, but he had a job and I had a job. His was a little bit flexible and of course I had flexible hours, but I did not have flexible expectations. So we managed to do that for quite a while, but it became harder and harder to do. And I wanted to be there. I felt like it was--. It is about quality, not about quantity. And I felt like it was about quantity time again, and I really wanted to be physically present and you can't do both. And I realized that, and the clincher was my daughter was hospitalized with Kawasaki disease in December of 2012, and she needed to be home for six weeks recuperating. So I took a leave of absence. I took family-medical leave so I could take care of her, and when I was on leave that I was heading that way anyway. So I had a lot of conversations with folks and I decided to resign, and I really wasn't sure what was going to come next. I'm still not sure what is coming next. Maybe this is it. It was demanding. Some people do it and do it beautifully. It was hard for me to strike that balance.         EF: Well that really brings me to the end of my questions.         KR: Alright.        EF: Is there anything else that you would like to say or talk about before I wrap it up?        KR: I don't think so. Thanks for all of your questions.        EF: You bet. Thanks for--.        KR: Your bent ear [laughs].        EF: Thanks for sharing so many personal stories. We'll go ahead and turn this off.
