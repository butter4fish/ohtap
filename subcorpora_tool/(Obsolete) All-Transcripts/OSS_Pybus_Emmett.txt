 Finchum Today is August 31, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University, and today I   m in Stillwater to speak with Emmett Pybus.  This is part of our O-STATE Stories, so thank you for having us today. Did  I say that correctly?  Pybus Yes. Glad to have you here.  Finchum Okay, thank you. Let   s start learning a little bit about you. When and where  were you born?  Pybus Okay. Well, I was born and raised in a little town called Fairport in New  York State near Rochester. It was one of the ports on the old Erie Canal, the  barge canal. I was within a block, we lived within a block of that canal. I  was born in January, on January 22, 1930, the height of the original  Depression.  Finchum In the dead of winter.  Pybus In the dead of winter, that   s right. (Laughs) My folks must   ve thought,    Oh  boy, here we go.    (Laughter) Anyway, my mother   s family were Hagadorns,  originally from Buffalo, New York. My father   s family, which was the  Pybus family but has Cody lineage   I think I figured out I   m about a  seventeenth cousin to    Buffalo Bill    Cody. (Laughs) I   m a member   we   re  listed in the Cody Association manuals. They have a list of all those  descendants and so forth from early Massachusetts on. Anyway, I lived and  was educated in Fairport through high school.  Finchum When did you graduate?  Pybus Oh, 1948.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Pybus Okay. My mother didn   t work outside the house. She was a homemaker.  Actually, her parents, my grandfather and grandmother, lived with us in  Fairport. My grandfather had worked for the railroad. He had been a railroad  fireman for the    Pennsy    Line  Pennsylvania Railroad  and the, let   s see,  Lackawanna   Erie-Lackawanna and Western Railroad, something like that.  Anyway,  it was  some of those railroads back then. He was injured, badly  injured, burned, in a roundhouse explosion, so he was retired and so forth.  Anyway, they lived with us. I lived with my grandparents and my parents in  Fairport.  My grandfather did various things, but he was mechanically inclined, which  I think came to me because I love mechanical things. My father, now, was a  stonemason, stonecutter. He was born in Stanley, New York, which is near  Canandaigua, one of the Finger Lakes in western New York, very  picturesque place. In fact, one of my sisters, I have two younger sisters, and  the older of the two, Sally and her family live in Watkins Glen, New York.  Anyway, Dad became a stonecutter. He put the dates and things on  monuments, on markers, cemetery markers, and did some statuary work.  You see sometimes little statues of lambs and angels, things like that. He did  that sort of thing. That was his work until he retired and died.  Finchum You graduated high school in    48.  Pybus  In  1948.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Pybus Well, yes. I was always interested in science. I received the Bausch   Lomb   Honorary  Science Award in high school for outstanding student in science.  That has continued. I mean, I continued that in my college education. My  mother   s family, the Hagadorns and some of the other relatives, came from  western Pennsylvania. There was a college down there, Waynesburg  College, south of Pittsburgh. My great-grandfather was one of the first  graduates from that school, so I had a connection. I went there. A lot of my  peers, a lot of my friends from high school went to the University of  Rochester, which is right there and handy. I would have, except that I had  that other connection to Waynesburg.  Anyway, I went to Waynesburg  and  graduated in 1952. I had a choice of  actually three majors: physics, math, and chemistry. I chose physics as a  major. That was really my favorite subject. Then, following that, I did a  summer internship at Aberdeen Proving Ground, after I graduated in    52.  Several of us, I think there were about five of us, went to Aberdeen as  interns that summer. That was a big program that the Army had, a very fine  program. I did a summer internship there and during   well, as you know, in  195 3 , the Korean War was on. I had joined in high school, my senior year  in high school, I had joined the Naval Reserve in Rochester, which entailed  a monthly training visit, like a weekend warrior here. Anyway, I continued  that at Waynesburg, but because of travel, I had to travel to Pittsburgh from  Waynesburg, which is about an hour and a half trip. I had just terminated  that kind of, that active duty just before the Korean War started. When that  started, I was in college and had a deferment to finish college.  Anyway, following my graduation and the summer internship at Aberdeen  Proving Ground (that was with the Ballistic Research Laboratories at  Aberdeen), following that, I did enlist full-time in the Navy. As a matter of  fact, the interesting thing, another friend of mine and I went down to  Washington. From Aberdeen, we went down to Washington D.C. as tourists  and walked around and so forth. One of us, I   ve forgotten who suggested,     Well, let   s see what the recruiters have to say to us.    We walked in a  couple different places, and we walked into the Navy recruiting office. Who  should be there but my old math teacher from college  (Laughs) Uh oh   Well, that did it right there. Anyway, I was sent to Officer Candidate School  in Rhode Island, OCS in Newport, Rhode Island, where I was anointed as a  new Navy ensign and so forth.  Then, following that, I was sent with a group of, volunteered and sent with a  group of fifty of us to the Naval Post-Graduate School at Monterey,  California, where they taught us for a year.  They  taught us meteorology,  which at that time was a big issue because with things going on in Korea,  the air support was from the Navy aircraft carriers, which, of course, needed  aerological officers. I mean, meteorology was a big thing there. Anyway,  that   s what we were destined for, but of course, before we graduated or just  shortly after, the Korean War wound down, came to an end and so forth.  Anyway, while at Monterey, I met my future wife. I met her at a great books  discussion group held in the basement of the Del Monte Hotel where the  post-graduate school was. Anyway, at the end of the year there in Monterey,  Florence and I got married. We spent our honeymoon in Hawaii stationed at  the Naval Air Station, Barbers Point Naval Air Station in Hawaii.  Finchum Pretty good deal.  Pybus Yeah, well, actually, it was fascinating because, well, we were forecasting  for the whole Pacific area north of the equator, essentially. The Navy ran an  air transport service similar to the Air Force MATS  Military Air Transport  Service . It was a Navy MATS, if you will. The Navy ran this transport  service, and we were forecasting primarily for those people, starting in  California, Alameda, California, for example, and to Hawaii, to Midway   Atoll  or Wake  Island , whichever, and then on to Yokosuka, Japan. We  were forecasting that Pacific area and down as far south as Canton Island on  the way to Australia. We had that whole Pacific area. That was also an  interesting time because we had stationed at Barbers Point, the AWACS  unit, which was the airborne warning, early warning system. We were  forecasting for those aircraft,  as well as meteorological aircraft , which  would take off from Hickam Airfield and go out to Midway, then go north  to Alaska, turn around, come back, and then back to Honolulu, to Hawaii.  We were forecasting for some of those flights also, which was, we were  doing a   I in particular. If you know anything about radar, radar signals get  bent depending on the atmospheric, their stratospheres, I mean, different  strata in the atmosphere. Those  radio signals  can get bent, depending on  what   s called the refractive index of the air. That   s very important because if  that signal gets bent, then what appears on the radar scope is not a straight  line to what you think you   re looking at. It may be something above or  below what you think you have. Anyway, I was forecasting. One of the  things I was doing was forecasting the refractive index layers of the  atmosphere there for some of these radar picket planes. Well, let   s see.  (Laughs)  Finchum Meteorology. Had you ever thought that that would be a part of your early  career?  Pybus No, but it was atmospheric physics, you know.  Finchum Related.  Pybus It   s all related. Yeah, that   s right. There   s a lot of physics to the atmosphere,  as I   ll tell you about later here with the tornadoes, of course. (Laughs)  That   s a lot of physics, too.  Finchum What was your wife   s maiden name?  Pybus Wooldridge. Actually, it was Ruth Florence Wooldridge.  Finchum Was she from California?  Pybus No, she was actually from Shawnee, Oklahoma.  Finchum Okay, that   s   .  Pybus Yeah, she had been born in Shawnee. They   d moved down to Brownwood,  Texas, for a while, and then moved back. Her parents became separated. Her  mother and she and some other sisters moved back to Oklahoma, but then  she graduated from high school. She was two years older than I. She was  born in 1928. Anyway, she had gone to live with a brother and his family in  California, and that   s where I met her.  Finchum Do you remember what book you discussed when you first met her?  Pybus It had to do something with Swiss neutrality because she   I have to tell you  that she was the aggressor in our relationship. (Laughs) I was very shy, you  know, and well, shy. Anyway, they were discussing something, and I had  spoken up and talked about something. I   ve forgotten details of that. It had  to do with the neutrality in Switzerland and so forth, in politics and all.  Afterwards, she came over to me, and she had a book. She was, at that time,  dating a much older man, a Swiss guy from the Army language school there  at Monterey.  Anyway, she came over and said,    Oh, I have this information. I have this  little book you might be interested in.    She gave me this book and all. Well,  that was it. (Laughter)  It was  all downhill from there. Eventually, well, it  was interesting because there were fifty of us brand new ensigns from  Rhode Island, just out of OCS, here at the school. I think there were  probably about forty-five of us who were not married at the time. Well, all  of a sudden, these California girls (laughs) had their pick of guys. I think  there were three marriages following our graduation from the post-graduate  school.  Finchum They turned their radar on high.  Pybus Yeah, that   s right. (Laughs) I made some good friendships there. Several of  those graduates we met later. One of them was with the hurricane hunters   U.S. Navy Weather Reconnaissance  in Miami, and they were lost. They  went out into a hurricane one time and never came back. That was a sad  thing. There   s another fellow who was with the hurricane hunters in Guam,  because there are typhoons, what they call typhoons, in the Pacific. He was  with that group. He came back through Hawaii. As a matter of fact, Hawaii  is a very interesting place because people from the east, you know, China  area and Japan, would have to come back through Honolulu on their way  back to the states or on their way out to those places. We got to see a lot of, I  got to see a lot of my friends there and saw our acquaintances that way.  Also, I didn   t realize it at the time, but it was very interesting. Some  airplanes came through. They were DC-4s, I think, and they had skis instead  of wheels. They were headed down to the Antarctic. (Laughs) Little did I  know that there was a message there for me, I guess. Anyway, it was kind  of, you know, we laughed, with skis in Hawaii, oh boy, (laughter) that   s  crazy. Anyway, I spent two years there. Our first child, our daughter, Nani,  was born. This was not a state  then . This was the territory of Hawaii. Nani  was born not in the states, but in the territory, for whatever that means.  Anyway, let me see. It was a very interesting time. Forecasting was very  interesting. It turns out   Barbers Point was located on the southwest corner  of the island Oahu. Well, about as far away from Honolulu, the main city, as  you could get. It turns out the reason for that was, of course, the Navy was  bringing in the special weapons into that area at that time. If there had been  an accident, of course, they wanted that as far away from population centers  as possible. That   s essentially what we were there for was for that.  It was very fascinating, very interesting time. Ah, let me see. Well, after we  debated, Florence and I debated, well, we didn   t really debate much. I had  not looked on the Navy as a career, and she was very set against that career.  Anyway, at the end of my three years of duty, I got out. I had worked at  Aberdeen Proving Ground earlier, as I said, in the internship program. I had  interviewed, set up interviews as we went across country. We were going  across to my parents in New York. On that trip across, I interviewed several  different places, and didn   t quite know what I wanted to do yet. I visited  Aberdeen, you know, some of the people I knew and so forth. They said,     Hey  We   ve got a very interesting time and projects coming up.    It was the  International   what was it? I remember the IQSY  International Years of  the Quiet Sun , but it was the International     Finchum Geophysic.  Pybus Geophysics, yeah.  Finchum International Geophysics     Pybus International program to coordinate many different aspects of meteorology  and geophysics and so forth at the same time. IGY, it   s called IGY,  International Geophysical Year. They were looking for people, and    Oh,  yes     Anyway, I went back to Aberdeen, and I   d had experience there and  so forth, so they hired me back in, same place where I   d worked as a  summer intern. That was extremely interesting. My particular area of  interest was in water vapor, high altitude water vapor studies. We flew  balloons with certain instruments on them. What I had there was called a  dew point hydrometer. A hydrometer is any instrument that measures  humidity. This was a mechanism that cooled a surface down until water  condensed, which told you at that temperature, and that is the dew point  temperature.  Anyway, you hook this instrument onto a balloon, fly it up into the  atmosphere, and you get a profile of how much water vapor there is at  different layers. Of course, very little was known then about the atmosphere.  This was before any satellites were flying, so we just didn   t know much  about that. Anyway, I was given this project to find out the high altitude  water vapor profiles at different latitudes. That took me from Thule,  Greenland, down to the Caribbean. We had three or four different places  where we flew balloons and that instrument to find out what the water vapor  profile looked like into the atmosphere. That, of course, entailed field trips  and so forth different places. Spent some time in the Caribbean, and there  was a radar ship, the  USAS  American Mariner, out of San Juan, Puerto  Rico, which was a tracking ship for the rockets being shot from Cape  Canaveral, tracking  missiles from the Cape .  We spent some time there, flew balloons from that ship, you know, and so  forth.  We  made several trips up to Thule, Greenland, but also we, during  this IGY, we had some rockets, doing rocket exploration at Churchill,  Canada, on the Hudson Bay. I spent, I don   t know, I was up there either  three or four times, something like that. The main purpose for my  information was that there was a rocket, another fellow in our department  there who was instrumenting a rocket to measure, again, water vapor and  other things, but that was not available  at low altitudes . That didn   t start  working until about twenty miles up into the atmosphere. They wanted some  information from the ground up to that altitude to overlap and also to kind of  calibrate the instrument on the rocket from there on up.  Finchum A balloon would go up that high?  Pybus Yeah. Oh yeah. Balloons go up that high. That was really the main purpose  of our being in that business and the purpose of my doing what I was doing.  We had that project going at Churchill, Canada, for a little more than a year.  They were flying rockets up there, and we were doing that.  Finchum Did you live there in Canada?  Pybus Well, we   d go up for a week or two at a time.  Finchum Go back and forth.  Pybus Yeah, not to live there. That was another fascinating place.  I  learned a lot  about the culture up there and so forth. That was in what was called the  Keewatin ook  District of Canada, northeastern district.  It was  very large,  probably about as large as the United States in area, but from Iceland and  west to well past the Hudson Bay and so forth.  Finchum Did they speak English, or was it French?  Pybus Both. Yeah. There were two groups of people there: the Eskimos and the  Indians. The Canadian government had to treat each one somewhat  differently. That was interesting. Canadians were taking children out of the  family, very disruptive kind of thing, but they were actually taking children  from the families, bringing them to Churchill, teaching them trades. For  example, the girls would learn cooking, nutrition and cooking, sewing,  things like that. The guys were taught carpentry and welding, you know,  some of the trades, so that they could go back then and earn a living. That  was kind of a controversial thing. Anyway, that was a fascinating time.  Eventually, because of the water vapor studies we   d been doing, a colleague  of mine, John Brown, got a grant from the National Science Foundation that  took us down to the Antarctic. I spent several months down there. I actually  lived down there. We did our balloon flying things and so forth. That was a  tremendously interesting place and time and so forth.  Finchum What was the living arrangements there?  Pybus The Navy was in charge, again. They were the housekeepers. The Navy  Seabees were in charge of the buildings, and they were Quonset huts and  some wooden huts, specially made insulated wooden huts and so forth. Four  of us lived in this one little compartment where I was. You had a bunk, and  it was a room, well, it was smaller than this living room. There were four  bunks and a little room for your stuff, your clothing and things, but you  didn   t spend any time there. I mean, that   s where you went to sleep and so  forth. Of course, and this, it   s 1960,    61, that was the Antarctic Research  Project, USAR, the U.S. Antarctic Research Project.  Operation Deep  Freeze was/is the joint service support to the National Science Foundation,  which acts as lead agency for the U.S. Antarctic Program.   Finchum When you weren   t working, what would you do with your time there?  Pybus That   s interesting. Of course, there was hiking. There were some artifacts  from earlier explorers down there,  Robert Falcon  Scott   s hut. In the early  1900s Scott had run an expedition down there. He had attempted   a party of  his had attempted to get to the South Pole from Ross Island. This was on  McMurdo Sound. Ross Island was not at the pole, so you had fairly distant  trip to get to the actual pole. There was a contest, kind of, between the   Norwegians  and the British trying to get to the pole. Be the first to get to  the actual pole. (Laughs) Anyway, our guys, Scott   s people   it wasn   t us. It  was the British and the Norwegians,  Roald  Amundson. Anyway,  Amundson won by just a little bit, but he had gotten there earlier and gotten  back.  Scott   s party, coming back, ran into some really bad weather. They all died.  They didn   t make it back. They didn   t make it back to   you set up stations  or places where you stored food and fuel and things like that. Both, going  out, you stored things there, then coming back, you picked them up, you  know, and made use of the   get more food and so forth. Anyway, the  weather closed in, and they just didn   t make it back. There was a party that  stayed at the station, at Scott base. They did report everything, and they  went out and finally found the bodies and so forth. Anyway, there was that  kind of thing. There   s Scott   s hut there. You trek down. It took about maybe  an hour or so from where we were down. It was very close. I mean, it was  not a distant thing. There was some recreation. You know, we did some  tobogganing and things like that. It wasn   t all work.  Finchum Any interesting roommates?  Pybus Well, yeah, yeah. There was a fellow from Stanford, Curly Volschlag. He  was a biologist, and we would go out with him. He had drilled some holes in  the ice and was fishing. He wanted to bring up fish. He had a very large  laboratory there, would bring back fish to study. I mean, he had live fish in  the aquarium and so forth.  Finchum He would bring up fish to study?  Pybus Yes, so we   d go out with him at night. I say at night,  but  there was no  night. We got there in November and stayed until late February. It was light  all the time. There were four meals that the Navy served. The only way you  really knew what time it was what would be breakfast in the morning was a  little bit different. The other meals were all alike. The other three meals  were pretty much alike. I developed a pattern of dividing up the day in  halves. I would get up in the morning (for example, let   s say eight o   clock)  and go to work until noon.  I would then take a nap in the afternoon and maybe get an hour or so of  work around six o   clock, seven o   clock, something like that. Then,  I   d   work until midnight. Then, I   d have a few hours    sleep until the next  morning. Then,  I   d  go on again. It was really six hours work, six hours  sleep, six hours work, six hours sleep, something like that. It wasn   t exactly  that, but close enough. You had to tell,    Well, let   s see, the sun   s over here,  so it must be morning. The sun is over there, over that hill, so it must be  evening.    That   s kind of the way you told time there.  Finchum How was your hut heated?  Pybus There were oil heaters. Everything ran on oil. To get fresh water, they had to  melt snow. The snow melter, there was kind of a broad street down at one  end, the mess hall, and the snow melter. Then, along the side, you   d have  the, there was a movie theater and some of the other huts and so forth. We  were at the far end of the   actually, we were at the south end of the street.  You had these various things there. One side was devoted to the aircraft  thing, the aeronautics. Again, this is mainly Navy. They flew airplanes down  there. Of course, the Navy was, that was the mode of transport was aircraft.  They had other things, helicopters and so forth. There was a large  component of aviation people down there.  Unfortunately, one of the huts, the parachute hut, one evening, apparently  the oil heater, kerosene heater, had tipped over or burned through  something. I   m not sure just what. Anyway, it had caught fire. Of course, the  parachutes being silk went up. There   s no water down there, I mean, not for  fighting fires, anyway. Everything is dry chemicals, so the best they could  do was try to pile snow between that Quonset hut and the one adjacent to it.  They lost, actually, two huts: the parachute hut and the avionics hut, which  was the electronics, the radio stuff that airplanes use. They lost a bunch of  stuff in there, but they saved the rest of the huts there. I have some pictures,  fascinating pictures of that. You see, there was a   you   re kind of helpless  there without water. You don   t understand just how valuable that is when  there is a fire. The only thing they had was snow and dry chemicals and,  well, ingenuity.  Finchum Did that help them prepare for the next time?  Pybus Yes, yeah, probably.  Finchum Did you figure out something that would work there?  Pybus You just kind of stand it. There were no fatalities. No personnel were lost or  anything there. There was another issue that I thought about temporarily  there. Let   s see. What was that? Anyway, maybe I   ll think of it later on.  That project, we flew some balloons and so forth there, and we got some  pretty good profiles. They   re very interesting. The gadget, the instrument  that I was using, required some alcohol and dry ice. I needed a very cold  reservoir to be able to cool down this surface where I was condensing the  water. This alcohol, it turns out the military, the government, can get a  bunch of, I mean, gallons of this stuff, ethanol. It   s very cheap, I mean,  pennies for a gallon. Of course, there   s always the temptation from some  people, apparently, who look on this as maybe drinkable, you see.  Anyway, there was quite a   I took a lot of precaution. I think we took  something like maybe ten gallons. There were two five-gallon buckets,  alcohol, I took down. I also had to become a purchasing agent because we  had to purchase dry ice from New Zealand, have it flown down periodically  for my experiment. I became a purchasing agent, temporarily, for dry ice.  Anyway, we were very cautious, very particularly wanted to take care of this  alcohol so nobody would be tempted to. Anyway,  we  took all these  precautions and took off the labels and boxed it up, so just some old box of  stuff, you know. I got down there, and it turns out that this biologist, Curly  Volschlag, had tens of gallons of this thing. I mean, he was using it in his  studies, in preserving the fish. He had a whole bunch of this stuff. (Laughs)  Anyway, I had worried about it, and here he was with all of this alcohol  down there. It   s one of those ironies of, you know, you don   t know until you  get there. That was kind of interesting.  Finchum Better safe than sorry.  Pybus Yeah, oh yeah, exactly.  Finchum As you were doing all of these experiments, did you create any things that  you would patent?  Pybus Well, I had   .  Finchum Maybe that   s later?  Pybus Let   s see. I guess it was later, yeah. It was during these studies, this  mechanism, this instrument that I was using took some electronics. I had  played around with some electronics, and I do hold a patent. Actually, the  Army holds the patent, but I did patent some electronic stuff that we did.  There were some patents, but it wasn   t directly related to the hydrometer. It  was just part of ancillary stuff. Then, I went back and wrote these reports  that, both from the IGY. There was a later term about probably five or six  years later. It was the IQSY, International Quiet Sun Year. See, the IGY was  the sunspot maximum. Then, the IQSY was the sunspot minimum. That was  the idea,  to  compare these two things with the sunspot cycle.  Finchum It being international, did you have scientists from other countries with   .  Pybus Yeah, there was a Russian guy who came down. He didn   t speak very much  English, but we played chess together. I played chess, and he enjoyed that. It  turns out also some of my very early work there at Aberdeen had been to  explore, to actually interpret some data about the ionosphere. See, there are  different layers to the atmosphere. After you get above about twenty miles,  then you begin to have these layers of not just atoms and molecules, but  ions, that is, separate elements, ionized elements. Anyway, these layers are  what our radio broadcast, for example, AM broadcast radio bounces off  these layers so you can hear these broadcasts way far away on the other side  of the globe, for example. Long-range radio communications depend on  some of these layers. They   re labeled the Sporadic E, which are like clouds,  and then there   s an E layer, and then F1 layer, F2 layer, and so forth. I mean,  they   re different layers of these ions.  It   s these layers or these ions that are, some of these layers are being  destroyed by our chemicals from the ground. These Freons and so forth are  destroying  ozone layers , letting the ultraviolet come through more than it  should. That   s what they   re talking about are these ionized layers being  destroyed. Anyway, I was doing some interpretation. We had rocket data.  The Army and others were firing rockets up through these layers trying to  discover what was going on. Again, all of this was before Sputnik, before  the  Russian  satellite era. He was doing some of that same work, which I  knew something about. (Laughs) We would sit down and start to write out,  you know, some of the math here and speak in algebra, (laughs) as you  might say. (Laughter) That was very interesting. Eventually, of course, we  came back, and these results, some of these results were published in the  international meteorological publications. My wife and I, then, traveled.  This was presented in Switzerland. There was a conference there, so we  traveled to Switzerland. I gave a talk there and so forth.  Finchum Had you gotten your master   s, or was this just all with your bachelor   s and  the work you had done in Hawaii, in meteorology?  Pybus Actually, you know, I   ve never stopped going to school. (Laughs) I did take  many courses at Aberdeen, math courses and so forth and physics, and a  couple of these through the University of Delaware, but they were never  focused. I suppose you could say that my year at Monterey was probably the  master   s year. That was fully focused on meteorology. They wanted to make  us instant meteorologists. That was the equivalent, but at Aberdeen, of  course, the military are always educated. There   s always something more  that you need to do for advancement and so forth. That applied, also, to the  science community. We had people there at Aberdeen at the research labs,  Ballistic Research Labs, who would teach particular types of mathematics  and so forth. Also,  I  took a course in writing, you know, how to present the  data that you have and, well, things like that. We were always going to  school somehow or another.  Finchum Sounds like it. (Laughs)  Pybus Yeah, yeah. Of course, we were educating each other there also. I mean,  there   s another fellow at Aberdeen. He and I got into frequent discussions  about    What would extraterrestrial life be like?    I favored alcohol instead of  water-based, which we are. Life here on Earth is water-based, almost all.  Anyway, he favored ammonia as a basis. I favored alcohol, which is very  similar to water. Anyway, we discussed things like that. That was  interesting. Coming back from the Antarctic, of course, there were other  projects. I got interested in fuel cells. Ecology, of course, was big in   we  knew already that the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere here was increasing,  which was the early warning about climate change, I mean, way back then.  I got interested in fuel cells. The problem with electricity with wind energy  and solar energy is that they generate electricity, but you   ve got to use it  right then. There   s really not a lot of ways to store that energy. You can put  it into a battery, maybe, which is, battery technology has really advanced  since I   m talking about the old days. Fuel cells were a promising thing there.  As a matter of fact, fuel cells are used on most of our satellite stuff now.  You know, the International Space Station and so forth use fuel cell  technology because you can store   while you   re in the light, you need to  store that energy for when you go into the dark side. Fuel cells and batteries  do that.  Anyway, I got interested in fuel cells. I talked to some people there, some  Army people. One of the fellows, I think   I   ve forgotten where it was, near  Washington D.C. Anyway, he said,    Hey, there   s a guy I know out in  Oklahoma who   s doing some work on fuel cells. You might give him a  call.    Okay, I did. Turns out it was Bill Hughes, who was head then of the  double-E, electrical engineering, department here at OSU. He and I talked  about fuel cells and so forth. He had done a lot of work. He and another  professor, Jack Allison, had done a lot of work, research on that and so  forth, basic research. He also got into windmills later on. Anyway, he and I  were talking about fuel cells, and he was interested in why I wanted to know  and so forth. Well, you know,  it was  just kind of interesting.  You could   maybe use it with a wind generator to store energy and so forth.  He discovered that I had a background in meteorology, and he says,    Hey,  we   ve got a project here. We   ve got some Army money.    I was doing work  for the Army then at Aberdeen. He had Army money, and he set up, it   s  called a THEMIS  Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions   project. Now, THEMIS money is money appropriated by Congress to  develop centers of excellence. Okay? Congress had appropriated some  THEMIS money to OSU because of the work of Herb Jones in lightning  sferic studies. It turns out that thunderstorms and tornadoes do a lot of  damage. You want to be able to predict what they might do. You know,    Is  this particular storm going to become a hailstorm, or will it be a tornado, or  will it not be anything?     The idea was to do some research on, listen to the, what   s called sferics.  When there   s a lightning discharge, there   s a radio signal emanated. We call  it static, radio static, but it   s a signal from that lightning discharge. Can you  predict anything from listening to that static, to that radio static? That was  the whole idea of this project. Of course, he did not have a meteorologist.  There   s meteorology involved here. We talked a little bit about this, and he  said,    Would you be interested in coming out here?    Just kind of offhand, I  said,    Well, make me an offer.    Well, he did. (Laughter) Here I am   (Laughter) That was a fairly serious decision, you know, and our family  decision. Our kids, of course, were in school and so forth. We had to  consider all of that. Anyway, in the end, we did.  In 1969, we came out here. I joined the faculty, the research faculty, at OSU.  The particular project was to listen to   Bill Hughes was a big fan  of  planes . He had his own airplane. He was a pilot, loved flying. The method  that we used was to instrument an airplane with receivers, radio receivers, at  different frequencies and listen.  We   d  fly around near a tornado or a severe  storm, one which might become a tornado or a hailstorm.  We   d  listen to  the sferics, and see if there   s any correlation between the sferics and what  that storm was going to become. Could you predict anything from listening  to the sferics? It turns out we never found any predictive value, but you  could always tell how intense the storm was. The sferics would go up as the  storm was building, and then, they   d go down as the storm was decaying  and so forth. We never did find a predictive value, but you could tell, at the  moment, what the storm was doing.  Finchum You were up in a plane getting closer and closer to these storms?  Pybus Well, yes, you get close, but not into them.  It was  some of the nicest  flying, some of the safest flying I   ve ever done. We did a lot of flying. We  had several different airplanes. There was a twin engine, Beech craft  D-19  they called it, two-engine. They called it the Blue Goose, which was here on  the project. Eventually, we got a couple of DC-3s. These are two-engine  aircraft, and one of them was really nice. It came from the Corps of  Engineers in Nebraska. (Laughs) It was a really plush airplane. Anyway, we  would put these radio receivers and things in them and go out and go around  the storm, not into them, go around. We were out in the clear air. You could  see them. It was beautiful, I mean, really beautiful flying and not rough at  all.  In fact, I consider that flying was safer than any of the commercial flights  because commercial airlines, you know, they   ve got a schedule to meet.     We   ve got to be at that place, at that time, doesn   t matter what the weather  is. That   s our schedule.    That puts a pressure on them. We had no pressure  whatsoever. We could go up and fly around. We could back away. As the  storm got bigger, we would back off, still be in clear air. We didn   t have to  go any place, just listen. There was an interesting project. We could listen to  the sferics, but also, when a lightning strike occurs, there   s a magnetic field  radiated, as well as the electrostatic field. I went to the  Navy  in   oh,  there   s a place  Lakehurst  in New Jersey. I can   t think of it. Anyway, senior  moment here.  Anyway, the  Navy  had been flying what they call a magnetometer, which  was used for submarine detection. The airplane would fly over the ocean  and have a wire, long wire connected to this instrument. It looked like,  actually, kind of a bomb shape towed behind close to the surface of the  water looking for a magnetic anomaly, which would be a submarine, an  enemy submarine or any kind of metal down there, but mainly for enemy  submarines. It   s magnetic. We got the idea,    Well, you know, maybe we  should fly one of these magnetometers around a storm.    We were working  with White Sands Proving Ground, which was actually one of the monitors  for our project, the people at White Sands. We were working with them.  Anyway, I went to Lakehurst, New Jersey, and borrowed a magnetometer  from them. Let   s see, I said Army, but I think maybe this, I think they  might   ve been Navy people. Anyway, we got the magnetometer, so we took  it out to White Sands. We flew around some storms out there. On one of the  trips, the motor, we strung the thing out. It was about, I don   t know, a half a  mile behind us, this magnetometer. The motor that rewound this cable  failed. There we were, flying around with this thing hanging out, so we  made provisions. The Navy had said,    You just need to make sure that you  can get rid of this in a hurry if you need to.    There was a little explosive  device up on the cable so that we could detach it in a hurry if we had to.  Here we were, flying around and   well, what do you do? You can   t land it,  really, in an airport because you   ve got this thing about a half a mile behind  you, and it   s going to possibly do damage.  Anyway, they found an old abandoned airfield out at White Sands. We were  talking with people on the ground all the time. They said,    Okay, go up  there and land that thing. Cut it loose off at this old airfield.    We did. We  had a guy flying our airplane, Orrin Tachio, who worked here at OSU. He  was an OSU employee. He ran the flight school out here at the airport. He  had been an old B-17 pilot over in England in World War II. He was just a  really, really talented guy. Anyway, we were flying, and he said,    Well,  okay,    so we went out and made a pass at this airfield. I was looking  through what they call a drift meter at the time. It   s a little periscope you put  down at the bottom of an airplane so you could watch what was going on  out there and see things down below you. I was watching, so we made a  pass to find out just what his altitude had to be for this magnetometer to be  very close to the ground. Okay, so we went around again. We went down,  and I cut it loose, so I tell people,    I have bombed White Sands, okay?     (Laughter)  It turns out it came down. Of course, it   s going pretty fast, you know,  several hundred miles an hour and skidded along. It took the fiberglass (it  was mainly fiberglass), it took a lot of fiberglass off, but it really didn   t  damage the magnetometer very much. Orrin was really good. He was very  good. The whole thing worked out very well. We patched it up, and of  course, gave it back to the Navy at Lakehurst. Anyway, that was one of the  interesting things that happened. I   ve had a lot of interesting things happen.  (Laughter) Let me see. Of course, we made reports to the Army, the  quarterly reports and so forth, which are documented. I think Nani has found  some of those. They reside, she said, at some Air Force base now, I think  she said, all those reports. Anyway, that money eventually ran out. I came  here for, it was a three-year project.  Anyway, that was extended. The whole project was extended another three  years, eventually, but eventually, that terminated. In that project, we did  not   we had an instrumented airplane here, so the Army was using that for  different things. We spent some time up at Arcata,  California , which was  one of the foggiest. The FAA uses that for their fog studies. Vietnam, of  course, was interesting because the helicopters needed to get in and out  sometimes, and the fog was a problem with this. They didn   t know where  they were and landing and so forth. They were examining ways to dissipate  fog. Anyway, we went out there to Arcata and did some of our studies with  fog, some of the electrical properties of fog. Then, we did another project  down at Alabama, again for the Army. It was weather-related, and a bunch  of people were studying storms. Then, we went out to, we were at  Brownsville, Texas, very tip of Texas, out over the ocean. They wanted to  know something about the characteristics of ocean storms. We gypsied out  there and did that. We were not confined strictly to Oklahoma during this  time. The Army was using us. Of course, we were delighted to be useful,  using us for these various studies.  Finchum You came after, you mentioned Jones?  Pybus Herb Jones.  Finchum Was he still here when you came?  Pybus He was here in town. He had officially resigned. As a matter of fact, I sat in  his office. What had been his office became my office here.  Finchum There was a tornado lab somewhere around?  Pybus Yes. Well, again, he had been one of the pioneers here in Oklahoma, one of  the pioneers to study tornadoes and the sferics, the electric phenomenon of  tornadoes. That   s why the THEMIS project was brought here, because of his  groundbreaking work. He and the people at Tinker Air Force Base   now,  Tinker, the Tinker people, Fawbush and Miller, were the two outstanding  meteorologists there. They developed a meteorological model for  forecasting tornado development. Of course, that has eventually become the  main way of forecasting. You look at the meteorology.  The sferics just never did pan out to be a good forecasting tool. I mean, it   s  just the way it worked. Anyway, Herb could locate where lightning was  most intense, which indicated where these storms were. Now, this is the  early day of radar, too, so that together with radar information could begin  to tell where these storms were. The lightning, the sferic intensity, could tell  how intense the storm was. Okay,  it was  these two things. The radar and  the sferic detection were the main tools at this time. This was back in the  fifties, 1950s, late fifties, I believe. Well, no, let   s see. It had to be   no, they  were talking about this when I was in school at Monterey, so it had to be  about 1954.  Finchum Oklahoma was in the discussion     Pybus Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Monterey   oh yeah. No, in meteorology, that was a big  deal because being able to forecast a severe storm like that, a damaging  storm, was certainly a high priority.  Finchum Oklahoma State had this instead of OU?  Pybus Yes. This is Herb Jones. Now, OU, we used to have a meteorology  department here, but when the Air Force left (the Air Force was here during  World War II), when the Air Force left, that department kind of degenerated  or went away. OU had a meteorological department. That meteorological  department became the center for their studies. That   s why the severe storm  forecast center  Storm Prediction Center  is located at Norman. They were  doing this meteorologically, which I say became, is now the main way of  forecasting these storms. You can forecast a certain airflow at higher levels  in the humidity and the temperature inversions, which are important.  Meteorology is important.  Finchum Dr. Jones was leaving about the time you came.  Pybus Because of his work and his association with the Air Force, with the military  there at Tinker, he had been able to get some money to build   it might still  be the remains of this out here at  the  airport at Stillwater at the end of a  runway out there. It   d be about   I don   t know, what was the runway, 1-2-0  or 1-4, something like that. Anyway, this was an underground bunker, this  concrete bunker, and the top of it was just about ground level. Inside, he had  all of the electronic equipment to monitor these storms. This is one of the  places where he had a sferic detector set up.  Now, there are some pictures, photographs of this cone-shape detector.  These were electrical radio detectors. They could tell a direction for sferic  strike, for the sferics. You get two or three of these together, and then, you  could pinpoint a particular spot. With one, you could tell a direction, but  now you needed a second one to pinpoint a distance. Two or three or more  would be better. Anyway, he had this set up. He had some military  equipment, radio receivers and so forth. He also had a periscope, a  submarine periscope mounted in the roof of this lab. You could be down  there in the lab, look through the periscope, and see what was going on at  the same time that you   re protected. You   re in the bunker. Okay?  Finchum That makes sense.  Pybus The whole idea was that if a tornado came by, then you could see it and  monitor it and so forth. Of course, tornadoes don   t generally come by here.  (Laughs) Anyway, it was a neat idea. He had these other radio detectors, so  at a long distance now, you don   t just have to see the thing to know where it  is. You could detect it with radio receivers. You could pinpoint where the  intense part of the storm was. That was the big part of his work. That   s why  the THEMIS project was brought here, because of that sferic detection  capability.  Finchum Did you all chase storms? Like current day, you say storm trackers or storm  chasers. Did you all do that?  Pybus We did with our airplanes.  Finchum With your airplanes.  Pybus I was the associate director. Bill Hughes was director of the project, of  course, and I was the associate director. I   d call down to Norman, and I  visited there. I got acquainted with some of the people and would get their  idea of where the storms were going to be and how severe and so forth. That  was my job, one of my jobs, that and instrumenting their airplanes. We  called down, you know. If it looked like it was going to be a stormy day,  then we   d get ready and go up. It was one of those things. You just kind of  had to be ready. This was before we had all of these meteorological  forecasts and Doppler radar forecasts and all of that. This was not available.  You had to kind of look at the meteorology and make an educated guess.  They were good. The severe storm people are good. They   re very good.  Anyway, we coordinated with them, and we would go up. Sometimes,  there   d be a storm there, and sometimes, it   d just peter out and be nothing.  Finchum You learn from those, too, I guess.  Pybus You learn. That   s right, that   s right.  Finchum Well, you mentioned Doppler. I think Gary England had something to do  with   .  Pybus No, he was   you see very little of Doppler, a true Doppler radar. You see  radar images, but the Doppler radar has more to do  with  when they show  you these red and green areas of the actual movement of the airflow around  here. That   s where the Doppler is being used. Doppler radar is just a, it   s  turned into a generic term, and it   s not at all what you see generally on the  TV screen. Once in a while, they   ll show something which does show the  Doppler Effect. That was one of the research things being done down in  Norman, and it   s quite valuable. They might now show you on TV, but it is  useful, and they can   now, that developed about this time. About 1970-  something, it was being developed. It depended on a mathematical formula  to interpret the data. It   s called a Fourier transform, which is a technical  term.  To get this information in real time, you had to run it through this formula, a  fast Fourier formula, to understand what it was saying. In radar, the raw data  is a shift in frequency. We had to translate that into an airflow, velocity and  airflow. There had to be this algorithm developed. It was called fast Fourier  transform. It was kind of a slick way of doing this calculation very fast, so  that now you can have the data almost immediately or within a very short  time, anyway. With the development of that mathematical algorithm, then  Doppler radar became very, very useful. Instead of having to go back later  in the laboratory and translate all of this, you could do it almost in real time.  For that particular mathematics was needed and became available.  Finchum A lot of brainpower.  Pybus (Laughs) That   s right, that   s right. That   s applied math.  Finchum A lot of that was before computer.  Pybus Oh yeah, oh yeah. No, that   s right. Then, computers, of course, were  growing in power at the same time so that now they became also faster and  faster, so the two things merged. Now Doppler radar is pretty much real  time, instead of you going back afterwards and looking.  Finchum After that particular project was finished, what did you end up doing?  Pybus Okay. When the money began to run out at the very end, this thing was kind  of tapering off and so forth. Airplanes are very expensive to run, so the  Army says,    Oh, you know, unless you got something useful, let   s kind of  taper off here.    I did some work for Extension, OSU  Cooperative   Extension  Service . This really has nothing to do with the THEMIS project,  except I don   t know if you remember this old movie, Being There. Who was  it? It was a Peter Sellers, I think it was a Peter Sellers movie.  Finchum That sounds familiar.  Pybus Being There. It just happened I was a meteorologist, and I was here. We had  a drought. (Laughs) The city people, and  Lawrence     Chub    Bellatti   publisher of the Stillwater NewsPress at that time  in particular, was   and  Bill Thomas   were very much involved with city affairs. Here   s a drought.  People expect you to do something, do anything. Anyway, they got together  with OSU, and it was decided that OSU should fund a cloud seeding project,     Rainmaker    business. Okay? Well, okay, that   s one thing. How do you  know   you   re paying this guy  Irving P. Crick Associates . We paid this  fellow from Palm Springs, California, to go out, put some silver iodide  flares down at different places. He said he could increase the rainfall during  this drought. Okay, so you hire this guy. Now, how do you know that you   re  getting your money   s worth? How do you know it   s working? You   re going  take his word for it? Well, no. Well, what do you do? You look for a  meteorologist. Oh boy. (Laughs) Anyway, there I was. I was here.  Okay,    Pybus go take a look at this. See what you can find out. Is this guy  really doing what he says?    (Laughs) Well, in the first place, cloud seeding  out here in the plains is just not very efficient. I mean, the variation in  rainfall patterns is so great from year to year and day to day, even. How do  you tell that you   re making any difference? Maybe a little more rain falls  today than it did two days ago. Was he responsible, or is that normal? You  just don   t know. It takes a long, long time and maybe never. Anyway, you  have to do something, popular pressure, citizen pressure here. Do  something. Okay, we   re doing something  (Laughs) It was very  controversial from the very beginning.  People down at Norman, there was a fellow down there who   s actually  doing cloud seeding from the air in an airplane. He traveled to different  places: Africa, Asia, and different places.  He  had done cloud seeding. He  said,    Well, you just don   t have the conditions here to do that.    You need  hills, mountains, and things, the likes of which assist in this cloud seeding.  In some cases, it does work. Pacific Gas and Electric, the California  company, routinely cloud seed for their water reservoirs up in the hills so  that they have this water now for whatever they use it for, for hydroelectric  generation or whatever. They, over the years, have found that it does  increase the rainfall maybe three, four, five, sometimes five percent, not  much, just a little bit. It   s enough that it pays for itself in those situations.  Out here in the flat plains,  it does  zip. People are saying this,    Well, okay,  okay, I hear you, but I also have to listen to the population, you know, the  people.    Anyway, the political people here were pushing this. I was given  the job. I developed what I called a neighborhood analysis. I took all the  rainfall data I could find from my   I forgot. I think I went back, at least if I  could go back twenty years, something like that. I could collect data. There  are a lot of little observing stations that don   t get reported regularly, but  people keep track of these things. There   s a lot of little stations around.  That   s what you need, a lot of data over a long time. I did. Anyway, I came  up with this analysis, and it turns out that you   d have to run that experiment  for maybe ten years or so before you could get data above the noise level. I  mean, there   s so much randomness.  In doing that, I found that there was a correlation with the sunspot cycle.  Our rainfall here varies according to the sunspot cycle. That   s an eleven year  cycle of sunspots. Our rainfall varies according to that. It   s a maximum.  About three, three and a half years after a sunspot maximum, we get a  maximum of rainfall here. Anyway, it   s very interesting. I wrote a report,  and it was published in the Oklahoma Academy of Science bulletin. That I  found more interesting than for one or two years of data that we had from  Irving Crick, he was the contractor there, Irving P. Crick from Palm Springs.  Compared with the one or two years of data that he had, the sunspot cycle is  much more interesting and more valid information. I never could see any  difference in his operation, never did see any difference. You couldn   t really  expect to. I mean, I worked out the statistics and all, and with such a  variation, you can   t. You need a lot of long-term data, and we just didn   t  have it. Anyway, I was doing some work with the Extension people about  this sunspot cycle.  I went out to the west here, and some of the Extension groups talked to  farmers and so forth. They said,    Oh yeah, oh yeah. We know in odd years,  the rainfall   s down. In the even years, it   s up.    These old farmers knew this.  I mean, they had observed it. They didn   t know the regular cycle and so  forth. It turns out in western Oklahoma, there   s also a twenty-two year cycle  that this eleven years has reached its maximum. The next eleven years  reaches a higher maximum. Then, the eleven years after that is a lesser  maximum. There   s a twenty-two year cycle, also. Out in western Oklahoma  they were experiencing the twenty-two year cycle. They were going by the  decades. The even decades were, I   ve forgotten which one I was now. Even  decades, the sixties were up in rainfall. The seventies were down, so every  ten years or, actually, eleven years up and down. These old guys knew that.  Finchum They keep records.  Pybus Yeah. If you look in the Bible and where it was Joseph that was forecasting,  interpreted the pharaoh   s dreams, seven years of plenty and seven years of  not plenty, he had looked at the, he had access, of course, to the flooding  records of the Nile. Hey, close enough to six, actually, it   s six and a half  years is the actual sunspot cycle, six and a half years, seven years. Seven  years, you got good flooding for the crops. Seven years, you have poor  crops. This old guy, he knew. He figured it out. That   s the way I look at that  story. He was one smart Hebrew. (Laughter)  Anyway, there   s another correlation which nobody can explain, or at least, I  haven   t heard any explanation that after a sunspot outburst, you have these  outbursts every once in a while from the sun when you have a storm like  that, severe storm. It   s something like, I don   t know, three or four. I   ve  forgotten now. It was three or four weeks after that there was a deepening of  what they call the Alaskan low. There   s certain low centers up in the Gulf of  Alaska, and there   s a high, Bermuda high out east. There   s another Pacific  high. Anyway, there   s usually a low center, low pressure area out in that.  That deepens a certain amount of time after a sunspot eruption. Nobody  knows why. Now, what   s the correlation? Why does this happen? There it  is. We   re tied to the sun quite a bit. I find that part fascinating. That I would  like to know more about.  Finchum Not too late to learn more.  Pybus Not too late. That   s right. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you follow much of the Mesonet? I mean, it   s weather-related..  Pybus Well, yeah. Of course, it   s used in our daily forecasts here quite a bit.  Finchum You know a little bit about it?  Pybus Yes. Particulars, I don   t know much about it, but I know that there is that  Mesonet. That   s the problem because with this rainfall data, for example,  why you need so long a time. You might get a shower over here, and just a  mile down the road, bright and sunny. You need a rainfall sensor here, and  you need one there. You need one   you need a million of them because  these little things are spotty, so you need a longtime trend.  Finchum Do you keep one here?  Pybus (Laughs) No, I   ve got a little rain gauge out here, but I don   t do anything  official.  Finchum When you were studying severe weather, did you have a shelter, a tornado  shelter, at your home?  Pybus No, no. (Laughs) I   ll tell you that there was a scary time. I was frightened.  This was back in the, I guess, seventies, maybe late seventies. Anyway,  there had been a cold front that had stalled out right along the Oklahoma-  Kansas border.  It had  been up there two, three, four days, kind of just  hanging around there. Nobody thought much about it. Then, suddenly, it  moved, and it created what   s called a roll cloud. You could actually see the  clouds a-rolling. It   s not something going up in the air like that. It   s actually  rolling, and I saw it coming down. I knew what it was. It was coming down   south . I guess it traveled about forty, fifty miles an hour, something like  that. Anyway, it did some damage to the aircraft out here. I was standing out  there, and I was watching it. What do I do? I just went into my garage and  hoped for the best. (Laughs) Now, that was scary. Tornadoes don   t scare me,  but that did. I mean, it was a whole   I mean, there wasn   t any place you  could run. You can   t outrun it or anything like that. I mean, you   re in it.  Finchum Just hunker down.  Pybus Oh, it did a lot of damage all the way down to Oklahoma City and   .  Finchum Mostly wind, or was it   .  Pybus Yeah, I guess it was seventy, eighty mile an hour winds.  Finchum Well, if it was snow   .  Pybus Oh, snow? (Laughs) No, this was just wind, yeah, wind and dust. Let   s see.  What else? After the money ran out, I came out here. I had invested in some  rental properties. This was one of them. This is just an old shack pretty  much, and I bought it very cheap and turned it into, tore everything out and  redid it and remodeled it and so forth.  I  rented it out and several other  rental properties around.  I  used this to finance the kids    schooling. Nani,  my daughter,  was a  National Merit Scholar here when she graduated from  school.  It  wasn   t worth a penny. I was making too much money. They  don   t grant scholarships to, you know, people who are making money.  (Laughs)  Anyway,  I  refinanced this and helped pay for her schooling and so forth.  Now, Sean, my son, got a full Navy scholarship. Actually, he went down to  OU and made contact with the Navy and got a  ROTC  scholarship  and  chose to go  to the University of Rochester. Yeah,  it was a  full scholarship:  tuition, board, everything.  It  saved us a pile, I   ll tell you. My third child,  Brooke, went to OSU here. Of course, we paid for him. He took five years.  He liked going to school so much he stayed five years. (Laughs) Also, he  hadn   t really decided what he wanted to do.  Finchum A lot of kids now are on the five-year plan.  Pybus Yeah, he was one of them.  Finchum Once you left the academic-type world, what did you do?  Pybus Like I say, I had bought some rental properties. I had four or five rental  properties, and I had hired this guy, Pat Watson, Stillwater Plumbing    Heating.  I  hired him to do some repairs around, you know. I   m sitting  down with him. He   s doing some work on a water heater out  in a  Ridge  Road property. I said,    What do you do and so forth? Are you willing to sell  this job?    I   d been looking around a little bit. I had an offer to go out to be  the meteorologist out at  the Marshall Islands . It was down range from  Vandenberg  Air Force Base , shooting rockets. That was their target area.  They wanted a meteorologist out there on the island. I had an offer to go be  hired for that, but I looked at myself and my age and everything. Actually, I  looked at my garage. There was no way I was going to move all of that stuff.   It was about  stuff, you know? (Laughs) That was a big consideration.  Anyway, I asked Pat,    Are you willing to sell your business?    He said,     Well, sure.    We negotiated, and I bought his business, Stillwater Plumbing    Heating. He was ready to retire anyway. It   s mechanical stuff. Plumbing  is very mechanical, and heating and air conditioning is mechanical. I like  that. I   m still doing it.  Finchum How many years later?  Pybus Let   s see. That was 1975, so it   s what?  Finchum Forty years.  Pybus Twenty-five, forty years, yeah.  I   m  still doing it. (Laughs) I spent thirteen  years at Aberdeen, thirteen years there. I think I   m fortunate. I had a  retirement account built up. I had a choice of leaving that retirement money  there or taking it out in cash. I figured,    Well, I   ll take it out in cash.    I look  back, and I think I made a good decision. Then, I did not want to put it into  the stock market because, as you know, just these past few days, the stock  market   s up. Then, it crashes, up and crash. I don   t know enough to play that  game. You   re up against professionals. There are professionals in there  investing other peoples    money, vast sums, and I don   t know enough about  it. I don   t want to put money in the market, so I put it into real estate. It turns  out that I put it in just at the right time, that real estate really took off about  that time, about the seventies.  Finchum You like Stillwater well enough to stay put?  Pybus That   s right. Yeah, yeah. It was quite different moving here. Of course, from  Aberdeen, Maryland, people there are very stable. I mean, the Proving  Ground people, they   re government employees a lot and so forth. It   s a very  stable neighborhood. Still know people back in, we lived in a little place  called Webster Village. Still know people. I plan to go back there, maybe  this fall, to visit.  I  came out here to Stillwater. Four years, people are gone.  Two years,  they  transfer. Woah. It   s a very different culture, very  interesting. I mean, OSU being a college town is a lively place compared  with a lot of places. It   s very lively. I like it.  Finchum You   ve been coast to coast and north and south.  Pybus Oh yeah, I   ve been different places.  I   ve  discovered a lot of things. My  time up at Churchill, Canada, on the Hudson Bay   actually, we stayed at  the military base on Churchill. We were staying in the officers    barracks,  and you dress for every meal. You dress for breakfast. You dress for lunch.  You dress for dinner. I mean,  it was  coat and tie. Here we were in grubby  work uniforms.  You had to  rush back, change, eat your meal, change back  and so forth. What a waste of time, but if I were stationed there, that is  something that takes up time that fills a soldier   s day. They   re required to do  these things, and psychologically, that   s absolutely necessary. When you get  out to some lonely place like that, you need something. It was interesting.  We lived in this Webster Village in Maryland and so forth.  We  went to a  little congregational church there and so forth.  Anyway, some years later, I was up in Thule, Greenland, you know. I   ve  forgotten how we met him, but I think I knew that he was there already.  I   went to see the chaplain. He had been the minister in Webster Village when  I was at Aberdeen earlier as an intern, you know, very early. He had gone  back in the Air Force, and he was a chaplain up there at Thule. He said the  primary problem he had was in the winter, no sunlight, a terrible  psychological problem with the troops. There were two places: their work  area and their bunk. If they weren   t working, they   d go home and go to  sleep. They had bowling alleys up there at Thule, all these facilities, nice  facilities and so forth, tennis court, indoor tennis courts, all of this stuff.  In  the  wintertime, you couldn   t hardly get the guys out there. There   s just  a   tremendous psychological problem.  I began to understand this thing at Churchill. The British understood very  well that you need to keep these guys occupied,  to give them  something to  worry, not to worry, but concern.  They   ve  got to do this and this. Of  course, we didn   t have that problem down at the Antarctic because there was  always something to do. I remember on my birthday I spent my birthday  with three other guys out on the, went over to the mainland, what they call  Marble Point. The geology was marble there. It was at the base of what they  call  a  Piedmont glacier. One of the guys was from the Bureau of Mines.  He was working with another fellow from the University of Kansas. The  guy from the University of Kansas could date some of the temperatures and  so forth underneath the glacier if he could get some pieces of marble. What  happened is that marble is a crystal, type of crystal. Cosmic rays come in  and displace electrons from this crystal.  Now, if it   s cold enough, then those electrons don   t go back into place.  Marble becomes essentially ionized. If you take a piece of this marble and  put it, for example, in the palm of your hand, it   ll sparkle, which is the  radiation given off as these electrons fall back into place, into a lower orbit  in the atom. They radiate, and you get that sparkles. He developed a way of  determining what the maximum temperature was and so forth. Anyway, my  associate and I, John Brown and I, just to be doing something, went out with  these guys, these other two guys, to Marble Point.  We  stayed out there. We  went out for a couple days. Actually, we stayed longer because the weather  got bad, and the helicopter couldn   t come get us. Anyway, we stayed there  for a little while. What was happening was we would go up on the side of  this glacier.  A glacier is kind of rounded at the bottom, and as it goes down, it pushes  stuff up from the bottom. You have these layers of, in this case, marble  coming out from the side. We   d go up the side of the glacier  and  dig down  a little bit. This guy from the Bureau of Mines had shaped charges,  explosives.  He   d  put one of those down in the hole, and  it  blasts a hole  down in so that the other fellow from Kansas could get down to some of  these layers that come off, the particular layers of the stuff that   s being  pushed out, and collect this marble and so forth. Anyway, we went up this     that was a fascinating time.  Finchum A lot of good experiences.  Pybus Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Finchum Been lots of places. Where do you call home? Where do you consider home?  Pybus Where I am, of course, is home. Ultimately, I suppose I consider Fairport.  That was home until I was eighteen, until I went off to school. I still have  attachments. As a matter of fact, I still keep contact with my classmates  there.  Finchum That   s pretty good.  Pybus Yeah, oh yeah. We were very close. I read an article. As a matter of fact, I  think it   s in this magazine. It examines people, children from families who  move every two or three years. It says that the people, those people, have  higher rates of despondency and alcoholism and so forth than those who are  stable  and  have a long period of childhood where they make attachments,  friendly attachments and so forth. There is some psychological advantage  there to long-term   anyway, these people, this group I grew up with in  Fairport, are some of the closest friends that I have.  Finchum Have they been to Stillwater, any of them?  Pybus Yes, and I   ve been to their places.  I  had a fellow just recently die, Mel  Yost, who died. He was down there at Florida, but he and I had traveled out  west to another guy who had been in the Marine Corps. He lives out in  Cottonwood, Arizona, so we met out there and had a little reunion and so  forth. We keep track.  Finchum When you actually retire, what are you planning to do?  Pybus Retirement is the pits. I don   t plan to retire.  Finchum (Laughs) Okay, fair enough.  Pybus Outside the house here, maybe you saw that Quonset-type building. That   s  my workshop. (Laughs) When I was doing the plumbing business, I put in a  heat pump system for a guy, a carpenter, actually, a cabinetmaker. He lives  south of town. I put in this system, and he couldn   t pay for it. I took a lien, I  placed a lien on his tools. I told him, Jim Schiessler, an old, well-known  around here. I said,    Jim, I   ll put this lien on your tools as long,    (seventy-five,  I think he was at the time, something like that)    I   ll put the lien on your  tools. You can use them. I   m not going to take them. You can use them as  long as you need them and so forth or until you don   t want them.     He   d had a heart attack and so forth.  He had  high blood pressure and other  things. He   s seventy-five, and I figure, you know, five more years. Anyway,  fifteen years later, he   s still alive, still working. (Laughs) He   d had a shop  down south end of town, and somebody   d just given him some space. They  sold the building, and he had to move. I had a shop on Main Street, 224  South Main where Cooper   s  Locksmith , next to Cooper   s key shop. It   s  the building between the key shop and the bicycle shop. It   s now Cooper   s.  At that time, I owned it, so I installed him in the garage, which was a big  place in the back of the building, to do his work.  Anyway, it came time to sell that building, so what am I going to do with  Jim? He   s just a real nice guy, and I   ve got to take care of him. I and Dr.  Lauvetz was one of his   he and I were taking care of Jim. Anyway, I looked  at this property, and I said,    Well, okay. I can build a big workshop out  here,    so I did.  I  bought a kit. I put that building up and moved Jim out  here. (Laughs) That   s one of the reasons for the building, but at the same  time, I moved his tools out here. I now had a little possession of the tools.  Of course, he could work and so forth. Eventually, he fell in his house,  broke his hip and collarbone and so forth.  He  went in a nursing home and  didn   t come out. Anyway, that   s the story of that building out there.  Finchum It   s going to keep you busy for a few more years.  Pybus Right. Now I   ve got a cabinet shop out here, among other things. I do still  have rental properties. I manage a four-plex, two duplexes for my son, Sean.  Sean   s in the Navy. I guess you know about him.  Finchum No.  Pybus No? Well, okay then, my children: Nani   .  Finchum Sure, tell.  Pybus Of course, Nani, as I say, when she graduated here, she didn   t qualify, I  mean, she qualified, but didn   t qualify for money for scholarship grants.  Anyway, she went to St. John   s College, which is in  Annapolis,  Maryland.  It   s a liberal  arts  college, well-known there.  She  spent a couple years   there , then she came here to OSU. During high school, she had traveled a  lot  Alaska, Taiwan, Japan, and Hawaii . We had all our kids travel.  While  at OSU  she spent some time in Mexico with some friends, learned Spanish.   Later she spent  some time in Germany with those same friends when they  had moved to Germany, knew some German.  She  studied  German,  Spanish, and  Japanese here at OSU.  Anyway, she came back to OSU  for two years, then transferred  to the  University of Rochester and studied linguistics, majored in linguistics  and  got her bachelor   s there .  She  got her master   s here  at OSU  in  English  (TESL) . More recently,  she  got her doctorate here in history.  She  works,  as you know,  at OSU  now. She spent some time,  fourteen  years, as a  Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. State Department. She was stationed in   Sana   a, North  Yemen;  Tunis, Tunisia; Damascus, Syria;  Belgrade,  Yugoslavia;  Lisbon, Portugal; and Sarajevo, Bosnia . She was in Belgrade  when Yugoslavia disintegrated into Serbia and Herzegovina and those other  places.  When the Embassy drew down in Belgrade, she remained as part of  the small staff left to run things. After Portugal,  she went to Sarajevo   Bosnia  and  helped  open our embassy there in Sarajevo. (Laughs) It   s  very interesting.  That area was divided, at that time, divided French, British, American, and  so forth. The French controlled the airport, and we controlled some area  around the city. Of course, she had to travel back and forth to the airport  to   our embassy people are constantly coming and going and different  people there. Anyway, her middle name is Suzette,  and she was the only  Embassy person who spoke French,  so the French  called  her    Suzette.     (Laughter) Anyway, she  sometimes drove in  one of the armored Humvees   the Embassy had  there in Sarajevo because the fighting was still going on  when she  arrived  there. Then she came back and got married and spent  some time in San Diego with her husband and  her son , Iain, and so forth.  Then came back here and eventually got her doctorate and now works at   Oklahoma State University .  Sean, out of high school, went down to the Navy recruiter at OU, as a matter  of fact. I don   t know how he did it. It was all his work, not ours. Anyway, he  won a full Navy scholarship to University of Rochester. To do that, of  course, he was in the Navy ROTC, NROTC program, Reserves Officer  Training program. Anyway, he majored in economics there at the University  of Rochester. When he got out, of course, he was in the Navy. I mean, for  the scholarship he was committed for, I guess, three, four years, whatever it  was. He came home and told his mother,    There   s this special program there  in the Navy. I would really like to try to get into it.     He  didn   t say what it  was. He just said special program. Of course, we   ve supported him, and  she   s supported him all the way, whatever he wanted to do. He was very  good at selecting what he wanted to do. She said,    Okay, fine,    not  knowing, of course, what the program was. Anyway, it turned out it was  SEALS, Navy SEALS training.  Finchum Pretty tough, yes.  Pybus Yeah, he   d done excellent work there while in college there in the ROTC  program, NROTC. He excelled in athletics and so forth there, very good  lacrosse player. (Laughs) When his mother found out, it was    Oh my God   Not my son     I mean, she   s not for violence at all  (Laughs) Florence was,  well, at the same time proud but horrified. Anyway, Sean got into the Navy  SEALS and went through the BUD/S Program and so forth. Then has since  been in the SEALS program. I   m sorry,  he has  not  been there  entirely.  There was a time he injured his back. He had hurt his back  herniated a  disc . Florence went out and, you know, kind of nursed him  after back  surgery . He  decided to resign from active duty  and was out for, I guess,  two years, something like that.  In that time he got married. His wife, Patty  Sylvia Patricia Serrate-  Pacheco , had majored in industrial engineering  at OSU .  She  had her  master   s in industrial engineering. He   d come back a time or two, and  eventually they married. He was out of the Navy then, and he was working  as a consultant there on the West Coast. He was kind of anxious to get back  in. Well, she was pregnant. She was about, I think, seven months pregnant.  He went back into the Navy. They had asked him,    Hey, come on back in,  come on back in.    The Navy had come to him and wanted him to come back  in. Okay, he went back in.  They shipped him off to Panama right away. Concurrent travel? No way.   There was  no concurrent travel. Of course, we didn   t know it then. They  were going after  Manuel  Noriega down in Panama. That was that  operation down there when we fought a little war and so forth down there.  At the time, we didn   t know it. He went down, but she was left at home.  Well, she said,    I   m not going to be left here.    She went down.  She   landed, I think, just two or three days before the main operation down there.  Holy mackerel, you know? Here  she is , in the middle of a war. She stayed  with, I think, some friends Sean knew down there, something like that.  Of course, then, all of this operation proceeded down there for several weeks  and so forth. By that time, she was well into pregnancy. There wasn   t any  airline then that was going to take her. Their first child, Ariana, was born in  Panama. (Laughs) Patty was not going to be left behind. I mean, that is  Patty. That is prime Patty. She   s just a lovely person. That   s that story. Since  then, of course, he   s been around different places.  Finchum Still in the Navy?  Pybus Oh yes. Well, he   s now the Deputy Commander of U.S. Special Forces.  Finchum Still in the Navy, then  (Laughs)  Pybus Still in the Navy, yeah, Deputy Commander: all SEALs, Deltas, everybody.  Finchum Wow, that   s impressive.  Pybus Yes, it is. (Laughs) Yeah, we   re especially proud of him. I wonder,     Really?     He   s a  three-star admiral, this one. Actually, he   s the highest  ranking SEAL admiral in the Navy right now. There   s no one else above  him in SEALs, but we wonder what   s next for him. Now, he has four   children . I have four grandchildren there. The oldest, of course, Ariana,   attended  the Naval Academy.  She  graduated, and she went to nuclear  school. She is now a nuclear engineering officer on a nuclear submarine out  of Georgia.  Finchum Wow.  Pybus Then, the next is a boy, Alexander. He also went to the Naval Academy. He  graduated number one in academics out of two thousand people, number one  in academics in the Naval Academy. He want s  to be an M.D. doctor. He   s  now at Bethesda. I think  he   s  in his second year there becoming a doctor.  They   re paying him, the Navy. He   s in the Navy, and they   re paying for his  schooling to be a doctor  Third child, Alyssa, she   s kind of a renegade. She   is in the  Army  ROTC program at  MIT  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology . She   s at MIT. I think this is her third year now at MIT. The  fourth one, the fourth is Christopher. (Laughs)  He   s  really a great guy.  He   s at Rensselaer Polytech nic Institute  in Albany, New York. He  is also  in the Navy ROTC program . Anyway, that rascal Sean did not have to pay  anything for tuitions. (Laughter) Oh boy. Anyway, that   s really great. That  family is really, really great.  Third child, Brooke,  is the  youngest. He graduated here, high school.  He   went to OSU  and  went through the power technology course here.  He   took five years, but he liked geology. He liked zoology. He likes all of these  things, but he picked power technology. He   s kind of a technical thing. He   s  a little me. I mean, he   s inherited that mechanical talent. He went to, well,  initially, it was   let me see.  It was  something United? No, United  Technology was later.  It was  something aerospace  Garrett Aerospace  out  in Phoenix, Arizona.  He  went to work out there for them.  He   s a hydraulic engineer, hydraulics and working with   well, one of the  things they work with there are these actuators that run the flaps up and  down for the airplanes. Okay. At first, he worked for this something  aerospace, I   ve forgotten. Then, United Technologies bought them out.  Then,  he  stayed in the same place, same office, same everything, different  boss. Then, Honeywell bought them out, so now he   s working for  Honeywell.  It   s the  same office, same place, same work. Okay? (Laughs)  It   s still, but Honeywell is big in the aircraft industry now in hydraulic stuff.  What he does is some of the testing. The FAA requires certification testing  for all the components of an aircraft and especially the hydraulic  components. They have to be tested for heat, cold, and so forth. That   s what  he does. That   s his department there.  Finchum It does sound like some of your   .  Pybus Yeah, that   s right, that   s right. No,  he   s  very mechanically inclined, very  mechanically. He won some award. He solved one of the problems that they  had with an actuator. It had caused several aircraft accidents, crashes, killing  people. He finally figured out, or somebody, I guess it was he finally figured  out what it was and invented a solution to the problem. He got a bunch of  awards and so forth from the company, from Honeywell, so they like that.  Finchum Good group of kids came from good stock.  Pybus Very proud. You know, I have to credit their mother. Florence grew up here  in Oklahoma pretty much. She had babysat for Oral Roberts in the early  days in Shawnee, Oral Roberts from Shawnee. She knew the family very  well and communicated with them. She sent Christmas cards, and they  communicated back and forth, mainly with the wife.  She  knew the kids   and  would babysit for the kids. When she graduated from school, their  family had no money to speak of. I mean, he was just a poor dirt farmer and  so forth. Anyway, Oral Roberts, because he knew her and so forth,  paid her  enrollment fees for college . Let   s see. It was Southwestern Evangelical  Bible College  Southwestern Bible College  or something like that. It   s still  there  as  Southwestern  Christian University .  Oral Roberts was one of the board members, founding members of that  college. The whole idea was to teach people, both male and female, to be  teachers, how to be teachers, which is very farsighted, a very, very excellent  thing. I mean, that   s the way to do it. That   s the very same thing that  Harvard University was doing was teaching these guys how to be ministers.  He realized that, and he was teaching these people how to be teachers.  Anyway, Florence attended down there. When we married, of course, she  was very   number one, she knew a lot about Bible, but she also knew a lot  about children and teaching and so forth. Man, that really paid off with our  kids. I mean, she knew how to handle them, set their bounds and so forth.  That   s the key. She kept saying a lot of these problems   you know, you  read about these murders and kids killing their parents and so forth. She  maintained it   s always parenting. It   s parenting. It   s important.  Finchum Would she be the one that would discipline them or would it be you?  Pybus No, both of us, but she was home most of the time. I was out making the  money to support all of this stuff at Aberdeen, mainly. Our kids were all  born by then, in Maryland. No, I was out, and I did a lot of travel, much to  her disappointment. Anyway, I did travel a lot. No, she was home. She was  the one that brought them up. I maybe helped, but she   s the one.  Also, now, she and I agreed   I mentioned  Southwestern  Bible College.  Her mother was  a Jehovah   s Witness . She knew a little bit about it, but not  a whole lot. She didn   t get into that. Going to college there, she learned  basic Bible stuff, but she was more involved with the psychology and the  theology of these things and was not at all what you   d call a fundamentalist.  She taught me. You know, I do a lot of reading now, and I   m very interested  in religion and that sort of thing, but the psychology of it   I mean, I  wouldn   t call myself religious in the normal sense. Anyway, she did a lot of  reading. She would connect with the Jewish community, find out what their  ideas were.  She  did a lot of reading in  Judaic philosophy , reading  Maimonides and different rabbis and so forth. She could tell you  philosophy. (Laughs) She kind of dragged me along into these things, which  are fascinating. Now that I have some time and so forth, it   s fascinating  stuff, but not to get too far into that. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, you   ve had a very, very successful and long and seems to be happy  life.  Pybus I look back, and I   ve really had an exceptionally wonderful life.  Finchum Would never have known it would turn out this way in high school.  Pybus (Laughs) Who would   ve known? I was doing plumbing one day here in  Stillwater for a Rowene Hunt who lives down south of town. I was under  her house there. There was a water leak. At that time I had a beard. Anyway,  there I was, lying under this house, face up, glasses on, and water dripping  in my face, cobwebs. There wasn   t much room there, you know, cobwebs  around and in my beard and so forth. Suddenly, I just asked myself,    How in  the hell did I ever get here?    You know, lying on my back under a house  with all of this nonsense going on. It was kind of,    Oh boy.    I went home  and shaved the beard. (Laughs) That was the first step. Anyway, you know,  you have those moments sometimes. You reflect and,    Oh      Finchum How did you answer that?  Pybus Yeah. (Laughs) Well, I knew exactly how I got there     Oh, back then I  should   ve done this,    or    I should   ve done that,    but it   s all done. (Laughs)  It   s amazing, but I   ve   now, going to school, I   ve taken courses and so  forth. When I came here with the THEMIS project, I took courses in EE  (Electrical Engineering), statistics and a lot of math courses.  Finchum Perpetual student.  Pybus Oh, yeah, yeah,  I  love it. Well you can see the books and so forth here.  When I had to move from this larger house, we had a large house on  Cherokee over here, five bedrooms and three bathrooms. When my wife had  died, it was just me. Well, that didn   t make sense. Anyway,  I  sold that  house, moved here to this,    The cottage.    (Laughter) That   s all I need. I  mean, really, you know, you face it, and that   s all I need.  Finchum We   ve covered a lot. Is there anything else you want to add before we close  out?  Pybus I   d better not. Otherwise, I might get into more trouble. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, I usually end with a question. When history   s written about you, what  would you like for it to say? Basically, how do you want to be remembered?  Pybus Oh man, I   m not sure anybody would want to. Yeah, there   s no particular  thing. I don   t have that much ego that I   m going to be   maybe, you know,  I   d like the grandchildren to know who I am and what I did and so forth, and  that   s that. I don   t think I made any particular contributions. There   s one  project that I would like to see. Okay. This is just pure speculation, but some  years ago, Robert Kerr, in the 1970s, was big on pumping water from here  out to the western part of the state. Okay? I think that   s still a valid  objective, but what I would do is go up someplace near St. Louis. I   ve  looked up some of this stuff.  Go up on the Mississippi River near St. Louis, high elevation. Run a gravity  pipe. Instead of pumping water from here uphill out there, run a gravity  system down to about Salina, Kansas, water pipe, I mean, like a tunnel, like  twenty-foot diameter tunnel full of water, down someplace in Salina and  Wichita, all in that area, where they have windmills. Pump the water up. Out  there, it would be, I   ve forgotten, six to eight-hundred feet deep by then for  gravity flow. Pump the water up, and then, pipe it out to western Oklahoma.  We could compete with California. California is drying up. California has  now met the limits of their water resources. Phoenix, Arizona, is in deep  trouble. Of course, California, you know, is crying the blues all the time  now. I think Oklahoma could compete agriculturally if we had water to the  western part of the state. There   s a lot of area out there which could be made  farmland with the water.  Now, it turns out if you run water to about Salina, there   s miles and miles of  windmills out there because that   s where the wind is. That energy can be  used. I did a study under Bill Hughes when I was here with THEMIS. I did a  study of the wind energy here. I figured that to pump water the size of a,  I   ve forgotten what it is, sizable amount of water from eastern Oklahoma out  to the western Oklahoma, you   d have to put a windmill (use the wind  density energy) about every half mile all the way out there to pump it up  enough. You   ve already got the windmills out there in Kansas now. If you  can get the water, and the Mississippi floods and water   s wasted, wasted. It  goes down to the Gulf. Store it out there in lakes, huge lakes. Fill that  tunnel. Pump it out day and night with wind energy. I would like to see the  western part of the state green. I   m sure we could compete very well with  California.  Finchum Well, there you go. .  Pybus That   s a project I would really like to see. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, someone will come along and maybe do it. Who knows?  Pybus Yeah. Now, if that would come about, that would not be a bad thing to be  remembered about, if you   re talking about something like that.  Finchum I   d say having three children that are contributing to society like your three  is a good thing to be remembered for, too.  Pybus Oh yeah, certainly proud of them, certainly proud.  Finchum Well, I thank you very much for reflecting back with me today. It   s been fun.  Pybus (Laughs) Okay.  Finchum Thank you.  Pybus Thank you.  -------  -------
