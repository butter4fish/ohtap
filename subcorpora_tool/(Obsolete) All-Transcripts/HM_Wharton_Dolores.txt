Speaker 1: So, I'm gonna start with some People magazine type questions, so they're quick questions, quick answers, okay?  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: It's, I would say, most Asian foods, particularly Chinese.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, mei fun is one of, one of my favorite dishes, and chow fun--oh, the gamut; then we like Japanese food as well.  We like--I like crispy shrimp, and lots of sushi.  We also eat Thai curries, which we like very much; it's a large array--large assortment.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall.
Speaker 1: Why (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Spring mostly.  Well, because spring is--tells of growth and newness and liveliness, and that's very charming.  And then the fall is lovely climate; the crispiness of the leaves; it's quite charming.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Multicolor.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: The Ocean Club [One and Only Ocean Club] in the Bahamas [Nassau, Bahamas].  It's a place where Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] and I have gone several times, and it's very--it's Caribbean; however, it's quite Asian because the owner went to Bali [Indonesia] and brought back from Bali a lot of the cultural aspects of that country--that island, so it has a lovely combination of being tropical and Asian as well.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Phrase or saying, wonderful (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's good.
Story_ID: 631735
Speaker 1: I want to talk to you about your family background.  Let's start with your mother.  Would you tell me your mother's name, and tell me about your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother was Josephine Bradford Duncan Owens [Josephine Bradford Owens]--she married a second time.  She was a very beautiful woman--brown skin, lovely silken hair, from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], she was from a rather aristocratic family, the Bradford family; they were well-established in Philadelphia, and I had great-grandparents--great-great-grandparents, actually, going back well into the 1800s.  The James T. Bradford, her grand- my mother's grandfather, became a greengrocer in Baltimore [Maryland] and Washington [D.C.]--both places where he had his place, his firm.  He did--he was extremely successful.  He owned property, he was--participated in a black bank in Baltimore--
Speaker 1: At what time?
Speaker 2: Ah, you're pinning me down on some facts now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Around.
Speaker 2: This--well, this would have to have been in the late 1800s.  Yes, there were blacks that were living very well in those years; it--there was a real upper middle class.
Speaker 1: And so your--these would have been your great-great--
Speaker 2: Well, the great-great [Thomas Bradford] was a house servant for--he was in Governor Bradford's [Augustus Bradford] home in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I hope I'm getting my facts right.  And we have newspaper clips about his--when he was deceased, how he was recognized as being so gracious in receiving guests for the governor, and it was his son, who was James T. Bradford, who was the greengrocer.  And he actually--for the greengrocer, he worked for the greengrocer and then bit by bit he was able to buy the firm, and it prospered.
Speaker 1: So, how far back can you track free people in your family?
Speaker 2: All of them--all the way back.  We do not know--I, unfortunately, from my generation, we did not press our parents about the lineage; we just didn't--it just wasn't something you did, as we're doing today, but mother wanted to talk, but we--it was always, "Oh, mother," and we didn't pay that much attention to it, so it's a little bit difficult to say; I don't remember that well.  But she often said there were no slaves in the Bradford family--there were free blacks.
Speaker 1: So, even the person who was the house servant was an employee.
Speaker 2: Correct--my understanding, yes.
Speaker 1: And how far can you date back that your family was black?  Like when--can you identify when there were whites in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, that would be more on not the--I don't know about the Bradfords; they were--I really just don't know; I do--the Duncans more so; that was my father's [V. Kenneth Duncan] side (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's your father's side?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we'll stick with your mom's family for now.  So your mother was a brown-skinned woman?
Speaker 2: Light brown.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She was a beautiful woman; she really was, she was quite--
Speaker 1: And how many siblings did she have?
Speaker 2: She had sisters, twins, who came the year after my mother was born, so James T. Bradford, the successful greengrocer, took my mother and reared--he and my great-grandmother [Josephine Bradford] reared my mother; that's why she was reared very well, and because their son who had married and had the--he had twins, and it was just a little bit too heavy a weight on that little family, and that's why my great-grandfather raised my mother, and she was raised very nicely, very well.
Speaker 1: Because she was raised by her grandparents--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) which is always different.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where was she raised?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore and Philadelphia--mostly in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Do you know why they went to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: I think it had to do with the business and property.  He owned quite a bit of--he owned property in Philadelphia; he owned the homes in Philadelphia that they had--and in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: And was he educated?
Speaker 2: Not--I don't remember very much conversation about education.  The Bradford--my--his daughters, my mother's aunts who participated in raising my mother, they were schoolteachers; they did have--they had school degrees for--whatever degree they got then in those years for teaching school.
Speaker 1: And did your mother get educated?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did; she went to--it wasn't Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]; there's a prominent school there.  What is the school that Bill Cosby went to in Philadelphia?  He got his--he got his Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Tem- thank you; she went to Temple.  I don't know that she graduated--
Speaker 1: But she went there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But she went to Temple.
Story_ID: 631736
Speaker 1: Who did she [Wharton's mother, Josephine Bradford Owens] marry?
Speaker 2: She married my father, a V--as he uses that--always uses that initial, V. Kenneth Duncan, from New York City [New York, New York].  He was an undertaker, he and his brother were undertakers here in Harlem [New York, New York], and his fa- and with--his mother was part owner of the establishment [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York], and they bought the property, 2303 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard], and that's when my brother [John Duncan III] and I, we were brought up until I was eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Now, the undertaking business was and is a big business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a business that blacks could go into, yes, and they did, they did very nicely.  It was the--and curiously enough, it was the time of the Depression [Great Depression] but they still did well because the blacks could not be--were not being buried by other than blacks, and the Duncan brothers, they were quite well-known there in Harlem; they participated in the community, especially my father's brother, Uncle Jack Duncan.  He was an Elk [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World], and he was in all different kinds of organizations, and he was a man about town, as well.
Speaker 1: So, during the Great Depression, they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did--
Speaker 1: --doing well.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and do you know any stories about them in Harlem during the Great Depression--your father?
Speaker 2: Well, they knew--it's hard to say about any stories--beginning and ending as kind of stories.  It was just--as I remember their reputation as, as being outstanding, doing a very--having a very successful business, being very caring about the people of Harlem.  They participated in that community, they wanted to be a part of that community.  They were from South Carolina originally, and their father was--had a, a livery stable in--I think it was in--I think it was Greenville--in Greenville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Duncan--I think that was also John Duncan, like my Uncle Jack; I think that was also John Duncan.  It was like a taxi--a livery stable.  They were very fair, the Duncans were.
Speaker 1: And when you look at the Duncans' family history, how far back can you trace that family?
Speaker 2: There is a--I have a picture of a--it must have been a cousin or a relative of my father and my uncle, and he was in the--he was--I'm hesitating on this--in the Senate, the United States Senate--oh, the state senate of South Carolina [South Carolina Senate], as colored.  He had a C next to--I have a picture of him, and I have a C next to his name for colored, and he was a state senator (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that was going back--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was going back to about what time?
Speaker 2: That was 'bout the time when--of Reconstruction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was after that, of course, that that was--that whole scene was eliminated with blacks being in the Senate, as we know.  But it was at that time when he was coming up that he did become a senator--
Speaker 1: As (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and I have a picture of it.
Speaker 1: As a colored man--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  And, and can you--how far back can you date your father's family in terms of being black or colored, and do you know when or if there were whites in his family?
Speaker 2: There had to have been, there had to have been.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Well, I've had my DNA (laughter) done, and I am one third black and two thirds European, and I don't think the European side was that much on the Bradford side, but it would have been on the Duncan side.
Speaker 1: But you don't know who they may have been.
Speaker 2: I don't.  We've not resear- Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] is very much--he enjoys this kind of research, and he spends hours doing it, but we haven't gone that deeply into the Duncans as much as we have the Bradfords.
Speaker 1: Now, do--were there any--can you date back to anyone being enslaved in the Duncan family?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: So, to your knowledge, both sides of your family were free.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And gainfully employed--self-employed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, self-employed, yes, absolutely, except going back to the--to James T. Bradford [sic. Thomas Bradford] who was the servant in the Governor Bradford's [Augustus Bradford] household.  He would have been employed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so he was a servant, but to the governor.
Speaker 2: To the governor, yes, but he wasn't self-employed.
Speaker 1: Correct.  So that's the--where you can date back to someone having a job.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 631737
Speaker 1: Tell me about your parents.  Where--when your parents got married, where were they living?
Speaker 2: My father was here in New York [New York], my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  My father was, was a New Yorker.  He was rather sophisticated and dashing--he dressed beautifully, exqui- handsomely, and my mother was glamorous, dressed beautifully, and little bit coquettish, and my aunt--her aunt, one of James T. Bradford's daughters, said, "I will send you to Europe if you don't marry Kenneth Duncan [V. Kenneth Duncan]."  She just--she had no particular reason; she was just not comfortable with the marriage and going to New York.  She didn't really want my mother to go to New York.  She was pampered--she was, you know, she was an adored little girl; she was adorable, I'm sure.  But mother persisted and she married, and came to New York.
Speaker 1: Now, when she was growing up in Philadelphia, was she part of the aristocratic social scene of blacks (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I don't know how outside of this interview you wanna go, but I am--I have been working on my, my memoirs, and I started with the opening scene is at a wedding, which I was the flower girl in Philadelphia, and how really lovely it was, and as I vaguely remember it, with all of the silver trays and the punchbowls, and the elegant foods, and that kind of thing, and I moved around.  I was about five years old and I moved around quite, quite comfortably.  And my mother was delighted, being a New Yorker now, she was delighted to bring me into Philadelphia to be with the society that--in which she had been brought up, the Philadelphia society.
Speaker 1: And when she was growing up as a young girl in Philadelphia, there was a black high society.
Speaker 2: Absolutely--oh, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about it?
Speaker 2: Not now, no.  After we blacks began to move out far and wide, the society was, was less--it kind of broke down.  It became more active throughout the whole eastern seaboard, I would say, rather than concentrating, concentrating in, in each community.  It brought--so it was a different scene.
Speaker 1: So they got married and moved to New York; she moved to New York (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joining my father at 2303 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard], yes.
Speaker 1: Which is--what, what is that cross street?
Speaker 2: Between 135th Street and 136th--closer to 135th Street.
Speaker 1: And when was this?  When did they marry, do you know?
Speaker 2: It must have been about 1920, 1920--yeah; a very--maybe '22 [1922], no later than '22 [1922].  My husband--my brother was born about '23 [1923] or '24 [1924]--about '24 [1924] because I was born in '27 [1927].
Speaker 1: What was the social scene like in Harlem [New York, New York] in the '20s [1920s] when they were a young married couple?
Speaker 2: It was active, and there were lots of very fancy black tie parties--dances going on at the Renaissance Casino [Renaissance Casino and Ballroom, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Where was that?
Speaker 2: You don't know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wasn't (unclear), we weren't--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's right, you're not a New Yorker; you're not a New Yorker.
Speaker 1: But I also wanted you to tell me so we document it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, all right.
Speaker 1: That's why I ask you these, so you can share.
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was on 7th Avenue, but it was about 137 [137th Street], 138th [Street]--maybe 138th, 139th Street.  It was right, right in that, that area.  There were, there were several ballrooms--there were a couple of ballrooms where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this was for black people.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and they always had--they usually had live bands playing; I mean that's where, where the best of them would be playing and, and the, the Comas [ph.] was a very popular, popular club, and everybody wanted tickets for the Comas dance.  There were several dances, and they had very sophisticated parties; the ladies wore jewelry and fox.  My mother loved her silver fox scarves.  It was very grand by comparison to what one suspects was the case in those days.  I don't think we talk about it very much.
Speaker 1: Well, that there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But mind you, I left when I was eleven--we left when I was eleven.  We left Harlem.
Speaker 1: But before--when your parents married, before you were even here--that social scene--your father was already a part of that social scene.
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  And they were--there were doctors and lawyers, and many of the women were schoolteachers, and most of the women were--many of the women in that group of schoolteachers.
Speaker 1: And did your mother work?
Speaker 2: No, she did not; no, she didn't.
Speaker 1: And she had your brother a couple of years after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before me--three--Jackie [John Duncan III] was three years older than I.
Speaker 1: And you came three years later.
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-seven [1927], yes.
Story_ID: 631738
Speaker 1: What is your first memory?
Speaker 2: Of?
Speaker 1: What you--as a child, what is--what do you remember as a first memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, dear--as a first memory.  Good Lord; let me see.  Well, it would certainly have been there in Duncan Brothers [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York], or maybe--we used to vacation in Akron, Pennsylvania, and my mother--my great-grandfather [James T. Bradford] on the Bradford side always took the family away for holidays on--during the summer, and my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] would follow suit and she would have a--get us out of the city, and I remember being in Akron, and it was a farm, so it was quite a contrast from being little Miss New York [New York] to being a country girl in rural Pennsylvania, and I just remember being very bowlegged and having a little white hat on my head, and my knees close together, my feet spread out, and standing looking at the camera.
Speaker 1: Whose farm was it?
Speaker 2: Anna Woods [ph.]; she was--her father--her husband was a farmer.  They had a farm--cows and guinea hens and chickens, and horses, and that kind of thing.  Her husband died and she needed to make more money than what she was doing on the farm, so she opened it up to what they called boarders, and we would go and board there during the summer.
Speaker 1: So, before her husband passed, it was like a gentlemen's farm.
Speaker 2: There were--I wouldn't call it a gentleman's farm, they were hard working farmers.  They were farmers; they were real farmers, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 631739
Speaker 1: Can you describe what you remember--the sights, and sounds, and smells of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: Your neighborhood where you grew up--like your home.
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: Yes.  When--little girl, yes.
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.  There was the smell of the sidewalk for some--for-- that's still--I still smell it every now and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is that smell?
Speaker 2: --a whiff of that, that whiff--it's the cement, it's the hot cement in the summer and it--I can still smell it today, and it is comfortable for me to smell--to have that smell.  It takes me back, it's--I'm Little Miss New York again.  It--but it's comfortable for me.  And there were trolley cars, and there were horse and wagon; there were horses to deliver the milk, where the men would get outta the side of the horse--of the wagon, and put the bottles of milk and cream at your doorstep.  There was the call of tamales, there would be blacks, Caribbean--people from the Caribbean going, "Tamales!  Tamales!" in the streets.  There was laughing.  It was far happier time then, and people were struggling.  It's not that they weren't struggling--they weren't poor; the poor people were very much there.  But it was a--I don't wanna give the misimpression that they were content because that is not the case, but it is not the rawness that we have in our society today--the rawness, the anger, not that I remember.  I do remember very well, two occasions when there were riots on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and Jackie [John Duncan III] and I were--we always looked out of the window.  Our--the build--our home there on 7th Avenue had a view straight out on the avenue, and we--there were two riots that I remember very well.  One was when a young His- well, it's a long story--young Hispanic was caught by the police, and taken as, as a black, mistakenly, for robbing, and he had not, and a riot ensued, and Harlem [New York, New York] went wild 'cause Harlem was mad; Harlem went wild.  And then the second was when--on the other side of the coin--was when Joe Louis won against Max Schmeling, and my people went wild (laughter).  They really delighted in that, and they were on top of those buses and just having a grand old time.  It was a racial kind of significance that Joe Louis had whipped Schmeling.
Speaker 1: And when you say they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I shouldn't say that that was a riot; it wasn't a riot, it--
Speaker 1: Right 'cause that was a celebration.
Speaker 2: --was a cele- it was not a riot.  The first one was a riot.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This was a celebration, the second one was a celebration.
Speaker 1: And was it a safe celebration?
Speaker 2: Up to a point.  Up to a point.  The police were out there.  On the first one, my father [V. Kenneth Duncan] was a gentleman, and very soft--very well spoken, very humane.  But in that riot, my father stood out in front of Duncan Brothers [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York] and he had a little pistol in his hand and he said, "No one is gonna break that window."  The window was very--it was one of those great big plate glass windows, and the--he stood out there most of the night, and then next door was a Chinese restaurant, and on the front of his window was in great big letters, "Me colored, too."  Neither my father's window, the Duncan Brothers' window, or the Chinese restaurant--West Restaurant [ph.]--those windows were not broken.

Speaker 1: At your home, was it a single family house?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was it brownstone?
Speaker 2: No.  It--no, not at all.  It--the business was on the first floor.  The basement was for the embalming, then the business, then the next floor was--it had an access from the street that was more public, and the dentist, Delany [Henry Beard Delany, Jr.], was in there; his sisters were the ones that wrote--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My--going my way?  Going--my say?
Speaker 1: 'Having Our Say' ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann].
Speaker 2: 'Having Our Say,' yes.  Well, he was there; when I was a very little girl, he was in that space.  Then, there was--then out--still in the building, there was a big storm door, and that led up those steps.  You had to get--it was quite something to get through that storm door.  Those led up to two apartments on--what was that--the third and the fourth floor, and my father [V. Kenneth Duncan]--my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens], father, and my brother [John Duncan III] and I were on the fourth floor, and my grandmother, the owner--the part owner of Duncan Brothers [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York]--was on the middle floor there.
Speaker 1: And who owned this building?
Speaker 2: My uncle, Uncle Jack [Jack Duncan]--my father, Uncle Jack and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: So it was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She used to pass for white.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She traveled all over the world.
Speaker 1: And she just--because she looked white she just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about it?
Speaker 2: There were a lot of us, you know; there were, there were a lot of people out there who passed for white like that in our black world, yes.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about her experience of passing for white?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did, yes, she did.
Speaker 1: What do you remember her telling you?
Speaker 2: Nothing much, you know.  Her--she'd talk about her trips to Europe and that kind.  She would--once said about my mother--my--as I expressed, my mother was a lovely, lovely looking woman; she was a showstopper.  Cora Duncan said, "Well, now they'll know what we are."
Speaker 1: Because your mother had some tone in her skin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, meaning not white.
Speaker 1: Because of her skin tone.
Speaker 2: That's right.  But that was the order of things then.  I don't blame her for it today; that's the way it was.

Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) funeral parlor [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: --your [paternal] grandmother [Cora Duncan] and your family on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the business on the--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --it was a mezzanine kind of thing.
Speaker 1: You're on the fourth floor.  Is this a walk up?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes; we had no elevators in those days.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Elevators were rare at that time.  That was unusual.
Speaker 1: And how many bedrooms was your apartment?
Speaker 2: I think there were three bedrooms.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how it was decorated?
Speaker 2: My mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] was very good at that kind of thing.  It was very nice.
Speaker 1: But--like what do you remember?  Describe what it looked like.
Speaker 2: There was a large living room on the 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] side where there were windows where Jackie [John Duncan III] and I used to watch--look out the windows all the time, at 7th Avenue and what was going on.  Then there were two bedrooms; there were--that was the living room, and then there were two bedrooms--three bedrooms going back; one was very small, by today's standard it's about the size of a closet, but a bed fit in there; it was Jackie's room.
Speaker 1: And your room was larger?
Speaker 2: No, not very much; about the same, about the same.
Speaker 1: But you had your own room.
Speaker 2: Ye- no--well, yes and no.  There were times when we were shifting around that it was--I had my own bed.  Sometimes I would--'cause Jackie--I had my own--ostensibly, let's say I did, but it was--there was some shifting around at that point.
Story_ID: 631742
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: The Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School] in Greenwich Village [New York, New York].  I went the first day the Little Red opened.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-two [1932].
Speaker 1: And the Little Red School House was a progressive education school.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the--what progressive education is?
Speaker 2: It was using a--Elisabeth Irwin was the founder; she created it.  She was an outstanding educator at the time--one of the first in the progressive movement in the United States, and she believed in teaching through experience.  We used New York City [New York, New York] as our laboratory.  We were moving around New York City freely, going to certainly museums; where I learned, where I studied was inside museums.  We had desks, but they were all pushed aside in a corner, where occasionally we would sit and write; sometimes we'd be doing our mathematics there, but other than that, we were all over the space with--we usually had student teachers from colleges and schools of education who were working with your own principal teacher in dealing with us youngsters; there were small groups of people, and we were engaged, we were involved, we were active.  Reading was supposed to be--we were well stimulated, so we were stimulated such that our interest would take us to reading.  It didn't come reading first and then experience, it was experience first and then reading.  There was clay modeling, there was woodwork, we had our own kiln, and this was in a day--today it's nothing to have your own kiln, but in the 1930s that was really quite extravagant.  It was heavily oriented toward the arts.  Our interest in the arts was elaborate, our interest in people who were being creative was tremendous.  They would bring the people into the school to work with us, to teach us, to educate us.  Lots of dance movement.  It was--for me, it molded my life, and we've traveled a lot, and with the traveled--it was the introduction of how to go into a new community; you go into it through the--for me, you go into that community through the arts; you look at the arts first.  That's what I learned at the Little Red School House, and it has given me a path that--like none other, I think; it's been wide open for me.
Speaker 1: It started as a public school, did it not?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: No, no, it was not, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: She had started--Elisabeth Irwin had started another, had worked at another school before she got the building there at Bleecker Street--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we could--you know, you're testing my memory.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  The--was it an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.  They were actually making an effort, a strong effort, to bring in blacks and other races.  My mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] was asked if, you know, "Can you help us bring in blacks?"
Speaker 1: So, now, in the 1930s, that there is a school, private school, that is actively seeking black students and students of other races, would be considered unusual, would it not?
Speaker 2: Yes, up to--yes, but Ethical Culture [Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York, New York] was doing the same thing, and later--many years later--I think The Dalton School [New York, New York] was more recent--they, too were looking for blacks, so this is New York.
Speaker 1: It is New York.  You went from Harlem [New York, New York] to Greenwich Village.  How did you get to school?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes I like to tell the story that I went by limousine--a chauffeur driven limousine.  After all, my father [V. Kenneth Duncan], my father was an undertaker and we always had a car.  Now, it wasn't always, we never travelled by hearse, I assure you, but by--but usually really it was by subway.
Speaker 1: And who took you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The 8th Avenue.  Well, for a while my mother would take us; for quite a number of years my mother took us, and then my brother, but he didn't--usually I was kind of--got going on the paints, and he said, "I don't wanna travel with her.  She smells bad."  So he didn't wanna travel with me.
Speaker 1: That what now?
Speaker 2: The paint--you know how paint smells?  We used to--and I would get paint all over me.
Speaker 1: Because you were doing art.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Jackie [John Duncan III] would say, "I don't wanna travel with her, I don't want to be with her."
Speaker 1: And your mother let you travel independently on the subway?
Speaker 2: With Jackie, yes.  Well, you could do that in those days; you didn't do it today, but yes, absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 631743
Speaker 1: What did you do for fun as a child in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I belonged to the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], and I used to swim a lot.
Speaker 1: Where?  Which one?
Speaker 2: 137th Street [West 137th Street Branch YWCA, New York, New York].  I did a lot of swimming.
Speaker 1: When did you learn to swim?  At what--were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't I ever didn't know how to swim.  Probably in Akron [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: So, what else did you do?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Swimming--what else did you do for fun (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] had me take ballet lessons 'cause I was knock kneed.  I didn't socialize; my brother socialized with the other youngsters in the community, I didn't.  I--they were mostly older; it just--happenstance.  The youngsters were mostly older at Jackie's [John Duncan III] age than my age, and I was a mother's child so she kind of kept me under her wing.  So there were the various activities.  And we--oh, we went horseback riding in Long Island [New York].  There was a lot of horseback riding in Central Park [New York, New York] in those days, but we didn't go to Central Park, we went to Long Island--there was a group of us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember now.
Speaker 1: But on the island.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  On Sundays.
Speaker 1: And your social set, was it--
Speaker 2: Mostly, it was the Little Red [Little Red School House; Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: --from the school.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So it was integrated from the beginning--from the earliest days.
Speaker 2: Totally.
Speaker 1: Did those kids come uptown to your home?
Speaker 2: No, not--well, a little bit, not very much, no, no.  It's mostly that I would go there; that happened actually with our sons, who were at Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York].  Well, Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III] was at--went to Ethical Culture [Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York, New York] when we came back from Asia, but I'm jumping ahead there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're still--you're a little girl still.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about your neighborhood??  What--as a little girl in Harlem [New York, New York], what do you remember seeing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard], and Jackie and I would look out the window, and on Sunday afternoons there would be the ladies coming from church, and they were all decked out with their hats and their high heeled shoes, and they were walking down the street and they were something else, let me tell you.  And there, there was a community feeling there, and there were low-income people certainly on--more on the side streets than what you saw on the avenue.  There were movies--the Renaissance Casino [Renaissance Casino and Ballroom, New York, New York] and the Alhambra [RKO Alhambra, New York, New York], and certainly we'd go.  We did go to, on Saturday afternoons we did--we would go to the movies for ten cents a head; it was lively.
Speaker 1: Given that you were in New York, Manhattan, Harlem, and everybody's kind of together.  Like you said, maybe it was the side streets, but there were poor people with wealthy people.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, you had some millionaires there.  C.B. Powell, Savory [Philip H.M. Savory].  They were--C.B. Powell was the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News], Savory and Powell were--had a lot of investments, outstanding investments.  They were millionaires in there.  And Mrs. Savory used to have big lobster parties that my parents would go to.  In those days, lobster parties were rare; today, it's nothing.
Speaker 1: And they lived near you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes; they lived--yes, they were--they had--he had--Savory had a car, chauffeur, a maid.  Well, he ended up by marrying his nurse, but we won't go into that--
Story_ID: 631744
Speaker 1: Was Harlem [New York, New York] integrated in terms of living (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  There--it was very much integrated because the other commercial owners lived in Harlem.  Those who--you found the undertakers and the hair--beauty parlors were usually black, but all the other businesses were white, and those people lived in Harlem; they lived there.
Speaker 1: And what were the relationships like between blacks and whites?
Speaker 2: It was fine.  It was easygoing.  I don't know that it mixed that well; I think there was a--I think there, there was quite a difference there as far as mixing, so I would not say that we mixed socially with the whites of Harlem.  No, I would not say that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember ever having an experience of racial conflict as a child?
Speaker 2: In Harlem, no, no, no I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We would cross the street--talking about the environment there--we would cross the 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard], and Officer Lacey, who was a great big strapping black policeman, he would stop traffic for my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens], and I was on--that was Mrs. Duncan, the undertaker Duncan's wife.  Tip his hat, cross the street.
Speaker 1: When you were downtown 'cause the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] is a very different environment, what was the racial temperature down there?
Speaker 2: Fine.  I'm sorry I--and just to be kind of with it I--but I can't, no.  I did not have that experience in New York [New York] at all.
Speaker 1: So, it was true, through your eyes anyhow, that the North was an integrated safe haven in a sense compared to--I mean in the South, at the exact same time, was very different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't generalize that; I'm talking about myself, my experience.
Speaker 1: Yeah, your experience, yes.
Speaker 2: I really can't say--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that that's true, but my experience was.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear your parents speak of challenges or conflicts regarding race?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were well aware of what was going on in other parts of the country, you bet, absolutely, yes.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, and as you say, your father's business [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York] prospered in part because blacks could only go to black undertakers.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember black only or colored only bathrooms in New York?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Story_ID: 631745
Speaker 1: You said you moved at age eleven.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: We went to Bethel, Connecticut, and then my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] remarried and we went to Danbury, Connecticut, and we were there through my high school years.
Speaker 1: So the move was prompted by divorce?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You wanna hear about that?
Speaker 1: Yes, please.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My uncle died--Uncle Jack [John Duncan] died, and he was the stronger of the two brothers, the Duncan brothers, and when he died, my father really began to drink seriously; he became an alcoholic.  In those days you didn't know really how to treat alcoholics as we do now, and my mother certainly didn't know how to do it, and then he had another lady, and that became apparent--suddenly, that became apparent that he did have somebody else.  We had--my mother had wanted to get out from under Harlem [New York, New York], and her mother-in-law [Cora Duncan], so she bought--my mother and father bought the place in Bethel, and so my mother moved--just moved out of Harlem, 2303, and moved us to Bethel when I was eleven, and she never returned to Harlem again.  That was the end of that.  About a year later, she remarried, and we moved to Danbury, and that's where the teenage years were.
Speaker 1: So, at eleven, for your parents to break up at that time, was that traumatic for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  What was--it was and it wasn't.  When we were in--I'm not crying; I've got some (unclear).  When we were--as I said, we would spend the summers in Akron [Pennsylvania] (laughter).  Daddy never went to Akron; he would--we'd drive to Akron with the car and the chauffeur and Daddy would be there, and as soon as we got there, there'd be a telephone call from New York [New York] saying, "Mr. Duncan [V. Kenneth Duncan], you've got to come right back; we've got a very important funeral for you, you've got to get right back here."  So the chauffeur was there, so he just went right back to New York.  So, Daddy never spent any time there, so we would--and that was for the full summer, so we were sort of used to his not being there.  He was a very loving father but--so his not being there was--and we had been through the experience of the alcoholism (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you had, you had witnessed that.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had--Jackie [John Duncan III] and I had, very much so, yeah.  It was a difficult time and my mother was on her own.  The money she was getting for support was from James T. Bradford; he had died and left everything to his daughters--his two daughters who helped to bring up my mother.  But that, that was what my mother was--that was still that money from James T. Bradford.
Speaker 1: So she always had independent money.
Speaker 2: I would say so, yeah; they were always making gifts to her.  The--her aunts, Aunt Blanche [ph.] and Aunt May [Mary Bradford], yeah, um-hm.
Story_ID: 631746
Speaker 1: Who was your mother's second husband?
Speaker 2: James T. Owen- James W. Owens.  He was Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], undergraduate and graduate, he was brought up from Long Island [New York]. His father was a racetrack clocker; he used to clock races.  He was quite a professional.  He broke the bank at Saratoga [Saratoga Race Course, Saratoga Springs, New York].
Speaker 1: And what does that mean, breaking the bank?
Speaker 2: They couldn't pay him; they didn't have enough money to pay for his betting.  He bet such that he went beyond what Saratoga bank could actually pay him.
Speaker 1: He was good.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, he was good, he was good.  He was quite wealthy and--
Speaker 1: And so when he met your mother [Josephine Bradford Owens], he was already wealthy.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  He had been to a--he had gone, he was at the--he had finished Juilliard.  He had not finished his graduate work, but he had finished his undergraduate work.
Speaker 1: What did he study?
Speaker 2: Music.  He specialized--he played piano, he specialized in the woodwinds--
Speaker 1: But his money came from collecting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, his father.  Oh, yeah.  His father left him with a German family in Long Island; he was raised--until he was a teenager and graduated from school, he was, as a very young child, as a child, an adolescent.  He--I don't think he had even adolesced, he was a little boy.  His mother died in childbirth and he was brought up by this German family, blue collar.  He made the comment that a white religious family could bring up his--a very religious family could bring up his child better than a black family.  So he was raised by Germans--white blue collar Germans, with a very different kind of rearing than what my brother [John Duncan III] and I had.
Speaker 1: So, while he was wealthy, he did not grow up with privilege.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: When he and your mother married, were your brother and you accepting of him from the beginning?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) What a question!
Speaker 1: How did you feel about him?
Speaker 2: Well, it eased the tension from my mother because she was a Bradford again.  She was able to be a Bradford and coming from her own background.  We had a very lovely home in Danbury [Connecticut].  It was a small estate, actually; we had horses, he had--he loved the latest cars; we had Jaguars and Porsches, and all of 'em.  Most outstanding of the fine cars, and we lived very well, but we were reared differently.  We'd been reared very differently so that it--we weren't close.
Speaker 1: That's a very politically correct way of putting it (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 631747
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Danbury High [Danbury High School, Danbury, Connecticut]--well, it started off with Main Street School [Danbury, Connecticut] and that was the junior high school, and then Danbury High School.  But I finished at Bethel High School [Bethel, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Now, Danbury, Connecticut at that time, what was the racial makeup there?
Speaker 2: I think Jackie [John Duncan III] and I were--we may not have been the only--Jackie went--he's older so he went right to the high school and I went to the junior high school.  I don't remember any other blacks being in the junior high school but myself.  In the high school, there might have been one or two other--I know there's certainly one other family--two other families in the high school then; otherwise we were the only ones.
Speaker 1: But Danbury [Connecticut] typically is pretty white--
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: --town.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Owens [Wharton's stepfather, James W. Owens] is black?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Why did--why was Danbury, Connecticut chosen as the place to live?
Speaker 2: We were in Bethel [Connecticut], and my stepfather, he did not--he'd had no love of--he didn't like New York [New York], he didn't like the pace of New York.  He was--he certainly had been at the Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], that kind of thing, you know.  He knew it, but he wanted to be out of the city, and since we were already at that part of Connecticut, they just started looking for a house nearby.  And they did get this place, it came on the market and it was a very good buy, so they--it was an estate; it was as they say, a small--I think it was eleven acres, but it was right on the water.  We had lakefront, we had boats, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Was that fun?
Speaker 2: Oh, wonderful.  Oh, yeah; that was great.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you sail?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I had my own canoe, I didn't sail, but we could canoed all the time.
Speaker 1: Who were your friends during that period?
Speaker 2: I had, I had great friends; I had a lot of friends, a lot of friends.  There was--there were three friends with whom I am still close.  We call ourselves the Danbury Darlings.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And who are they?
Speaker 2: One is Mary Christine Adams, and she goes back to, I think, probably the 1700s with the name of Adams.  She was a true Adams.  The other was Rita Feinson; her father owned two--her family owned two stores in Danbury; one was a clothing store and the other was a furniture store, and the third, Marian Heyman.  There was Heyman Hardware that she--her father owned, owned a big hardware store in Danbury.  And we used to--we were in the same--well, with our names being close, you know, Feinson is an F, Adams is an A, and I was a D for Duncan [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], so we were always moved together in the same homerooms, and then we would eat together, and we decided among ourselves who were the finest and who were the worst, and so we graded everybody.  You know how that goes.
Speaker 1: And were--so you were the popular girls.
Speaker 2: No, we were not the in group.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: We were not the in group, no, we were not.
Speaker 1: What were you?
Speaker 2: We were unique, we were.  We did things we'd--neither of the three--none of the three of us liked volleyball; we always had to play volleyball, so Rita found out that it was not necessary to play only one game in high school, so we decided on shuffleboard, and we went to the principal of the school and asked him if we could play shuffleboard.  There was a floor above the gym for an audience and whatever, but it was a wide floor, so they painted a shuffleboard for us and we played shuffleboard, the four of us.  Well, I guess it was really the three of us, but it was a small group of us.  We'll play shuffleboard while the rest of the girls were on the floor playing volleyball.  We did things like that.  Then, sometimes--I remember once, a lovely spring afternoon--it was a beautiful spring afternoon, and we convinced the principal that it was important for us to observe the flowers of spring, so we got--we convinced him that we should go to Lake Kenosia, my home, where we had--and we could be able to commune with springtime, and we spent the afternoon on the deck, on our float.
Speaker 1: At your home.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were--it was an academic effort.  We did things, we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were cunning (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  But he adored--for some reason, this principal was very fond of us.  He let us get away with all this nonsense.  He also--he was the one who asked me if I would be willing to speak for the American Red Cross; it was during the war [World War II, WWII], and the Red Cross was doing great things all over the community, and they were making a presentation to the whole school in the big auditorium, and he asked if I would be the student representative with the Red Cross, which I did, and that was sort of the beginning of my speaking career.
Story_ID: 631748
Speaker 1: And how old were you at this point?
Speaker 2: What--fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 1: In high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, English; I wanted to be an English teacher, yes, very much so.  I had a great English teacher.  I learned more from Rita [Rita Feinson] about math than what I ever did the teacher--the assigned teacher.  I--she did not--we just didn't click.  She would go over lessons with me--very hurried, haphazard way.  But it was in Danbury [Connecticut] where I think I had the--my first racial disappointment.  I was invited by the in group to join them at a Girl Scout [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] meeting one afternoon--free afternoon meeting, and we got along like, oh, we just had a wonderful time together and I was kind of the--I was well-received.  And the next morning--and we were gonna--we were planning for the next day.  "Well, tomorrow we'll do this and the next meeting we'll do this, that and the other," and there was a representative of the Girl Scouts there who was guiding the group, and she was very stern throughout the whole meeting, and the next morning, the girls had nothing--they said, "Well, we're not gonna be meeting; we're changing things around.  We won't be meeting again."  We never met again.  Why?  I don't know.  And my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] said, "My dear, don't ever let them know they hurt your feelings.  You just go through and hold your head high, and don't ever let them know that you were worried about it."
Speaker 1: This was at that same age, around fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your core friend group remained your core friends (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  Oh, yes; they did, definitely.
Speaker 1: And they were white, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But no issues at all with them regarding race.
Speaker 2: No.  I would say absolutely not.
Story_ID: 631749
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] meet Mr. Owens [James W. Owens]?
Speaker 2: Well, we were in Bethel [Connecticut], as I say, and we had common friends--the name of Carter [ph.]; I can't remember their name.  Huh?  No.  They were friends--I think they were friends of Dr. Powell's [C.B. Powell] and Dr. Savory's [Philip H.M. Savory], but they were part of that New York [New York] group and they weren't in Danbury [Connecticut] or Bethel, but they were close by in Connecticut and they had a home.
Speaker 1: And excuse me, Bethel was a town (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Small--much smaller town.
Speaker 1: --where New Yorkers were having their second homes--some?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why did, why you all choose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just--my mother was--she had a realtor.  With New York and with my father [V. Kenneth Duncan], she wanted to get out of New York, and she had--they were looking over the newspaper clips.  Houses would go on the market and mother just went.
Speaker 1: So, she met Mr. Owens.
Speaker 2: Well, she was entered--he was entered--she--he was visiting with the Carters and I can't remember their names (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's okay.
Speaker 2: --I can see them clearly in my mind's eye but I've forgotten.  It was a couple, and they knew him, and he used to visit them in their place in Connecticut, and the Carters knew my mother very well and he--they brought him over to meet my mother.  Just a normal kind of social interaction, nothing special.  And my mother used to sing for him.  He played the piano and she would sing.  She thought she was gonna--mother thought she had a lovely voice, so they had music together.
Speaker 1: And he was what age in comparison to her?
Speaker 2: He was about twenty-four.
Speaker 1: And she was?
Speaker 2: I don't remember; she was--well, there was seventeen years difference, you do the math.
Speaker 1: So, he was seventeen years younger than she.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Now, remember, she was a gorgeous woman and she could bat her eyes (laughter).
Speaker 1: And boy did it work (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, she could get anybody to just crumble.  She could--she was absolutely fabulous.
Speaker 1: And did he treat her well?
Speaker 2: He did.  You mean throughout the marriage?  He did and he didn't.  He had a terrible temper.  He used to yell at her, and that upset Jackie [John Duncan III] and me terribly.  My father was a gentleman, but he would yell, but then he'd feel ashamed and he'd go out and buy her something very extravagant--he did.
Speaker 1: How long were they married?
Speaker 2: Oh, throughout.  He was--throughout her life.  He was there at her funeral.  He--she stayed with him.  He stayed with her.
Story_ID: 631750
Speaker 1: And so you were in Danbury [Connecticut], and we were speaking about race and racial awareness.
Speaker 2: Yes.  As I say, we were--I had many, many friends but I had my special friends and interacted quite a lot with everybody.  When--there weren't great issues, but we knew that there were issues out there, but in this social world that I was very nicely accepted in, there was another group of girls who had, who had gotten together and we were going to form a club, and I had gone to some of the meetings.  I've forgotten what we were doing, but it was just a girls' club, high school girls' club, and then they came--the last meeting of the season, they came to my house on Lake Kenosia, and the mothers drove up in their cars to come and collect their daughters and went home.  Then, for some reason, we never ever meet again.  It wasn't 'til many years later here in this apartment in our study, that Chris Rotello [Christine Rotello], one of the three girls that I was telling you about?  Chris told me that what had happened was one of the mothers was out with the other mothers and said, "Do you know we went to pick up our daughters at Dolores' [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] house and her mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] came out on the deck to greet us?  Her mother is a Negress."  And that's why, I gather, they never, ever met again.  And then there was one other.  I was taking ballet lessons.  You know the--I started when I was three 'cause I was bowlegged--I was knock kneed, so dance was--and the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York], we danced all the time everyplace.  Mother put me in a ballet class on Saturday mornings, afternoons, and at the second ballet--second Saturday of ballet class, the teacher, who was a ballet dancer herself, came and said to my mother and me, "Dolores really shouldn't be coming to these classes; she is so good--she is a natural modern dance.  She's natural for modern dance, and she really shouldn't be studying ballet, she should be studying modern dance."  So, my mother kind of went along, "Ah, oh well."  She said, "Well, I can teach her modern dance, and I would love to be able to teach Dolores."  So, my mother thought, okay, this is a good idea.  She was not a modern dance teacher, she was ballet; there's quite a difference in the two disciplines.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But--well, I dropped out of the class and I went to teach--I went to study modern dance under her, but it has always occurred to me that there was a reason she didn't want me in that Saturday ballet class with the other young girls of the community.
Speaker 1: This suggests, at least in part, that some people didn't know that you were a child of color.
Speaker 2: Possible, yes; I'd say that's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was your mother browner than you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what about your brother?
Speaker 2: He--Jackie [John Duncan III] was even darker than--yes, Jackie was brown skinned.
Speaker 1: So, without conscientiously passing, in some instances, perhaps you did.
Speaker 2: Oh, I would not even use that expression with me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it may have happened; I think it just may have happened with other people thinking so, but I didn't know about it, wasn't my--I was not cognizant of it.
Speaker 1: How did you identify racially as a young person?  Or was it even anything you talked about?
Speaker 2: I don't think I talked about it.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of what was going on in the world--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --race wise?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  When I was a little girl at Duncan Brothers [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York], about five, six years old, I walked into the funeral parlor.  My father [V. Kenneth Duncan] was in there talking to a very brown skinned woman.  He introduced me.  I turned my head and started to walk away.  My father grabbed me by the seat of my pants and he whipped me 'til I almost cried.  "Don't you ever not speak to anybody; you speak to everybody," he taught me.  And since then, I've always spoken to everybody (laughter), you bet.  He did.  Daddy would not put up with that kind of thing.  His mother [Cora Duncan] would have.  No.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense, growing up, that you were privileged?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I knew that--
Speaker 1: And because you started out anyhow, in Harlem [New York, New York], and saw people who were not.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What did you understand about the difference between those with privilege and those without?
Speaker 2: That's just the way it was.  Nothing--I didn't think about it; it's just the way things were.

Speaker 1: Did you go to church when you were a child?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went to St. Philip's Church [St. Philip's Episcopal Church, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And when you moved to Connecticut, did you continue?  Were you involved in church?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] was divorced.  The Episcopal church did not accept it.  Now, the minister of the Episcopal church asked my mother to do anything--he would do anything for her that she wanted.  He would give her anything she wanted, but we were not allowed to go to the church.  And, of course, my mother was aghast, she was furious.  Of course she--you know, that was the end of that.  I mean totally the end of that.
Speaker 1: Even being in another state, it didn't matter.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was the Episcopal church; it's the church.  Now, this is the time she needed the church and she had--and going back to the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] days, the Bradfords were very much a part of the church.  James T. Bradford was a major contributor to the church in the Baltimore [Maryland] situation.  I mean he really did--big time.  But when we got--after that divorce, no.  And that's how it is I was bap- well, you don't wanna go that far ahead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's okay.
Speaker 2: I became married in the Marian Anderson Studio [Danbury, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, I don't want--because I want you to tell me that story.  Getting divorced at that time, breaking with the church as a result of getting divorced, how did the family react?  How did your mother's family react to her getting divorced?
Speaker 2: It--oh, there was no issue regarding the divorce; that was mother's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They understood.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It was the marriage (laughter); they weren't too happy with the marriage.  Because of the age difference, they just thought it was just not--it was quite bizarre, the age difference and that kind of thing.  The Bradfords in Philadelphia; they thought that was kind of strange, but--
Speaker 1: But they had no issue with her divorcing--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: --your father [V. Kenneth Duncan].
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything, I really don't.  It could have been but I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: 'Cause divorce wasn't as common then.
Speaker 2: Not--no, it wasn't.
Speaker 1: It wasn't common then, right?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.
Speaker 1: You--do you believe that they knew the circumstances?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That wasn't hidden from them.  They knew daddy was drinking, yeah.
Story_ID: 631752
Speaker 1: Now you're in high school.  When did you meet Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]?  You were in high school, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There was no social--there was no real social interaction with young men in, in Danbury [Connecticut].  There was one--no, I won't go there--and he would (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, I read that you were--you had a date with someone else, and then when you met--you went on a date with a cadet or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that was--yeah, well, that was much--that was later.
Speaker 1: It was later, okay.
Speaker 2: That was later.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] wanted me to interact more with--well, I think she did.  I think she wanted me to go up to meet--she was interacting with her cousin, the Fitzgeralds, who were in Boston [Massachusetts]; they had been--they were related to the Bradfords, the mother.  Bertha Fitzgerald was related to--she was related to the Bradfords, and mother went once to visit them, and she had me going up to Boston.  I went to Boston once to visit my cousin, and she had a party, a birthday party, and Cliff was supposedly at that party and I was supposed to have met him then.  I don't remember it--having met him; I had a lot of young men paying attention to me (laughter).  The year later, Betty [Betty Fitzgerald] invited me up for a--she was at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and she invited me up to a dance at Radcliffe, and she got Cliff as my date, and we met at Harvard Yard [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was what--eighteen?  We went to--we met in Harvard Yard, he took us to Adams House--for dinner at Adams House, and then we went back to Betty's dorm and got dressed for the dance; it was black tie, but--well, it might have been semiformal.  The girls were in long dresses.  And we went to the dance, we had a lovely time--just grand, just really delightful.  I've described this as, I felt like I was--what was it--Sarah [sic. Scarlett O'Hara] in 'Gone with the Wind,' dancing with Clark Gable.  Ooh!  He was gorgeous (laughter), he really was so handsome.  He's tall and thin, and he was Mr. Harvard, and oh, it was lovely.  Then the dance was almost over and Cliff asked Betty and me if we would like to come to his church the next morning, where he was serving as an acolyte, and we accepted.  We--you know, an extension of the weekend.  So, the next morning we got on the "T," and went to the black part of Boston--Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts]--and we went to the church.  We were sitting in the pews quietly, and we thought we were being very quiet, and up comes a little white priest with all of his British accent and pulled back and said, "How dare you speak at the House of God!"  Well, we just disintegrated, the two of us sitting in those pews.  So, off he goes, and he goes back to where the acolytes are, and he tells this story back there, with the acolytes, of these two girls who happen to be there inside the vestry, talking.  Can you imagine that?  Well, Cliff knew full well who it was (laughter), of course.  And the ceremony began, and he was going through with all of his incense and waving all this smoke all over the place.  That passed, and then we went outside, and there were lots of people outside doing their--you know, the little old ladies with their bonnets; they were all black.  It was a totally black church, and Cliff got his mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] and introduced me to his mother.  His mother was very stern.  She was a schoolteacher.  She was very much a schoolteacher, and she was very busy greeting people--her friends, the other members of the congregation.  And she greeted me and then she left, she went off someplace, and I was talking to Cliff.  And then she came back suddenly and said, "Cliff, Cliff, you have to excuse yourself from these young ladies, I want--," and then she said, "he has to go, he has to meet some friends of mine."  So, off he went, and we said, "Goodbye," and Betty and I got back on the "T" and I came back to Danbury.
Story_ID: 631753
Speaker 1: How long from then did you see him again?
Speaker 2: Well, I saw him--I dated his roommate Harold May, and I went back to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] a couple times--football games.
Speaker 1: So, when did you meet the roommate?  The same time?
Speaker 2: The roommate?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, ha--oh!  You're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you dated his roommate.
Speaker 2: Yes. Oh, well--
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was around all of this social life--he was part of it with Betty [Betty Fitzgerald] and whatnot; it was all part of the same group.
Speaker 1: So when did it shift from you dating the roommate (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in New York [New York], the war [World War II, WWII] had taken place, we'd been through the war and all that, Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] had been to graduate school in Washington [D.C.]--SAIS, School of Advanced International Studies [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies].  I was in New York, Cliff was in New York, and Betty came in.  We were both dating West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] cadets, and it--by coincidence, Betty was dating somebody in the class that I was dating somebody, and she said, "Can I come and stay with you?"  'Cause the Pointers were coming in; they come in about once a year and take over New York City.
Speaker 1: The Pointers.
Speaker 2: Yes, West Pointers.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They call themselves--in those days they were the Pointers.
Speaker 1: And you--just to set the stage, you're in New York, you're in school, correct?
Speaker 2: I was taking--I had gone to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] but I was taking a break.  I had--the war intervened.  I had to go back to Danbury [Connecticut] because of the war.  My mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] was alone in Danbury.  Both my brother and stepfather [James W. Owens] went into the [U.S.] Army; she was alone on the estate so I went up to be with her.  I went to Danbury Teachers College [Western Connecticut State University, Danbury, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: So, let's look at that a little bit more.  Were they drafted?  Were they--
Speaker 2: I think they joined so they could do what they want--would go where they wanted to go in the Army.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Jackie [John Duncan III] went to Germany.  Those specifics I really can't remember.  I have no idea; I can't--
Speaker 1: But they were both gone and your mom was by herself.  So you went home and--when you were at NYU, what were you studying?
Speaker 2: General ed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yeah--yes, yeah.  The--I always wanted to be an English teacher, so it would have been in that direction.
Story_ID: 631754
Speaker 1: This was before you were studying dance?
Speaker 2: This is at the--when I began studying dance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you study dance at all at NYU [New York University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I was taking night classes--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --at the--it's a place on 59th Street called the New Dance Group [New York, New York], and I'd go at night with another friend, and we would go over there and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As you--then you moved back home to be with your mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] while her husband [James W. Owens] and your brother [John Duncan III] were--
Speaker 2: --in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: --in the Army.  Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] was also--did he--
Speaker 2: He was out--well, at that time I don't know what the math is on that; I can't begin to tell you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --but where he was--
Speaker 1: Were you staying in contact with him?  Were you friends with him then?
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all, no.  No contact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, he sent me a picture of himself.  He was in--he was a cadet in the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces; U.S. Air Force], and I don't--you remember they used to have those hats with the goggles and the little lambskin collars, and he sent me this picture.  Oh, he was gorgeous.  He--and I gather he sent it to a lot of girls, but he did send it to me.
Speaker 1: And how did you feel when you received it?
Speaker 2: I was touched, I was touched.  I had a crush on him.  I thought he was pretty terrific.  I felt kind of badly when he went into the Army; I thought--my feeling was, this is such a fine talent, Cliff Wharton, that I felt it was a waste that he couldn't be going on with his education.  I was a kid at that point; I was--I think I was still in Danbury [Connecticut] when I came--before--
Speaker 1: How many years difference are between you?
Speaker 2: Ten months.  We're both the same age right now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for--until September, then, then he's a year older than I am.
Speaker 1: So, he's off doing his thing, you are being educated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Between Danbury--I was between Danbury and--there's NYU, there's Danbury, then I came--then my stepfather came home from the Army and I got right back into New York City [New York, New York], if you get my drift (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 631755
Speaker 1: And what did you do when you came back?
Speaker 2: I went to the Neighborhood Playhouse [Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And--set the stage, what was the Neighborhood Playhouse back then?
Speaker 2: It--actually it was on 46th Street at that time; just onto 5th Avenue--west of 5th Avenue, and then they moved to the building over here on 54th Street I think it is, with the great big red doors.  Sandy Meisner [Sanford Meisner] was there, Gregory Peck had just graduated--a lot of superstars.  Carol Veasey [ph.] was teaching English--was teaching speech.  It--there were a lot of--it was exciting; it was an exciting place, it was--actually, oddly enough, it was the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York], advanced.  The Little Red was very important to me.  It gave me a direction in life, it--life is exciting, it's fun, it's dramatic, it's dance, it's theater, it's music, it's alive, it's vibrant--that's what the Little Red meant to me.  I was in it, I was in it.  And the Neighborhood Playhouse was that, too.  So I was there and then I got very interested; I did extremely well in dance with Martha Graham herself.  I studied under Martha.
Speaker 1: What was it like working with her?
Speaker 2: Oh!  It was wonderful.  The dance--it is wonderful.  She got married; she married Erick Hawkins once.  You'll never tell why a man and a woman marry; it is not to be known, it is for them (laughter).  It was great.  Oh, Martha was something.  We could be dancing in her studio, and there was a--there's a studio she had on, on 5th Avenue downtown, and she had a fire escape.  You could be dancing in the floor with an outstanding teacher; Martha would stand up on that fire escape outside of the room, you'd be dancing--that whole class would be dancing to Martha in no time whatsoever.  She just drew you right to her--the dynamism of the woman.  It's not phony, it wasn't just showmanship; this is the real thing.  It was the charisma, the presence of the woman. Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] went out there once; I think that's when I really captured him.  He stood out on the fire escape; he saw me dance (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was your intention, at that point, to be a professional dancer?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I wanted--really wanted to go back to school.  The intent was to be a--I was having a wonderful time, I really was.  It had--things had just evolved so that I was there with the dance, with Martha, and it was a little period of time to get back before getting back into school.  I had every intentions of going back to school to be an English teacher.
Speaker 1: And about how old were you at this time?
Speaker 2: Nineteen, twenty, about twenty.
Story_ID: 631756
Speaker 1: And so you had every intention of becoming an English teacher but that didn't happen.  What did happen?
Speaker 2: Well, Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] and I took on New York [New York], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you reconnect with Cliff?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's where the West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] cadets comes in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Betty [Betty Fitzgerald] was coming--was--had this date with the West Point cadet; she was staying with me, she said, "Can I stay with you?"  "Yeah, sure."  I had an apartment--I had a room in an apartment.  "Can I stay with you?"  "Sure, come on in."  She said, "Well, I'm gonna contact Cliff Wharton.  Cliff Wharton's living in New York now; he's finished graduate school and he's in the city, so I'll contact him."  And she did, and she said--told, told Cliff, "Come help me with my bags 'cause I'm gonna--coming to be with Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], my cousin."  And Cliff came and picked me up at the apartment, took me to Grand Central station [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York], we met Betty and we came back, and that was the end of that.  We went off with the West Point cadets and we were running all over this town with the--they looked absolutely gorgeous, you know, those cadets in those uniforms, and running around New York City.  It was a blast.  It was charming, it really was (laugher).  And, and I got penned.  The cadet gave me the A pen--A for Army; it's full of pearls.  And then we said, goodbye, and the next morning, soon as this cadet said goodbye, the next morning Cliff Wharton calls me and asks me out to dinner.  I accepted, and then he asked me out for dinner, then he called the next morning, and he called the next morning, and he called the next morning, and he called the next morning, and he saw the pen--the A pen--and he said, "Why don't you send that pen back to that young man?"  So I did, and then we were just all--we just had a wonderful time in New York City.  We went to the theater, we went to movies, we saw Billy Eckstine, we, we went to plays, we went some--then he got cheap and said, "Well, let's do Dutch treat," and I said, "No, I can't do Dutch treat."  Then we started going to track meets; we went to the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York], we went to Staten Island [New York], we went to the Bronx Zoo [Bronx, New York]--we were just all over the city.  We had a wonderful time.  And the weather was absolutely divine; it was a--New York at its most spectacular.
Speaker 1: What time of year is this?
Speaker 2: It was--it started on April 8th, 1949; it was gorgeous.  And, and then we went through the summer.  He went to Latin America for Nelson Rockefeller, I went to Danbury [Connecticut] and was a counselor up at a summer camp, and he came back, we--the next fall, that's when he asked me to marry him, and it was just total--it was a year later, we were married.
Story_ID: 631757
Speaker 1: Where did you get married?
Speaker 2: In Marian Anderson's studio.
Speaker 1: And what was your relationship to Marian Anderson?
Speaker 2: My mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] and Marian Anderson had been high school classmates in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; they knew one another--there again, by happenstance.  We were in Danbury [Connecticut], and Miss Anderson married Orpheus Fisher [Orpheus H. Fisher] who was of--socially, a friend of my mother's from that eastern seaboard, Philadelphia society.  He was from Delaware, and they've got a property about three miles from us in Danbury--they became buddies.  We were in their house, they were in our house all the time; it was back and forth all the time.
Speaker 1: And was she--where was she in her career at this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, she was at a high point.  This wasn't at the end by any means, but it was getting more--it's about three quarters of the way through her career, I'd say, and we used to go--she had a wonderful estate, just beautiful estate.  She had horses too, so there was the horses and the music with my stepfather [James W. Owens].  He was over--he was playing--he used to tune her piano all the time, he was very good at that kind of thing.  But there was music, it was horses, there was Philadelphia, there was the black society, there was everything.  She entertained magnificently with celebrities from all over--S. Hurok [Sol Hurok], you know, the big names.  And we would just have the grandest time.  We used to go--they would all--sometimes they would invite us to go off when Miss Anderson was in concert in that area.  We would--they would say, "Come on and get in the car and go with us," and we would be part of her entourage in going to concerts.  I'd be backstage with her.
Speaker 1: And her--how far away from your estate was hers?
Speaker 2: About three miles.
Speaker 1: Oh, very close.
Speaker 2: Marianna Farm, on Joes Hill [Joes Hill Road].
Speaker 1: Great.  Well, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They so--they gave up--it was a magnificent house.  Mr. Fisher wasn't crazy about it.  He was an architect and he built another on the same piece of property, but he built a more contemporary home for them.  But they had a studio, a beautiful studio, which they built when she was still in the original residence.  He had built a studio for Miss Anderson, which is now in the Lib- which is now part of the museum [Danbury Museum and Historical Society] in Danbury, Connecticut.  They took the--Miss Anderson's studio, they made it smaller.  They keep saying it's the same size but it isn't, I'm telling you it isn't, it is not smaller.  I think it's smaller--it's not the same size, but that's all right.
Story_ID: 631758
Speaker 1: You have accepted the invitation to marry [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you're figuring out where you're getting married.  How did you come to that decision?
Speaker 2: We were in Danbury [Connecticut], at our house in Danbury, and my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] and I were talking about this business that she, we can't--where?  We can't go to the church, and Mr. Fisher [Orpheus H. Fisher], you know, as I say, they were popping into the house back and forth all the time.  So--what's going on today?  So Mother said, "Well, we're trying to figure out where Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] is going to be married 'cause she can't--we can't do the church here in Danbury."  So Mr. Fisher sat back and said, "Well, she can be married in Marian's [Marian Anderson] studio."  Oh (laughter), that was just the loveliest thing in the world so, of course, we were thrilled with that.  And he sort of implied there was a conversation back and forth about it; he said, "Well, probably about fifty people."  We--he said, "We couldn't really handle more than that--about fifty people."  It was probably about 150 people (laughter); it became a very important wedding, and a whole lot of people.  Every time you turned around there was someone who--we just have to invite this one and that one, and the list just grew and grew and grew and grew.  And then C.B. Powell, who owned the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News], said to Gerri--what was her name?  Gerri--no, no.  Major.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Major.
Speaker 2: Gerri Major; she was then the social editor for the Amsterdam News.  He said, "Gerri, I want this to be well done."  So Gerri Major came up with her photographer to the wedding, and every--and she just saw to it that there were a lot of excellent pictures.
Speaker 1: Now, Marian Anderson's studio was on the property of the estate.
Speaker 2: Mar- it was called Marianna.  The name of the estate was Marianna Farm.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the studio?
Speaker 2: It was one large, wonderful large room, it had the--I've forgotten the name of the woven rug.
Speaker 1: Raffia?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't raffia; it was like a raffia but it was a mat--it was very smooth.  A baby--wonderful--a grand piano, not a baby grand but a grand piano.  We had been--over the years we had been in that room many times for various affairs, but that's where Miss Anderson studied, worked with different trainers, and that kind of thing, who would come when--you know, other years in the summers we knew there.  It had a lovely bathroom on the side, and a little--a very tiny little kitchen place for hors d'oeuvres and whatnot.  No feast.  And then it was on a--Mr. Fisher had built a natural--almost a kidney--bigger than a kidney-shaped pool, but it wasn't sophisticated like today, it was supposed to have been natural pond, and it was lots of big stones, and then there was a bath house for changing clothes--for guests to change clothes.  There was a diving board, and it was on the countryside, so it was sunken so that all around were this beautiful blue hills of Connecticut.  It was just lovely; it was just a lovely spot.  Behind, as you come in from the road, there were a number of very large white barns, and then you travel down the road and then toward a hillside there was the studio and the swimming pool, and it was all wonderfully, beautifully scenic.
Speaker 1: And 150 people fit in the studio (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not saying it was really--I'm probably exaggerating but there were more people than which there should have been for the studio.
Speaker 1: Did you have seating for all of them?
Speaker 2: There was standing--there was standing room.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 631759
Speaker 1: What did you wear?
Speaker 2: I wore Aunt Blanche [ph.]--I wore Aunt Blanche's wedding dress.  I still have it.
Speaker 1: Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: It was lots and lots of lace--tiny, tiny, tiny.  I was tiny then, too.  It was white, lots of lace, it was--on top of a cream colored gown and a white lace.  All the way down it was just lots and lots of layers of lace, and the wedding--and short, practically no sleeves.  That was the fashion of the day.  And the dress didn't have sleeves either.  She might have had sleeves at the time but it was re- the dress was remade for me.  It was very sweet, very pretty, but the thing is it was Aunt Blanche's dress.
Speaker 1: And who married you?  Was your priest there to marry you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my dear!  Oh!  There were two priests.  There was the Reverend Shelton Hale Bishop, and he was the bishop of St.--he was the priest, his name was Bishop, but he was the priest of St. Philip's Church [St. Philip's Episcopal Church, New York, New York].  He had--when Duncan Brothers [Duncan Brothers Funeral Home, New York, New York] was--anyway, he did a lot of funerals for Duncan Brothers.  We went to the church, his Episcopal church.  We went to the church.  Jackie [John Duncan III] and I, as children, went to the church when Father Bishop was there.  He was very close to my mother [Josephine Bradford Owens] and my father [V. Kenneth Duncan], and he was a man of outst- he was a priest of esteem.  St. Philip's, I think, was the largest Episcopal church in the United States; it was black.  Then, Cliff's mother [Harriette Banks Wharton] had to have her own priest, so she brought a priest from Boston [Massachusetts]; he was white.  So, they both were up there praying.
Speaker 1: Both Episcopal priests.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they both prayed, so we were very well married (laughter).
Speaker 1: And were you, at some point, welcome back into the church?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was fine; I could go back to church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was your mother.
Speaker 2: It was my mother, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.  And was she ever welcomed back into the church?
Speaker 2: She never tried.  My stepfather [James W. Owens] was very religious, but he did not belong to a church.  I don't think he did.  They did a lot of radio, television churches and he read the Bible every night kind of thing.  He was that kind of religion that he came from with the German family--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --very different from what had been our culture.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the guests at your wedding?
Speaker 2: Oh, dear, I--gosh, I can't remember that.  There were, there were the Powells and the Savorys and--there were a lot of people from, from Cliff's [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] job with the Rockefeller Group [New York, New York]; there were certainly my cousins, there were--from Boston [Massachusetts].  There were a lot of the--Cliff's roommates and close friends and brothers.  My brother's friends, lots of the--they were older than I--the black social set from New York [New York].  It was very well mixed; it was mixed very well.  And Chris was there, Rotello [Christine Rotello], my--Rita [Rita Feinson] wasn't, Rita was at the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] so she couldn't make the trip.  Rita's sister was there.  It was a huge gathering.  I had classmates from Danbury High School [Danbury, Connecticut].  Actually, this--the woman who sang for me was a classmate from Danbury High School.  It was a very, very well mixed group of people.
Speaker 1: What year was this?  What is your wedding date?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].  April 15, 1950.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].  Where did you live after you got married?
Speaker 2: Riverton--the Riverton [Riverton Houses, New York, New York].  We got a brand new--we got a lovely apartment.  I had a dear friend, Mary Carmen Aldridge [ph.], who I knew very, very well before we were married, and we used to visit--Cliff and I used to visit with her, so we knew the Riverton apartments.  And Cliff went to the Riverton before we were married, and got our apartment so when we went into it, it was the first time I'd seen it when we went into it the night after the wedding.
Story_ID: 631760
Speaker 1: So in a way you've come full circle.  So now you're back in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: It did--please describe your apartment.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was sweet, it was lovely, it was charming, it had a living room and we had--from Rita Feinson's grandfather's store, Henry Dick [Henry Dick and Son, Danbury, Connecticut], the furniture store, we had gotten a wonderful sofa and two lamps, and the lamps were on cardboard boxes because we didn't have tables.  We--and we'd also, from Henry Dick, we had gotten bedroom furniture--French Provincial bedroom--and it was spanking new; the apartment was new, and smelled just wonderfully new.  And we had the foy- you walked into a foyer, which was the dining area, and the neat little kitchen, and I did swags.  We didn't have a lot of money so I, getting very artsy, got swags that I would drape over prongs for holding the drapes, and then we went--I--you probably never heard of Sloanes [W. and J. Sloane, New York, New York]; it was a wonderful, very fine furniture store on 5th Avenue--W.J. Sloanes, or something like that.  We got a marvelous brown chair, a brown velvet chair, and it was, it was just delightful, delight- a very happy little home.
Speaker 1: And how long did you live there?
Speaker 2: We were there for, I think no more than two--than about two years.  We were there about two and a half years because young Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III] was born--young Cliff--we bought another--we got another apartment.  He is very legitimate--no, dates were right (laughter) for young Clifton.  He was born in September 1952 when--we were married in 1950.  So we had gotten a second apartment when we had gotten young--when young Clifton was coming on, so he had his own room.  That's sort of the size of it.
Speaker 1: And what--were you still studying at this point when you had your first child?  What were you doing?  Were you working?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was; I was working at Lord and Taylor [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What were you doing there?
Speaker 2: I was there in sales; I was selling fountain pens.
Speaker 1: And what was Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] doing?
Speaker 2: He was with Nelson Rockefeller.  He was still in Latin America, dealing with Latin America.
Speaker 1: So, he was living there, with--
Speaker 2: In Riverton [Riverton Houses, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So--but his work was in South America.
Speaker 2: Yes; he would travel to South America.  We had South Americans--the summer before we were married, he went--he was there for about three mon- two or three months, all over Latin America--two months, all over Latin America.  And then after we were married for that time we were there in New York [New York] that--it was about two years.  There were--I don't think he traveled that much to Latin America, as we had lots of people coming in from Latin America, and Cliff is bilingual in Spanish, so they were always sending him out to the airport.  And we would go out to the airport because they had wonderful martinis, and we loved the large martinis that they served at the airport; they had--in the terminal where we would meet these South Americans, Latin Americans coming in, we would go out and have martinis (laughter).
Story_ID: 631761
Speaker 1: When you moved, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Cliff's [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] mentors, where he was working for Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller], believed that he should get his doctorate, and he looked at several universities.  He looked at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I don't know where else--certainly Chicago.  But then we--he decided upon Chicago, and then we moved to Chicago [Illinois] and we were there for four--with little Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III]--for four years.
Speaker 1: So your--when you were a kid, you moved at age eleven, so this was--moving after being married for a short time wasn't, that wasn't the first time you had moved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that was--
Speaker 1: --but what was it, what, to leave New York [New York] and go to Chicago wasn't a big deal at all?
Speaker 2: No.  Delighted.  It was great, just fine.
Speaker 1: And where did you live in Chicago?
Speaker 2: We lived right on the Midway [Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois] where that famous Chicago World's Fair [World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois] took place.  We lived in prefabricated houses, they were houses built for [U.S.] Army officers during the war [World War II, WWII], but the university bought them for graduate students.  There were a couple of hundred, maybe even more than that, families living in these prefabricated houses.  They had two bedrooms, they had a sink for washing your dishes, and a two burner hot plate, and I--we got a roaster oven.  That was it.  We had a potbellied fire--a potbellied stove to heat the entire apartment--the little house.  You could see daylight through the cracks in the wall, but we--I hated Chicago, I hated the life situation, I was miserably unhappy.  Then we came right around to Easter, and I gave up--'cause we had no money, we lived on eleven dollars a week.  We lived on--no, we lived on fifteen dollars a week for the three of us, and I gave up for Lent--I didn't, couldn't give up any money, or anything worth any money, so I gave up hating Chicago (laughter), and I turned out to just love it.  I love Chicago.  I had a wonderful time.  We had wonderful friends, just super friends--all students.  There were--we had a few black friends from our other years, a few, but basically it was all white.
Speaker 1: Now, you were on a budget of eleven dollars a week (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifteen dollars a week.
Speaker 1: Fifteen dollars a week.  How'd you come up with that budget?  What--was it because he was in school, or--
Speaker 2: Well, Cliff was--Cliff was working for T.W. Schultz [Theodore W. Schultz] as a graduate assistant--
Speaker 1: So that was the income--
Speaker 2: --and for the--in the department of economics at the University of Chicago.  And then my father [V. Kenneth Duncan] died and he left us--left me some money, so we were able to get a car and a television set (laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of car was it?
Speaker 2: Little Chevrolet, I think.  We called it the gray goose.
Speaker 1: How long did you live there?
Speaker 2: We were there for four years.  And we interacted with the Chicago students, with Cliff's graduate students.  They were brilliant, they were truly all brilliant people.  And I became--socially, we met a lot, and I began to really identify with the Chicago milieu, the community, the students, the--I became part of the University of Chicago.  I belonged to the Dames Club, I was invited to be part of a bridge club of some--of four graduate wives of professors at the University of Chicago, and it was a full, rich--lots of wonderful neighbors, all graduate students, it was a full, rich kind of world.  And at the same time, I went to night school to finish, finally, finish my degree in art--and I did it in art history.
Speaker 1: So, did you finish your degree by the time he was finished his?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 631762
Speaker 1: What did you all do after that?
Speaker 2: Then we--Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] joined--Nelson--John D. III, Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller III], and we came to the New York [New York] office; we were here for a--not quite a year, I think, before going out to Asia, and Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III] was at Ethical Culture [Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Young Clifton, that is.
Speaker 1: --before you left Chicago [Illinois], were, were you not teaching dance as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I was invited by a group of--to choreograph.  When I was at the Graham School [Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance] here in New York, I studied under Louis Horst; he was--he did a lot of choreography with Martha [Martha Graham], and he also taught choreography, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he became world famous.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes.  Oh, absolutely.  But I studied under Louis Horst--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --while I was at the Graham School.  So, I knew how to go about it and I did two--well, two years' performances at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And all this is as you are getting your B.A. from Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Now, before Cliff left, when did he get his doc- was this the doctorate that he went there for, the doctorate.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this was significant, was it not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Major.
Speaker 1: --that he was the first--
Speaker 2: --black in economics--
Speaker 1: --black to receive it.
Speaker 2: --a doctorate in economics, yes, in that particular discipline.  The University of Chicago's economics is really quite outstanding because it's known for econometrics more so than any other department in the United States.
Speaker 1: And for him, to your recollection, you know, being the first, I mean that means a lot.  Was it something he was conscious of at the time, or he's just going to school doing his thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was academically very strenuous.  That's what he was doing, that's what we were doing there, we were there to get that degree.  The race was not an issue then--that really wasn't what we were there for, to prove something.  He was there to--as a student to get his degree, and it was tough going, and we were, we were--fortunately, our marriage has always been wonderfully strong, but it was tough.  But there were other people there and hundreds of other couples there who were also in the same boat.  We were all--they were all struggling to get that degree.  Even little Clifton, when he had a birthday party, he went around delivering his dissertations.  So it's not his invitations, but, "Please come to my party, here's my dissertation."  It was--this is the whole mentality is to get that degree.
Speaker 1: I'd love for you to talk about that a little because, you know, for couples who are married and building their lives together, it can be quite a struggle to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --especially when there's--
Speaker 2: A child.
Speaker 1: --a child, and when you're getting educated, there's usually low income.
Speaker 2: Very.  There were some--Cliff had a couple of fellow students--we were--I don't like to be envious but I--there was one chap, he was very wealthy--he had his own sports car, and he was running around.  He was a graduate student, and he had an apartment, a real apartment, an apartment house.  Oh, my god!  An apartment and an apartment house?  How extravagant can you be?
Speaker 1: How did you, as a couple, weather the challenges during that period?
Speaker 2: Very well.  What I didn't want--I'll be very truthful.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What I didn't want was to become pregnant.  I did not want to become pregnant.  We could not afford a child, and this was no time to be having a child, and I took that very seriously.  It was after he left; it was a year after we left that we did have Bruce [Bruce Wharton], but you make your--you set your priorities and you work with them, and at this day and age, you can work with them.  You do not have to have children if you don't want them; if it doesn't work, don't have them.  There are other things in life and there are other times in life.
Speaker 1: Now--and this is way before the pill.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is about discipline.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 631763
Speaker 1: You finish your time in Chicago [Illinois], and where do you go?
Speaker 2: Came back to New York [New York], Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] had to finish his dissertation.  He had--he'd done all of his graduate--he'd done all of his classwork, but he hadn't finished his dissertation so we came back, and went back to Riverton [Riverton Houses, New York, New York] for a year.  We went to Riverton--we really went to Riverton so we could afford to send Clifton--Clifton III [Clifton R. Wharton III], to Ethical Culture [Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York, New York].  We have not gone on--never have we put the boys on scholarship in any of the schools that they attended.  We've paid full tuition for both of them.  So he went to Ethical Culture and we were able to afford it.
Speaker 1: Had you kept the Riverton apartment?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: So you were fortunate to be able to get back in.
Speaker 2: Well, they were lovely--yes.
Speaker 1: You kept a relationship with them, is that it?
Speaker 2: That's all part of the same society, you know--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Cliff III goes to Ethical Culture.  Why was that your choice of school?
Speaker 2: I decided that a more disciplined training would be better for Clifton, young Clifton, than what I had known at the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York].  It was freewheeling for me; it was uniquely wonderful for me, but I felt more discipline was better for young Clifton, and Ethical Culture certainly offered that.
Speaker 1: And Ethical Culture still is a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ooh, prominent school.
Speaker 1: --progressive.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: It is also progressive education.
Speaker 2: Definitely, yes.
Speaker 1: So, it's in the same vein--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --but more disciplined than--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Now, at the time that Clifton III is going to Ethical Culture, how racially diverse is the school?
Speaker 2: Not very.
Speaker 1: Still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot of upper-middle income blacks were there from Har- from Riverton; there were a couple of other families from Riverton there.
Speaker 1: And were any of the educators black?
Speaker 2: I don't remember; I can't say.
Speaker 1: And now you also have your second son [Bruce Wharton] at this point, is that right?
Speaker 2: Bruce is on--well, it was at the very end of the ye- we went through that whole year, practically, before Bruce came on--started coming on the way.  He was born in Singapore--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so we had gone through that whole year there in New York.
Speaker 1: And how, how many years was Clifton at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was less than a year, I think, there when Cliff was working on his doctorate, on his degree--on his thesis--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --and then we went--then we left for Asia.
Speaker 1: So, Clifton III was at Ethical Culture for a year.
Speaker 2: That is correct, and a summer.
Speaker 1: And why Asia?
Speaker 2: Well, that's where they found--that's where John D. III [John D. Rockefeller III] was interested.  That was his area of interest.  From Pakistan all the way over to Japan, that--and Cliff had four countries in his area of responsibility.  Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malay- well, five, Malaysia, and part of--from time to time Indonesia.
Speaker 1: And he went there to do what?
Speaker 2: He was an associate for the foundation [Rockefeller Foundation] in that particular area where he was making grants to the univer- and attached to a university.  He was attached to what was called the University of Malaya in Singapore [National University of Singapore, Singapore], and he made grants to the university for various programs.  He taught as a Ph.D. in economics; he taught classes, and he identified outstanding students to train to come to the United States to get their Ph.D.'s.  There were no--I think there were only--in all of Asia, I think there were only about two Ph.D.'s in, in the field of economics--agriculture development, and that kind of thing, in the--most of Asia.  They just weren't there, and Cliff was getting them ready to participate in the world scene--the, the Asian scholars.
Speaker 1: And what was Cliff's Ph.D. dissertation on?
Speaker 2: It was on Brazil--
Speaker 1: Huh.
Speaker 2: --Sao Paulo.  I think he went to Sao Paulo.  Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo in Brazil.
Story_ID: 631764
Speaker 1: So you moved to--where?  Where?  Singapore?
Speaker 2: We moved to Singapore, we were there for two years, and then we moved to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.  By then--well, soon aft- about a year or so after we moved to Malaya, it became Malaysia, that included Singa- that included temporarily Singapore and Borneo, and part of Indonesia which, some of the pieces later left, but Malaysia--Malaya became Malaysia.
Speaker 1: Yes.  When you first move there, you're in Singapore, so you moved to Asia pregnant.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And gave birth to your son in Singapore.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a Singaporean.  Great Britain still--Singapore was still under Great Britain, so he was a British subject, a Singapore citizen, and an American.  And when he was born, he was--and we went to the hospital rather fast, one afternoon.  They took him in and gave him--and entered him as--in the books as Chinese, and Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] found out about it, so he went immediately with those papers to the American embassy and got Bruce's [Bruce Wharton] own passport--American passport (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it was clear he was American immediately (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 631765
Speaker 1: You moved from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia], you're getting acclimated to being in Asia as your husband is working.  At what point do you begin exploring the work that you might do there?
Speaker 2: Immediately.   My interest was in the arts--as I say, the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York]--when you go someplace and you wanna learn about it, you go into the arts, so I did immediately.  I became interested in the arts scene.  The Malaysian--the Singaporeans and Malaysia had just gotten their independence from Great Britain, and they wanted to show to the world that they had a culture, a deep culture other than the British culture--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So they would encourage the artists.  They would encourage all art forms--poetry, music--all arts, whatever.  And for me, particular interest, but also outstanding were the painters of Singapore and Malaysia.  I went to every exhibition there was.  I loved it--I had a wonderful time.  And then I had a dear friend, an Australian friend by the name of Ina Gamba.  Her husband was very close to Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister, and she knew--she was just interested in--she knew Singapore and Malaysia; she was interested in all of it.  She was Australian.  And--well, plus, with the American embassy and whatnot, the world, that world was open to me and I loved it.  I had a wonderful time.  The food, the funerals, the weddings, the parties, the--it was exhilarating, and I just loved every minute of it.
Speaker 1: And when did you shift from observing and going to everything to doing some work?
Speaker 2: It took some time.  It was so dramatic a change going into Singapore with that culture that it took me a while to just settle down so that I took it for granted.  It--I did not take Singapore for granted really to the very end.  It was exciting.  And I think it was not 'til we went to--we came back--after Singapore, we came back to the United States for an academic semester.  I think for about three or four months we came back, we went to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] for three or months, then we went back to Kuala Lumpur.  And then I got more involved with that art scene, very seriously involved, and I became known, generally speaking.  "If you wanna know about what's going on in Kuala Lumpur art, contact Dolores Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton]."  Even Metropolitan--people from the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] were told--they had somebody coming out.  "If you wanna find out what's going on there, contact Dolores Wharton because she knows the scene."  I did, I followed it.  And then it got so that Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] finally said, "You ought to do a book on it," and so I--it was--oh, I guess it was sort of the last year or so that I started my academic work for my book, the 'Contemporary Artists of Malaysia: A Biographic Survey' [Dolores D. Wharton].  I knew these young people.  I followed them--I had been following them all along, so doing it was just sheer piece of cake for me.  I loved it, and I got a photographer, and went around, and I did a proper survey of them.  I had a set of questions that I asked all of them, and then I did a blurb on how I found their work.  And it didn't come out until after we were at--the book, you know, these things take time.
Speaker 1: Yes.  When were you working on it though?  What years?
Speaker 2: We came back in '64 [1964]--'66 [1966]--certainly '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966]--during that part.  I--well, we went back out.  We were back in the New York [New York] office.  We were back in the New York office for a while, and then we were living on 88th Street and 1st Avenue, and we were going--we were traveling out to Asia from 88th Street.  Cliff was, as I say, with John [John D. Rockefeller III], not--now.  He'd left Nelson [Nelson Rockefeller].  It was John Rockefeller, and we were going back and forth to Asia, and that's when I was still doing work--research on my book until it was finished in 19--and then it came out in 1970 [sic. 1971].
Story_ID: 631766
Speaker 1: While you were working on that, didn't you also develop dance programs over there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was asked by a group of students--Malay students--Muslim, Islamic students at the University of Malaya [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia].  There was great celebration when Malaysia became Malaysia.  This was a huge affair.  There were great celebrations, it went on for about a year.
Speaker 1: And around what time was this?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was huge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it's in the '60s [1960s], the middle '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Early '60s [1960s], yes.
Speaker 1: Early '60s [1960s], okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And there were, there were representatives from all countries and Asia coming to Malaysia for part of this celebration.  Many of them were coming with some very exciting performances--dance, and that kind of thing.  The Philippines, they were doing some really extraordinary dance work.  And the Malaysian students wanted--there again, they wanted to show their culture, so their dance was very (unclear).  The Malay dance was very formal.  You--women and men do not touch.  It's very routine, very formal.  They wanted something more contemporary, so they came and asked me if I would choreograph some pieces for them.  So, I got a group of them, it was a group of the Malay students, and we worked for quite some time over three--in our living room.  Wonderful marble floors, and you open up the side walls, and there are all doors, glass doors, and you pull them back and you're inside, outside.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We worked in our place and different places where, where I trained--where I developed the dances.  I used parts of their culture for the dances.  One was sepak raga, it's a ball dance--it was a ball, it's a ball that they kick with their feet.  You do not use your hands.  You can use your--top of your head, not your hands, and you kick with your feet, and I developed a dance around it, and the ladies around it, and that kind of thing.  Then there was the Ramayana.  Hanuman, the monkey god and whatnot, and I was able to get--there was a terrific artist who made wonderful masks of the Ramayana, and he was able to make these masks for us.  So we put the dancers behind a screen.  You put the dancers behind the screen, they move behind the screen in very slow motion, and it magnifies so that you--and the audience sees these huge figures, and in these very exotic headdresses, and then the dancers, my dancers, came out from behind the screen and onto the stage, and we went through the Ramayana, and that was fun; that went off very well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, the religion of Malaysia --
Speaker 2: This was folklore, this was--yes.
Speaker 1: --was Hindu?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Well, it--Malaysia is mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Hindu, but basically is highly Islamic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hindu, Tao (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But Ramayana is Hindu, is it not?
Speaker 2: The Ramayana is Hindu, that's right, that's correct, that is correct.
Speaker 1: And so that--you were bringing in that aspect of their culture in the dance--
Speaker 2: It was there, it was already there, it was very much there.  Those--
Speaker 1: But I mean since they invited you to draw forth from their culture, yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Story_ID: 631767
Speaker 1: When do you come back to the states?
Speaker 2: We came back between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia].  We were at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay, and then after that.
Speaker 2: Then we went to--that's when we went back to Kuala Lumpur for four years, and that's when I did the book--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and worked with the students--the Malay students.
Speaker 1: And then in 1970 [sic. 1971], the book ['Contemporary Artists of Malaysia: A Biographic Survey,' Dolores D. Wharton] is published.
Speaker 2: Yes, we were at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 1: When did you move to Michigan State?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: That year.
Speaker 2: We moved--well, we actually moved the end of '69 [1969] from--that's where the boys were at--both of the boys were at Dalton School [The Dalton School, New York, New York].  We'd come--we'd left--
Speaker 1: So, so what is happening with the children?  Because you're kind of moving every few years.  Are they moving, too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--oh, absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so they're with you where--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Definitely.  When Clift- in Singapore, Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III] was at the Singapore American School.  Bruce [Bruce Wharton] was a baby, very well cared for by amahs.  Oh, glory; you should never have a child without an amah, oh!
Speaker 1: And an amah is--
Speaker 2: A maid, a servant.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Chinese make wonderful servants.  And she helped me take care of that little boy, so all I had to do was love him--
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: --that's the way to go, let me tell you--just love him.  That was Singapore.  Then we moved to Kuala Lumpur, and Clifton went to a British school, the Alice Smith School, in Kuala Lumpur; it was totally British.  He had to learn pounds, shillings and pence, and spell with Os and U's.  It was not easy for him, the schooling, it was difficult.  They write--the British-trained children write a composition every day.  They come by their language well--they do.  He was bilingual in English and American-ese, and his teacher once in Singapore--in the Alice Smith School.  "You Americans!  You do nothing but watch the telly [television]!"  And he got a lot of that.  It was not racial disagreement there as much as it was cultural--as much as it was against Americans.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't anything we couldn't live with, but the British were annoyed with us.  We weren't the wisest people but the--I cover this in my memoirs, but we were not the wisest people in the world, we Americans out there.  We did some pretty dumb things but--
Speaker 1: It hasn't ended.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: You are at Michigan [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]; so the invitation to your husband was what--to come to Michigan?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: The--his job.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, as president he was--we were back in the--we came back in '64 [1964], and we were here from '65 [1965], really.  We spent a year in Palo Alto [California], and then we came here in '65 [1965] to '69 [1969]--through '69 [1969].  The boys [Clifton R. Wharton III and Bruce Wharton] were at Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York] and Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] was still with John III Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller III], but he was visiting universities all over the United States on a particular program that had him interacting with the agricultural professors here in the United States.  He became very well known as he moved about the country on a particular academic work, and then his name was submitted to become president of--well, say his name first was submitted to become president at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and there were other invitations that came up--Michigan State was one of them, and he and I particularly--he particularly cottoned to that, he was very interested in that.  And we went through a very interesting few weeks there in, in the fall of '69 [1969], and he was vote- it was voted on by the board of trustees of Michigan State University and he was made president and became president in 1970--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and took office in, I think it was January 2nd, 1970.
Speaker 1: Once again, he--this is a first.
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And it was at such a significant institution.  This was newsworthy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We knew this.  We were, we were aware of this move.  The others we took in our stride, but that presidency at Michigan State--his being awarded that, was something that we took--we were thrilled with it ourselves, and Cliff became quite well known for that assignment.  He was looked upon, throughout the entire nation, as having achieved something of great significance in the United States for himself and for the race, as a scholar--and president--and administrator.
Speaker 1: And with that extra bright light shining on him and the family, what was the experience for you as now stepping into the role of first lady?
Speaker 2: Dazzling.  The--you know, the deer in the headlights.  We were--every move we made, we were covered by the press--by photographers.
Speaker 1: Was that ever--did that ever create a daunting feeling to you that you were in the press with every move?
Speaker 2: No, it--no, I wouldn't say that exactly.  I would say I--you don't wanna jump ahead too much, but I would say after a few years it gets so it kind of wears on you.  It's less than exciting, it just gets to be grinding--you, you need a break from it.
Story_ID: 631769
Speaker 1: You even find that at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]--I shouldn't go into this--where there's some people in Cliff's [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] team--particularly the women, they would watch my every move.  And you just get so people are staring at you all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Given that environment, how did you fulfill your role?
Speaker 1: I knew it was something important that I was--it was something very important for me to do, for my husband and me, for our race--certainly for the university.  I represented them, in my own way, I represented them, and I knew that I had a critical role to play, and what I did and how I performed was significant.  We interacted with a lot of organizations dealing with other university presidents and their wives.  And at one point--at some point or other--I'm confiding in you now, I made the wish.  You know, you say, "Make wishes?"  And I wanted to be the most outstanding first lady in America of a university, with graduate schools.  I made that wish to myself.
Speaker 2: And what did you do to fulfill it?
Speaker 1: I did everything I could.
Speaker 2: Which was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, there again, what was natural to me--it was no effort.  I went to the arts, I went to the art department; that was--for me, that was just so easy to do, and I was welcomed with open arms.  Michigan State is known for its football, it is a football university, and I went into the arts which was not very well recognized.  It wasn't recognized barely at all.  They knew they weren't recognized.  I was pursued actually, by a newspaper reporter who came to be a wonderful friend at a very grand event.  I was--I signed off at the press.  The press had treated me badly at one point, and I said, "I'm gonna have nothing to do with the press."  And then we went to this event that was given in our honor, and there was a newspaper reporter from the Free Press [Detroit Free Press] news, and she chased me aro- she chased me 'cause I was running away from her.  And so she came after me and said, "Mrs. Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], I'm not gonna hurt you."  So that stopped me in my tracks, and I slowed down, and she came and said, "I really want to interview you.  I'm not gonna hurt you."  I had been hurt.  So we sort of made friends and she came to campus, to Michigan State, and she did a wonderful article on me and my interest in the arts, and what I was doing.  I had a--I brought the arts in Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House, East Lansing, Michigan].  Cowles House is a--it's a president's residence, it is a mansion, it is--as I knew it, it was absolutely a mansion; it was gorgeous, it was just beautifully done, and very well respected.  Like the White House is in Washington [D.C.], Cowles House is respected on the campus of Michigan State.  I borrowed the art from the artist--the studio artist, not the--I did not deal with the students, I dealt with the studio artists, the teachers, the professors.
Speaker 2: At the university.
Speaker 1: At Michigan State.  They--the chairman of the department and I had a room full of their art--of the student--of the professors' art, we selected art to come into my home in the public places, not in our private places, and it made a big hit.  Then John Whitaker [ph.] at the Free Press, gave me a big splash one Sunday--that did it.  I was in.  You know how you get into your computer?  You're in (laughter)?
Speaker 2: And what did you do after that?  So, now you're curating (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well then I, then--yeah--well, about every three months I would change the art, and the artists were delighted--the studio artists--they were delighted.  So I had the house full of art.  Surrounded, paintings, clay, ceramics, sculpture--it's a big, beautiful house.  I entertained four thousand people a year in that house.
Speaker 2: What were some of the events that you hosted?
Speaker 1: Well, the big ones are, of course, the graduations.  Every graduation, I entertained the graduates.  Not all of them came, thank goodness, but we--they ran for three nights.  That was the big ones.  But then we had celebrities.  They were guests of the university, people who--outstanding people who were speaking on campus, always outstanding--we had--good lord, I can't begin to name the people that we had, you know--Walter Cronkite.  I just can't name them; they were just--a long list, all celebrities.  And very often I would have receptions and dinners, and teas, and all kinds of things.  And then we had a lot of alumni, and we had what we called a president's club, which Cliff and I expanded to be quite sizeable; I think they had a small, very small number, fifty, sixty members, and we expanded it to hundreds.  Managed--just bloomed, it blossomed, it grew huge, it grew quite wonderfully.
Story_ID: 631770
Speaker 1: What influence do you believe you had on your husband during his tenure at [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now you can ask him that.
Speaker 1: This is your interview.  I mean, you know, the--in a great partnership?
Speaker 2: I think it was the romance that we've just always had in respect and regard, and love and affection, and the intelligence that we both bring to the relationship.  And I had a particular vantage point that Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] couldn't get in his office.  I interacted not only with the people I've discussed, but also I interacted a lot with the students.  They would--we had just come from Asia; we had--Vietnam was in Cliff's area of responsibility.  We went in there, I went into Vietnam, so the students were coming to our doorstep protesting the Vietnam War, and I would invite them in.  We sat on the, the carpets--beautiful carpet there at Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House, East Lansing, Michigan] and we would--I could talk about Vietnam, I had just come from Asia.  I--it was part of my experience so that--and we went out to the dorms and visited with them, so there was a--it was full, it was very full (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you were in Vietnam before--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, before the war (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the war.
Speaker 2: --and went to Vietnam and to Cambodia.  I went into Cambodia, too.
Speaker 1: Having been there before the war, and then seeing what's happening with the war, how did that affect you?
Speaker 2: In what way?  Where?  Where are you--
Speaker 1: Just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean in general, or with the students?
Speaker 1: Starting with you.  I mean you saw Vietnam and Cambodia pre-war, when you got to meet the artists and see the beauty of the countries.
Speaker 2: I did, and of course when we went to Vietnam and to Cambodia, we saw, we saw the ancient art, we saw the architecture.  It was magnificent.  I loved it, I loved--and the people were lovely, they were wonderful, they were dear, and we were going out and killing them, hm?  So, I had a lot to talk about with the students.
Story_ID: 631771
Speaker 1: And when the students protested--because it happened all over the country, including there.  Because you had been there, was that helpful to them--the interaction?
Speaker 2: I strongly believe that it was, yes.  Yes, we had credentials of having been there.
Speaker 1: But your credentials were not suggesting that they should go and fight.
Speaker 2: The--what Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] wanted was not to close the university [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  The students were protesting to close the university in the name of the struggle against the--of keeping the university open and not recognizing the struggle that we were in politically.  Close the university.  Make your statement.  Close the university.  And Cliff said, no matter what, he was gonna keep the university open, and he did, he never closed it.  They protested.  There was police in there, they heard aircrafts, tear gas, shot once at our windows in our house, you know?  We, we went through it all--went through a lot.  But by--my feeling is Cliff were--my feeling--for my part I'm gonna see to it Cliff Wharton comes outta this thing right, that's what I wanted.  And meeting with students, meeting with all of them, it was a drive that I felt, that it--Cliff was going to do this thing and do it as--for my part, he was gonna do it and he was gonna do it the best he could--we could, and we were a we.
Speaker 1: Were--was Clifton III [Clifton R. Wharton III] at this point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Dalton School [The Dalton School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: --so he was still too young--
Speaker 2: --at the first year.
Speaker 1: --to go to war [Vietnam War].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--no, he wasn't, he wasn't old enough to go in the [U.S.] Army, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have that conflict.
Speaker 2: No, no.  But he was, he went to the March on Washington and he was wearing--he--his first visit he did not--he stayed in New York [New York] when we went to campus in '69 [1969], when Cliff's taking office in '70 [1970]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Cliff stayed in New York for the rest of that year.  It was his last half year at Dalton, so he stayed here in New York with some friends for the--for those last several months, so he came out to visit us on campus, but we were already there and he came out in his outfit for having marched on Washington [D.C.] and he--I couldn't meet him at the airport because the campus was closed off because there'd been a protest and the police had closed off the campus from the outside.  So Clifton had to get out of the taxi, taxi couldn't come into the driveway, into the campus, so he got out of the cab said, "I can't take you any further," so Cliff got out of the taxi and went to the police and said, "I'm looking for Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House, East Lansing, Michigan]," and he said, "Well you can't go to Cowles House, campus is closed.  Who are you?"  He said, "I'm Clifton Wharton."  And the campus policeman said, "Yeah, right."  (Laughter) So, then he said, "Well, I really am."  So he showed his badge, and so he--the policeman escorted Clifton to his new home.
Speaker 1: Now, your art program that you developed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Cowles House?
Speaker 1: --at Cowles House became a television show.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was lovely.  It was the chairman of the art department and myself, and we went through the various pieces that I had in the house, in Cowles House, and spoke of the artists and what they were doing, and how they were doing it, and gave a full view of the art in Cowles House, and it was very well received.
Speaker 1: And not long after that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you see it?  Have you seen it?
Speaker 1: I saw the video.
Speaker 2: You did.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  Spectacular.
Speaker 2: Good.
Story_ID: 631772
Speaker 1: I'm assuming in this timeframe it was not long after that that you were noticed by the president, by president [President Richard Milhous Nixon]--
Speaker 2: --of the United States?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Weren't you then appointed to the National Council on the Arts?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he sort of gets into it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, how did that happen?  This is--both of these things are--happen in 1971, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your film and then your appointment to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was on my boards by then--my corporate boards by that part.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then let me--that's--so in terms of the timeline (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The corporate boards came before the arts endowment.
Speaker 1: In terms of the timeline, when were you appointed to your first board?
Speaker 2: Well, that I don't exactly remember.  I guess it was '70 [1970]--I think Phillips Petroleum Company [Phillips 66] was in 1976.
Speaker 1: So this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot happened in seventy--between '74 [1974], '75 [1975], '76 [1976], a lot began really to happen for me.
Speaker 1: The National Council on the Arts, this suggested that happened in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: The Michigan Council for the Arts [Michigan Council for the Arts and Cultural Affairs]--
Speaker 1: Okay, perhaps that's what it is.
Speaker 2: --and the Michi- the governor [William Milliken] was very generous to me.  He appointed me to the governor's committee on--special committee on architecture, and there were a number of appointments statewide (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the appointments began statewide while you were at Michigan.
Speaker 2: Statewide, definitely statewide, yes.
Speaker 1: And then your book ['Contemporary Artists of Malaysia: A Biographic Survey,' Dolores D. Wharton] has come out, so that's giving you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the book had come out, I'd done some television programs, so I had a great deal of visibility at that point.  They knew who I was, and I was recognized as--they also knew where I came from.  I had a persona, I--and also with the students 'cause sometimes I made nighttime television with the students coming and protesting thousands at a time at the Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House, East Lansing, Michigan], you know--that kind of thing, and I would come out and talk to the students, so fortunately, I was making sense, and so there's integrity there, and this made me a candidate in the board room for--they were looking for blacks and they were looking for women of stature, and whom they knew.  And you are well reviewed before you're even approached to be a director--an outside director for a major American corporation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So evidently, I was making sense, and I was invited on the boards.
Story_ID: 631773
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about your stepping into a more public role, and you began to be invited to sit on boards.  Can you describe how that began?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there was all this visibility going on there at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  As I was saying, it was just rather full--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it was working out for me extremely well, and Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] was getting a lot of attention for being the first black of a major university--president of a major university, and I was coming on okay, pretty good in the press, and I was getting quite a bit of press.  I even--how did that come about?
Speaker 1: Well, let me say this.  Cliff also mentioned that part of what you did together was a listening tour in Michigan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, with the students?  Oh, yes!
Speaker 1: And then the--which led to the fundraising.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  Yeah, we did, we did.  We--one of his--I think it was his provost, Larry Boger [Lawrence L. Boger], who was very well--he was an agricultural economist, he was very well known in the state, and it's a lot of people saying, "Well, we don't know who Cliff Wharton is." The people out there in the hinterlands, "We don't know who he is."  So, Larry Boger said, "Cliff--," he was one of Cliff's brain trust.  He said, "Cliff, you want to get out there and meet the people."  So, they organized a tour, like the presidential tours?  And we went all over the State of Michigan on tours, and we went with an entourage.  We had, oh, about three or four deans and their wives, who would go with us, and we would go out, and Cliff was the lead speaker, and then I would talk about--he would speak for a half hour or so, then I'd come in maybe about the last ten minutes or so, then questions would come up about the students.  "How are the students doing?"  Well, I had taken--gotten invitations from the students in the women's dorms to come and visit, so I went and--two or three times, as guest in residence and spent a week in the dormitories sleeping with the students--with the--and that's when I found out what was going on.  So when I spoke, I spoke with some authority 'cause I knew what was going on.  I'd been in the dorms with the, with the students.  So, I would talk about--that was my conversation.  So it was more and more of being well known through the State of Michigan and appearing.  I got to be very, very comfortable in speaking publicly, and then sometimes Cliff would have--he had so many invitations he couldn't make them all, and my name was big enough so that they--sometimes they accepted me, so some of his important--I accepted some very outstanding awards for him, actually.
Story_ID: 631774
Speaker 1: So, there was recognition and it was through that--we had been talking about getting on the boards?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think it was through that that I got a phone call.  It usually starts with a phone call--an invitation for a lunch, from a CEO's secretary, or vice president or something, and I--for Phillips Petroleum [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] was my first (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Michigan Bell [Michigan Bell Telephone Company]--
Speaker 1: Michigan Bell!  Yes!
Speaker 2: And that was 1974.
Speaker 1: Dave Easlick [David K. Easlick], Dave Easlick--yes, that's right.  I got a phone call from the office and invited me to come and have lunch, and the head of Michigan Bell--the CEO of Michigan Bell and his number two came to Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House, East Lansing, Michigan] and picked me up and took out to a local restaurant, and we talked about all sorts of nice pleasant things--I knew what was going on--and then he said, "Well, we're very interested in having you come aboard as a director of Michigan Bell Telephone Company.  Would you be interested in that?"  "Well, yes, I think I'd be interested in that," and that's the way it always began.  You'd get a phone call from somebody very outstanding, and he'd invite you out to lunch, and that's where it happened.
Speaker 2: And these--now, these are--
Speaker 1: CEOs.
Speaker 2: --CEOs meeting you, inviting you to be on boards.  These are paying boards, correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Very different from not-for-profit.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Opposite.
Speaker 2: And you came on that board as the first woman and first black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Every board I've been on, except for one, that, that was the Michigan National Bank [Lansing, Michigan].  There was a woman on that one before I went on, but on all the others--I was first black on that, but with all the others, first woman, first black.
Speaker 2: And in working on these boards, what are you bringing to the board?  What are you bringing that's unique?
Speaker 1: I think it was more unique that I felt that I had--I was representing other women and others as a voice to be--to participate.  I had a place at the--we had a place at the table.  By George, we were here!  I'm at the table with you--with these men.
Speaker 2: And it was often just you, the only woman (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, for years, for years.  Finally, the women's--
Speaker 2: Was that intimidating at all?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Was that intimidating at all?
Speaker 1: No, I loved it (laughter).  Don't put that on (laughter).  No!  I was the Queen Bee.  I was, for a long time.  But I welcomed the other wo- Rosalynn Carter was the second woman on the Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.] board.  She called--Rosalynn called me up on the telephone and before she went on--before she accepted it, and wanted to know how it was, how did I like it, and she was thinking of coming on, and what did I think about it.  Yes, she did!
Speaker 2: What were the different boards that you joined?
Speaker 1: Well, I had Phillips Petro- well, I had Michigan National Bank, then Phillips Petroleum, big time, Kellogg [Kellogg Company], big time, Gannett the newspaper com- you know Gannett, big time.  Oh, god, what were some of the others?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  COMSAT [Communications Satellite Corporation].
Speaker 1: Oh, COMSAT was another one, and then there were a couple of small ones like Golub Corporation in Albany [New York], and KeyBank in Albany.  Oh, and then I was a--one member of a group of seven men and myself, we started a bank in Albany, the Capital Bank and Trust Company.  We started it.  It's--I think it's still up there now.  I sold all my stock when we came to New York.  Well, I don't know.  I don't belong anymore but they've been--there were a few.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And New York Telephone [New York Telephone Company] before it was AT&T [AT&T Corporation; AT&T Inc.]; we were still Ma Bell then.
Speaker 2: At what point were you--did you reach critical mass with these boards?  How many boards were you on at the same time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, we made it such that I never served (laughter)--I never served on more than four boards at any one time (laughter).  Four was a lot (laughter), but then I had the not-for-profits that I was serving, like the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], which was a big baby, and a lot of other side organizations.  I was busy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where you were volunteering.
Speaker 1: Yes, you're bought in--not-for-profits you're asked to give money.
Speaker 2: Right.  More than volunteering.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  Basically, it's how much you're gonna give.  With the profit making it's the other way around--you get paid.
Speaker 2: So this became full-time work for you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty busy.  Well, plus I was mother, I was--I had my responsibilities at the university [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], I was doing a lot with Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  We were appearing all the time on campus--going out to dinners, going--constantly with students, with--big affairs that would come--always something big; some department was doing something big and important.  There were always graduations, there were always prominent people coming to campus, we were entertaining them at Cowles House.
Story_ID: 631775
Speaker 1: How many years were you at Michigan [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: And during that time, you helped to develop a fundraising initiative.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was president of the club, the Presidents Club--yes.  The enrichment program.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Well, John Hannah [John A. Hannah] was the first president--well, I can't say that; I know he wasn't--he did not believe it was necessary for the university, as a state university, to have an active fund--presidents' fundraising organization.  Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] did, and so he made a--he wanted to build it up.  And then Cliff wanted to do some other important things on the campus, but then I became very interested in our having a performing arts center at Michigan State University, and I was doing a lot with the--there was a theater on campus, it was a WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] construction, and the wooden seats--collapsible wooden seats--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and we had outstand- it was, they had electric concert series--had very outstanding performers coming.  It was a big audience, so they had very outstanding performances coming in to perform on campus, but this dreadful auditorium to show in, and there was a young man who was very much involved with electric concert series, and he--there was the thought of having a performing arts center, and this is something I was--I thought was fabulous; we should do this.  And Cliff Wharton thought this was--he said, "No great university should be--." Cliff Wharton said, "No great university should be without a performing arts center."  So, you put that mix together, and we were off and running, and that was part of the enrichment campaign was for a performing arts center, but there were other initiatives that Cliff had in mind for the full enrichment campaign.  But for me, it was the performing arts into that segment.
Speaker 1: And how much money were you able to raise for that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I think--well, I think it was something like $18 million.  In those days, it was a lot of money.  Today it's (laughter), it's nothing.  But it was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: And, and you did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And for the arts?  My god!  There were people on campus that thought this was the most ridiculous thing they had ever heard of--for the arts?  And one senator, state senator--said, "I'm not gonna vote for having somebody running any men running across my stage with tutus on" (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, of course, you did raise the money and build the building [Clifton and Dolores Wharton Center for the Performing Arts, East Lansing, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yes, we did, yes, we did.
Speaker 1: And the building is--
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't raise all the money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We left.  Cliff had--Cliff accepted State University of New York [State University of New York System] before the money was all raised.  That's the one thing that hurt us in our hearts--that we didn't finish the campaign.  But he did--we did go to State University of New York.  It was well--the initiative had gotten well started, but we hadn't acquired all the money before we left.
Speaker 1: So when was the building built, and named for the two of you?
Speaker 2: We were well--we had been at SUNY--I think we were there all--totally, I think, nine years.  We were about five years into our life there at State University of New York when we got a phone call.  We were at dinner one night and we got a phone call, Cliff went out--left the dinner party and went out, and he came back and he said, "Have I got a surprise for you!"  And they had named the center for us.  It was really quite something.  That touched the heartstrings.
Story_ID: 631776
Speaker 1: Your moving to SUNY [State University of New York System] occurred when?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: And--now, this role is to oversee all of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-four campuses, he had.
Speaker 1: Sixty-four campuses, that's a big job.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you bet.
Speaker 1: Where did you move--where did you come to when you--
Speaker 2: You don't wanna hear it (laughter).  You don't wanna hear--god (laughter).  Now, I had been in Cowles House [Alice B. Cowles House, East Lansing, Michigan], and all I've described about Cowles House.  Well, this place, it was Dracula's house.  (Laughter) 'The Addams Family'--remember 'The Addams Family' on television?
Speaker 1: I do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was great.  That was a great house for them.  It was a--the ugliest house you've ever seen in your life (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was it?
Speaker 2: It was in Albany [New York], it was in Albany, and in a well to do section in Albany but it was ugly.  It was all discombobulated--what was on the first should have been on the second floor.  It--they had a thermostat on--upstairs in our bedroom; you could pick it up (laughter) and take it off and walk around with it--that was your thermostat.  But anyway, that passed and I--they were looking--we were looking all over Alb- they promised me another house, and they were looking all over Albany for a house, and then--this is supposed to not be a true story, but it's my story anyway.  Ada Louise Huxtable of The New York Times--well, I think it's a true story--convinced Nelson Rockefeller that the State University--that the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Building [SUNY System Administration Building, Albany, New York], which was the Cloth Hall building from Ypres, Belgium, was a copy of it on the waterfront there in Albany--beautiful, old, elaborate--gargoyles and everything.  Nelson--he did make the decision that that--I don't know about the history with Ada Louise Huxtable, but he did make the decision that that should go to the State University of New York, and they put their headquarters in there.  There were two huge towers.  Well, one dead center, and one small one on the side.  I saw that small one on the side and I said, "I wanna go in there."  So, we moved--I had three floors with two elevators in the middle, and we--I was able to work with the architects in designing those three floors for our private residence and it was a knockout--it really was.  It was round, so you could--the sun came in from all around.  We had a schnauzer, and the schnauzer'd go from one window to the other to sun, sun herself--it was charming.
Speaker 1: And how long, how long (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were there for nine years.
Speaker 1: How long did you have to live in Dracula's house before you moved into this one?
Speaker 2: Not quite a year, but we were in there for a long time.  And you know how well I said we were received there at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], well, there was one point I remember walking around there, and the--some official working around there; it was kind of like, "Lady, would you please go find yourself something else to do?"  (Laughter) I was saying, "Well, you know, what can I do to be helpful?"  "Please go find something else to do."  They didn't wanna be bothered with me.  I went on tours with Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].  As we did tours at Michigan State to all the students, I--Cliff visited all the campuses--of the sixty-four campuses--every one of them, within a year, and being a good wife, I accompanied him.  And that--finally got to one campus, oh, about the fourth or fifth campus out, and I was called by the president into his office 'cause he wanted to meet with me without Cliff.  So I went and I sat down with him.  I was on all my boards at that time, too.  And he said to me, "You are too intelligent and involved a woman just to be coming on these tours for entertainment and to be greeted by students and art departments.  Why are you coming on these camp- why are you coming on these tours with your husband?"  So I said, "It was just to find out about the university."  He said, "Well, we have the feeling that you're coming in here to find out what we're doing so you can tell Cliff Wharton."  (Laughter) I stopped going; I--then after that, I wouldn't go to any other campus unless I was invited by the president--I didn't go.  So he did all the rest of the other tours by himself.
Speaker 1: They were scared of you.
Speaker 2: Oh!  Well, they didn't know what I was up to.  I wasn't up to anything, I really wasn't, I was just being with Cliff and going to see the campuses-- what this, what SUNY is all about.  I was just--but he didn't believe that.
Story_ID: 631777
Speaker 1: After you were--you're in Albany [New York] now, you became a trustee of the Albany Institute of History and Art [Albany, New York] and the Albany Law School [Albany, New York]; these are two different--
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so--oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what--you moved to Albany in what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]; so this is two years later--this is '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So we have reached--let's at least begin to talk about the Fund for Corporate Initiatives [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.] 'cause we're there.  You--I believe the context is you've done all of this work with different boards, and now you decide to create your own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What could I do?  My question to myself was--I was on these boards, and I had started--at both Phillips Petroleum [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] and Kellogg Company, I inaugurate--I started the committees--the Fund for Cor- the corporate social responsibility committees.  Now, this is where you can get--any work that you do on any board, you do it in a committee; you don't do it at the board session--they just approve stuff--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --but you do it in a committee.  So I was able to--I started the corporate social responsibilities in both of those big corporations, and this is to be able to take a look at what is happening.  You can find out or you can take a look at anything in the corporate social responsibility, but it's usually--the corporate social responsibility is to improve the situation with--for the corporation within the human--the greater community where the corporation is established.  All different kinds of activities.  I chose to be--particularly to see what--how the women and the minorities were doing, and their--I had various things I was looking at through my seat there, chairman of corporate social responsibility, and one of the things I looked at, was the numbers, and looking at these young people, and they--and I saw--initially, you take a look and you see that the numbers are quite good; they're well balanced with the whites and minorities, but then I was--fortunately, you get onto a number of boards, you began to look and be able to find out where--your questions--the kinds of questions you ask are very important.  I wasn't asking the right questions.  I had--they were dealing with me with percentages in giving me the numbers; they weren't dealing with the actual numbers.  You can get a percentage--you get two blacks and four others--you get 50 percent of their--of your blacks or 50 percent--that's pretty good.  You get down to actual numbers, you got two people in there (laughter).  So I--it was through the other boards and that I be--I learned how to operate within my corp- with women corporate responsibility, so I was able to find out a lot about what was going on.  And it was through looking at these numbers, and various activities with--about the minorities, about women, that I decided to do something about it, and that was my way of making my return to what I could do to be helpful to what was going on in the issue--dealing with the issue of minorities and women in the corporate world.  You can't do it all, you can't be engaged in everything, and I am totally sympathetic, and empathetic with what's going on in the other parts of the country with minorities.  But the area where I could be helpful was in the corporate world.  This is where I could do something, and this is where I wanted to be helpful.
Speaker 1: And what did you create?
Speaker 2: I created the Fund for Corporate Initiatives, which was an organization dedicated to the upward mobility of women and minorities in the corporate world, and I designed three programs, starting in Albany, with the corporate internship program, and I got my credentials, my--
Speaker 1: Certification?
Speaker 2: Well, I had to go to--no, I had to go to get my--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  501(c)(3).
Speaker 2: Thank you--my 501(c)(3) to be able to operate, which I did, and they were lovely to me.  The people there in Albany were just wonderfully helpful to me in just seeing it through, and I went to the corporation.
Story_ID: 631778
Speaker 1: You wanna get into all this?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I went to the corporations--the major corporations there in Albany [New York].  I just had my secretary call up and say, "Mrs. Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton] would like to come and have an appointment with you," and I went to see all the CEOs and human resource people, and talked--sat down--well, I--first I, with Cliff's [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] help, I made a questionnaire for these--to find out what was going on in the corporations in Albany, why the blacks, why the women were not moving up the corporate ladder.  What's happening?  And I went to the CEOs and I--a number of them--and found out a lot about what might be able to be done, and got some ideas, and I talked about it a lot here and there, and got a contact with a chap who was the head of the school of--dean of the school of business and--but basically, Cliff and I really talked about what could be done.  And we organized a program [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.] and I went to the dean of the school of business and asked him to come aboard and to do some teaching with the young people, but first I went to the corporations and asked them to give me summer internships in their companies for women and minorities to work in their companies for a real job--a job with a beginning, a middle and an ending--just not a gofer's job.  I negotiated this and a decent salary for them, and knowing--and telling them that on the weekends those young people would be coming to me and I would be teaching--I would be training them.  I got a let- ooh, I got a number of corporations to come aboard saying, "Okay Dolores Wharton, we'll give you jobs for these kids."  I went to the deans of the schools of business and the universities all around--Union [Union College, Schenectady, New York] and RPI [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York]--all around, and I got those deans to take my material to their bright students that don't--you can't deal with them if they're not bright.  I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it.  I'm small, I can't do it.  So, for the young people to apply to me to come for the internships--these jobs that I had gotten for them--and I placed them, and gave them the jobs, and they went off on--in the summer, throughout the entire summer, to their jobs, but they came to me on weekends, and that's when I trained them where I had this dean of the school of business from State University of New York in Albany [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York]--and we trained them in person in various aspects of what you do in developing your relationships to your colleagues on the board in your company.  And we also gave them writing, I--one of our--Cliff's colleagues there, we taught them writing for the business sector.  They don't always write for business, they write for their compositions.  But writing for the business sector, I gave them speech, I got a speech teacher from the youth theater; he taught them how to stand up and make presentations.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I had lovely residents.  I gave them--how to deal with people outside of their corporations when they would be invited to dinners, and that kind of thing.  How do you introduce some people, one outstanding person to another?  How do you behave yourself?  Good program.  And that's what we did on weekends.  And I was told by the dean that when those--when my young people went out to get jobs at the university--when the recruiters came in to hire at the universities, my kids just turned out, they just got the jobs--they cleaned up because they knew how to behave themselves.
Speaker 2: How many students moved through that program?
Speaker 1: I don't really remember, but there were a--I know it's the other program, the young executive program, that I remember.  We put a couple a hundred through that one, and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And does it exist anymore?
Speaker 1: No.  Once I got to a certain age, I'd gone off my boards.  I--you know, I--at seventy, I had to go off.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I didn't have the contacts anymore.  Cliff didn't have the contacts.  We used our contacts, that was our faculty--our contacts.  They were brilliant (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it lived as long as you were on the board.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And also, other institutions were beginning to develop programs like--they were copying me, they really were.  They were doing what I was doing, quite a few others.  So it got so--and I didn't have to do this, so I decided it was time to close the doors.

Speaker 1: I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole, interviewing for The HistoryMakers.  Today is August--
Speaker 2: October (laughter).
Speaker 1: Today is October 4th--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Two thousand sixteen [2016] (laughter)--that's funny.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  We are here at United Nations Plaza [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I would love for you to reintroduce yourself.
Speaker 2: I'm Dolores Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton]--
Speaker 1: And what is your--what do you do?  What have you done (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I am a retired executive--foundation executive.
Story_ID: 631780
Speaker 1: We spent some time talking about your board appointments, and you were the first, often, woman--first, often, American black--
Speaker 2: Always the first American black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Always the first American black--
Speaker 2: --on every board I've been on.
Speaker 1: --and over the course of your career you were on how many boards?
Speaker 2: Ten boards--ten corporate boards.  I'm speaking of corporate, not--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --for-profit boards.
Speaker 1: And just for the record--and you were also on many not-for-profit boards, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And do you know what that number is?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--no (laughter).  Quite a number, yes.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the for-profit boards, starting with--your first board was what?
Speaker 2: The first board was Michigan Bell Telephone [Michigan Bell Telephone Company].
Speaker 1: And that was in 1974.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the circumstances around being invited to be on that board?
Speaker 2: There was a conversation generally throughout the media, and certainly at the university [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], and business meetings and whatnot, that the boards should have--should and wanted to have mixed race and gender.  It was--had permeated really throughout, this issue had permeated well throughout the country, and I was identified by--I think by my many appearances as it related to the university and the not-for-profits that I was participating in, that I had been seen, observed, and I was a known factor.  Everything about me was out there, and the boards are always looking for people who they can trust, they're not taking any risks on, who are articulate, who have integrity, who are balanced, who relate to the public but also who will fit into the corporate cultures--their own corporate cultures.
Story_ID: 631781
Speaker 1: So, I'd like to know, on a corporate board--on a for-profit board, what is a board member's responsibility?
Speaker 2: To represent the shareholders at the board meetings.  The corporate director--the outside directors are voted on by the shareholders usually one--the annual meetings usually once a year, and you are approved by the shareholders to represent them in the negoti- any kind of business that the company is engaged in, and you have access--a board member has access to every bit of information--piece of paper that goes into that company.  You don't always ask for every bit.  As a matter of fact, there are times when the company will send you more information than what you can possibly read (laughter), but you have a huge responsibility--your major responsibility is to the shareholders.  Then, next, is to the employees.  Then, following that is to the community or communities in which your company is operating.  And then there's a stream of other responsibilities that you have, but your major responsibility is to the shareholder.
Speaker 1: And at a company like Michigan Bell [Michigan Bell Telephone Company]--this is the energy source, is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, this is the telephone company.
Speaker 1: Telephone, okay.
Speaker 2: This is AT&T [AT&T Corporation; AT&T Inc.]--Ma Bell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The old Ma Bell, she doesn't exist anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  In 1974, this would be the only telephone company, different from--like today, is true?  Did they have--
Speaker 2: No, there--no, no, there were other telephone companies in the State of Michigan--
Speaker 1: In the State of Michigan.
Speaker 2: --but they were smaller.  Ma Bell dominated throughout the uni- at that time Ma Bell dominated the United States.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But there were many other telephone companies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so--
Speaker 2: But not like today.
Speaker 1: Sure.  So, how many board members were part of that board?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly what that is, but usually they--in those days, they ran about eight outside directors, and you usually had three, four maybe, inside directors, so that the boards would be composed basically of about twelve members for the formal board meetings.
Speaker 1: And did each board member have officer duty--like a treasurer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no.  No, that was--those are the insiders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are, yes, those are definitely--that was inside activity, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, is there anything that you can--I know that you can't discuss what happens at board meetings because that's confidential, but is there anything that you can describe about--starting with the Michigan Bell board, to give a sense of the work?
Speaker 2: I knew very little about the operations of the company--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I went--with Cliff's [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] encouragement, of course, he's always done this on all of his boards.  I went all over Michigan--through the headquarters, I was taken all over Michigan to the switching stations to see the operations.  It was quite fascinating.  You learn a lot about what goes on technically and also ethically.  Our government--no one is supposed to be able to get into a telephone conversation, but they can.  There are activities that you are asked to perform in that, that are quite congenial, but you ought--but the main source of working in a board is through committees.  As a director, and at the beginning of each year, you are assigned one, two, maybe three committees, the audit committee being the most introspective of them all, and they are where you sit down and really get down to basics with your fellow board members and with--you have your fellow outside directors, one or two, not too many of them, of the outside directors at each of the committee meetings, but then this is where management reports to you about what's going on in their area, such as treasury and finance, and the whole slate of activities that a board is--that a company's engaged in.  They have chairmen of those areas that will report to you as a committee, and that's where you learn, that's where you bring your own ideas and you have discussions and argue.  You do not ar- very rarely do you get an argument within the actual board member meeting itself, and they're really quite formal.  It's--when you're in the board meeting, it's an environment that is rather formal, and the aura of the presence of the company is one that you have full respect for, and for your other board members, and one behaves--performs accordingly, which is not necessarily true in the committee meetings.
Story_ID: 631782
Speaker 1: In 1974, being on the Michigan Bell [Michigan Bell Telephone Company] board, this is a time when technology is changing a lot--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and were you--was Michigan Bell facing changes in technology that affected the way that the telephones were working?
Speaker 2: To a certain extent, but Ma Bell had--I've forgotten the name of the organization; it's over there in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Bell Labs [AT&T Bell Laboratories, Inc.; Nokia Bell Labs].
Speaker 2: Bell Labs.  Ma Bell had Bell Labs, and they were doing extraordinary--otherworldly kinds of technical scientific developments, and from time to time they would take us in--one of the trips, for example, would be to Bell Labs to see what was going on to keep us informed about what was available and what was coming on stream.  That was very exciting.  But within our own company it--we were not pioneering, we were doing the work of the company.
Speaker 1: Were there any big challenges or controversies--public--that happened while you were on the board?
Speaker 2: When Ma Bell was being challenged by the other telephone companies and it--and that's when I was on there for a number of years before it changed, but there was a big controversy and lots of conversation, and we had to change the name of the companies.  It just totally--Ma Bell went out of existence pretty much.  Some of the companies throughout the United States did maintain their own identity, but not very many of them.
Speaker 1: And when was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) New York, for example.  I was on New York Telephone [New York Telephone Company] board for a while, and New York had to change--it changed to NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.].  Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that was a change after the threat had been made that Ma Bell was going to be made extinct.
Speaker 1: And about when was that?
Speaker 2: Well, New York Tel- I was--we were in Michigan, so that would have been in the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: And so as a director who's responsible to the shareholders, what kinds of decisions do you have to make, you know, in wake of something so big as that, Ma Bell's dissolving?  What kinds of decisions does a director have to make, or what kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's the laws of what I--you're challenging me on these things.  The laws that govern the--something's laws of running a business meeting.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What, the laws, the rules, the--
Speaker 1: Robert's Rules?
Speaker 2: Robert's Rules (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Robert's Rules, yeah.
Speaker 2: --of Order [Robert's Rules of Order].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so whenever it came up, we would--it would be discussed in that fashion and we would vote on it.  But you could get impassioned about it.  The head of New York Tel- the head of AT&T [AT&T Corporation; AT&T Inc.], actually, he was a very tall, outstanding man with great charisma, and he actually went all over the country talking to the--talking to us, the boards.  Prior to that--we, you know, we would genuflect when we heard his name.  But he was fighting for the life of Ma Bell at that time, and he came to plead our course and to tell us what he planned to do and did we--did he have our concurrence in what he was doing.  It was that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And, and so did Michigan Bell stay intact?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, we did not.
Speaker 1: Oh.  And so do you leave that board when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--we moved to New York, and I came to--and I was--it was very nice that there was no obligation on the part of Michigan Bell to have me come to New York, but they did.  They were very pleased with my representation and asked that I be accepted on the New York Telephone board of directors, which I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--I don't know if this is something you can talk about or not but--yeah, please.
Speaker 2: I--the names, they--Franklin Thomas [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas] was on that New York Tel board; he came on the New York Tel board (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the same time as you?
Speaker 2: Yes, of the Ford Foundation [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: This was before he went to the Ford Foundation.  I came to know him very well then, as a fellow board member.
Story_ID: 631783
Speaker 1: And I was saying, I don't know whether this is something you can say or not, but these are--these for-profit boards are paid positions.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it public knowledge what you're paid?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you were paid for the first board?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, can you give me a sense of the range of what people are paid for board (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I can't.
Speaker 1: You don't remember at all?
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One of the things you do with your bank is you just have the company send the compensation directly to your bank account.
Speaker 1: So it, it was not something that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not something you deal with specifically.
Speaker 1: What was the next board that you joined?
Speaker 2: Well, then there was the Phillips Petroleum [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66], and very, very soon--almost at the same time--there was the Kellogg Company.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, these are huge companies.
Speaker 2: Yes, these are multinationals.
Speaker 1: And so Kellogg is cereal, primarily, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And Phillips Petroleum is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Big oil, big oil.
Speaker 1: Big oil.
Speaker 2: Big oil.
Speaker 1: And in the mid-'70s [1970s].  So, what were the challenges that--let's start with petroleum.
Speaker 2: Well, when you're dealing with petroleum the--every major company on the globe wants that oil, and so there's a struggle, there's a fight always for the oil, and I was brought onto the board actually by a contribution, but the--Phillips Petroleum, the head of Phillips Petroleum had made a contri- the chairman of Phillips Petroleum--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --had made a contribution to the reelection of Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], and that was illegal.  A class action suit was brought against Richard Nixon for this act, and it went to a--the class action suit was run by a company in California, and I'm not remembering it fully, public service, something in public service, I don't remember.  This is being very specific for me after all these years.  They were looking very--they had--they and the board had to agree on the new directors that--the decision having been made that Phillips would include more outside directors.  I think it--I've forgotten the number, but I think it was something like five new directors.  They were dealing--this major American company was dealing with three outside directors, and they insisted that it be five outside directors, and they were looking for these outside directors.  One of the requirements--the Law in Public Interest [Center for Law in the Public Interest, Los Angeles, California]; that was the name of the group--the Law in the Public Interest.  The Law in the Public Interest was also looking for the--it was required by the determination of this class action suit that there be included in these five a woman and a black.  And by strange coincidences, I was observed and seen for--I was speaking on an event related to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  It was the campus--well no, it wasn't actually, it was--a Mormon church actually had a dormitory that was set up very close to the campus and Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] had been invited to attend the dedication of this dormitory.  He couldn't make it and I was asked to, to just join the group, and then when I got there I was asked, "Well, please, Mrs. Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], won't you please speak?"  And I did, and I spoke very easily and off the top of my head, and it happened that one of the board--inside directors of the board of Phillips was a Mormon and he was at the event, and he went back to Phillips; he had--he was there in, in--there in Michigan with his--with the company plane.  The story is he went back to Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville [Oklahoma], said, "I think we found her."  And one thing led to the other and the chairman of the company and several of the vice presidents came to East Lansing [Michigan] and invited me to lunch, and soon after it, I became the first woman and--the first black and the first woman on that board.
Speaker 1: Now, you--I'm sure you were aware of what was going on.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And, stepping into a director position when the company is really on the hot seat, did you have any trepidation about joining the board?
Speaker 2: Well, it had pa- with a law--with it had been settled with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Still--but they still had a--
Speaker 2: It had been--well, this is true of all--all businesses run, they have their problems.  Even state universities (laughter) have--you never, when you're in business, you're never without problems.
Speaker 1: So, there--you didn't have any reservation about joining.
Speaker 2: No, no, not in that regard, no, I didn't.
Story_ID: 631784
Speaker 1: Joining a board when a company is looking to repair its image--because that was certainly part of it, was it not?  Would you say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes and no.  There's something about the oilmen; they are unique in their cultures--their cultures in all of these industries, and, and then they refine it to the actual company.  And the oilmen in Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66], for example, I don't think any of the inside directors were under 6'2", 6'3", 6'4".  They were big men, and when those Phillips men walked in there (laughter), whew!  This is oil!  And these were men--when they walked onto the stage, you got a sense of presence, of power and dynamism, and there's not much that humbles them.  Can I leave it that that?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And when you walked in at--what, five foot what?
Speaker 2: Oh, sweet little innocent me?  Well, there--the board--we, it was a--the trip--the first trip to Bartlesville [Oklahoma] began with a dinner--a formal dinner at the headquarters.  Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] was there, of course, all the spouses were there.  And it was an occasion when the atmosphere was a little tense because Phillips did--was a very powerful company, and here you had five directors coming onstage who could change everything in that town of Bartlesville and throughout the whole empire that Phillips ran 'cause Ekofisk had already been found, and this was an enormous find in the North Sea.  They were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, just for verification purposes, where is Bartlesville?
Speaker 2: Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and tell me what Ekofisk is.
Speaker 2: Ekofisk, it was a major find in the North Sea of oil--it was an oil well--a huge--it's a series of wells.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's a number of wells.
Speaker 1: And was it found by Phillips?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were a number of major companies who were out in the North Sea.  They knew there was oil out there but they couldn't find it, and many of the company--this is the story on Ekofisk.  Many of the companies gave up and said, "There's nothing, let's get out of here."  It's very expensive to run, the dollar signs change in your mind when you're talking about oil.  It's just a whole different kind of math.  It was very expensive, but some of the oil--most of the oil companies gave out.  Phillips was the only one who stayed the course, and by George they struck it, and that was Ekofisk.  And then a lot of--many of the companies--British Petroleum [BP P.L.C.] really came back, it was close to them and they had seas on the border there with, with North Sea, so that it just began to boom, and many, many companies went in there after we had made the initial find.
Speaker 1: And so what did that do?  This was while you were on the board, did this--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Around when are we talking?
Speaker 2: Oh, the find?  No, no.  It had been--Ekofisk had been found, so we were talking about--what surprised me--I'm sort of getting ahead of your questions--what surprised me was that when we were having board members and we were discussing Ekofisk and, like, you know, where is it?  What is it?  What is the drilling like?  The other directors and the in--the outside directors had never been out there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We can do anything we want to do on a board; it's--we can move about, and ask for anything.  So, I said, "Well, let's go out there."  And lo and behold: "You really wanna go?  You wanna go?"
Story_ID: 631785
Speaker 1: Lo and behold, they took the board out and we all of us went out, and it was--we were going by--we were using our own planes.  We had--Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66]--we had--I think we had four planes, we had four or five planes, and two of them were overseas planes, which we voted on all the time.  This is one of the things you--it's in your ballpark that you do vote on is the number of planes.  The expenditures are enormous and this--it's what you--it's in your portfolio that you review and know what the monies are being spent on.
Speaker 2: And so you all go out to the North Sea, and I've seen photos of you doing that.  What--do you go down?  Like what do you do when you get there?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, we went in--into the living quarters, we went into the technical areas--keyboards, monitors, technology all around you in there pushing buttons, and then we see where the men are going down into the sea, into the ocean floor.  They have a lot of movies for us, too, that we see so we can--we see the movies and we can see the actual physical evidence of what they're doing but we can't--we do not go down to the ocean floor, but they allow us to see it onscreen.  We interviewed the men who went out on the men on the platform.  We got to know what their routines were which was very fascinating.  We talked to them, we had lunch with them.  Their food, for example, was top of the line, and I would say, "You eat well?"  "Better be, better be.  Better want that food."  And they can ask for it.  The atmosphere is one of men--very strong, macho individuals who are very competent, and know their skills, and are in charge of whatever it is their assignments are they are in charge and they're very strong, and they stay out on the platform.  It is identified well in advance of how long you stay out on the platform and then how long you go back to shore--when you're offshore, and how long you are onshore.  It's all very well laid out, you review these things.  We did have one dreadful accident where one of the platforms--there're quite a number of platforms and they're all connected by gangplanks that run through them.  But one of the platforms turned upside down with the men in it.  The loss of life in that environment is very easy to--and it's heart wrenching.  I mean you know you can just--you've been out there, you can know what these men have gone through.  The fact that they're out there in the first place, I wanna--you know, "Why would you ever want to go out there to work?"  I was fascinated, I was intrigued.  I went out twice; I made two trips out to the platform because I was so intrigued by it, so I wasn't afraid of it.  But you do feel very strongly about those men that go out there on those platforms to do that work--pay is very good.
Speaker 2: And so you're--what's the temperature like (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, when, when we were walking above on the catwalks and that kind of thing, it was quite pleasant.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Quite, quite pleasant.  And sometimes you see the men out there fishing with a fishing pole and it was just kind of--it was really a lark (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How long were you there? Were you just--
Speaker 1: Oh, a full day.  And--well, the whole trip would take a full day.  We were up--and we started--we left Stavanger [Norway] in--the coast, right there at the coast, and we flew from the port of Stavanger out to the platform.  It was--I think it was about a two hour trip.  The helicopters are huge, they're great, there was--it's as wide as this room.
Speaker 2: Where is Stavanger?
Speaker 1: It's on the coast of Norway--
Speaker 2: Okay, Norway.
Speaker 1: --and this was just off the coast going out to the platform.
Speaker 2: Do you know what year this was?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Around what time it was?
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Were you the only woman?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Next question, how was I treated?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Beautifully.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: Beautifully.  I think in all of my twenty-two years as an outside director, I can never say that I was in any way ever compromised, or I felt I was being thought of or spoken to in a way that I would object to--never.  Now, they did do little things then by themselves.
Story_ID: 631786
Speaker 1: You were telling me--board members.
Speaker 2: You had politicians on the boards but they--well, they were retired from government.  And Melvin Laird, he was the secretary of defense--he had been the secretary of defense.  And I would say I sat next to Mel Laird for some twenty years.  Our chairs--our seats were just right next--and I would say he was my buddy and he was--we supported--and very often there were things going on that we were interested in--and we supported each other.  There was Clark Clifford, he was a very outstanding lawyer--he was a Democrat, and one of the most powerful men in Washington [D.C.] in those days.  There was Victor Palmieri who was the--Penn Central [Penn Central Transportation Company] had gone into a Chapter 11 kind of thing and Victor was the one that saved it.  David Meeker, he was the head of Hobart company [Hobart Corporation], a great big refrigerator company.  Who else was on there [board of Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66]?  Well, that's pretty much which comes to mind at the moment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--and so you mentioned one person who was a Democrat.  Were--did he--
Speaker 2: That was Clark Clifford.
Speaker 1: Did the other board members make their party known?  Why was--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just in casual--not at--never at the board, not at the board, no, no.  Though, at--you would get a little bit of humor.  There were times when you would have an issue, and Mel might have been standing up and standing firm on this issue and being profound and dramatic, and Clark Clifford, "There's Mel being his Republican self," you know, kind of on the side and kind of--and giving a little--just for fun; they would get at each other that way.  But as I say, in the actual board meeting it was formal--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and there were--and those--that's when you receive presentations from management that were very serious, and you voted on them yes or no, and--but there had already been pretty full discussions before you get to the board meeting.
Story_ID: 631787
Speaker 1: You initiated the first social responsibility committee.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When I speak of my friend Mel Laird [Melvin Laird], he supported me on this.  I had been on the board for a couple of years when there were things that I was interested in doing and looking at that I felt we could perhaps encourage more hiring of women and minorities, and seeing how that movement went.  There were other huge areas of responsibility that you can look at that the company--how the company is performing in these ways, contributions is another one.  There was--I won't mention the company 'cause I really don't want to, but there was one inside director who was giving large sums of money away--the company's money away that had not been approved by anybody.  Well, the social responsibility committee approves every dollar that--at a certain level, you--there's a cutoff period--a cutoff level where you do not impose your will on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is the low level.
Speaker 2: Which is the lower--and, you know, a certain level of (laughter)--in the oil company there's so many millions of dollars below that, we don't worry about those millions.  I'm being funny.  But there is a grading there.  The movement of the birds, for example--the animals that could be killed and destroyed through the oil.  Kellogg [Kellogg Company] once had some water that was underground and they were concerned about oil dropping into this water.  Well, this came to the corporate social responsibility.  There were lots of things that would come to corporate social responsibility that prior to that had been handled in other committees but not with a direct concern for this particular socie- impact on society, and I felt that this was also a way of looking at the hiring of minorities and women, and seeing how they can move.  As I said before, I could ask for any kind of information.  I did ask for those--for that information of the hiring, and it was delivered to me and my committee.  I'd started--Mel Laird was supportive of me, and that's how I was able to get that committee to be part of the company's agenda.  It was a committee at the board level, it had clout and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Mel Laird's role was--
Speaker 2: He was an outside director.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was out of the--he was no longer secretary of defense, but he was involved in many different kinds of not-for-profit things.  He might have even been involved in some of the--probably was, for-profit activities as well.  You can be involved in other things, of course.
Speaker 1: Well--and you were on the board of Kellogg and the petroleum, Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] at the same time, so when you just mentioned Kellogg having the water issue and were questioned as it related to oil, how did you navigate that 'cause now you're on two boards with competing interests.
Speaker 2: I won't go into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was nothing--really, I don't remember how it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did--does it end up being helpful?  I mean that you can--you then have the ability to talk to different companies 'cause you know each other?  Is--I'm just curious.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I'm not sure where you're going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm--given--you just mentioned that Kellogg was concerned about the water and petroleum (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you see, with this you're highlighting a situation that requires some real facts and figures which I do not have access.  If I were sitting on the board I could ask for the access, but I probably wouldn't tell you anyway (Simultaneous) .
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure. Okay--touche!  (Laughter) Let's move on.
Story_ID: 631788
Speaker 1: Just a little more on the social responsibility committee.  So that really supported (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, that was my entrance into the--to the company and its--taking a good strong look at what the situation was with minorities and women, and how they were moving or not moving.  And I had someone who was making a--from personnel who was making a report to me at the board level.  You can make reports all over the company, but once you're making a report to the board, you're up there in the executive suite, and this is where the real decisions are made.  And this is where you're able to make an impact, and you get your board--you bring your positions to your committee and you get--you have full dialogue and discussion with the committee, and you come to decisions and you take these decisions to the board and ask for their approval, and they're adopted or rejected.
Speaker 1: And creating this committee, did Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] ultimately begin to pay more attention to bringing minorities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They all did--all of them did.  I also did it with Kellogg, I brought--had a--was accepted, Kellogg Company accepted the idea and both companies made me the chairman for--of that committee for several terms for quite some time, until, I think until I left--certainly with Kellogg, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did you serve on the Kellogg board?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was probably--nineteen, with most of 'em it was nineteen, twenty years kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not bring--I did not have a corporate social responsibility committee--I didn't even try with Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.].  Gannett was so far ahead of anything that I would be initiating that Allen Neuharth came to his leadership with newspapers.  Certainly with USA Today and the impact that he had on the other newspapers throughout the country.  We had--I think it was something like sixty-two newspapers throughout the United States, but USA Today--I was there when, when that was a germ of an idea for Allen and, you know, it came into being.
Speaker 1: And you joined that board in '79 [1979], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is--that's when you were in New York.
Speaker 2: We were in New York, yes; we were at SUNY then.  Allen came to the State University of New York [State University of New York System] to take me out to lunch--this is how most of my invitations come.  I get an invitation for lunch with the CEO, the chief executive officer.  "The chief executive officer would be very pleased if you would join him for lunch."  Huh!  Usually with somebody else, another cohort in upper management, will join him.
Story_ID: 631789
Speaker 1: How did you balance working on these boards--the for-profit boards, the not-for-profit boards, and being first lady?  You had a full slate.
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  Being there at this--at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] gave me an extraordinary window on what was happening in higher education with students at the university level throughout the country.  We interacted with many different kinds of organizations--several different organizations, with presidents and their upper management, throughout the country on frequent basis.  And even in the sports you're still interacting with these same people.  You get a very good look at what's happening in higher education.  It's--this is important--this is an important factor when you're dealing with a larger society in the United States, certainly when the students are very upset about something that's taking place in the country and they're challenging government, the society, the corporations--why having an insight, for me, gave me a voice that was at times very useful.  It was something I could bring to my discussions--to my conversation, and I did.  I think we--I told you that I had been a visitor on several occasions in the dormitories, I'd spend a week at a time in the dormitories talking to the--talking--being with the students.
Story_ID: 631790
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.] for a moment because you said that USA Today was being born, basically, during the time that you were there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So, as--getting back to being on the board and seeing that there's this--the company owns multiple publications, is launching a new one, does the board have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely!
Speaker 1: --you know, "Oh, this new thing, what are you doing with that new thing?"
Speaker 2: Allen Neuharth was the chairman--chief executive officer.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He wanted this thing.  As a board member I did interact with a lot of the management people.  Allen brought us all together all the time, we were always together.  They were totally opposed to it.  "This is the wrong time to be starting up a newspaper, it's not going to work."  Everybody out in the industry, "No, don't start a newspaper now.  This isn't going to work."  Allen was determined.  He knew--he felt that there was a niche for USA Today, and he brought the board along, step by step, and every meeting--oh, for a couple of years, I guess it was, he would be bringing us facts and figures and presentations that showed that we had a spot, we had a place, we could get in there.  This is one man who took on this fight, it was something he wanted and he felt was going to work, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He had to convince all of you.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  And so--and he--I don't know where he--I don't know, Allen is a very complex man, so I don't know where he started.  But certainly with us, we knew--Allen let us know everything that he was thinking, and what he wanted, and he was very good about bringing the controversy to us.  He would tell us by name who was opposed to it.  But he was for it, and he brought us along, so we believed in him.  We said, "Go ahead."  We finally came to the decision.  "Okay, Allen, go for it."  And it was a great success.  I remember being here, he had the first--one of the first meetings at Radio City Music Hall [New York, New York], and it was better than the Rockettes coming out on the stage.  I think--was it Koch [Ed Koch]?  I think it was Mayor Koch.  He got up on the stage--I don't know if you remember the vendors.  We had our own unique vending machine.  You could spot the USA Todays, and then we even would put it in movies.  You knew (laughter), you knew it was a street in New York, or wherever.  He--the mayor got up on the stage, he said, "I went to bed last night and my city was in good order, and I woke up in the morning, the whole city was covered with these vending machines of USA Today."  Well, it brought the house down there at the Radio City Music Hall.  It was what Allen had really wanted, and--I think the last launch--they launched it throughout the country.  The last launch was New York City [New York, New York] because they knew it was going to be the toughest.  But we went to a--he would take the board along and go to the launches.  That was another thing that Allen encouraged and I loved doing--was when I traveled--he enjoyed, he was very happy about our going to other newspapers to see how they were being run, and when--whether I was Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] or Kellogg [Kellogg Company], or whatever, or not-for-profit meeting and I was traveling around the United States, and I was near a Gannett newspaper, I would contact a head of the manager of the newspaper and say, "Can I come and visit?"  "Oh, sure, come on in."  And what I did was I would go to their editorial boards.  And this is where you find out what's going on in the community and where you see what the newspaper supports and doesn't support, and what they're going to do and they're not going to do.  And then they would take me through the facilities and that kind of thing, and I would--but being in on those editorial boards was very informative and it was most enjoyable--wonderfully enlightening.  But you see, I had all of these different components that you were talking about--how do I manage them?  Even the--certainly the university 'cause that was my base.  They all came together in my mind so that I had a perspective of what was going on.  I wasn't a single issue board member, I had a good look out there at society and what was happening out there, not only that one--in each individual board, but the other boards.  And the same--when you're reading, oooh, the reading, the reading, the reading.  It was tons of reading.  The reading that you would do for one company does relate to the others, it's not the same--they're not the same facts, not the same people, but there is a strong relationship, and it just adds to what you can bring to the board, and your information that you can share.
Speaker 1: You joined--so you joined that board, Gannett, in '79 [1979].  Were you--you're based--you were based in Albany [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that where you all were based?  And then--so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my castle [Delaware and Hudson Railroad Building; SUNY System Administration Building, Albany, New York].
Speaker 1: In that castle.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 631791
Speaker 1: Then in 1980, you became a trustee of the Albany Institute of History and Art [Albany, New York]--
Speaker 2: Not-for-profit.
Speaker 1: --and the Albany Law School [Albany, New York].  Those are both--
Speaker 2: Not-for-profits.
Speaker 1: Right.  But then, that same year was when you established the Fund for Corporate Interns [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, can you describe--what is the Fund for Corporate Interns, and, you know, what made you start this?
Speaker 2: With my corporate social responsibility committee, I had an--I was able to look to see what was going on with the minority women and minorities in the corporate world, and they were coming in, they were being employed, certainly at the lower levels, but they weren't up there in the executive suite where I was.  All right, why?  And I decided to take a good, strong look at why a research approach.  I went to my CEOs and had meetings with them.  It was very easy for me to get appointments with, with my CEOs to talk about this issue.  I went to the human resource offices of these companies, and I found out there are some areas where the young people who want to move up are lacking--that there is--there are some problems.  And with women, for example, they're going to get pregnant and they're going to leave the company.  You put this big investment in there in their education, then they leave the company.  Well, with people of color they had problems.  What I found was missing was the breadth of experience that they were lacking.  All of my young people that I brought on to be with me were bright, intelligent, and capable.  That was important to me.  But what was missing?  And it was my aim--my drive is to broaden their experiences, to give them exposure with actual people in situations that would expand their ability to interact, to converse, to exchange, to share, to have something to talk about to share that is of value.
Speaker 1: And so you figured out that this was needed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: By meeting--well, you observed it and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it started with the interns 'cause we were right there in Albany [New York] and I went to the head of the business school at State University of New York in Albany [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York] came aboard with me for instructing certain business codes and necessities for young people.  But before that was--part of the plan was to go to the various colleges, there were a number of colleges--many other than State University, there in that Albany area.  And I went to the colleges and made contact with the deans of the schools of business with my materials so that they could learn about what I wanted to do, and so that they would identify young people who would come to me for summer internships.  Then (laughter)--sometimes I get a giggle myself of what I did.  I went to the businesses there in Albany--the major businesses--and called on the CEOs, and they accept me very nicely.  I think they were wondering, what does this woman want?  But they were all very, very generous and courteous in receiving me, and I told them that I really wanted to have a ten week summer internships for very bright university students in the schools of business, to give them exposure to their company, and to give them a job, a real job with a beginning, a middle, and an ending--just not gofer jobs, but a real job.  And that they would come to me on weekends so that these young people would be guided by me and my team on weekends, so that there was an observation of what they were doing during the week on their jobs.
Story_ID: 631792
Speaker 1: We went through that program for ten weeks summer internship, and on weekends I--there was a very lovely conference center outside of Albany [New York] in Rensselaerville [New York], and I took my stud- it's really quite--it's a resort kind of place, but a lot of academic seminars are held there, and they have lovely bedrooms and dining rooms, and that kind of thing.  I took my interns there, I had the school--the dean of the school of business and his associate, and they dealt with the--on weekends they dealt with my young people, I bused them over there.  I got buses and everything to take them over there.  They dealt with the students in personal relationships with the schools of business and how to be--and the needs of programming that is beyond what, more of what they would get on the out--beyond the undergraduate university level.  I had one of my cohorts, Jim Harkness, was a wonderful writer--he was an author, and he trained the interns in writing for the business community.  Most of them can't write when they go to--when they get out of college, so they took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are these, are they already graduates?
Speaker 1: No, they're undergraduates.
Speaker 2: What year are they in?
Speaker 1: Their final year.  Sometimes, I think sometimes I did have a junior in there, but basically they were seniors.
Speaker 2: And how many students did you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I had from eight to eighteen, I would say.  I also had a speech teacher for them so that with--by the time--and they gave speeches to us, and that was quite an eye opener.  That was quite an experience for them because they had not spoken before, and it was a broadening experience for the interns.
Speaker 2: And were they all from the SUNY System [State University of New York System]?
Speaker 1: Not--no.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  I had lots of--Union College [Schenectady, New York], Rensselaer [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York], RPI, technology--oh, god, there were many of them, many, many colleges there, and Rose--St. Rose [The College of St. Rose, Albany, New York], a lot of 'em.
Speaker 2: You had they staying at this facility.  Obviously, this costing money, how are you paying for it?
Speaker 1: I paid for it.
Speaker 2: So this was your gift to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was, yes, it was, yes, it was.  I had my 501(c)(3), I'd gotten that.  There was a wonderful lawyer there in Albany who was delighted to take my case to the courts where I was granted a 501(c)(3), and I used my own corporate dollars to pay for it [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.].  I have--when you have a 501(c)(3), you have to get other monies, you just can't do it all yourself.  You have to have other monies to be able to operate--it's not legal.  So I was able to gather other income.  I wasn't too good at that, but I did solicit other funds.
Speaker 2: And you got what you required.
Speaker 1: I got what was neces- yes, what I required.  But then I published what we were doing, I had a paper, and we were coming into New York--there were people here in New York [New York] that we knew very well, and Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] was on the board of the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] which does some extraor- the great books, the elevated thinkers, and Joe Slater [Joseph E. Slater], who was the head of the institute, said, "This is very interesting, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton].  I think this is something that we should adopt in the Aspen Institute."  At that time, the Aspen Institute had no programs for young people.  They were all very lofty.
Speaker 2: And what time are we talking about now?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  In the '80s [1980s], well, probably about 1980.  Oh!  Well, I founded (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-four [1984].

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I had three programs altogether [as part of the Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.].  I founded the Fund for Cor- I founded the initiatives program in 1980, and that's where we had--where we went to the corporations that identified their talented young people to come to the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] for one week seminars, and that's when I had some of the most outstanding people in business come to the Aspen Institute.  They were flying in there on their helicopters coming to me for the programs that they understood what I was trying to do with these young people to stretch their minds, their experiences.  My young people got so they were totally comfortable with what--dealing and talking with CEOs about--and we brought issues to them.  One woman I had, she was a--Anne Wexler.  She was a lobbyist, and we--she identified all of the corporations; we usually had about eighteen at the Aspen Institute.  They came from different companies.  She went to all--she researched all of the companies of my interns, of my participants, and looked up what was in the [U.S.] Congress that was--affected those companies, and she brought those issues to the interns, to my young executives, my participants.  "Did you know that this is--that your company was being sued by such and such a company?"  And these were great experiences.  I also had experiences of their--of bringing in the arts and sports.  Arthur Ashe came talking about his experiences in sports.  These are all interrelated, these are people who are doing things and moving, and stretching out--reaching out.  Bobby Short came.  Do you know Bobby Short?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: It was--it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you--all disciplines that you--
Speaker 1: We had--the way I'm talking about it, it sounds like it's a hodgepodge but it wasn't (laughter), it was very well organized.  But we had four different segments to each day, but it's hard when describing it, you know--trying to give this overall look to do it without sitting you down with almost a syllabus to go through so you could see how--it really was very well laid on, and we saw to it that with the participants, they--we had lovely, exquisite facilities and dining rooms, and we had the participants sitting at different tables every meal, three meals a day, and they would be with the visitors so that they had the exchanges one on one at a meal.  And you have a different kind of conversation, a different kind of rapport with your friends when you're talking to them at dinner, at lunch.  It is an insight and a feeling that is--allows them to be at home and comfortable, at ease--and that's what I wanted for them.
Story_ID: 631794
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a bit about the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] partnership because this is now--here's your baby that now you are aligning with the Aspen Institute which is a world renowned, highly regarded think tank--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and as you mentioned, they didn't have any programs for young people before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: --because you were bringing tremendous value to them, and vice versa.
Speaker 2: I was pleased with what--I was convinced that--and I did--and it went to the board.  It was a full discussion there at the Aspen in one summer meeting with the board, and I was pleading--I think I have a picture of that.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I was pleading my case for bringing in the program [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.] into the Aspen Institute, and there was one very famous man, whose name you would know very well, who was saying, "Aspen is very well known for what we do for the seminars we give, and there's no point in our changing the formula.  We've got a formula that works."  But we pressed on and we worked, we became part of the Aspen Institute.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me, what benefit do you believe the students who went through your program both before it was at Aspen and then at Aspen?  What benefits did they get?
Speaker 2: Well, I got some wonderful letters from them saying--you know, it's a mountaintop experience.  It was one of interacting with people and ideas in that they may not have--certainly would not have had the opportunity at the ages where they were and at the slots that they were professionally at that time--it wouldn't have been possible.  It was giving them a step up into a higher altitude that allowed them to breathe an air that is exhilarating and expanding, and they were able to have exchanges with people on their level, but still maintain their--and still maintain who they were because of the four separate programs we had each day, starting off with ethics and philosophy.  So we were talking about cultures.  We were talking about Asian cultures and philosophies.  We were talking about African cultures and philo- I had Africanists coming--several of them who came in.  I had Japanese coming and talking about their attitude and how--and the simplicity of how they come to things and how you deal with them.  As executives yourself, how you deal with them, how you go to other countries, and before you--for my young people, before you set foot on that foreign territory, and you get a hold of that history and you find out what's going on in their newspapers, you don't set foot on that foreign country until you know what's going on in there.  And it was a way of getting a grip on your company who you're representing and what you are taking to the foreign company, or even beyond in your own--in the United States.  But it was an expanding of your mind and attitude, and understanding of a greater world.  But at your age as your feet are still right on the ground, starting off with those ethics and philosophies, you know, where all the people are from all different areas of the world and cultures.  Not all of them, but a lot of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  Do you remember where it went and what the other categories were?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was--yes.  Well, there was--see, well, the discussions with Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] were very good, he led this one.  Directors and CEOs is cultural connections and upward mobility, upward mobility.  That's where I had the human resource officers come in and I think that's where Darwin Davis [HistoryMaker Darwin N. Davis, Sr.] came in.
Speaker 1: Right, so Darwin Davis--can we tell who, who he was and what he did?
Speaker 2: He was with Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] at the time.  He was with Equitable and he--I think he was in human--I believe he was in human resource.  I don't--he came in under the--in the program of human resources, and he was talking to the participants about entering a situation where you are the only person of color, and that's when he said, "If you see someone drawing a circle, be sure that they include you in the circle and not out of the circle."  It's certain little ways of envisioning what your situation might be.  It's not all that graphic, but--.
Story_ID: 631795
Speaker 1: Then in 1986, you allowed white males to participate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely--
Speaker 1: --in the Young Executive Program [of the Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.].  Why was that?
Speaker 2: If you really want to get a full understanding--and this is what we were after, is a full understanding of what the corporate work is about, you include everybody in your discussion.  You include everybody, and we had a handful of white males.  There was one from a petroleum company actually, so--he wasn't from Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] but he was from a Phillips affiliate.  He said he had no idea what he was walking into, and he wasn't scared but he was a little bit concerned.  He was in a situation where he was the minority coming into the black culture.  He said it changed his life--just changed his life.
Speaker 1: Did he say how?
Speaker 2: Positively, so that he could interact.  He knew--he had an understanding--a better understanding.  He was dealing one thing on that level.  He was dealing with other people in--who were executives, middle managers.  So, they--after hours when they weren't in session our young people were interacting among themselves.  They were talking, they were having teas and drinks, and playing pool, and going out on bicycle rides, interacting with one another, so it was an interaction where he found himself part of the group.  He was on the inside.  One of the things--one of the studies from the philosophers was the cave, the allegory of the cave, are you in the cave or are you out of the cave?  Where are you?  And this was profound.  He was in the cave.  And he learned.
Speaker 1: And what did the women and minority students have to say about interacting with white males (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They wanted it.  This is a broadminded group, they're not narrow minded where I can only deal with one element.  They were dealing with the universe.  And their minds were--and the setting is otherworldly.  It was nine hundred acres with black Angus cows wandering around and magnificent lakes--and trees and lovely houses and whatnot--
Story_ID: 631796
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was really quite incredible.
Speaker 1: Now, when you partner with Aspen [Aspen Institute, Washington, D.C.], do they then help to pay for the interns?
Speaker 2: No, they did not, they did not.  No, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're still funding the whole thing [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: No, not the whole thing.  The corporations actually paid Aspen for their time at Aspen.  They took care of the transportation, their food, their housing.  They had very nice accommodations--lovely accommodations--really quite nice.
Speaker 1: Was this in the summer?
Speaker 2: Usually just about--it's usually in October.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Usually in October.  I--Harvey Kahalas is Jewish, so I always had to pop around the Jewish holidays to (laughter) have it fit in.
Speaker 1: And what was Harvey's role?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, he was very much with--in discussing the upward mobility.
Speaker 1: And he was from SUNY [State University of New York System].
Speaker 2: SUNY Albany [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York], he's the head of the school of business at State University of New York, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was his role in your program?
Speaker 2: He was at the head of that particular program.  I had the four programs--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he was head of that.  You don't want me to go through every one of those, do you?  The names and that kind of--I don't know that I--
Speaker 1: That's okay.  But tell--you can tell me about what he did.  So he is head of the upward mobility (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was head of upward mobility and human resources.  Human resources came under that umbrella, so people were talking--he would be hosting that with the participants.  He--for the participants, he would host the guests, introducing--well, actually I would have the participants, I would choose certain participants to--and if they were coming from their corporations as guests, I would have the participants introduce their visitor, but that was all under Harvey's aegis.  And Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] had the CEOs and directors, corporate directors.  Phillips Talbot, who was a humanist, he was in--he had been in the state department [U.S. Department of State] in foreign affairs.  He was big in India and philosophically very deep, and he had the different cultural areas.  But I had cultural connections, which was the arts, and I was the one who brought in the arts people, the sports people, the politicians.  Oh, yeah, we had a lot of politicians coming in speaking.  And lobbyists, for example, so that we were touching all parts--many different parts of society.
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna go back to upward mobility for a second because one of the challenges that people still talk about as it relates to minorities and women coming up the corporate ladder is if they didn't grow up in a particular environment, how were they navigating this new territory?
Speaker 2: They should--if they were really bright and really talented and really aspire, they could come to my program.  (Laughter) We could, it was important that we had people who came to the program with a high degree of intelligence and ability and aspiration.  You had to have--you had to bring that with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They had that, but you said they could expand their--
Speaker 2: --yes, but then it--they could still be very--they could still be very uncomfortable in certain settings.
Story_ID: 631797
Speaker 1: See, I had another program, the fellows program when I brought--totally on my expense.  I took them to Washington, D.C., and we dealt with another think tank, was the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  That's one that's still very active in Washington, and they held seminars for us, and fascinating seminars.  Then there was another one here, the New York City Partnership [Partnership for New York City, New York, New York] that I dealt with and I had my people make presentations to the New York Ci- but that was another whole program.  As I say, I had three programs.
Speaker 2: And how long did you--well, how long did that program live?
Speaker 1: The FCI [Fund for Corporate Interns, Inc.; Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.]?  I think we were about twenty-two years.  I think it was about twenty-two years.  But then the time had come.  I had--I was going off--I was getting old, I was going off my boards, it was time for me to depart from my boards.  I'd reached the maximum age, and I did not have--I had--when you're on a board you have contacts, and people, and you have a certain camaraderie among your fellow directors.  You belong--it wasn't formal by any means, but you had a relationship with them, and you would ask something of them, they would come through for you just like that.
Speaker 2: Now, you say there were age limits on your boards--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --as part of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna say about sixty, sixty-five or--well, it depends upon the board.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], they were--I think you had to go up for that--oh, no, that was employees, that wasn't a board member.  The employees at IBM in those days--I don't know what it is now--you were very young when you left.  They wanted only the very young minds.
Speaker 2: And that wasn't considered ageism (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I do think--knowing what it's like to be out there and what the challenges are for you, I think it's very selfish of someone to stay on--oh, beyond--certainly beyond seventy.  Your mind is just not the same, it isn't.  And you--the shareholder deserves the best that they can get to be representing them, and I think as an outside director, you owe it to the shareholders to say, "Okay, it's time."  And do--and formalize it, you know.  You just don't say, "Well, I won't come this time, I'll come next time."
Speaker 2: Now, while you were still working on--with the Young Executive Program at Aspen [Aspen Institute, Washington, D.C.], your husband's [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] job changes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He goes to TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This is all in 1986.  That was a busy year.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Oh, they're all--they've all been busy.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  And where--this moved you back to New York City [New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To New York City.
Speaker 2: --'cause you'd been in Albany [New York]--very different, obviously, from New York City.
Story_ID: 631798
Speaker 1: I'm asking about the trip to South Africa.
Speaker 2: It was an extraordinary trip to South Africa.  The other board members of the company had been out to South Africa.  I had not been included in that trip.  The question came to the board at a proper board meeting, "Do we stay or do we go?"  Now, I had previously in--oh, maybe a year earlier, had taken a stand on an issue dealing with South Africa and I won big on that issue.  I'm not gonna go into that, but I won big.  I got somebody fired--big time.  They--I said I would not vote.  Coming back to the board meeting and being there with, with my cohorts, I said I would not vote until I was able to go out to South Africa and take a look at it.  They said, "Okay, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], we'll send you out."  So I went out with another director; he had--he was new on the board so he had not been there previously.  Great guy--lawyer.  I went with the head of security of the whole company (laughter), and the lawyer--the top lawyer--there were four of us on that trip.  They took us out, we went out by the--with the fast plane that we don't have anymore, we traveled around on that.  We got our own plane, we landed in Johannesburg [South Africa], I met with the authorities, the government authorities, I met with businessmen, people who own, naturally, shopping malls.  That's what we were at Kellogg [Kellogg Company], we were interested in shopping malls.  The business, the government person, for example, I said--I asked him, "Well, you have schools, grammar schools here in South Africa.  What do you do about those--the blacks and getting them well educated?"  And he had one of the famous names of South Africa--Botha.  He was a Botha, not the--well, he wasn't the prime minister but he was a Botha.  He said, he looked at me and he said, "We send them books, period."  (Laughter) That's what he said.  I went, we went--we had our own plane, we called on Chief Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi], we called on--it wasn't, it wasn't Bishop--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Tutu [Desmond Tutu]?
Speaker 2: Tutu--it was not Bishop Tutu, it was another bishop.  We called on him.  There were a lot of young black strong thinking, intelligent leaders that they made appointments with them for me.  It wasn't only the Kellogg's diary that I was keeping their calendar, it was another friend who had--who knew South Africa.  He was an American--he had been out in the field for a very long time, he knew the area extremely well and he knew all the people in it.  He was an independent at the time, he was very independent, and he was advising me on getting me work--getting--seeing to it that my itinerary was very well grounded, very well founded.
Story_ID: 631799
Speaker 1: And one of the people I called upon was Chris Dlamini.  Franklin Thomas [HistoryMaker Franklin A. Thomas] had--with the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], he had a big project going on in South Africa, which I had been invited to as--I don't know why, but I went anyway.  I was invited to it.
Speaker 2: And Chris Dlamini (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Chris Dlamini, he's the head of the union--all the union members at the plains plant of Kellogg Company in South Africa.  I called on him, and it was very, very secret.  We met in a little, little restaurant, a little hole in the ground kind of thing, and he was kind of being very careful and watching who was around and who was observing him with this American woman.  I'm black but still, when you're an American, you can't hide it.  And they got me an appointment with--there goes the mind again.  Madam--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Sisulu [Albertina Sisulu].
Speaker 1: Sisulu!  Her husband [Walter Sisulu] was number two to Mandela [Nelson Mandela], her husband.  But she was in house--under house arrest.  She was in Soweto [South Africa].  They got me a date with her to call on her in her home, under house arrest, and I went.  My friend, who was also my fellow board member, he said, "Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], I cannot take the risk of going on that trip."  He said, "I'm a married man and I have a family.  I--these people--I know what these people are gonna do.  I have to protect myself.  I can't go on that trip with you."  So, "Okay, I'll go by myself," and I did.
Speaker 2: To Soweto?
Speaker 1: To Soweto, yes.  I--we got a van--Kellogg Company got a van and the general counsel and the head of security--Kellogg security and myself and the driver--the driver was local.  And we went into Soweto.  It was an area--there were houses--you could see that there were houses, but there were no streetlights, nothing.  You had--they said they don't give them streetlights.  They--you just knew that they were houses.  I--we stopped the car and I said, "I can't see where I'm going, there's no streetlights here.  I don't think there's anybody here."  And I was told, "They know you're here."  (Laughter) So, I got outta the van and, and I was told, "Just walk straight ahead."  I walked straight ahead and I got to a door, and I rapped on the door, and a little lady came out and opened the door, and I said, "I'm Mrs. Wharton from the Kellogg Com- director of the Kellogg Company, and I would like to meet with Mrs. Sisulu."  The reply was, "She's expecting you, come in."  I went in, she closed the door, I was given--I went into a little parlor and I was given a seat in a wooden chair--very simple room--wooden chair, wooden table, water on the table--and then she came in.  Mrs. Sisulu came in.  She was a small, heavyset woman with an immense presence of strength, and we sat and we talked for about forty-five minutes.  And we got into a really deep conversation, and she looked me--we were talking about the Kellogg Company in South Africa, and she looked at me and she said, "My sister, remember, this is our fight.  We are glad that you are here, and we thank you for being here, but remember, my sister, this is our fight."  Bam!  It was a knockout!  And I thanked her and I left.  It was something.  It was a moment, it was a moment.  Then I got back in the van and met some more people and we took off.  It was very funny when we took off.  At that time, apartheid was still in action.  They could--the South African government could have taken me--could--as a black, they could have taken me out, and not let me leave.  So, my colleague, the other director and the general counsel, they crowded in on me.  I didn't know they had--they must have planned it.  They--we were going through--giving our passports in to be stamped and, you know, exiting, and they just crowded me, the two of them, and I gave my passport and they put their passports on top of mine so it was really fast done.  And then they (laughter) pushed me, and so we went through immigra- went out through immigration.  And my colleagues were seeing to it that I got out of there, and they were pushing me out of there.
Speaker 2: Because you weren't supposed to go to Soweto.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I have no idea, I have no--I--they just didn't want to take any risks of my going out of immigration and the government saying, "We won't let her go out," 'cause I was black.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was a riot (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 631800
Speaker 1: When a decision had to be made regarding whether you should stay or go--
Speaker 2: There was no decision, it was just something--I'm just relating the uniqueness of this story of how (laughter) really kind of prepared my colleagues were to see to it that I got out of there all right.  So that's it.  Oh!  But anyway, what I--let me me go back, let me go back.  I went to schools, I went to houses.  Kellogg [Kellogg Company] saw to it that their hirees could own their own houses, that was not being allowed in South Africa.  We were giving great gifts to schools to--seeing to it that they got into proper schools, we got teachers for them, we really got books for them.  We saw--we really saw to it that they were really well treated, and through Chris Dlamini the workers in the plants were really good, happy--they were good campers.  They were well cared for.  I met with some of the high school students who had left high school because they had given up.  They didn't want an education.  They were just--they just didn't want any part of whatever the government was giving, or anybody was giving, they wanted nothing of it.  It was this kind of conversation that I was having with those people there in South Africa.  But what I saw was that we were doing ev- though the stories abounded of the offenses that these poor people were going through, but what I saw was that Kellogg was doing the needful, as far as we were concerned, and being genuinely supportive, and not only us, I did not deal with the Kellogg Foundation [W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Battle Creek, Michigan]--it's big.  I'm not a--I was never a member of the Kellogg Foundation, though there was a member of the Kellogg Foundation on the board, he was one of the board members.  The Kellogg Foundation was making enormous gifts in there, I mean real gifts.  So that--my feeling was that in all honesty, the company was doing its utmost, its best, and doing a hell of a good job on it.  And this was a tear for me.  There is the feeling of a thrust that was carrying--being carried on in our country for the sake of the South--black South Africans.  But then there's the future also of these jobs held by these black people, these houses that were being bought by these employees, the students who were being trained.  So is it for a philosophical reason that I say we shouldn't be there?  We shouldn't be supporting this company and these people when I saw it for myself?  We were doing it, and so I said we should--I went back to Battle Creek [Michigan], and in the board meeting I said, "We should stay."
Speaker 1: And Chris Dlamini, did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I think it--oh, huh?
Speaker 1: Did--as, as representative of the union--
Speaker 2: Union?
Speaker 1: --was his opinion that you should stay?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  He didn't try to influence me.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't have those kind of--
Speaker 2: No.  I--well, we had deep conversations about--oh, well, I was asking him how they were being treated, how they were--you know, he was--they even sent him to the ILO [International Labour Organization], the United Nations [UN] labor union over there in Switzerland?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They got him out of jail.  The police were always putting him in jail for being a black in South--and working with the Kellogg Company.  They'd put him in jail, we'd go in and pull him out of jail.  We were really making contributions over there.  I was in support of my company.
Story_ID: 631801
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-three [1993]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: --is an important year (laughter) in your family.  Your husband [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] is announced as the new deputy secretary of state for Bill Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] presidency.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Secretary of state was Warren Christopher, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And one of the things my research says is that it was suggested that you resign from your boards so that there would not be a conflict of interest--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --a presumed conflict of interest.  How did you react to that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I--rather negatively.  I--who was it, there was a gentleman who was doing the whole interrogation of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) James Thessin [James H. Thessin].
Speaker 2: Thessin, yes.  James Thessin.  He was telling me I had to resign from all my boards, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he was the agency ethics officer.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I told him I didn't wanna resign from my boards.  Why should I resign from my boards?  So he said it was because of my husband's position as deputy secretary of state, that any conflict that he might have dealing with any of these corporations in these foreign countries, he would have to recuse himself.  So, I went into the issue of why I'm not an independent woman, and I said, "We black people have been slaves long enough.  I'm not going back there."  I did--I think I said that to him in so many words.  Do you have that written down?
Speaker 1: You said something like that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I did.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) "I thought wives gave up being our husbands' property years ago."
Speaker 2: I--that's right.  I did.  You have that, too?  By gosh!
Speaker 1: And so what--I mean that's a very strong reaction, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, well, what he finally came with--he finally came around, and he allowed me to remain on the Kellogg Company board and the Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.] board, but I had to go off to leave big oil.  I had to go off the Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66] board, he insisted that I go off the Phillips board.
Speaker 1: Did that make sense to you?
Speaker 2: No, but I did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I love my husband and I'll do anything for him, I really will.
Speaker 1: But speaking out for yourself, you were able to keep two of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I can stand up for myself, yes, I can.
Speaker 1: And your husband didn't stay in that role that long.
Speaker 2: Ten months, I think it was.
Speaker 1: So, one of the things that you all did during the time that he was in that role was to go to Southeast Asia.
Speaker 2: We went to Turkey and we--well, he went, he and I, on another trip as well, but I went to Turkey with him and I went to Southeast Asia, yes.
Speaker 1: And where you had lived in Southeast Asia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the beginning of--
Speaker 2: Of our--yes, in the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s], yes.
Speaker 1: Now, your going turned out to be a point of contention also.
Speaker 2: That's right, it was; I'd sort of forgotten it--yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember why?
Speaker 2: I was a woman, a wife of, and they didn't wanna be bothered.

Speaker 1: What I did was I went to--oh, god, the names.  That wonderful head--man who was the secretary of state, and he resigned.  And his (pause)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Cy Vance [Cyrus Vance].
Speaker 1: Cy Vance!
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: I knew, I knew Cy Vance.  I--Cy Vance was on the Rockefeller Foundation board, and when they entertained, they always included the wives, so I got to know the board family very well, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And your husband [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] had been--
Speaker 1: He'd been on the Rockefeller Foundation board--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Gay Vance [Grace Sloane Vance], his wife, had--was the head of an organization of a think group organization which I became co-chair of years later, so I had a tie-in with her.  So, I came to New York [New York] and I called on Gay to talk to her about her role as the wife of--was he deputy or he was secretary?  And she received me and we talked about it.  Cy was very ill, but he did come--we were talking, and I think she went into the bedroom.  I don't know what she said--probably something like, "You might be interested in this conversation."  So anyway, Cy came and he was in his pajamas--he was ill.  He was in his pajamas, he came out into the living room and we talked about it, and we talked about the fact that the present secretary [Warren Christopher] was not particularly fond of women and being involved in anything that the deputy secretary did.  Then I also talked to the prior deputy sec- the wife of the prior deputy secretary and she and I were conversant, and she told me she went on every trip she could with her husband and they just made it--she just said she insisted upon it and they just did it.  She said there wasn't any issue, she just did it.  So, I did it.
Speaker 2: Now, your husband ended up being a scapegoat for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think so, yes.
Speaker 2: --what happened?
Speaker 1: Oh, I would not take on that responsibility of relaying it without some real facts.  I just would not do that.
Speaker 2: But when--so his tenure was short (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: And when the time came for him to go, you supported leaving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good lord, yes.  I said, "Let's get the hell out of here."
Story_ID: 631803
Speaker 1: What did you all do after that?
Speaker 2: Came right back to the United Nations Plaza [New York, New York].  We never gave up the apartment.  I think it was a one week--I don't think it was a week between the time Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] handed in his resignation and we were back in here.  I was home.  I'm a New Yorker.
Speaker 1: And he, then, began working on his book, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Privilege and Prejudice: The Life of a Black Pioneer' [Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: You joined more boards (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: COMSAT Corporation [Communications Satellite Corporation]--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right, yes!  That was Mel Laird [Melvin Laird], Mel Laird had me do that.
Speaker 1: Say that again?
Speaker 2: My friend Melvin Laird was chairman of the COMSAT, and he invited--and I had gone--he knew, you know, he was secretary of defense, so he knew that I had to go off of the Kellogg [Kellogg Company] board, so when I was free, he said, "Well, come on the COMSAT board."
Speaker 1: So you had to go off the Kellogg board be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I meant--no, no, Phillips [Phillips Petroleum Company; Phillips 66].  I didn't mean to say Kellogg; I meant Phillips.  Mel was on the Phillips board.
Speaker 1: And then--so therefore you could--you had space--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because you had your quota of four--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at a time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, at that point you're sixty-five you're joining (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Little old lady (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you were still very active on boards.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then--well, tell me about the Capital Bank and Trust Company (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's in Albany [New York].  There were a group of men, one was--had been our financial advisor actually, but he'd retired and his son had taken over, and he wanted to start a bank up there in Albany; there was a lot of moseying around of banks and that kind of thing.  And he got seven men and he said, "We wanted a woman to come aboard, so how about it, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton]?"  So I--we sort of looked into it--oh, it'll be fun--so I did.  I was one of eight to start a bank in Albany, New York.
Speaker 1: And does this bank still exist?
Speaker 2: In part.  It--I did leave the board after--oh, I was on for quite a while, about--I've forgotten how long--about a good five, eight, six years--something like that.  And I had a wonderful time.  They had an attempted takeover when we were on--when the board was.  At one point somebody wanted to take the board over.  I had been on the Phillips Petroleum board when T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn wanted to take over Phillips Petroleum.  And they're gonna come after me and (laughter) up there in Albany?  I shouldn't speak it like that, I'm being condescending and I don't mean to be that.  But, yes, I did have a very good time, and I did know which end was up.
Speaker 1: Now, that was in '95 [1995] when you founded that board.  What--when you were part of that group.  What did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  Oh--well, we were here in New York at the Fund for Corporate Initiatives [Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.].  I was on--was I still on the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] board?  I've forgotten, I think--I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Well--so there--there's a whole group of not-for-profit boards that you were on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Oh, and City Center [New York City Center, New York, New York], which I loved--still do.  Yes, I was busy, I stayed busy, very busy.
Speaker 1: And in 2000, which is sixteen years ago 'cause we're in 2016, you and your husband celebrated your fiftieth wedding anniversary.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that event.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was wonderful.  That was just wonderful.  We had--we took over--we had a lovely room at the University Club [University Club of New York, New York, New York], Cliff had been a member there for a long time.  And we had a room--a lounge and a dining room, and we had friends just from all over.  They came from--well, they came as far as Michigan and certainly Albany and Chicago [Illinois], and all different kinds of places, and Bobby Short played for us, and it was a great big, wonderful, huge embrace.
Story_ID: 631804
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not sure about the timing, but I believe in that same year your son passed away.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: And so for--obviously, for a parent to lose a child is the hardest thing.
Speaker 2: There's nothing more difficult.
Speaker 1: But you and your husband created a charity as a result, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Can you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With the Enoch Pratt Library [Enoch Pratt Free Library] in Baltimore [Maryland].  I wanted to do something really creative, and I was looking for a way of making a gift to the library in young Clifton's [Clifton R. Wharton III] name.  He, too, is Clifton.  He's Clifton III, with a third, thank you very much.  And a friend of ours had the idea, which she shared--she was a librarian.  She said, "It would be a wonderful idea to go to a school that is teaching theatrics, and have the theater people read to the children, and assist them in their reading through the exercise of reading to them."  Clifton did read to children in the library.  I actually went to visit once.  I visited him at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he an educator?
Speaker 2: He was a librarian.  He got--oh, he was a--he got his master's in library science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to visit him a couple of times there at Enoch Pratt, just as a guest, and he would sit and read to school children.  It was just charming; it was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he in the main library downtown?
Speaker 2: He was in the main library, but then there were times they would send him to other branch libraries to do certain projects.  So it was when he was in the branch--I also visited him in the main library, too.  We would--he was 6'4", and he walked--you know, he really strolled around.  He was tall and handsome, and he would walk around that library and people adored him--had a delightful personality.  His favorite holiday was Halloween.  He was 6'4" and he would go and ride on a bus in a Frankenstein costume, that's the kind of sense of humor he had.
Speaker 1: And is the charity still--
Speaker 2: No, no.  We ran it--I think we ran it for ten years and it was a wonderful experiment, and we used the--it was Enoch Pratt Library, and then there was the school there, a university there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Towson [Towson University, Towson, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Towson University.
Speaker 1: Towson State University.
Speaker 2: Towson State University.  We went to their theater department, and the head of the theater department was delighted with the idea, and he got a team of students to do outreach, and they would go--and the library organized it so that they would go out into the schools and read to the students.  And then they did plays, and just had a wonderful time all year long, and then at the end of the year, Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] and I would go out and the students and the teachers--the students from Towson would perform, and it was a wonderful exercise, and we ran it for about ten years.  We, we made a substantial gift, and then lots of friends--when someone dies you say, "If you wanna make a gift."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it never ran out of money, I'm glad to say.  But then we decided that, you know, to bring it to an end after ten years.  But it was--it's a most positive exercise, wonderful memory.  We're very, very pleased we did it.
Story_ID: 631805
Speaker 1: At what point did you retire from your boards, or are you on any boards now?
Speaker 2: No--no, no.
Speaker 1: When did you--when did you retire?
Speaker 2: I've forgotten.  I think mostly if I was there at sixty-five, it certainly was by seventy--or maybe sixty-eight or seventy.  I decided it was time.  I hadn't began to lose it, I mean that wasn't why (laughter) I decided to go off.  I just am of that opinion that you are not the same mentally.  You just are not, and I just decided I was--I should go off.
Speaker 1: And so you have had many years since working--you and your husband [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]--of enjoying each other's company.
Speaker 2: I love him.
Speaker 1: After not working anymore, what is your time?
Speaker 2: Busy as we can be--very busy, yeah.  Was here in New York [New York], was--the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York]; it was at the City Center [New York City Center, New York, New York], was that--Off the Record--Off the Record foreign policy--some sort of foreign policy--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: No, no.  You were saying the name of something, correct?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: The name of it was Off the Record something.  There, there were a lot of organizations that I was involved in, but I was still very much involved with FCI at that time.  I was still holding conferences with the fellows and taking them--I took them on trips.
Speaker 2: And FCI, can you say what that stands for?
Speaker 1: The Fund for Corporate Initiatives [Fund for Corporate Initiatives, Inc.].
Speaker 2: So that was the third (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  There was the--that was the umbrella.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was the internships, there was the executives, and there was the fellows under the umbrella of the initiatives (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And for--okay.  And then that lasted at Aspen [Aspen Institute, Washington, D.C.] until 2001.
Speaker 1: Did it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And do you remember why it closed?
Speaker 1: I just thought it was--well, for those reasons I cited.  I just didn't have the contacts that I had, and getting, I got the most outstanding people in Corporate America to come.  I mean these were the CEOs, they were showing up in there, but I--being off the boards it just wasn't the same so I decided it was time to close it.  And then it closed--I forgot that Walter Isaacson took over, and he came to me.  We were at Ron Lauder's [Ronald Lauder] house.  You know Ron Lauder?
Speaker 2: Estee Lauder Company [The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Correct.  And Walter came and said, "I've got to talk to you, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], I want you to--I wanna start up FCI, start up the young executive program again.  I think it's a wonderful idea."  So, they took a shot at it, and I went we talked about the approach, and they were gonna use a lot of--they have a lot of executives on the board of the Aspen Institute--they were going to do that, but the success--one of the main successes I had was the initiatives on my own that they couldn't do.  I gave that one week a full year to get ready for it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was a lot of work and a lot of money.  I was doing it for myself, for, for my--for what I wanted to do--my venture, and Aspen didn't have that kind of time or that kind of money that they were gonna put it in the way that I did it, and the program just--it didn't shape out.
Speaker 2: Well--and by that time, weren't corporations beginning to incorporate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely--sorry--absolutely.
Speaker 2: --what you were doing into their human resources?
Speaker 1: Yes, that is correct.  You also--I don't know that much about the history of the executive leadership program, but that was a big one.  That was a major one that was coming on stream.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was being--it was also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you were a pioneer.
Speaker 1: Well, it's very nice of you to say so.  I'm awfully glad that I did what I did.  I don't think--I do think that no one saw--no--at the time I did it, I don't think there was anybody else doing it.
Story_ID: 631806
Speaker 1: You're writing your memoirs now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is that process like for you?
Speaker 2: It's fun.  I've had a good time--a lot of chuckles.  It's been therapeutic as far as family concerned when--in writing about them.  There's some--you, you can have family and not get mad at them (laughter), so you write it down and you really think about what happened and how it happened, and who did what and said what, and this kind of thing, and you say, "Oh, what--so what."  And it was a good exper- it was a great experience, and then it was wonderful reliving all those experiences that I did have.  There's a lot that was left out; a lot that I enjoyed but just didn't think it was--a reader would necessarily wanna read about it.  And then there was also Cooperstown [New York], and that was--we were running two major domestic environments.  I mean being here, it's a full-time world that we live in here, it's a New York international world.  Everyone--practically everyone we know, at some time or other, is gonna come through New York [New York].  Everybody comes to New York.
Speaker 1: In Cooperstown, when did you all build a house there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't build--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --the house was already there.  It was a friend of mine who was on the Albany Law School [Albany, New York] who owned--who built the house, and we bought it.  Same year.
Speaker 1: As this one.
Speaker 2: This was a few months ahead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Sorry?
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Nineteen eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 2: Okay, 1987.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you were maintaining your two homes--you split your time how?
Speaker 1: Well, basically it was half and half, but we were young, and we were able to travel on weekends, so we spent a lot of weekends even through the winter.  We even had Thanksgivings and Christmases up there, but now, at the end of September, certainly going into the middle of August, we're out of there until April or May.  We just can't handle it anymore.
Story_ID: 631807
Speaker 1: So as you look at your life--which you've been doing because you have been working on your memoir, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Your legacy.
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I've never really thought about it.  I--on this--I guess the Aspen Institute [Washington, D.C.] board--I think it was the Aspen Institute board.  The woman who was the governor of Georgia, a marvelous personality, big personality.  You'd know it if I could come up with her name.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Texas.
Speaker 2: Huh?  Texas!
Speaker 1: It's Ann--
Speaker 2: Ann--yes.
Speaker 1: What--yeah.
Speaker 2: Damn, I can't think of her name.
Speaker 1: I know who you mean but I can't think of her name.
Speaker 2: She said, "I never," she said, "I do not want on my epitaph that 'She did--she ran a good kitchen.'"
Speaker 1: Ann Richards?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's who it was, Ann Richards, yes.  "I do not want it on my tombstone that 'She ran a good kitchen.'"  And I think that's just about where I am--don't say that I was a good cook.  I am a good hostess and I know that, but it's just one of those side affairs, and besides, I really don't wanna be remembered as a hostess.  I was--I wanted a place at the table, and I think I got pretty, pretty well along on that--on that exercise of getting a place at the table.
Story_ID: 631808
Speaker 1: Young folks--young black folks today coming up, building their dreams, what advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Go out there and live it--live it to the fullest, but think about what you're doing, you know; go, go, go home, go out in the woods, go someplace--really think about what you're doing and the value of it, and how it is--how it is rewarding you.  You've got a certain amount of time, and you could use that time--you could waste it while sitting down watching television, or you can use it by studying and preparing for the future, or walking into--dealing with people.  You, you, you can, you can deal with a lot of dummies, you can deal with a lot of bright people--it's your choice.  So think about what you're doing with your time; don't waste it, but think about.
Speaker 1: What advice do you have for married couples today?  You know, our society is very busy, lots of distractions.  You've been married for how many years now?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six.
Speaker 1: What wisdom do you have to share?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry they're not all like Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]--the husbands.  I don't know; I'm being, being silly.  I just think it's believing in the marriage and believing in the other person and being there with, with, with your support and your love, and doing, doing it sincerely.  It--there's tremendous sincerity in our relationship--tremendous sincerity, and it's wonderful.  I can't imagine life without him; I mean I really can't.
Story_ID: 631809
Speaker 1: And you are now what age?
Speaker 2: I'm eighty-nine years old.
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine years young is what my mother would say (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't mind being old.
Speaker 1: No, but--
Speaker 2: No, it's okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's okay being old.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: As long as you feel good it's great.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As long as you feel good and you have your common--your good senses about you, sure it's great--it's okay.  Don't give in to it--you don't have to, you don't have to give in to it.  I'm not giving in to it; I'm up in that gym three times a week with a trainer--here and in Cooperstown [New York].  I think it's the answer.  And reading.  I love the reading thing--I love words.  You would say, "Lady, why weren't you using some of them when you're sitting here talking to [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole?"  But I look upon words as jewelry--they're my--in the jewel box, and I just love using the jewelry and hanging them on.  And I love literature.  I tend to like literature of current events, be it politics or history, or whatever, but it's something, something that is not--I'm not as big on fiction unless it's really awfully good, and somebody who--the British have a wonderful use of words, but that I think is useful, and I don't have a lot of time for people--I don't have a lot of time for people who don't speak well.  I think it's an imposition on me to have to listen to you, and I don't want--I don't--please don't impose on me.  And there are a lot of our people who speak badly--really badly because they think it's okay.  Well, I'm very sorry, I don't think it's okay, I think it's ridiculous.  I'll leave that at that.
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: One I will answer very quickly and I will not go any further.  And that is--as it relates to young Clifton [Clifton R. Wharton III].  And we lost him.  I've not gotten over it, I can't talk about it--it hurts very, very deeply, and what did I do so wrong to where I might have been able to have made it different?
Story_ID: 631810
Speaker 1: Let's look to the future.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: What does the future look like for Dolores Wharton [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton]?
Speaker 2: I'm still busy with the present, I'm sorry.  It's still today, and the one thing--there's just one thing I'd like to change in my life--I don't like to cook.  And it's going to be very diffi- in Cooperstown [New York] it'll be easier 'cause we have the space up there in Cooperstown; we have--it's a lovely, wonderful, big house and lots of property, and a huge kitchen and, and rooms for maids and that kind of thing, but in--New York City [New York, New York] life does not lend itself to having a lot of people around, and Cliff [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] and I are very private people.  We love our life together, and I don't know that I really want a lot of people in here with us while we're enjoying ourselves, and we do enjoy dining together.  And how does one have dining together and all the service if you (laughter), if you don't want a cook and a waitress in here doing it for you?  So I haven't worked it out yet.
Speaker 1: What do you all do for fun?
Speaker 2: We go out and eat.  We do; we go to the best restaurants in New York City and we love it.  We go to the theater.  My--of course my love is museums, I love museums.  And of course now that I'm old and with back problems, and heart problems and whatnot, I take a walker into the museums.  I don't walk in the street with a walker, but when I go to the museums, I do use my walker so I can really enjoy myself and walk and look and sit and--I can get lost in the museum forever.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite museum?
Speaker 2: The Modern [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York].  I was on the board of the Modern for about ten years.  It's--the Modern is mine; I own it, but the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] is coming on pretty strong with the new collection that they have.  Talk about Lauder [Ronald Lauder], boy!  Whew!  The Modern is getting--the Met is getting some wonderful art in there; it's grand.  And then architecture is great--Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]--you know, I was very much involved in the selection of the architect for the new museum at Michigan, the Broad Museum [Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, East Lansing, Michigan] at Michigan State.  Unfortunately, we lost her--Zaha Hadid--she was an Iraqi, born Iraqi, but she was a British architect.  And what's going on in architecture now, ooh, it's wonderful.  Architecture did not come into my life the way it has now, as fully blossomed as it is now.  When I was younger, it was mostly the galleries and the museums, and the artists--the, the modern, the contemporary, 20th century--oh!  I love it.  I just, just love it.  And I'm ready to go.  And it's today; I'm not worried about tomorrow, I'm not there.

Speaker 1: Please tell me about this photo.
Speaker 2: This was a reception in Washington [D.C.] soon after I had gone on the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] as a council member.  It was a presidential appointment.  I was appointed by President Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], and we are standing there with President Ford, Mrs. Ford [Betty Ford]--the very tall lady in the back, her husband was the head of The Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.].  Rosalind Russell, this famous movie star in my day, and then I'm standing next to my good husband [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.].
Speaker 1: There you go.
Speaker 2: Was that short enough?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Perfect.
Speaker 2: That's great.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is (unclear) the romance between my wonderful husband and myself.  We--it's a black tie party at Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan] on the stage, one of the--of our small theater, at Wharton theater [Clifton and Dolores Wharton Center for the Performing Arts, East Lansing, Michigan].  We had two theaters and this was in the small theater.
Speaker 1: Around what time?
Speaker 2: It was a New Year's party.
Speaker 1: But what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, it was before the turn of the century (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where were--were you at Michigan State?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  This was after we left.
Speaker 1: Oh, we had left then.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Oh, this was in Indonesia.  We had--we were--a field trip, stopping in many ports in Southeast Asia, and we had taken a trip up to the summer palace of Prime Minister Sukarno.  He was not in power then, I think.  And we're standing there with the, with the--many of the group that were on that flight with us throughout Southeast Asia.
Speaker 1: And this is around when?
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993], excellent.
Speaker 2: That's--this is about that same trip in Southeast Asia.  I was calling on the prime mi- the wife of the prime minister of the Philippines.  We were there in the palace.
Speaker 1: President, your husband said.
Speaker 2: What did I say?
Speaker 1: Prime minister.
Speaker 2: Oh, sorry--president of the Philippines.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of the board of directors of the Phillips Petroleum Company [Phillips 66].  I've forgotten what year that was, there were my colleagues and myself, in blue.
Speaker 2: I was on one of hundreds--maybe even--well, I won't go into thousands, but a whole lot of tours that I made to factories all over the world--not all of it was developing, to look at cereal coming off those, those machines getting ready to be boxed.
Speaker 1: And this is Kellogg (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kellogg Company.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We were in Stavanger [Norway].  The board of trustees--the board of directors of the Phillips Petroleum Company was taking a board trip out to Ekofisk, and we were on the coast there of Stavanger in Norway on our way out to the platform Ekofisk--helicopter ride--little two hour helicopter ride.
Speaker 1: That is the--one of the platforms of the oil well of Ekofisk in Norway.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Ekofisk?
Speaker 1: E-K-O-F-I-S-K.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: This was a photograph Allen Neuharth had asked be taken of me.  It's very soon--very, very soon after USA Today had first been published, and it is outside of our residence.  I lived in these towers--the little tower there on--in the middle of the picture--with snowman.
Speaker 2: Outside of your residence at--
Speaker 1: At the State University of New York in Albany [State University of New York at Albany, Albany, New York].
Speaker 2: And this is about when?
Speaker 1: Well, it was Albany [New York] so we were living in Albany, so it had to have been in the late '80s [1980s], very late '80s [1980s]--1980s.
Speaker 2: We had made a--I had--we had made a trip to China, and I was on a mission to visit the--really to visit the China Medical Board, of which I was a trustee, in New York, but we had not been--the China Medical Board had not been in China since 1949, and I am standing next to a gentleman, the Chinese gentleman with a bowtie, who was our escort throughout the entire trip.
Speaker 1: This is the same trip to China for me to visit the China Medical Board, and it's outside the premises there of the institution, and I'm standing there with Dr.--what is his name?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Crowe?
Speaker 1: Huh?

Speaker 2: I was first lady, Michigan--of State University of New York [State University of New York System] visiting a deep sea excursion when we were--when my husband was there as president, and I was christening a boat that was going off into the waters.
Speaker 1: I was speaking at--I think that's a picture of one of the colleges of the--one of the sixty-four colleges of the State University of New York, and I was making an address, probably on corporate social responsibility, to an audience there, locally.
Speaker 2: That was--this is my first honorary degree.  I've received nine--this is the first--of Central Michigan University [Mount Pleasant, Michigan].  This--I was still at Michigan State, so this was in the mid--early 1970s, and Lloyd Cofer was the president--was a trustee of Central Michigan, was presenting me with the honorary degree.
Speaker 1: We had a huge benefit at Michigan State University--a huge fundraiser with--'Tony and Lena Sing' was the feature, and my husband and I meeting after the performance with Tony [Tony Bennett] and Lena [Lena Horne].
Speaker 2: This follows the 'Tony and Lena Sing.'  There was no such building when that 'Tony and Lena Sing,' but this is the result of that, that effort, and this is my husband, and Ken Beachler was very instrumental.  He and I and my husband were the ones who really laid the groundwork for what is now the Clifton and Dolores Wharton Center for the Performing Arts at Michigan State University.
Speaker 1: I am enjoying a week's visit at one of the residence--women's residence halls at Michigan State University, and we're walking out after dinner to go have a good women's conversation in the dormitory.
