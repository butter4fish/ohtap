Speaker 1: What has been your lifelong profession and what is your present job, sir?
Speaker 2: Well I started off being a cigarette salesman for I guess Pilarlar Tobacco Company [ph.] way, way back.  I guess I was one of the first Afro American hired by that particular company.  And that was part of my beginning.  The other thing that I begun was working for Lyndon B. Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] in the War on Poverty and administering poverty programs in the State of South Carolina.  And thereafter, I passed the bar exam, started practicing law and I did that for approximately thirty-one or thirty-two years.

Story_ID: 534466
Speaker 1: If I can just ask you five simple warm-up type questions, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I love seafood, any kind, as long as it's seafood.  I love it, but I'm not sure it's good for my cholesterol.  And you know, love a good steak every now and then, and seafood gumbo, love to make and eat gumbo, you know.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is brown.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh I like springtime, love springtime.
Speaker 1: And your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: All over the world.  I say that because I've traveled, you know, extensively and would like to go back to places like Hong Kong in the future.  I would love to go back to some of these historical sites.  I have not had a chance to go into many foreign countries, and I mean like Russia or some other location, would like to do that.  But normally I like to be in and around a resort area and a beach area.  That's what I like very much.
Speaker 1: You have a favorite expression or a favorite saying?
Speaker 2: Yep.  The best day of my life.  Each and every day I can hit that floor with my face facing the rising sun, I just say the best day of my life.  Thank you God and I'm gonna move positive--forward with a very positive attitude.
Story_ID: 534467
Speaker 1: Let us explore, just a little bit, of your family background if we can, Judge [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.].  Let's talk first starting about your mom.  Would you state your mom's name and tell us where she was born please?
Speaker 2: My mom was named Mag- Maggie Ruth Andrews [Maggie Andrews Arrington].  Momma was from Baldwin County [Georgia], Milledgeville, Georgia.  And she was the daughter of Jack [Jack Andrews] and Ida Andrews [Ida Hitchcock Andrews].
Speaker 1: And she grew up in Milledgeville, Georgia?
Speaker 2: No, momma grew up there the early part of her life and then they moved to Pittsburgh, here in the City of Atlanta [Georgia], and that's where she was reared.  And went to Booker T. Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia] and completed the tenth grade at that particular institution.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you, or would you share with us some of the stories you heard from her about her growing up please?
Speaker 2: Oh, just growing up.  And many of the men in her life were businessmen.  Small merchants, you know.  There were farmers, but owned stores and what have you.  And if you go back and look at the Hitchcocks, it was a very enterprising city.  And I guess that's where we took up with my grandfather, Johnny "Jack" Andrews, was a vendor.  He had a vegetable truck.  And it was mobile, it would move around the community and sell whatever vegetable that was needed.  And I worked in that environment.  My father [George Arrington] subsequently owned a store here in Atlanta, a grocery store, and I worked that.  So I always tell people I was the marketing director during that period of time.
Story_ID: 534468
Speaker 1: How many children were in her family, do you know that?
Speaker 2: Oh I think mom [Maggie Andrews Arrington], she had three siblings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --two brothers and a sister.  They all preceded her in life.
Speaker 1: Her father is Johnny "Jack" Andrews [Jack Andrews] and her mother is Ida, what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Ida Hitchcock Andrews.
Speaker 1: Hitchcock Andrews.  What stories--oh did you get to know them?
Speaker 2: Well I got to know them.  But they just had good work ethics and believe in right and wrong.  And if you did something that was wrong, you were in big trouble.  So you always knew that you had somebody there to say to you, boy that's not right, that's not the right thing to do.  And he was a strict disciplinarian, but I admired my grandfather.  There was one here and one living in Columbus, Ohio, you know.  I didn't get a chance to interact with him too much, the one in the State of Ohio, but my other grandfather [Idus Arrington] I got a chance to be with him and was there when he passed and I knew of his goodness.
Speaker 1: And he lived his--lived out his life down in the Milledgeville [Georgia] area, or--?
Speaker 2: No, they--he was from (unclear) area, but like I said he moved here early on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Moved here, that's right.
Speaker 2: And they settled on a little place called Lynwood Park [Atlanta, Georgia] out in DeKalb County [Georgia].  Okay.  And we still own that property in DeKalb County.
Speaker 1: I see.  Great.  Did you know his parents, his--your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, I knew--I did know his parents, but they never got married.  His name was Ira Andrews [sic. Idus Arrington] and grandmamma was named Lucy Shepherd [ph.], and--
Speaker 1: Were they from this area or were they from down in the Milledgeville area (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were down in Milledgeville--no, I mean down in Harris County [Georgia], yeah.
Speaker 1: Harris County, all right, sir.  Let's look at your grandmother, Ms. Ida Hitchcock.  Was she originally from down in that area?
Speaker 2: Milledgeville.
Speaker 1: Milledgeville as well.
Speaker 2: And she was a homemaker for the better part of her life.  I never saw my grandmamma get up and go to work.  They ran--he sold groceries on his (unclear) Nash pickup truck and they maintained a little grocery store in the back of the house where they served candy and stuff like that.  And grandmamma kind of ran that operation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know her parents?
Speaker 2: No I did not.  Never got a chance to meet her parents.
Story_ID: 534469
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear any stories from either the Andrews side of the family or the Hitchcock side of the family regarding the origin of their names or their origins, whether they're from Mother Africa or whether they have Indian [Native American] ancestors or whether they have European ancestors, any stories about--
Speaker 2: Well they were unlettered and some could not read and write.  So there's not much history, but hand-me-down history that somebody may have told them and they, you know, hailed from the great state of Virginia.  And the reason I believe that to be true, I got a chance to talk to Alex Haley many years ago and I told him my name was Arrington and he said, "Boy, you from Virginia."  And we just kind of smiled about that, you know.  But I really don't know if we were in fact from Virginia. What happened to my grandfather, Idus, you know, Arrington [Idus Arrington], he got involved in a Saturday night brawl and he had killed a man.  And the white people that he was working for was named Arrington.  So he moved to Atlanta [Georgia] and just assumed their name because he know that the law wasn't behind him.  And he subsequently left here and went on to Columbus, Ohio.
Story_ID: 534470
Speaker 1: Any other stories or anything else you'd like to share about your mom's [Maggie Andrews Arrington] side of the family in terms of lessons learned, or admirable traits that you tried to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My momma basically was a Christian and lived by the Golden Rule.  Straightforward, didn't have lots of a social life.  Her children was her obligation and opportunity, and you know, she cooked, went to PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meeting.  She worked, she was a domestic worker.  But I just think my momma was--was one of the finest human being I ever met in my life.  And because of her, I am where I am today.
Speaker 1: So she had a profound impact on your life?
Speaker 2: A profound impact.  At one time, I started to drop out of law school when I was a freshman at Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington D.C.].  And talked to her over the telephone and she begged me not to do it, and--because I was not going back the second semester.  But after that conversation with her, I decided to stay there and make my way and grind it out.  And so it was that conversation I will carry it to my grave telling me, "Boy, don't you drop out of school."  And reminded me of Paul Laurence Dunbar who said, life has not been a crystal stair for me, you know.  You're gonna have some hard times, but if you work hard to succeed, then you succeed.
Story_ID: 534471
Speaker 1: Regarding your father's side of the family, what was your father's name and where was he from?
Speaker 2: George Robert Arrington [George Arrington], his nickname was Bully.  I don't know how he got that, B-U-L-L-Y, and he was from, which is now Pine Mountain [Georgia], but back in his day it was Chipley, Georgia.  And that's where daddy was from.  He didn't have any brothers nor sisters.  And his grandmamma and his auntie raised him.
Speaker 1: Any idea of--let's go back, any idea of your mother's [Maggie Andrews Arrington]--your grandmot- your mother's date of birth and then tell me your dad's date of birth approximately?
Speaker 2: I don't have those off the top of my head, but they are easily ascertainable because I just completed my autobiography ['Making My Mark: The Story of a Man who Wouldn't Stay in His Place,' Marvin S. Arrington], where I made a reference to the 1800, the later part of the 1800.
Speaker 1: Where did your dad grow up?
Speaker 2: In Summerhill here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you share with us what you know about his background and his growing up and kind of describe him?
Speaker 2: Well he was a product of a single--single family.  And I'm just not sure that my late grandfather [Idus Arrington] and his mother [Lucy Shepherd (ph.)] ever got married because she maintained the name Shepherd [ph.] throughout.  And my father, I thought, was a pretty bright guy even though he only complete the tenth or the eleventh grade and went to David T. Howard High School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Were you closer to your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: I was closer to my mom--
Speaker 1: What was your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because she was in the household.  She was there and a house maker.  So she was the last face we see in the morning when we leave going to school and first face we would see coming home in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Did your dad ever share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  We did not necessarily have a close relationship.  So I never got a chance to sit down and confide in him for him to tell me those type of stories that I think would've helped me to understand his background and his conduct and character.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about his parents?  Well you mentioned both his parents.  Any--any stories from them regarding their background?
Speaker 2: No.  Never had that type of conversation.  Years ago, before my mother passed, I sit down and taped her.  Lo and behold the secretary I had at that time lost the tape after I had interviewed of three or four hours about her background and wanted to know about war stories and what had happened.  And that darn tape got lost.  I was serious.
Speaker 1: I understand.  Can you trace any further back than your grandparents on your dad's side?
Speaker 2: No I cannot.
Story_ID: 534472
Speaker 1: Anything else you'd like to share about your father's [George Arrington] people or your mother's [Maggie Andrews Arrington] people and the stories you heard from them that made a difference in your growing up?
Speaker 2: I was more around my mother's people.  Go to Milledgeville [Georgia] in the summertime.  I had cousins that we- age-wise were comparable to mine and we still communicate to this day.  In fact, talked to one about ten days ago through voicemail.  I called her to say hello, she returned my call and I was not at home.  But we have, religiously speaking, family reunions and I always look forward to going back, particularly those people who are still alive and talk about just growing up together.  We literally grew up like brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Where do you have those reunions?
Speaker 2: All over the place.
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of rotate around?
Speaker 2: We've had 'em down in Milledgeville on the Hitchcock side.  Andrews side down in Pine Mountain [Georgia].  We've had 'em in Cleveland [Ohio].  We've had 'em in Pennsylvania.  Had one this year in Illinois.  We just move around.
Story_ID: 534473
Speaker 1: Both of your parents [Maggie Andrews Arrington and George Arrington] grew up during the era of Jim Crow in the South.  Any stories from them regarding how they managed to cope with life in those days?
Speaker 2: Ah it was just--it was hard for everybody to cope.  You kind of knew your place and certain things you do and certain things you do not do.  My daddy as a young man was accused of sassing out a white woman and her husband was a police officer.  And two of them caught him one night and beat him unmercifully.  In fact, we thought he was gonna die.  Because he allegedly cussed at or sassed her back and what have you.  And I'll never forget the beating that was administered.  It was just uncalled for, you know, physical, you know.  So that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Do you think those type of stories had any impact on--on you as a young man coming along?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the lookout.  The thing that--that will be in my mind forever was the shooting of a neighborhood friend by the name of James Jackson [ph.], who was going home one night and for whatever reason there was no disrespect, but he was shot and a knife was planted on him.  And we know that a knife was planted on him, okay.  And he must've been shot eight, nine times and survived.  And I've told that story to my son [Marvin Arrington, Jr.] for almost sixteen to seventeen years and I don't think he necessarily believed me.  But once said, I was shopping at a five and ten cent store, (Unclear) on Marietta Street [Atlanta, Georgia], and James Jackson walked in.  I had not seen him twenty, twenty-five years.  I said, "James, Marvin [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.]."  He said, "Hey Marvin."  He walked over and I said I tell my son all the time man about how those police officers shot you down.  He said, "Marvin, it will be with me to the end of my--my life."  And it was my son (unclear) that said, "You were actually telling the truth?"  I said, "Absolutely."  I said, "There was no reason in the world for James Jackson having been shot by Atlanta police officer anywhere from eight to ten times. It was unconscionable what they did to him."
Story_ID: 534474
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit more about the early, your early memories.  As a young child coming along, just a tot, what, what are some of your earliest memories?
Speaker 2: Oh you're asking about early memories and I remember going to segregated schools and getting books where the pages was torn out and not being able to have any continuity in the subject matter.  And that's why I appreciated laws, school teachers and in this particular context I'm talking about Afro American school teachers because they did in fact have books where there was--where pages were not missing.  And they were able to teach, you know, those lessons that was omitted from our books, and all you had to do would be attentive and listen to, you know, what they were saying.  And so that impacted me.  Never understood nor accepted why we could not compete against the white high schools.  I really wanted to know how good we were.  And we were always taught that they had better facilities, better football players, and always accepted that they may have had better facilities.  But athletes that I played with both in high school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and college [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] were exceptional.
Story_ID: 534475
Speaker 1: Take for the instance, the late Mack Jones who went to H.M. Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and went on to become the center fielder for the Milwaukee Braves, came back with the Atlanta Braves.  And the first athlete I know to turn professional.  The second one was a guy who's now deceased, the late Allen Smith who was a running back at Fort Valley State College [Fort Valley State University] down in Fort Valley, Georgia who went on to play for the Buffalo Bills for a short period of time before being injured.  You know, I recall just great athletes.  A guy, you know, named Robert Thompson, we called him Skinny, who's probably the best all-around athlete that I'd ever seen in my lifetime.  Quarterback, guard on the basketball team, tennis player and he was the first baseman on the baseball team.  And probably was the first full-letter man to come through Turner High School.  And always admired him and looked up to him and I was so happy when he went to Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] for a year or two, to know that he was competing at the collegiate level.  He was a tremendous athlete.  And--but all this gets lost in history 'cause we don't have anybody writing history for us.
Story_ID: 534476
Speaker 1: That and other thing is that in, when they passed the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka] in 1954, and a boyhood friend of mine, Melvin Rivers [ph.] and I were riding out with bicycles in a western direction on Simpson Road [Atlanta, Georgia].  And this '40 [1940] Ford car pulled up next to us and white man moved over to the passenger side and hawked up and spit (unclear) in my face and unprovoked in any way, shape, form or fashion.  And I was so hurt, I just laid down on the ground and cried, because what was a sixth grader going to do to a white adult.  That impacted me and I didn't know until later on in life that I had some outstanding public school teachers.  You know, a lady by the name of Ms. Winkfield [ph.] may have graduated from Clark [Clark University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Articulate, bright, knew her subject matter.  The late Lois Wright.  The principal [of Alonzo F. Herndon School, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time, Odessa Davis was a graduate of Clark University, and it was Clark University even back in those days.  It went from Clark University to Clark College, then I proposed the name Clark Atlanta University, which was adopted and ratified by the board of trustees.  But she was a good principal and you had to work hard to earn your way.  And great competitors and people that went on to get their medical degrees, their law degrees and Turner High [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] was a good place to be during those particular days.
Story_ID: 534477
Speaker 1: So your earliest memories are that others may have had superior facilities, but in terms of the individual, your teachers, your outstanding teachers, were able to help develop the youngsters athletically and academically such that they could go on and be all they could be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I learned from them how to compete and I never did accept inferiority that I could not do.  I did what I had to do, you know.  Had a great high school coach who helped me get a scholarship to Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and I'm not even sure, and athletically speaking that I was able to go on to college and play quarterback.  And when I got to college I had to change my position to linebacker.  And that was not a problem for me.  At some point in time after my senior year in high school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia], I had this hunger, this desire to get a college education.  And as I said to you, my mother [Maggie Andrews Arrington] instilled that in us, because there was five of us and we all got post-graduate degrees.  And as I talk here today, all of the other children, except one, got post-graduates degrees.  And that's because somebody sitting there saying to you stay in there.  And I asked my son [Marvin Arrington, Jr.] one day after he had graduated from the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], did he ever contemplate no--not going to college.  He said daddy, almost quote, he said come on man, he said, my grandmother on my wife's side, Myrtle Jones, who was a profound educator and had her B.A. degree from Clark Atlanta University [sic. Clark University; Clark Atlanta University] either the late '30s [1930s] or the first of the late '40s [1940s], somewhere--at '37 [1937].  And went on to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] to get the master's [degree] in '51 [1951] or '52 [1952] and was an educator for fifty-plus years, English major.  And so she was in and around my children.  She spent quality times with them.  And for that I will forever be indebted to her.  She's real sick right now and she deserves God's grace, care, understanding and sensitivity.  So my children were exposed to that type of education background, and plus all of his uncles and aunts had B.A. degrees and post-graduate degrees.
Story_ID: 534478
Speaker 1: Share with me what life was like around the Arrington household on a school morning, let's say in elementary or middle school?
Speaker 2: I don't know, we always mad with my brother [Joseph Arrington] because we only had one toilet.  He always thought that he could go in there and stay two or three hour until--putting my dad [George Arrington] in behind him, you know.  But you know, get up in the morning and you know, get ready for school.  Always had breakfast and my children [Marvin Arrington, Jr. and Michelle Arrington] always had breakfast.  My ex-wife [Marilyn Jones Arrington] was good about making sure they were properly fed and clothes was clean, and helped them with their education.  And so she was very valuable to my two children.  And so growing up in, you know, and getting out and competing.  The one thing I would not do again if I had to live that life over just to hang out with the bad guy, you know.  But that's basically how you survived in that environment.  And, but I would be more attentive to my books.  You know, even though my daughter tells me all the time, "Oh, Pop, you worked out okay," you know.
Story_ID: 534479
Speaker 1: All right Judge Arrington [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.], as we continue, you've talked about life around the, the household on a normal day, how about on holidays around the young Arrington household on Christmas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We always had great holidays.  Families, you know, collard greens, potato custard and gifts.  And you always got that extra pair of shoes or that one suit you wanted.  You know, there's a place called Target [ph.], it was shore up--a store up on Mitchell Street [Atlanta, Georgia].  You got a chance to go to Target, man, and pick out something, and go to the Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia] basement.  And so I--holidays were great, in fact.  But my favorite holiday is not Christmas.  My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving, where you can come together and thank the master for all of your rewards and have family there.  And it's not like any other day.  And I love having people, people over, I love to carve turkeys, whatever, and so I love those holidays.
Story_ID: 534480
Speaker 1: Are you much of a cook yourself, Judge [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: --you know, I did not get married until I was thirty-one years of age.  So I was out of college at twenty-one, twenty-two and was a bachelor and did not have much flexibility in terms of, you know, someone preparing my food.  I could always stop by my momma [Maggie Andrews Arrington] though and have a plate.  But I went to work for the Union Pacific Railroad in 1960--'61 [1961] in a little place called Ogden, Utah and saw the cooks on the railroad.  I was a waiter and, you know, you would see them cooking and then so, you know, you learn how to go home and you know, make grits, how to cook sausage and what have you and old cook told me one time, he said, "Son, just don't burn it up."  He said, "Most people don't wait until the pan get hot.  And so you always keep it on low, and if you're frying chicken you turn it up to medium and make sure that your meat is done on the inside."  And so that's that informal knowledge that you get, the mother wit that you get.  And so I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 534481
Speaker 1: You've talked lovingly about your brothers and sisters, would you share with us their name and their birth order in-, include yourself in that order?
Speaker 2: I had a half-brother who is now deceased, Robert George Arrington [ph.], who had a different mother.  Older brother, Joseph Arrington, my older sister, Yvonne Arrington, and two younger sisters, Audrey [Audrey Arrington] and Cynthia [Cynthia Arrington Wright].  So there was five born into the marriage of my late father and mother, George [George Arrington] and Maggie Arrington [Maggie Andrews Arrington], and so there was five of us.  And went to various school.  My brother Joe went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  My sister Yvonne went to Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time.  My sister Audrey when to Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina] for one or two years prior to transferring to Georgia State [Georgia State College; Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] where she got a math degree.  And my youngest sister, Cynthia Wright, Cynthia Arrington Wright graduated from Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], and she won't let you forget that, and she is Spelman lady, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the secret to financing the education for the Arr- for a fairly large Arrington family back in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, my brother Joe was extremely bright and so he got an academic scholarship to Morehouse.  And my sister Yvonne got a band scholarship.  And I received a football scholarship to Clark College.  Audra received an academic scholarship to Bennett.  And Cynthia received a scholarship to Spelman.  But we worked during the summer months and during the school and during the Christmas break.  We worked at the post office, whatever work we could find.  I did lawn service.  My mother would talk to people and--the people that she worked for into letting me do their grass.  So and I threw papers with one of the brightest human being I ever met in my life who did not have a formal education by the name of K.C. Marks.  If anybody had an impact on me and his--his little favorite quote was keep getting up.  And that's what you have to do in life.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: When you get knocked down, you have to keep getting up.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 534482
Speaker 1: What street do you--did you live on, and can you describe your block and basically your neighborhood and your neighbors as a young (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I lived in three different neighborhoods, one or two I don't recall that much 'cause I was so young for the first three years.  I lived in Summerhill [Atlanta, Georgia] and then we moved to Grady Home [Grady Homes, Atlanta, Georgia], one of the first government project, we thought we had died and gone to heaven.  We had our own individual bathroom.  And around six or seven--when I was six or seven, my father [George Arrington] hit the Georgia lottery, which they called the bug back in those days, it was not legal, you know, it was illegal.  And won some money and he paid ten thousand dollars for a house at 883 Mills Street.  And so early on I had, you know, Joe [Joseph Arrington] and I, you know, shared bedrooms and my sisters, you know, they shared bedrooms, but man we were something else.  We had a little room and my parents had their own suite.  We had what we called a TV area and then Joe and my room was on the back side of the TV area.  And Dad had a room built for my three sisters.  Kitchen, bathroom, refrigerator, it was fairly comfortable for me.
Speaker 1: What was the neighborhood like, who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: A good neighborhood.  People went on to college.  Some of the best football players at the time came right in neighborhood, a fella by the name of Johnny Haywood Williams [ph.], one of the great linebackers of all times, man.  We just had good athletes and in that particular neighborhood, nobody picked on us because Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] was in Dixie Hill [Dixie Hills, Atlanta, Georgia].  But, you know, we were student athletes, we all went to school.  We rode the same bus, dated in the neighborhood and we were almost like brothers and sisters.  And they would come to your aid, too, if they thought you were being mistreated.
Story_ID: 534483
Speaker 1: What are some of the other memories you have of growing up in the neighborhood, in school, around Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I know segregation will always be there, but I did not necessarily appreciate all the friction, whether or not you went to David T. Howard High School [Atlanta, Georgia], whether or not you went to Price High School [Luther Judson Price High School, Atlanta, Georgia], Turner [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia], Archer High School [S.H. Archer High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And it built-in competition.  But I don't know if I had appreciation for all the little gang fights that we had and whatever, and some people got hurt during that period of time, unnecessarily over ma- minor issues, you know, back in those particular days.  But athletic speaking, I still say the team that I quarterbacked, the 1959 team, where I was not the greatest quarterback in the world, we went eight, one and two.  And it was probably the best season and it still stands today because we had some great football players.  We had the late Hamilton E. Holmes [Hamilton Holmes] who integrated, along with Charlayne Hunter [HistoryMaker Charlayne Hunter-Gault], two of my high school classmate, the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] had a guard--a guard did not know any fear, a boy by the name of Fred Andrews.  His people owned Andrews Funeral Home [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Fred Andrews lives in Washington, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now he does (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He's my neighbor.  He's my neighbor.
Speaker 2: He and Jean [ph.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, he and Jean.
Speaker 2: And I talk to him all the time.  And so, Fred was just a good football player, but he was a good human being.  He and his wife, Jean.  And they moved down there because he wanted to get out of the city and he wanted some land.  And he's a country boy, he loved fishing and hunting, and--
Speaker 1: He's raising cows and goats now by the way (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Goats, and he likes that, you know.  And I've talked to him periodically.  And had a boy we just buried about two months ago was one of the best running backs to ever play the game and made the varsity in the tenth grade, a guy by the name of Bobby Thorrington [ph.].  Bobby Thorrington was a football player extraordinaire.  So got a chance, you know, to play ball with some pretty good guys.  They had my back and I had their back, and we just kind of grew up together and went on to make things work.
Story_ID: 534484
Speaker 1: What are some of the other sights and sounds and smells that you encounter now that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well it's kind of hard, you still run into incidents and you just kind of rectify.  You know, police officers stop you and they talking rough to you and I always say, "I beg your pardon, I'm a Fulton County Superior Court judge, and I don't understand what you're saying to me," and that's enough to stop it.  You can see 'em backing up, you know.  This morning for an instance, you know, and I were trying to convey to the young officer that I needed to make a left hand turn into the courthouse, and that I had an appointment with you all.  He said, "Get back in that car."  I said, "I'm Judge Arrington [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.] and I was the vice mayor of this city for twenty-eight years and I'm gonna make the left 'cause I have an appointment.  Now you do what you got to do, and I'm gonna do what I got to do."  And he said, "Judge, I apologize," you know.  And you're not leveraging power per se, there just a certain courtesy that should be extended, and it's almost like that Smith Barney [Morgan Stanley Wealth Management] commercial, I've earned it.  And--and I am not abusive, would never be abusive, but you run into that or (laughter)--oh four or five years ago I went to see my broker, and this white female who was about sixty-five, you know, gave me her ticket for me to go get her car.  (Unclear) I said, "I'm waiting on somebody to get my car, maybe we can give 'em the tickets at the same time."  And she kind of backed off.  It was offensive because I had on a shirt and tie, you know.  And at the--at the time I was a member of the Buckhead Club [Atlanta, Georgia], and that's where the luncheon was being held.  But you don't get upset.  You handle it in certain ways.  You know, like (Unclear) say, when he was ambassador living in New York [New York] at the Waldorf [Waldorf Astoria New York], a lady stopped him and asked him to carry her bags for her, thought he was a, a baggage boy.  And that just happens and it used to make me fighting mad and now I found a smart way to ignore them, kind of put people in their place without creating some type of controversy, just move on.  I told one of my colleagues here in a meeting one day, he was snappy and I said, "Well the one thing I like about this job," I said, "one superior court judge does not have to answer to another superior court judge," and I just kept on moving.  And the reason I know it impacted him, within an hour of returning to my office he had written me a hand note apologizing for his conduct.
Story_ID: 534485
Speaker 1: Let's back up just a little to elementary school, sir.  What elementary school did you attend and who were some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to three different elementary schools.  I went to E.R. Carter [E.R. Carter Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], attended English Avenue [English Avenue School, Atlanta, Georgia], and I got my elementary school diploma from A.F. Herndon Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia] on Simpson Road [sic. Temple Street] and went on to Henry McNeal Turner High School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the friends you remember and some of the teachers who impacted you in elementary?  And apparently elementary went through eighth grade back in those days is that right?
Speaker 2: Seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Seventh grade, all right.
Speaker 2: Elementary school, I told you, Lois Wright was--who had--impacted me.  Mrs. Winkfield [Evangeline Winkfield] at Herndon had an impact on me.  I don't remember my teachers from E.R. Carter.  I was in kindergarten and first grade.  At Turner High School, a lady by the name of Mrs. Evans [ph.] who was an English teacher and spoke perfect English, diction and would tell you in a minute that she was a proud graduate of Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama] and she was good.  My high school coach. Georgia Allen [Georgia Williams Allen], who now is an actress and just starred in 'Family Reunion' ['Madea's Family Reunion'] with Tyler Perry.  She played the matriarch of the family.  And she participated in the series, 'On the Heat of the Night' [sic. 'In the Heat of the Night'], and she may be a Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate, and people like that.  The late Marshall Arnold, who was a good man.  And so I had several high school professors.  I'm not sure I took advantage of everything they was offering, but that's part of life, too.
Story_ID: 534486
Speaker 1: You stated you went to Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia], is that the school named after Bishop McNeal Turner?
Speaker 2: Henry McNeal Turner.
Speaker 1: Now his spirit lived for a long time.  Is there anything about the life of Henry McNeal Turner that positively impacted you and other students that attended the school that was named for him?
Speaker 2: One of the thing was, they never taught us the history of Henry McNeal Turner.  I, later on in life, found out about his contribution to University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Graduate, distinguished writer, one of the few ministers, you know, had his pistol, his gun with him on Sunday when he (laughter) preached sermons.  But I don't think we know the outstanding contributions that were made by, you know, Henry McNeal Turner.  And I read that later on in life and also the same thing about Vernon Johns, and those history--histories need to be told.  Vernon Johns did not have a--at Blockbusters a tape called the 'Life of Vernon Johns' [sic. 'The Vernon Johns Story: The Road to Freedom'] and I would recommend it to anybody.
Story_ID: 534487
Speaker 1: You've kind of sold yourself short on the type of student you were, but let's, let's just talk generally--what type of child were you, were you well mannered, were you rambunctious, were you mischievous, did you just enjoy being who you were (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I thought I was a pretty good kid until I got in around the fifth grade [at English Avenue School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And you get with that crowd of people.  Rambunctious, I have always been able to do my work.  It may take me a little longer to complete assignment.  But once it has been completed, it is as good as the next assignment.  And about twelve, fifteen years ago I read a piece in the paper, evidently was a white professor in one of these high schools, and he says speed is not the answer.  He said grasp the subject matter, learn it, if you're able to regurgitate it, then you have succeeded.  So you may have to rewrite a paper five or six times.  I didn't have any problem with that, I wanted it to be right.  And so I kind of worked hard at doing that and went to Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] on an athletic scholarship.  But while I was there for probably a semester or two, I made the honor roll and that made me feel proud and made me feel better about myself and--and gave me the oomph that I could succeed and that carried me on through college and law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 534488
Speaker 1: Do you recall what--whether you had dreams and aspirations as early as high school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I used to watch (laughter) 'Amos 'n' Andy,' and Calhoun [Algonquin J. Calhoun] was a lawyer.  And it's something about that role that impacted me, speaking for others.  And I had a buddy of mine who was a superior court judge out in Sacramento, California, had this distinguished picture on his wall when you walk in his house.  And I said, "Jimmy [ph.], who is that?"  He says, "Man, that's Calhoun."  He said, "I've wrote and got on the Internet, Google, found it." He said, "But that was the only black lawyer I knew anything about."  And then when the Civil Rights Movement came about in the early '60s [1960s] and I was a young student at Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and got a chance to see, from my perspective, the greatest civil rights student sit in demonstrator was a boy by the name of Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.].  It wasn't much better than that.  Danny Mitchell [Daniel B. Mitchell], Ben Brown, [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, Carolyn Long Banks, Annie Ruth Borders, so many others who literally put their life--their lives on the line so that we to--could succeed.  And then I got a chance to see one of the finest lawyers in America's history, Donald L. Hollowell, who had graduated from Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee.  English major, articulate, bright.  And I would cut class--classes to go down and sit in the courtroom just to see Mr. Hollowell take care of his business.  And that's when I knew that I wanted to go to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Amen.  And that was right here in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you were able to do that?
Speaker 2: At AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].  But it all started at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], sitting down at the Woolworth [F. W. Woolworth Company] counter, lunch counter trying to get some food.  And it spread it throughout the South, where our students basically said we're not going to be denied our basic constitutional rights, you know.  And I wanted to go on and do well.  Do it to do good.
Story_ID: 534489
Speaker 1: You finished high school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] in what year, sir?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959], so you were in high school and elementary and high school at the time of the start of the Civil Rights Movement, let's say starting in 1955.  From '55 [1955] to '59 [1959], how were you impacted by Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and by the Civil Rights Movement, sir?
Speaker 2: Well I think I was impacted in 1959 when we started the Civil Rights Movement.  Because Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] laid on the table for seven, eight years.  It was on the books, but we didn't know how to--to implement it.  And when people started saying we're going to Northside High School [North Atlanta High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and made application and went to Northside High School.  The late Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter [HistoryMaker Charlayne Hunter-Gault] said we're going to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].  Then Ham had been a B student at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and when he transferred to Georgia, in four quarters, he was Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] and Charlayne Hunter.  I really had some bright students in my class, I guess superlatives, you know, who was bright, smart and who could compete.
Story_ID: 534490
Speaker 1: Now throughout that time, were, were you on campus, by the way, when you're at Clark Atlanta [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: During football season we would always violate the rules.  You weren't supposed to be on campus.  The people knew you were on campus and let you sleep in some of the vacant rooms.  But by and large I was a city student, and I went home every night.
Speaker 1: And so you had to deal with the social life of the city?  Was you prob- an expert at it by then, you've lived here all your life, but in terms of segregation and terms of the Civil Rights Movement you interacted with that on a daily basis in your going and coming (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, but you're gonna have to survive.  I talked about the greatest civil rights leaders of all time was Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.].  One of the brightest guys I met in my young career was a guy by the name of Danny Mitchell [Daniel B. Mitchell] from Walterboro, South Carolina.  Danny Mitchell was articulate, great writing skills.  And so I think about that experience and thank God I got a chance to meet Danny Mitchell and--and others.  Who in the world knew that [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman was going to go ahead and head up the children fund [Children's Defense Fund], you know, and make the contribution that she have made of caring for our young, you know.
Story_ID: 534491
Speaker 1: Let me just ask you, up through the end of high school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia], what--was your family active in the church and what impact did the church have on your life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We've always been active in the church, not necessarily my father [George Arrington], but my momma [Maggie Andrews Arrington].  And I attended Sunday school at Lindsay Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], and after I got out of law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], I went back to teach.  And I was in the choir, I don't know if the minister and the people in the choir was appreciative of my contributions.  And when I resigned, they gave a going away party for me (laughter).  They voted not to let me sing a solo.  But that's where you did your plays.  That's where you made your Easter speeches.  That's how you learn how to be good neighbors, in church.  And I have a great deal of respect for the black church.  I like to hear Bob Franklin [HistoryMaker Robert Franklin], a distinguished scholar at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] talk about the role of the black church, and I wish they were more involved today.  But I can't figure out how we deal with the social problems we have today.  And I'm not sure they have a magic wand, that could put it all in proper context, yeah.
Story_ID: 534492
Speaker 1: Let's go back and look at one other factor, which clearly was a theme in your life, and that's athletics.  During your upbringing, some of the real heroes of African American people who carried themselves with dignity, as well as performed well on the field were people like Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson, and Sugar Ray Robinson.  How did those people impact your life in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well really I did not know them per se.  Jackie was before my time and I just got a chance to see him play baseball.  I will never, never forget when Jackie Robinson stole home plate in the World Series.  It was just unbelievable.  And (unclear)--I mean Yogi Berra protested loudly, and I basically thought Yogi Berra was right, I thought he was out.  But in order for it to be so close, and I think the ref probably gave Jackie the benefit of the doubt.  But got a chance to watch Jim Gilliam, who was also bright.  Don Newcombe and Joe Black, you know, and others.  Even--I had a great deal of respect for Pee Wee Reese, because when players on another team would try to beat up on Jackie and spike him, Pee Wee would always come to his aid, he said, "Fight me."  Because Branch Rickey had told Jackie Robinson, "You cannot fight, you cannot hit back."  And that was--must've been hard to him, but I also think it made him bitter on the inside.  And you saw some of the hostility later on in life, you know, like to see the tape of [HistoryMaker] Oscar Robertson when they hon- honored him at the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio], where he started crying about how he had been treated at the University of Cincinnati.  People putting black cats into his locker and the name that he was called, and was just treated different.  He never did go as far as I thought he should've gone in terms of vice president of operation, everything, because he took on--represented the players.  And he took some hard stances, and I think he probably suffered from that.  So I've rea- read about these people, Jackie Robinson, you know, book, who bases and I'm trying to think of the top of it.  I never had a chance or some other quote that was appropriate.
Speaker 1: 'Never Had It Made.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'I Never Had It Made' ['I Never Had It Made: An Autobiography,' Jackie Robinson and Alfred Duckett].  And you know, they sent him basically to Fort Hood [Texas] to either get killed or to be court-martialed.  And they did in fact file court-martial papers against him.  And he had a good lawyer and they defended him or what have you.  But, you know, I've just have seen that, you know, even I got a chance to see a fellow that just passed, a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate, won the MVP when he played with the New York Mets, Donn Clendenon.  And Donn was an exceptional football player at Morehouse, and didn't even make the varsity when he was at Booker T. Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia], but went on to Morehouse to excel and probably stayed in the major anywhere from ten to twelve years and just recently expired.
Story_ID: 534493
Speaker 1: You mentioned [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton Holmes earlier, did you know them personally?
Speaker 2: They were my classmates, class of '59 [1959] at Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Ham was my running back and Charlayne was the high school queen.  And of course I knew them and others in that class.  People like Josh Dax- Jackson [Josh Jackson (ph.)] who now lives in Virginia somewhere, Charles Johnson [ph.] who went on to become a dentist.  Others who became--went on to become teachers and--and everything else.
Story_ID: 534494
Speaker 1: Judge Arrington [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.], as we continue, let's talk a little bit about the '60s [1960s] that were so much a part of, of our lives.  And were you at Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington D.C.] during the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: No, I was still at Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I graduated, what year was that--?
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--got out of Clark the first semester of 1964.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But I did not participate in the March on Washington.  Several of my classmates--but because I missed it, when they had the first anniversary I did go back and will always remember it because Bill Cosby was standing there with my son, they was talking and I was able to get a photograph.  And I have that photograph now with Marvin, Jr. [Marvin Arrington, Jr.] and, and Bill Cosby (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bill Cosby.
Story_ID: 534495
Speaker 1: You spent a year in Washington [D.C.] at Howard University--
Speaker 2: At Howard University law school [Howard University School of Law].
Speaker 1: Yes sir.  Tell us a story about your making the transition from Howard University Law School to Emory University [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia], please?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it was accidental.  I'd gone out to Emory to get ready to go back to Howard law school for my second year.  And was standing in the lobby of the law school and the dean at that particular time was Ben Johnson, Jr. and he came out and asked me my name and I told him.  And he asked me, who was I and I told him I was a law student at Howard University and I was--just I'd been reading and trying to get ready for my second year.  And he said, "Well let me talk to you."  He invited me into his office and said would I be interested in going to Emory University law school.  And I said, "Well I'd never thought about that.  Did not know the opportunity would be offered to me.  Well let me think about it."  And I thought about it and he asked me how was my grades.  I said, "Well I got about a seventy-six average, and I feel good about it, you know."  And so I took advantage of the opportunity.  I returned home from Emory University campus to my house and called Clarence Cooper, who is now a United States district court judge in the Northern District of Georgia.  And Clarence says to me, "Man, these white folks ain't gonna let us in their school."  And I said to him, "We'll never know until we try."  And so we made formal application.  And that was the beginning of Marvin Arrington's [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.] experiences at Emory University, and it was fabulous.  I hold Emory in the--in high esteem and--but for Emory University and its contribution to my life I don't think I'd be where I am today and certainly would not be on the board of trustees.
Speaker 1: At Emory University?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And to fast forward a little, other members of your family have gone to Emory law school since your graduation, is that right?
Speaker 2: Well my son, Marvin, Jr. [Marvin Arrington, Jr.], my nephew, Joseph Arrington, II, and my niece, Jill Arrington.  So there are four of us who hold law degrees from Emory University and I'm very, very pleased with that.  Nothing was more rewarding to see my son accepted and go to Emory law school and complete that core study at that outstanding law school.
Story_ID: 534496
Speaker 1: Let's return to your days there, and do you have any comparisons between life at predominantly white Emory University [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] and predominantly African American Howard University School of Law [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well it's not a great comparison.  Literally everybody at Howard was Afro American.  We probably had five or six white students in that class.  But it was different, a little isolated.  Emory was cold in the first instance and study and, and in terms of interacting with other students.  But you had some guys who helped me make my stay there, guys like Dana Shapiro [ph.], Henry Bowers, Jr. [ph.], Marty Fearman [ph.] and other, just walked up to me and asked me to go out to lunch.  And so there may be a few bad moments, but you know, if you got scale of justice and if you, you know, on the scale of one to ten, it was about an eight or a nine.  So it was not a bad experience, and I would do it again.
Speaker 1: And did your friend, Judge Cooper [Clarence Cooper], transfer with you and remain with you throughout that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you all were the first two African American graduates (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that's not true.  People say that we were the first two day-time students, Afro Americans.  The first Afro American to go to Emory and graduate was a guy by the name of Ted Smith, who had gone to South Carolina State, South Carolina State's law school [South Carolina State University School of Law, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And he transferred over to Emory in the evening division.  So people did not get a chance to see Ted, but Ted was the first Afro American student at Emory University.
Story_ID: 534497
Speaker 1: Let's just look at your overall college experience--college and law school experience during the '60s [1960s], a time of turbulence in America politically in terms of the war [Vietnam War], in terms of music.  How did the music of the times, Motown and other genres impact you during that time sir?
Speaker 2: Oh man it had an impact.  I mean, you know, we used to have canteens.  High school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] would have, you know, dancing contests.  You know, I came out of the same neighborhood with Gladys Knight and knew all the Pips.  We were in--we're students at E.R. Carter [E.R. Carter Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Gladys and her brother Bubba [HistoryMaker Merald "Bubba" Knight, Jr.] lived about two blocks from a grocery store that my father [George Arrington] owned at 559 English Avenue.  And so I can remember today when she won the Ted Mack amateur hour, eight, nine years of age, but she could always sing.  And she recently had the chance to sing at a funeral of one of my boyhood friends that passed, George Smith [ph.].  And when she got through singing man, the church was turned (unclear).  But just a great lady, great human being and been a great political supporter.  And of course we had Hamilton Bohannon who was Motown at the time and was a year behind me at Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And you know, I had Erma Franklin, who was one of my classmates at Clark and that's Aretha's [Aretha Franklin] youngest sister.  Her brother [Cecil L. Franklin] had gone over to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] for a semester.  You know, but, you know, I'm a product of Atlanta [Georgia] and we had Royal Peacock [Atlanta, Georgia], and we got a chance to see, you know, the Temps--The Temptation [The Temptations], Roy Hamilton, James Brown, Carla Thomas signing her hit, 'Gee Whiz.'  The Temptation, 'I Got Sunshine.'  You know, Aretha Franklin '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Born Woman' [sic. '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman'].  And so it was a part of my spirit, there was music in my bones.  And when things were not going well at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], I had a guy that lived in the same house with me downstairs named Kenneth Days, man, we were throwing some Temptations and we danced the night away.  So it was a great, great experience.
Story_ID: 534498
Speaker 1: All of these artists you mentioned, there were clubs on Auburn Avenue, or other places around Atlanta [Georgia] that they would come and--and you would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was the, the--basically, you know, it was the Peacock [Royal Peacock, Atlanta, Georgia] and the Ponciano [ph.], were there for a little while, but not big places, but people just kind of hung out on Auburn Avenue.  That's where the action was.  All the black doctors, all the black dentists, Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 1: So not just an entertainment vicinity, but business and doctors and lawyers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the business enterprise, and I say to you that integration was good and bad.  Good from the perspective we got a chance to drink out of water fountains and not have to sit in--in a--in the back of the bus and, you know, and watched the case went before the United States of America, United States of America versus the Heart of Atlanta [Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 1964], which they said hotels had to open up its doors because of interstate commerce.  And so that's what we did and that's how we responded to it.  That's how we lived with it, but Auburn Avenue had doctors galore, had the drugstore chain Yates and Milton [Yates and Milton Pharmacy, Atlanta, Georgia], and they were pharmacists.  You know, we had the Royal Theater [Atlanta, Georgia], we had the Beaman's [B.B. Beaman] restaurant, you know.  We had the Butler Street Y [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia].  You know, funeral homes.  We had the most prestigious religious institutions in America.  You had Big Bethel [Big Bethel A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia].  We had First Congregation [First Congregational Church, Atlanta, Georgia], you had Wheat Street [Wheat Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], you had Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].  They were the giants in the community.   And you gained from hearing William Holmes Bardy--Borders [William Holmes Borders] and I can hear that thundering in his voice right now.  And I quote, 'I Am - Somebody.'  The guy would say, "I am James Weldon Johnson," and he would call off all the black leaders to let you know that he was standing there on their shoulders.  And those type of teachings and lessons have impacted me tremendously over the years.
Story_ID: 534499
Speaker 1: Now the Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] that you mentioned, is this the same Ebenezer, home church of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, no question about it, you know.  And I think Daddy King, dad was a minister.  It's a family of ministers.  Even the youngest--his youngest daughter, Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King], is now a minister.  But it's the same family and they have had an impact on this town forever.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to know the King family, specifically Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Met Dr. King once or twice, saw him speak in Mount Moriah [Mount Moriah Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] one night.  And when he quieted the audience and, we were criticizing other student right leaders who had gone down and cut a deal with the establishment, which we didn't like.  And we were going back and forth.  And he just stood up in that voice of his he said, you know, we all can sing together, but we can't all talk at the same time.  And he told us that he thought we were being unfair to the student leaders who had cut the deal.  He said, well they went down and came back with something, you know.  Say you gave 'em ten issues and they got five or six resolved, and time will help us heal and we will go on to, you know, get these other rights.
Speaker 1: Who were these leaders, student leaders or leaders in the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Student leaders, man.  Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.], who is like a bull in a china shop.  Danny Mitchell [Daniel B. Mitchell], Ben Brown, Carolyn Long Banks, Annie Ruth Borders, many, many, many more, [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman.  You know, just many, many, Anne Ashmore [HistoryMaker Anne Ashmore-Hudson].  Just student leaders who have said we have had enough and this is it.
Speaker 1: And on, on your authority, they represented you to the establishment and, and, and negotiated for additional rights and privileges for the black community?
Speaker 2: They were the leaders.
Speaker 1: Not appointed, but they rose up out of the community?
Speaker 2: They rose up, but you know, athletes, particularly at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] were limited in what they could do because coach (Unclear) said well, you got a group of students out there doing that, I need you all to concentrate on your books and your--and the program.  I thought probably he should've been a little bit more sensitive, but I didn't question him because he was an extraordinary leader, somebody I believed in.  And I just didn't see football players going down there taking the beating that they were wishing out.  And surely would've led to civil disobedience in some kind of way.  I just could not visualize someone spitting in my face again and not reacting to it in some kind of way.

Speaker 1: Who were the adult leaders in the community that you, as a citizen of Atlanta [Georgia] and you and others as Clark Atlanta [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] students looked to and respected and--?
Speaker 2: It's kind of hard, but you had Sam Williams [Samuel Woodrow Williams] at Friendship Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] and Borders [William Holmes Borders] at Wheat Street [Wheat Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].  Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] over at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and Bishop Bearden [Harold Irvin Bearden], you know, at Big Bethel [Big Bethel A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: That's your home church isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, now it is.  And you had probably the brightest, the most arrogant, the most articulate of all time was Warren Cochran who was the executive director of the Butler Street YMCA [Atlanta, Georgia].  And he left Atlanta, stayed away for twenty years and when he returned times had changed.  And I don't think we afforded him the proper reception when he returned to Atlanta, because when they said the Atlanta police officers, they were hiring black Atlanta police officers and they didn't have nowhere to dress and everything, he said bring 'em to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] and they can dress and change here.  You could not arrest a white citizen, you had to hold 'em until the white police officer came to put him up under arrest.
Story_ID: 534501
Speaker 1: I wanna return to the Butler Street Y [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] in just a second, but let's talk about Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia].  A vibrant community, a business community, a community of professionals.  At what point in time did it start its decline, and what was the cause of it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I guess one of my criticism on the black leadership include me as one of the leaders.  We just never figured out how to get it done, and I am not sure that we reached out to the white community, white leaders.  We negotiated for jobs and public accommodations and really didn't understand the impact of economic development.  There's no way in the world that Auburn Avenue should have declined to where it is now.  Now you see some movement now.  But if we had taken that infrastructure, infusion of cash, I think it would've sent a different message.  It is constructive criticism because I think we knew wh-, what we knew, we did it well.  But economic development was not one of our fortes during that particular time.  And maybe, you know, the leaders with that type of background should've come together and carved out a training program for young black leaders at that particular time.
Story_ID: 534502
Speaker 1: Many institutions did survive on Auburn Avenue, primarily the churches and I think a funeral home and maybe the Elks lodge.  But one that stands out is the Butler Street Y [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia].  Why did it continue to grow and prosper and make an impact in the black community?
Speaker 2: Well the Elks lodge (laughter) have not survived, it's closed--
Speaker 1: Oh is it.
Speaker 2: --been closed now five or ten years.  Because of Warren Cochran, John Cox and a guy by the name of Gene Thomas [Eugene Thomas], nobody ever mentioned his name.  He was an orphanage [sic. orphan] that Mr. Cochran took into the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and provided him with a bed and sent him to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  When he went down to Tuskegee he didn't have no room.  He stayed in the boiler room.  But he got his degree.  And Gene has come back and for the last sixty years have given his life to the Butler Street YMCA.  We had a guy by the name of Mr. Winston [ph.] who died of Alzheimer who spent his entire life, never married, was as straight as an arrow, and it was because of him and the programs that he implemented and was a Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate.
Story_ID: 534503
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s], in addition to the music, the vibrancy of Auburn Avenue, the leadership being developed among youth in Atlanta [Georgia], the advice of the elders, there were some tragedies.  The death of President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], where were you and what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was--I was on a football field, practice field at Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] getting ready for the Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] game.
Speaker 1: And how did that impact you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was profound.  I mean from my perspective he had been a warrior, you know, and pushing program that he never got through [U.S.] Congress.  But after his death, [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson was able to get the Voting Right (laughter) Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] passed, and I'll never forget, he was the commencement speaker in '64 [1964] at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] where his theme was, we shall overcome.  I mean I was glued to my chair.  To hear a white southerner from Texas embrace the principles that we were trying to implement and make applicable to all citizens.
Story_ID: 534504
Speaker 1: Malcolm X in 1965?
Speaker 2: Malcolm X was profound and back in that day--those days, we would bring student leaders--I mean we would bring speakers to the campus.  A distinguished minister out of--out of Harlem [New York, New York], Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], Malcolm X and other leaders.  The great debate of all time was a debate between Malcolm X and C. Eric Lincoln.  Lincoln had wrote a book about 'The Black Muslims in America' [C. Eric Lincoln].  And probably Malcolm X was not the opponent that he should've elected to debate with.  Because Malcolm X chewed him up and spit him out in a way you wouldn't believe.  It was done on a professional level.  But I got a chance to see those great debates.  I got a chance to see Adam Clayton Powell stand in Davage Auditorium at Clark Col- at Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] when the black teacher union merged with the white teacher union, he told 'em it was a mistake.  He said you will lose all of your independence and you won't hold any leadership positions.  Well that was true for five or ten years and now they have succeeded, but he was telling us, you're giving up something.  But my response now was there are compromises in life.  And you don't win in every instance.  You're either Willie Nelson or Kenny Rogers say, you know, you got to know when to hold it and you got to when to fold it.
Story_ID: 534505
Speaker 1: Medgar Evers, so many others, but especially Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in 1968, where were you, how did it impact you?  What did you--how did you react?
Speaker 2: Oh, his death we were second or third year law students at Emory [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia].  And Clarence Cooper dropped by and said, "Have you heard?  You see, they've killed Dr. King."  And I sit there on that step and cried.  I could feel the hurt, I could feel the pain, and he was taken at such a young age, I wanna say thirty-seven or thirty-eight.
Speaker 1: Thirty-nine.
Speaker 2: And you know, but Jesus Christ died at what age, thirty-three.  Malcolm [Malcolm X] died at a very young age, you know.  William Monroe Trotter was found, you know, hanging in a hotel room in Massachusetts.  I'm not sure it was Boston [Massachusetts].  But, he was bright.  We never got a chance to see him live his fullness.  Medgar Evers was a young man.  And we just saw, you know, people, but you know, you had Fannie Lou Hamers [sic. Fannie Lou Hamer] who said, this little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.  She and so many others committed themselves to the movement.  And for that, I feel to be indebted, and generations unborn ought to read about it and they too be indebted to the next generation.
Story_ID: 534506
Speaker 1: And those leaders enabled many political victories for those--for African Americans.  The Civil Rights Act of '64 [1964], the Voting Racks--Act of '65 [1965].  Would you comment on the Voting Rights Act of '65 [1965] and it's--the provisions that called for cyclical renewal for certain jurisdictions and what we face in such a time as this and ensuring that it continues to serve its purpose (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I don't know if I have the answer to whether or not it was continued, that's in the hand of [U.S.] Congress, but it was one of the single most important piece legislation that passed.  Anytime you can give, you know, people the right to vote I think is impact.  And recently I attended a--a function and there was a black (unclear) judge from DeKalb County [Georgia] who was sitting at the table with seventeen, eighteen black judges who took the position that black people who were ignorant and can't provide a driving license photo was not to vote.  And I thought we were gonna have to call 911 to get him out of there.  He wasn't sensitive at all and he diminished in my eyesight, and that's not the type of person I want to be around nor do I want my children to be around.  Have no appreciation for history.
Story_ID: 534507
Speaker 1: You finished law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] in nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: Seven [1967].
Speaker 1: --seven [1967].  Passed the bar exam and what did you--what was your first employment?
Speaker 2: I went to work with a law firm known as Kleiner and Herman [Kleiner, Herman, Deville and Simmons].  Kleiner, K-L-I-E-N-E-R [sic.], and Herman, and Jack Kleiner is still living and at one time was teaching over at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  Bob Herman [Robert Herman], unfortunately, took his life in the last three to five years, but he was at University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] graduate, Chapel Hill undergraduate.  But I learned from them, you know.  They reached out and accepted me when other white law firms would not hire Afro American.  But I'm not a fool.  They knew I was a hot commodity and well known in the black community.  And they understood that I could generate some revenue.  And people (laughter) generate--interest--generate interest when you can provide some type of economic in-, incentive.
Story_ID: 534508
Speaker 1: Judge Arrington [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.], before we talk about your experience in South Carolina and before we talk about your running for elective office, let's re-visit Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington D.C.] and some of those legal giants that you were exposed to that--that--that influenced you during that time?
Speaker 2: Well Howard was a rich experience for me.  I was debating if I wanted to go to law school.  I knew I wanted to go, but whether or not I was going to have the resources.  And Judge Cooper [Clarence Cooper] and I applied to and was accepted at North Carolina College Law School [North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina].  The school has not changed in North Carolina Central, and they had a dean there that had an outstanding reputation by the name of Dr. Albert Turner [Albert L. Turner].  And I heard Maynard Jackson and others talk about Albert Turner.
Speaker 1: Is that Maynard Jackson's law school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And we applied and we were accepted, and I don't think the money was all that much.  But then my brother [Joseph Arrington], who was at Howard University in dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] at the time said to me that if I was going to an Afro American law school I probably should try to go to the best and he considered Howard because of the facilities and the professional schools.  And, you know, I had read about Alain Locke and the dean of the college, and Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] at the time was the dean of the theology school [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.].  They had had Charles Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] and others to be the dean of the law school.  They had Mordecai Johnson, Ralph Bunche had taught there, and so many other, you know.  The law school had deans like Spottswood Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III], James Nabrit [James Nabrit, Jr.], Thurgood Marshall had graduated number one in his class from there.  Another guy by the name of Bob Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter], who is now a retired judge on--in the Southern District of New York.  I ran into a dean by the name of C. Clyde Ferguson [C. Clyde Ferguson, Jr.] or the late C. Clyde Ferguson who had graduated from Ohio State University [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society], and went on to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and taught there for years, and he came over to assume the leadership at Howard University.  And you had people like him and so many others.  You had Pat Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris] who was a law professor went on to become ambassador to Luxembourg.  You had Herb Reese [ph.], who was great.  Oliver Morse.
Story_ID: 534509
Speaker 1: And when I asked Ben Brown, the late Ben Brown who is now deceased and who had been one of the student leaders who got out of Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1961 whether or not he thought that I could go to Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and be successful.  And he said, "Don't you ever, ever question yourself.  You're as bright as anybody.  And if you get to Howard, you will graduate."  And that encouragement did more for me than anything else.  And what hurts me today, there's not a plaque or a statue of Ben Brown nowhere in this town and that hurts more than anything else in the world.  People always tell me about getting the winning lottery ticket, I will put up a black museum almost equivalent to the one in Detroit [Michigan] and let young people know about our history so they can come in and watch these tapes.  You know, and build it into their curriculum and provide scholarships.  They would come in and become a true student of black history.
Story_ID: 534510
Speaker 1: Did Charles Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] have an impact on you, sir?
Speaker 2: Quite frankly, I didn't know about Charles Houston until after I had graduated from law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] and started reading my NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] magazine, Crisis.  And saw him on tapes.  Then I started hearing about Charles Houston who had gone to a school in Massachusetts, the name, Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] where he had done extremely well and he went on to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where he may have been one of the chief-in-editors [sic. editor-in-chiefs].  Harvard has more than one chief-in-editor.  But he was the architect for desegregating schools.  And his students and mentees, George Hayes [George E.C. Hayes] and Oliver Hill [HistoryMaker Oliver W. Hill] out of Richmond, Virginia, Don Hollowell [Donald L. Hollowell], and C.B. King down in Albany [Georgia] and R. Jess Brown over in Mississippi and others.  And most of them went to Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], some went to other schools.  But he planted the seeds that we need to go to these courtrooms and use the law to make things better.  And that is the richness, you know, and people like, you know, him, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now Charles Hamilton, he was the mentor for Thurgood Marshall, is that right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  You know, you may have seen the picture ["Simple Justice," 'American Experience'] about Thurgood Marshall.  It was a--produced for TV.  And I was always presently surprised that the producer was a boy by the name of [HistoryMaker] Avon Kirkland who had graduated from Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in '60 [1960] or '61 [sic. 1958].  And there was a scene where Thurgood Marshall said to his wife, or the lady who played that roll, and I quote, "I'm gonna kick that white boy's butt."  He said, you know, "Charlie Houston told me there would be days like this."  And he was so let down when he thought he had not put forth a pervasive argument on the issue that was raised in the brief.  But they were good enough to come back and counter what had been said and he litigated against the white supremacist lawyer of all times and who was good.  But always appreciated at the end of the court hearings he went over to shake Thurgood Marshall's hand in a way to say congratulation.  So Charles Houston and others, man, they were out there doing it long before.
Speaker 1: Giants.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Giants.
Story_ID: 534511
Speaker 1: Sir, let's talk about the beginning of your legal career.  After graduation, on to South Carolina, talk to us just for a moment about your experience fighting the War on Poverty in South Carolina?  Then your running for a seat on the Board of Aldermen [Atlanta City Council], which began a twenty-eight-year plus career as an elected official in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: You know, I went to OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] because I was not successful in passing the bar early on.  Needed employment and they were paying a whopping salary of twelve thousand dollars.  And--I went and heard about the vacancies and several other people who had been in AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] with me.  I was working over there and so I applied for the job.  And I ended up working for a guy by the name Chuck Boar [ph.], who had come out of the Peace Corps and I thought was a minister, may have been a United St-, United Methodist minister.  And I was assigned to South Carolina and I got a chance to go to Columbia, South Carolina, Black Bottom and work.  I got a chance to go to Walterboro [South Carolina] and work.  And I was monitoring poverty programs.  I was approving budgets, helping with work programs.  Meeting people and help making the social change and got a chance to interact, work with local governments.  And I've talked about rich experiences, but working in the poverty program had to be one of 'em.  It was just profound.
Story_ID: 534512
Speaker 1: I did that, then I passed the bar exam and went on to go to work for Kleiner and Herman [Kleiner, Herman, Deville and Simmons].  And at the particular point in time I just kind of wanted to be in charge of my career and I started a law firm [Arrington and Rubin] with a young Jewish guy by the name of S. Richard Rubin, who was as close to me as anybody in the world, including my brother [Joseph Arrington].  And he and I had a relationship that was unique, and I'm glad I had a chance to meet him in my lifetime.  And we remain friends to this particular day.  His two children have gone on to graduate from law school, practicing law.  My two [Marvin Arrington, Jr. and Michelle Arrington] have gone on to law school, graduated and now practicing law.  So our two lives have paralleled each other.
Story_ID: 534513
Speaker 1: You were inspired early on to run for public office, tell us about that experience?
Speaker 2: Well I was working as a law clerk when I was at Emory law school [Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia] for the first black senator in the United States since Reconstruction and--State of Georgia that is, Leroy Johnson [Leroy R. Johnson], who had gone to North Carolina College Law School [North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina].  And he was both a politician and a lawmaker and a lawyer.  And just learned from him that you can take the power of the law, massage it in a way, understand the issues and make it work for you.  And the thing that he understood, and it was taught to me at Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], the most valuable tool in the Constitution of the United States [U.S. Constitution] from a black perspective was the Fourteenth Amendment, the due process clause.  And how you could use it, fashion the facts and make it work for you.
Story_ID: 534514
Speaker 1: So you ran for the Board of Aldermen [Atlanta City Council], and you were successful.
Speaker 2: I ran for the old Board of Aldermen in 1969 against an incumbent by the name of Bill Knight [William T. Knight], who had offended me when he heard that I was running.  Called me in and offered me two hundred dollars, said, "You don't need to run, here's two hundred dollars."  And I thanked him, but said, "No, I don't think I wanna do that."  And I made a decision at that particular time that I was gonna run for office.  And later at the insistence of Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.], he said, "Man, you could win that race."  He said, "That race, that ward is predominately black," and that was the beginning of when Marvin Arrington [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.] ran, got elected at age twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: Age twenty-seven, was that the youngest--
Speaker 2: At the time it was I think.  Later on Arthur Langford [Arthur Langford, Jr.] came in and succeeded me at age twenty-six.  But ran for the election, got elected and worked under Leroy [Leroy R. Johnson] for a while, like I said until I got my own practice [Arrington and Rubin] going.  And then I went on to establish, you know, my law practice.  And at one time it was rated by Black Enterprise as one of ten black, best black law firms in America.
Speaker 1: At the time you were elected, the Democrats are no longer in office, Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] is now president of the United States--
Speaker 2: No, I came under John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson prior to that.
Speaker 1: What year was your election, sir?
Speaker 2: My election was in 1969, in September.  And then I went on to get sworn in on January the 5th of 1970.  So I lived under the Kennedy administration, Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] was the United States attorney general at the time.  Then of course because of Kennedy's assassination, Johnson succeeded him and went on to live in this country under his administration.  And then Nixon and others unfolded.
Story_ID: 534515
Speaker 1: Was it before your election [to the Board of Aldermen, Atlanta City Council] or after your election that you sued the Georgia bar [State Bar of Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I sued them in 1970 along with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union].
Speaker 1: And for what purpose was that?
Speaker 2: All the blacks who had applied and some was gradate from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], the best law schools in the country.  And all the black applicants were--did not pass the bar exam.  I upset about it, I was appalled.  I just did not believe that could happen.  And we sued 'em and--under the Title VII, you know, the voters right act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] it did apply.  But the next time the bar exam was given, the numbers increased substantially.  And it was the right thing to do because as the late Vernon Johns always said, if you see a good fight, get in it.  And it was a good fight for the right thing, yeah.
Story_ID: 534516
Speaker 1: You continued to show your courage in the first legislation you proposed once you were elected [to the Board of Aldermen, Atlanta City Council], what was that about?
Speaker 2: Proposed what?
Speaker 1: I believe it had something to do with water fountains?
Speaker 2: Well no, when I went to City Hall [Atlanta City Hall, Atlanta, Georgia] back in '70 [1970], we still had separate water fountains, you know, white and black and what have you.  And I was on the water committee.  And I just demanded and went to Sam Massell, and he graciously agreed that it ought to be changed.  And also I found out later on about a man by the name of Mr. Chenault [ph.] who (unclear), who said that the dressing room facilities at the Atlanta Water Work [Atlanta Water Works, Atlanta, Georgia] facilities were also segregated, and I demanded and got legislation passed for it, too.  The lockers would be re-assigned alphabetically.  And I always felt good about that.  You never know if people appreciate what you're doing.  About two years ago I was at a Unity Restaurant on M.L. King Drive [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] and a black former city employee walked up to me, he said, "Man, I will never forget you, and one of the reason I voted for you for mayor."  He said, "I'll never forget that you had those lockers changed at the Atlanta Water Work."  And he said, "Nobody else had the courage to do it, and to stand toe-to-toe," with a guy by the name of Paul Weir, W-E-I-R.  And he was a fine gentleman, but he was product of his time.  He said, "We're not gonna do it."  I said, "Oh, you're gonna do it."  And at the time I asked Maynard Jackson to join me at the committee meeting, and he added his voice and was outraged at a city and that you have segregated facilities.  So that came about and it was a good thing and I'm kind of pleased with that.
Story_ID: 534517
Speaker 1: What other African Americans were on the City Council [Atlanta City Council] at that time, the whole Board of Aldermen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh the whole Board of Aldermen was Joel Stokes, Ira Jackson, the dean of the council, Q.V. Williamson, H.D. Dodson and myself.
Speaker 1: And what was the total composition?
Speaker 2: There was five of us.
Speaker 1: And out of how many?
Speaker 2: Out of eighteen.
Story_ID: 534518
Speaker 1: What are some of the other inroads in terms of legislation or progress that you and the others were able to make during the time you all served together [on the Board of Aldermen, Atlanta City Council]?
Speaker 2: When I first went there, they didn't have--minutes were not being recorded.  And sometime people have selective amnesia about what they had voted on and it was my legislation that passed that through.  And now, you know, minutes are recorded, televised now.  So people can just go back and find out what you said.  I think my being one of the co-sponsors of the legislation they're putting Muhammad Ali back into the boxing ring.
Speaker 1: Tell us more about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just that Leroy Johnson [Leroy R. Johnson] had been retained to try to find a venue that would permit him to box after he had gone through the whole [U.S.] Supreme Court thing.  And being a Muslim minister, and they ruled in his favor and they researched the law.  And Leroy was bright enough and canny enough to line up ten votes.  And so I introduced it and along with the late George Katsakis [ph.] I was able to introduce and it passed.  And at that time, fortunate, the municipal committee, which had jurisdiction over boxing did not have to report out to the full council.  I do not know who crafted that language, it had been there and the mayor's that used it in the past to punish aldermen who had not gone along with the program, so I was over there, proud to be over there.  And we passed it.  He returned to the ring against Jerry--
Speaker 1: Quarry [Jerry Quarry].
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Quarry.
Speaker 2: Quarry and beat him like he stole a government mule.  And that was the reinvention of Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 1: So after being absent from the ring for four years as a result of him declining to submit himself to the--to the draft, you were instrumental in providing a forum, ensuring that a forum was provided for him.  And that took place right here in Georgia.  Right here in Atlanta [Georgia], (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: In Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: But he was in superb condition.  I don't think Ali ever smoked, ever had a drink of liquor.  He was not involved in all that negative stuff like drugs and the body was in great shape--
Story_ID: 534519
Speaker 1: You and four other African Americans served together for a period of time, but in 1973, Maynard Jackson was elected the first black mayor of Atlanta [Georgia].  What impact did that have on, on government in Atlanta (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I had pride, man.  I didn't know that an Afro American could be mayor.  But that's not true, because Carl Stokes had gotten himself elected in Cleveland [Ohio].  But it was a rarity.  And he was articulate, he was bright, and he had a plan.  And so the whole city, both black and whites, probably more blacks were just proud that we had stood the test of time and we had the courage to elect a black mayor.  You know, it let me know then that we could be congressmen, we could be United States senators.  We could be CEOs of major corporations.  That we could do anything.  And Atlanta was the mecca because of the five colleges or the six colleges.  You had Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], you had ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And they were producing more black graduates in the Atlanta area more than any other institution, including Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], because there was five institutions that were producing black graduates and they were competing, they were going to law school all over the coa-, country, Boston University [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They were going to dental school and they were returning to their communities to make a difference.

Speaker 1: So how was Marvin Arrington [HistoryMaker Marvin S. Arrington, Sr.] able to, in a greater manner, influence change as a result of there now being a black mayor [Maynard Jackson] and the city [Atlanta, Georgia] where he's on the city council [Board of Aldermen, Atlanta City Council]?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) things on the book about, still had slave statues.  And I took it upon myself with the city attorney to rewrite the municipal code and have distinguishing words removed from the charter.  So we could feel good about what we were doing and by that time I knew that if you had legislation, if you violate it, we always going to court and bring it somebody's attention.  We had a judge over in U.S. district court who just recently passed.  He had gone--he was from Hawaii and going to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], his name evades me now--that made some profound decision as it relates to Afro American.  And to him I'll forever be grateful.  I'm having a senior moment now, but his name ought to be with me everywhere I go, yeah.
Speaker 1: Atlanta has now changed.  We have a black mayor, we have several city council members.  In a few years, we'll have a presen- a black president of the city council and a black mayor.
Speaker 2: We have that now.  Lisa Borders.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's a continuation, but it happened first with Marvin Arrington and Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 2: It happened with Maynard Jackson in the first instance and after he completed his term, [HistoryMaker] Carl Ware became president of the city council.  Former executive with The Coca-Cola Company [Atlanta, Georgia] and one of my classmates and fraternity brother at Clark Atlanta University [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And Carl went on to become an executive of Coca-Cola and created a vacancy.  And there was a contested race between Michael Lomax and myself, and I won that particular election.
Speaker 1: The point is, we--we have a black president and a black mayor, and I'm just wondering how did life change for black people as a result of these two positions being held by black men at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh I think we showed that we were competent.  We were able to get jobs in Corporate America.  We were able to register voters.  We were able to do some good.  What we did not lack, from my perspective, we did not have development plans and capital to implement programs.  I think we've always been bright and intelligent, but we simply did not have that type of (unclear).  But I think that we produced people that went on to become mayor of Stone Mountain [Georgia], which I was always impressed with.  Created an environment where you had the late John McCown down in Hancock County [Georgia].  Ed McIntyre [Edward M. McIntyre] who became the mayor over in, you know, Augusta, Georgia.  And we saw other people rise to the top, and they always looked to us for leadership and so that made the difference in my lifetime.

Speaker 1: By now the Congressional Black Caucus has been organized, what impact did the election of additional representatives in [U.S.] Congress have on the operation of the City of Atlanta [Georgia] and its mayor [Maynard Jackson] and president [Carl Ware] of the stu-, of the city council [Atlanta City Council] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well in the country because you had, you know, congressmen from all over the country.  You had Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] from California which I thought was profound.  You had the young lady out of New York who ran for president and lost, can't think of her name now, but she was a Jamaican.  She held a congressional seat.
Speaker 1: Shirley Chisholm.
Speaker 2: Shirley Chisholm.  You had, you know, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] in a bitter contested fight between he and Lonnie King [Lonnie C. King, Jr.], and I supported Lonnie King because he was a native Atlantan and I knew about his hands-on administration that made the changes in Atlanta.  And so it let us produce and now you got, you know, council members and peoples sitting in law making bodies and I think they're very sensitive and I think we'd law some punch under the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration, the son, 'cause I really don't think they give a lot of attention to the Black Caucus, don't have to.  You know, they said that the Republicans here in Georgia when they regained the House of Representatives told some black leaders, and I quote, "Now it's payback time."  And that is small, that's not the way to be a great legislators because every twenty years, power changes.  And you may have to walk on the other side of the track during that particular time.

Speaker 1: In the last minute, let's just commit to talk at our next session about the founding of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] during the early years of your career and at the same time, the--not only your election, but the election of a black mayor [Maynard Jackson], and the election of Dr. Ben E. Mays [Benjamin Mays] as president of the Board of Education [Atlanta Board of Education], and the implication of those events for blacks in Atlanta [Georgia], the next time we meet?
Speaker 2: Here's an-, Dr. Yancey [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.] or his wife [Carolyn Dunbar Yancey], who also went on and made a change.  Dr. Mays had the capacity to get along and he was so well respected.  You know, people just didn't wanna disagree with him or they listened to him.  And he was so bright, you know.  One of my greatest hurt in my heart was to see him get old and he did not know when to quit or somebody did not tell him that you've done well my son, my faithful son, you have done well, and it's time to move on.
