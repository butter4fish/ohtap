 Finchum  Thomas  Today is September 12, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today  we   re in Aline, Oklahoma, to speak with Roberta Thomas and Lori  McMillin, and this is regarding the Oscar O. and Jessie Runyan  Homestead Place. So thank you for having us today.  Thank you for coming.  Let   s start with learning a little about how the land came to be in the  family to begin with.  Dean   s Granddad, who was Oscar Runyan, made the  Land  Run on  September 16 in   I don   t know the year. I might add right now,  Granddad Runyan and I made a run on the same day, only his claim was  his farm, and my claim was a little daughter,  Phyllis . (Laughter) We  always talked about that. Okay, they made the Run of   oh, what was the  year?  Eighteen ninety-three?     eighteen ninety-three. He came to this farm and staked the claim on it,  but he and the neighbor next door, the farm next to us, he went first, and  he staked his claim. Well, as it turned out, Granddad Runyan   s should  have been the other farm, and Dan Elly   s should have been this farm, but  since Dan had already gone up and staked the claim ahead of him, they  decided it was all big, tall grass, anyway, and they couldn   t tell the  difference. As it turned out, this was the better farm. Granddad Runyan  then went back after they got all that done. He went back to Kansas to  get Grandma Runyan, and then they came back down. They came on a  5  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  horse. He had his horse, and its name was   what was his horse   s name?   The horse   s name was Old John.   Oh, I don   t know.  Well, anyway, he had a horse that he rode in the Run. Then he went  back to bring Grandma Runyan down, and they lived in a dugout down  by the creek. I often wondered where the dugout was, and I just found  that out this year. I thought it was over beyond the road where you go in  down to the creek to get in down there, but I found out as you go in, it  was to the west. Right there by where you come into that field was  where the dugout was. They lived there. They made their home there.  That   s where Mom Ellen   that   s Dean   s mother, was Ellen  Runyan .  That was their only child. That   s where she was born was in that dugout.  Well, sometime along the way and pretty soon they built a four-room  house, and that   s what they lived in first. It was right here in this section,  right about where we   re sitting right now. They built this four-room  house, and that   s where they lived. Then they built another house, and  that house was one whole house-width to the west of where we are now.  When we built our house, we moved it one whole house-width. Dean  built this house. In 1979, we moved into it. Then he died from cancer in  November of that same year, so we didn   t get to live in our house very  long together. I don   t know what else you want me to say.  Well, we can back up. Was Oscar married when he came?  Yes, yes, yes. He went to get Grandma Runyan. Her name was Jessie.  Yes, Jessie. Jessie Harrel.  Their honeymoon was a trip in a covered  wagon, with a cow tied to the side, to the half dugout home where he  staked his claim.   Yes, she was Jessie Harrel, but they were married when he went after  her. They were married already. She lived in Kansas, and, like I said,  they came down here. Then they had Mom Ellen which was Mary Ellen  Runyan.  Just the one child?  Just the one child.  What were some of the products or produce that they had on the farm?  How did they make money on the farm?  Well, Granddad Runyan, he actually was the vice president of the bank  6  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  in  Aline . He did a little bit on that side as Aline was forming. They  raised wheat. I think when they moved here it was tall grass.  It was just grass, yes.  They talked about it being like up to your shoulders, tall grass. Of  course, they had livestock and stuff at different times.  They raised cattle. I don   t know whether they ever had sheep or not, but  we did. I think cattle probably was their main thing, chickens. They had  chickens.  Pigs.  Pigs, yes.  Well, if he worked in town, did Jessie work outside of the home?  No.  Not to my knowledge.  No. I don   t think Grandma Runyan ever had another job.  And besides the house     And they were very, very active in church. He was chairman of the  board of the church, and both of them were very active in church. Like  she said, he was president of the bank in Aline. We had two banks in  Aline, in fact.  What denomination were they?  Christian.  First Christian Church, Disciples of Christ   Christian.  Yes.  Well, besides the house that they lived in, did they build any other  buildings? The initial Oscar and Jessie, did they build any other  structures on the farm?  Well, yes, we had a wash house that they built, and then we   ve got a  cave out here. I think she stored her canning. She did a lot of canning.  She stored that down in the cave, and we still have that. I don   t often go  7  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  down there. It   s got a lot of spider webs now. (Laughs) I also stored my  canning down in the cave.  Did Granddad Runyan build the red barn that was out...  We had a red barn, yes. We had a big barn out there that he built, and we  had chicken houses back in that part of the yard. Is it all right for me to  point? (Laughter) So we did have the chicken houses, too, yes.  There was, at least at some point, I remember when I was a child, (of  course that would have been beyond him) we had a couple of barns.  There was a place where we had pigs, and there was a barn out there.  There was another shed over here, I remember, and you said at some  time you had a separator house. Was that the wash house?  Oh, no. That wasn   t the wash house. The separator house was just out  our back door and down the path east, and that   s where we separated our  milk. Also, they had a big tank that was there by the separator house that  they kept water in. It got hot during the daytime, and that   s when they  liked to take showers. It wasn   t very nice when your brother-in-laws  would go ahead of you and then say,    Oh, the shower is so nice. You  and Mary Ann need to go down and take a shower tonight.    The shower  was very cold. They had used all the hot water and then filled it up  again. (Laughter)  Then after the little separator house was not used anymore for that, we  made a playhouse for our daughters. We made them out of little crates.  We made them furniture and cabinets and things like that for their  playhouse. They had that. Then when we went to expand the playhouse,  they made a playhouse in the wash house that was built out here. They  had a washer with the tubs and everything, and that   s where they did  their laundry was in there. Sometimes when it was hot, Mom Ellen  would have them move the washing machine outside with the tubs and  everything, and they would wash clothes outside. Didn   t have a lot of  clotheslines or anything like that, so they hung them over the fence.  They had fences that they hung them over, especially the guys    jeans and  stuff.  How many children did she have?  Mom Ellen had Oscar and Ila and Ralph and Dean. Had four.  Had four.  Dean died first. He had lung cancer. Then Ralph was an FFA  Future  Farmers of America  teacher. He was in Kansas City at a meeting, and  8  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  he had a heart attack and died. His wife   s name was Mary Ann, and they  had two boys, Robert and Jack. They were the same age as two of my  children. Then Ila had Joetta and Steve and Larry, and they lived on a  farm over   at one time they lived just a mile from here. Then they built  a home in the southeast part of Alfalfa County.  With them having four children, then how did they pick which child was  going to get the property?  When Dean was in college, every one of them went to school at OSU or  Oklahoma A M, whichever it was at the time. Dad Cy rus , Dean   s  dad, got sick with pneumonia, and he couldn   t do the farm work. He  couldn   t do anything. Dean was in his second year of college, and then  he was asked to come home and do the farming. We met in college. I  was from Bartlesville, and that   s where we met was in college. We got  married in 1949, and then we had all of our children here, not in this  house but at the hospital in Cherokee and Fairview. We had five  children: four girls and one boy. Darrel, our only son, was killed in a car  accident just a mile from here, and that was devastating to our family.  We were building our house at the time. Dean and I was singing in a  quartet, and we sang at the church at a funeral that day. Darrel had gone  to Carmen to get cement. They were working on our basement. He was  coming home, and he was hit just a mile down from here, and we came  upon the accident.  I was going to say that Mom Ellen and Dad Cy had some other property,  as well, near here, and then she also had some property in Kansas that  was from her Harrel side of the family, and so they divided the property  up that way.  Well, and not only that, Dean had, like I said, (I got kind of off there) he  had quit school to come and do the farming. He had farmed here several  years before Mom Ellen died, and they all had their jobs and everything  that they did, the other children. We did not know, though, until the will  was read what she had done. We had no idea that she was leaving this  farm to Dean. Anyway, that   s the way it turned out. The farm that   s  south of here, two of the children got that. Ila got the   they owned a  home in town, and she got that and the Kansas property. They had a  farm in Kansas, and she got that. I don   t know. It was just the way Mom  Ellen decided to do it, and nobody knew, like I said, until the will was  read who got what or whatever. That   s the way it was done, and that   s  how we got it. We   ve certainly made a nice home out of it and place for  the children to come home, and they do come home.  Once you two came to live here then, did you farm the rest of the   Dean  continue to farm for most of his lifetime then?  9  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Dean did, yes, and besides that, he custom harvested. We went up  north   when he went south, it was just for one place down there. Then  when he came back, we harvested here. Then we went north, clear to  Montana. Ralph, his brother, had recommended these boys that he   d had  in FFA from Woodward. That   s where they lived, Ralph and Mary Ann.  He had recommended these boys as helpers, and they were good. They  were good helpers, really, but we went clear to Montana to cut wheat  and then came back. I was a beauty operator for fifteen years, so I didn   t  go right off with them. It was a while before I ever went to harvest with  them. I had to stay home and take care of things. I didn   t take care of the  farming.  At different times, Daddy also sold insurance. He worked at Sears, I  think, in the winter sometimes, depending on how hard times were,  whatever needed to be done.  He always had a job in the wintertime somewhere else. Yes, he sold  insurance for Old Surety, and then he sold it for American Health and  Life. They turned into that. Like she said, he worked at Sears Roebuck,  sold washing machines and that sort of thing. He was always busy.  Mainly in order to keep the farm going?  Yes.  Something like that, then produced mostly wheat then while     Wheat, yes. We had alfalfa, also. We had a really good alfalfa field, out  right south of this house. He raised a lot of alfalfa. It was a good, good  field. This is a good farm. It really is, and it raised good products,  raised good gardens. We raised gardens.  So you mentioned that you would have to stay here and take care of the  farm?  Yes.  What would be some of the things you would do?  I would can while he was gone if there was things. We had a garden. I  would do things like that. Take care of the children and whatever  animals needed to be fed. The children and I fed the animals. We did  have pigs, and we did have sheep and cattle.  Tell them about milking cows.  10  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Oh, well, I was a city girl. I would go down to the barn, and I   d watch  Dean milk. I loved it. I loved to sit down there and visit with him while  he milked. I said,    Do you think I could milk a cow?    He said,    Well        he had this one cow that he had bought from Louis Thomas. That   s his  cousin that you all were talking about a while ago. He said,    She   s very  gentle. You can try to milk her.    So he got me all fixed up, and it got so  whenever I would go down there to milk, she would draw her milk up.  She didn   t like my milking. (Laughs) He said,    I   m sorry, but we can   t  do this anymore. We   re ruining the cow.    (Laughter) So that ended my  milking career. Then when I really wasn   t interested, he said,    Would  you like to try again?    I said,    Nope. I   m not interested now. I   m doing  other things.    (Laughter) We did. We took care of the cattle. We didn   t  do any milking while he was gone. They weren   t milking then. We were  past milking times.  One of the things that I always remember Mother talking about, because  she was from Bartlesville and had always lived in town, is learning  about living on a farm and  killing  chickens and     Oh, let me tell you about   I had a aunt that lived here, and she   s the one  that taught me how to kill a chicken and then how to dress a chicken.  The way I killed the chicken, I put my foot on its neck, and off it went,  just going everywhere like they do. Then we   d have to catch it and settle  it down. I   d have to burn the feathers off, put it in hot water, and get the  feathers off. It was bad. (Laughter) Then she showed me how to cut the  chicken up, so I had to do that. Well, I want to tell you something. After  I cleaned ten chickens, I never wanted to eat one. That took all the eating  part away from me for at least that day. Of course, we had deep freezes  we put our product in.  I learned how to do a lot of things after I came here because I did not  know how to sew, I did not know how to do a lot of things. I pieced  quilts. Like I said earlier, I pieced quilts by hand, quilted by hand. I  belonged to this little Busy Bee Club. They had a lot of little country  clubs at that time. We   d meet in each other   s home, and if you had  something that you wanted the club ladies to do at your home whether it  be patching   I had a neighbor up here that did beautiful jean patching,  and I always had the boys    jeans ready, Dean and Darrel   s jeans ready  for her. Then if I was going to have them help me quilt, I would put up  my quilt ahead of time, and then that would be an all-day meeting. I  would feed them lunch then. We   d start quilting early in the morning,  and then they   d probably stay until afternoon. We   d have our little  business meetings. We made little programs that we had for all year.  Each person would make their own little books, and so that was  something that I   d never done before. I did a lot of things when I came  11  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  here that I had never, in town, ever done.  Well, did the farm have electricity?  Yes.  In    48?  We had it in    49. They had, I think it was, like, for two years maybe, no  longer than that, that they had electricity. Yes, I was very fortunate, and  I was introduced to an outside toilet. My daughters did not like it, nor  did I like to go out there at nighttime. We didn   t have a lot of lights. It  was out there on the other side of the wash house. You   d have to go out  by these trees that were out here, so you   ve got shadows in the night that  were scary. We did have an outside potty. The first thing that we got  new in our house was a potty. (Laughter)  I want to tell you about my first hot water heater. We had a little  bathroom, and it sat beside the bathtub. What you did was put water in  the top of it, and it had a hose that the water came out of. When the  water came out of the hose, it was hot. You   d put however much cold  water you wanted in your bathtub, and then you would get the hot water  that way to make it warm. That was new. I used to wash out in the wash  house. We had a big back porch, and we finally had a washing machine  that we put in there. We had had a huge deep freeze out there that we put  canning in or products. It was different. It was definitely different than  this city girl was     Well, we should probably back up and ask how you met your husband  then. I know it was at OSU, but how did you meet?  Okay. I was at a place there on the campus where you go for a drink or  something. I was there with another woman, and she was interested in  Dean, only I didn   t know that. She   s the one that introduced me to him,  but she really wanted him for herself. Then the minute Dean saw my  blue eyes, he knew that that was it. She didn   t have a prayer. So that   s  where we met. Not only that, we didn   t have a lot of money. We didn   t  have a car. We walked everywhere we went on campus. We walked up  to the corner to have drink. We would order one drink and share two  straws with it. So that   s how we   and he was a Farmhouse man. He was  a member of Farmhouse fraternity.  I ate in their fraternity house. It was a rule that if they had fried chicken,  which they most always did on Sunday, however Mother Cantrell ate the  chicken, that   s how you ate the chicken. If she did it with a fork, you ate  it with a fork. If she picked it up, you picked it up. Well, I was lucky.  12  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  My first visit to Farmhouse for dinner was chicken, and I got a back.  Guess how Mother Cantrell ate it? With a fork. Then I find out the next  Sunday she ate it with her fingers. (Laughter) It was very difficult for me  to get meat off of a back with a fork.  We played Bridge there. I learned how to play Bridge when I went  college. You have to learn all these things. Now I   m a real Bridge  player, and I just hosted Bridge in my house last week. I learned how to  play Bridge. My roommates and I even did that. We   d go over to the  Farmhouse and play with other people over there. I found out real quick  (a sorority girl informed me) that when you cut the cards, you cut them  towards the person, not back. That was a big deal with her. Every time  we cut cards now, whenever we start playing Bridge now, I will tell  them,    You want to be sure you cut these cards right.    (Laughter)  Where did you live on campus?  I lived in Willard Hall. That   s right in front of Theta Pond. I lived in the  corner room. I lived in the west corner. First of all, I lived in the middle  room. Then my roommate got married, so I moved over into this next  room with Scotty and Hazel, and we had that room together. I learned  how to make cottage cheese with a hot plate, those hot plate things, and  about ran the people out of that end of the dorm. (Laughter) We saved  our milk and brought it up and let it get to where we could do it, and I  made cottage cheese in this little pot. We just about got turned in by my  sister   in-law, only she wasn   t my sister-in-law then. Anyway, my  roommate, for the first time in her life, liked cottage cheese, so that  wasn   t too bad.  What was your major?  Home economics.  Oh okay.  Hazel was a   I can   t think what her major was, but Scotty was a nurse.  Well, did you graduate, or once you got married you stopped?  No, no. Got married and just stayed here.  Well, when you got engaged, did they do anything special to either one  of you, like throw you in the     Oh, hey  Yes  It   s called   what   d they call it?  13  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  You get shivareed.  Shivareed  We got shivareed, and we had a tank of water out here that  we got to be put in. Yes, the church ladies and guys did that to us.  Both of you?  Yes, we both got it, (Laughter) but that   s fun. We did it to other people,  too. We had one couple that were older when they got married, and we  had a buggy that we pushed them up main street in this buggy, the guys  did. We did that for them. That was Norma Jean and Corky.  Not having been to this town before, can you talk a little bit about it  from the older days compared to today?  In the older days they had stores that had businesses. Today we have  stores, but no businesses. We used to have, where the post office is, used  to be drug store. Best drug store in town made the best lime cokes ever.  Grape phosphates. (Laughter)  Right next to that, when it was the drug store, the next building was the  post office, and then a barber shop. We had a   what do you call them,  where the guys go in and smoke cigars and play cards and talk and do  that kind of stuff? Whatever that was called then, they had one of those.  Then we had an American Legion building. We had a fire station. Our  very first fire station was in our community building that   s up there right  now. In the south end of it was a little place, just a little place, because  we had a little fire truck. They   d go crank up that fire truck to get it to  go, and they still have that fire truck. It brings the things on Santa day.  They bring the fire truck down Main Street, and they give out goodies.  They give out bags of candy and fruit and stuff, so they still have that  fire truck.  Now they   re going to build from where the old hospital was to where the  co-op station was. They   re going to build a new fire station. It   s going to  be huge. We have several more fire trucks now than we did then. The  business office is going to be in it. It   s going to be a big space there that  they   re getting ready to build, and it will be right across the street from  the old community building. We use that for   sometimes people don   t  like our water, so they bring water from somewhere, and they have a  tank in there where they do that. They closed it. They wouldn   t let us  have things in that building because they said there was mold. Well,  we   ve had a lot of things. I don   t know. This mold thing has really  gotten to me because it   s not gotten to anybody else.  14  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  In the other side of that building, at one time, was a laundry. They had a  whole bunch of the washing machines, the little Maytag washers with  the tubs. You could go to town and wash and visit with the people, and it  was fun to do that. Now it   s our exhibit building for our Aline fair which  we have every year, the second week in October. Outside, they   ve got  these big iron kettles, bigger than that, about this, and they make soup.  We meet on Thursday and cut up all the vegetables, and they have  cooked the soup outside all night long, getting ready. We have free soup.  Sometime you need to come to our fair. We have a parade.  It   s good soup, too.  We always have a parade, and we have lots of exhibits in our exhibit  building. They have a bingo night. They   re going to have a talent show  instead of entertainment on Friday night. This year, they   re going to  have a talent show, and it   s not going to be judged. Anybody can come  and perform. I think they   re going to try and have it outside because I  think they   re having a band, also. So we   re doing that. They have a cake  walk. They   ve got things outdoors for the children to do with those  things you bounce around in and all that. They   ve got that.  We   ve increased what we do every year, and I wish I knew for sure what  year we started this. If I had thought, I would have looked back to see  because it   s been maybe a hundred years. It   s been a long time, and they  had free soup then. I read back in our little history book thing, and the  things that we do now, they had their little parades. Everything was done  differently. We still have our fair, and as long as we have a chamber of  commerce, which we do have, and I   m a member of that, we will still  have our fair as long as these old people can do it.  When you were talking about businesses, I know even when I was  little     Oh, I was going to go back to that.     Mother had her beauty shop. When I was little, attached to that  building, she was kind of behind Mrs. Loomis    clock shop. I always  loved that shop because there   s clocks everywhere ticking, and she had  all the little parts. I could go through the back of mother   s beauty shop.  There had been a library there at one time in between those two  buildings, and so there were still old books there. I could come into Mrs.  Loomis    clock shop, and she repaired all the old clocks and everything. I  always just thought that was a magical store. She was very sweet to let  me go in because now I think having a little child, with all those little  screws and gears and all that stuff, she was probably going,    Oh my  gosh.    Then around the corner from there, there was a meat locker, a  15  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  grocery store, a     They had a little bowling alley there one time. They used the ball that  didn   t have any holes in it. It was little and you   d just roll it down. I  wasn   t there then, but they said you did.  A caf  , there was a lot of different kinds of businesses, a lumberyard at  one time.  We had a lumberyard. The first Alfalfa County hospital is still there, and  down around the corner, we had a doctor   s office down there. We had  several doctors. The doctor that delivered Dean, they had a little wooden  hospital then. I think he was born here in this house, but that   s who  delivered him. He had his little office there in town. It was the first   I  think it is out in the country now. I think that little building   s out in the  country. I think somebody bought that and took it out in the country.  Well, where would he go to school...  He went to school in Aline.     like for elementary school?  He went to school in Aline. We had one school. It held from first grade  through the twelfth grade. They have just now, in the last two, three  years, built a new school. Until that time, that school still stood there,  but it   s gone now.  It was consolidated with Cleo Springs     Yes, we consolidated. We   re really in Major County school district now.  We consolidated with them.     so the elementary school now is in Cleo, and the high school   s here.  Lori was the only one of any of my children that went to kindergarten.  We didn   t have a kindergarten. The way they did the school, the  elementary was downstairs, and the high school was upstairs. It was a  two-story building. They had the first and second grade together, third  and fourth, fifth and sixth, and seventh and eighth, and they were all  downstairs. I just heard today where they   re talking about having,  maybe, three grades together at Cleo, and I question that. We got along  really well with our children with the two together, but they didn   t  include the two together. The first grade had their things they did; the  second grade had their things that they did. It wasn   t a combination all  together. Probably sometime there was, but not for   it was a first grade  16  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  and a second grade.  Population   s just gone down, I guess, is part of the problem.  Our number in the school is down, yes. This building out here, Dean   s  sister Ila taught school in that building. It was out in the country; it was a  one-room school. They sold it to Aline. They moved it into Aline for a  lunchroom, and this was with the old school. They already had built the  gym that   s still there. That was the lunchroom. Whenever they sold it,  Dean bought it. He was going to make a three-car garage out of it. Well,  it   s never made that. (Laughs)  Wanda Sims and Martha Thomas and I used to refinish furniture. We did  all the refinishing in this house. I refinished this organ over here. We  refinished furniture, and we painted houses inside and out. This is after  Martha   s and my husband, both, had died. We did do this. Dean, he was  still alive when we did part of this. I forget now, but all of ours, we did  for other people. People would bring their things to us, and we   d finish  them, and they   d come pick them up.  We   d get a little card table out there, and we   d have our little breaks  around the coffee table. We   d have coffee and whatever. Sometimes  we   d have Snicker bars, and if we didn   t have enough Snicker bars it  was my job to cut them so that each one of us had the same amount.  (Laughter) We laughed about that. Anyway, we did a lot of things like  that. This has been since our husbands died. Like I said, we painted  houses inside and out. There   s a lot of things that I have done that I  never dreamed that I would do, actually.  In the country.  In the country. You know what? I wouldn   t live in town for all the tea in  China. I love it to go visit my children. I love to visit with their  neighbors. Cheryl always said she liked for me to come, especially when  they just moved to wherever, because I would get acquainted with the  neighbors for them. (Laughs) I did. I loved visiting with people, and  that   s what I really do miss is having somebody to visit with.  Well, where   s your closest neighbor?  Gary Booze and he lives a mile from here, Gary and Doris. I   ve known  Doris since she was born. Gary comes every day for coffee and checks  on me to see if I   m okay. Now, you can   t find a better neighbor than  that.  He   s a very good neighbor.  17  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Nykolaiszyn  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  That   s my chair; that   s his. We were sitting here one day, and I said,     Gary, what are you going to do when you come here and I   m not here?     He says,    I   m going before you.    I said,    No, you won   t.    He knows  how to get in my house. He knows everything about me, I   ll tell you for  sure. He   s a very, very good friend. He helps me in no way that you can  imagine if I ever need anything done. My little OSU sign that I   m going  to show you after while, it   s out there. It had fallen down the post thing.  I said,    Would you please put that up for me? I   ve got some OSU people  coming.    (Laughter)    I need to have my sign back up.    It wears down.  It   s heavy, those signs. Have you seen them?  No.  Well, you will. They   re heavy, and it   s on a     Are you talking about the Centennial Farm sign?  I   m talking about the Centennial Farm sign, yes, so he   s got it all ready  for you ladies.  We checked that to make sure we were in the right place. (Laughter)  Yes, yes.  Well, growing up, what were some of your chores on the farm?  I mowed the lawn as I got a little bit older. Of course, Daddy was  harvesting, and so all those things Mother learned how to do when she  moved from the city, she taught all of her girls how to do. We all knew  how to cook.  And they   re good cooks.  (Laughs) I can cut up a chicken several ways. In the summertime,  especially when we started going on harvest but even here, I would help  her get meals ready for whoever was working. I liked to go out in the  field, so as I got older I helped drive the tractor, I mowed the lawn, that  kind of stuff. I had chores in the house to do, too.  If I drove the tractor, Dean liked to put me over at our farm on the west  place because he couldn   t stand a crooked row. If I was on that field  over there, nobody could see it. (Laughter) That   s my tractor driving.  When I was in high school, Daddy died when I was a freshman in high  school, so I was fourteen at that time. I continued, though, in the summer  18  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  for summer jobs. I helped one of my cousins, Ila   s son Larry, he had  farms here, and so I drove the tractor for him in the summer. I just have  always loved that aspect of being on the farm. When I was really little,  we had pigs and chickens, and I remember having sheep and cows and  things like that.  They showed sheep.  I was little, though, so I was kind of a tag-along, I think, for most things.  I loved that part of farming and still do. When it   s harvest time, I like to  see the wheat getting cut and enjoy that.  They showed calves, sheep, pigs. Janice even   this is in the 4-H     4-H okay.  They showed them at the county fair. Janice, she had a rooster that was  just absolutely gorgeous, and she took it to the fair. It grew a feather  between its toes overnight and was disqualified. (Laughs)  Couldn   t pluck it? (Laughter)  Well, we didn   t know it. They   d already judged when we got up there,  and it had done that overnight because it wasn   t there the day before,  and was disqualified. She was just heartbroken because she had paid a  lot of attention to that little rooster.  There is an age gap. My next oldest sister is eleven years older than me,  so they   re, like, eleven to fifteen years older than me. I was a special  project that came along later. (Laughs)  Well, let me tell you about that. When I got married, I wanted four  children, and I wanted them close together, and I wanted them before I  was thirty. Well, I evidently forgot where they came from, and eleven  years after I had Cheryl, here came Lori. That   s right. I want to tell you  something: it was meant to be. She was a lifesaver for me after Dean  died. God knew what he was doing. You know, we shouldn   t ever, ever,  ever wonder because God knows what each one of us are going to do,  when we   re going to do it, and how we   re going to do it. We   re his  plans. My plan for today was to meet you two lovely ladies.  And we   re glad we did. Well, let   s back up.  Okay, now what? (Laughter) I kind of get bypassed.  Let   s go back to your earliest memory of holidays here on the farm.  19  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Oh, they are great. We   ve always had good holidays. One year for  Christmas we decided that we were going to make everything. I made  little dresses for   Janice and Phyllis were little. I made little dresses. We  all wore long dresses. We all wore long dresses, and everybody was to  make everything. This cabinet over here, Phyllis and Darrel made for  me. Let me see what else I   ve got around here. Can   t think now. There   s  a little thing up there that Dean gave me, that little thing that   s shaped  like this. It hangs up, like up there on that cabinet. It   s a little hook thing.  Well, it doesn   t always work, but anyway that   s what Dean made for me,  and he had given me I forgot what else.  You got a microwave for your real   . (Laughs)  For that real thing. He was kind of funny with things like that. He and  Darrel, whenever they would come, they would go to harvest beans in  the fall. This one Christmas that we made everything, we would get  around the table, we made all of our decorations, we made everything,  Christmas tree decorations, all that. We were doing that, and Darrel  made a bear. He made it out of felt and made all the little face on it and  everything. Dean made a donkey, even stuffed it. They made those for  our tree. They came in while we were doing that one night, and so they  wanted to do something. That   s what they did. Everything that we did  for that Christmas, and it was so special to see what all     I think I was about nine or ten that year        they would come up with.     and I embroidered hot pads and all kinds of things from being in the  Busy Bee Club. I knew how to embroider, and so I embroidered a lot of  things. I wasn   t that old that year. The girls made aprons, and I don   t  know, night gowns and all kinds of different things for gifts. The boys  had made this cup holder. They made Phyllis this big TV unit.  It   s downstairs.  I remember that. We all had, like, (there   s one around the corner, or  there used to be) a little thing you put a lamp on, oil lamp on. Those  were kind of popular at that time.  It   s in the utility room.  They spent a lot of time out in the building with the wood workshop  going. It was a fun   .  20  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  That was just that one. One thing that we did at Christmastime, we  always, always cut our own tree. We never had a store tree. We always  went out in the country. We did this on a Sunday afternoon, and whether  it be snowing or whatever, we still did it. We made hot chocolate and  cookies. I can   t remember the people that let us come out to their farm  every year and get our tree. Naturally, I always picked one that was too  tall, and they would try to,    This is too tall, Mother. This is too tall,     Dean would say. I   d say,    Oh, no, I think it   s just right.    Of course, we   d  have to cut it way down by the time we   d get it to the house, but we  always had a big tree. Sometimes my mother and father and my older  sister would come from Bartlesville. Louise came one year the day we  were going to go get a tree, and she had never, ever, ever done anything  like that, being a city girl. We didn   t do that. We bought trees. She got to  go out and do that with us, and she enjoyed that so much, so much.  Oh, another thing that our family did was carol people on Christmas  Eve. Every Christmas Eve, we   d go to town and go to different places in  town, different homes in town. Went down to Virgil and Ila   s down in  the country, and down to Martha and Louis    out in the country. That   s  what we did on Christmas Eve. We   d go carol people. We were singers.  We were singers. A family of singers is what we were. Then I had a  stroke in 2001, and I lost my singing voice. (Laughs) That   s only thing I  lost.  Shoot  We were going to have you sing something.  No.  But you guys, when the other girls were little, you would go to Mom  Ellen   s house in town on Christmas Eve.  On Christmas Eve, we   d go in to Mom Ellen and Dad Cy   s house and  have Christmas with them. Then we would come home and leave clothes  on our children and put them to bed, except for shoes. Then we   d get up  about five in the morning, pick them all up, and put them in the car and  go to Bartlesville because they had Christmas on Christmas day in  Bartlesville. Here, Mom Ellen had it on Christmas Eve. That way, we  got to have Christmas both places.  When did Santa Claus come?  Oh, I took care of that. Dean would take the children to the car, and then  I would naturally have something I needed to do, so I was in here like  that. (Laughs) I knew where everything was, where everything needed to  go. We even had a tricycle wagon thing that we had to hide in the house  from them before we went to Mom Ellen   s. Some of these things, I  21  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  could do that. Then when we came home, Santa had been here, so we  had Santa before we went to Bartlesville.  One thing that I   ve got, (I   ll show it to you in a little while) we found a  little book that, I think, it was a school book that Mom Ellen had written  in when she was, we think, second grade. Of course, they had to write  just to practice writing or whatever, but she talks about Christmastime  and how exciting it was to have maybe a piece of fruit in your stocking  or maybe nuts. She would talk about it like it was really awesome to  have fresh fruit. Then she also talks about how cold it was in the winter  and that people died, they would freeze. It was just, this is her little  school book. She   s just writing whatever, but it   s a big comparison to  certainly how our Christmases are now, a big difference.  And she played the piano, Mom Ellen. She gave piano lessons, and she  also played the organ and the piano at church. She also was a   what do  you call the Cub     Cub Scout leader.  Cub Scout leader. When I bought this   I bought this organ over here,  and it was black. I got it for ten dollars at a sale there in Aline. Well, we  put it down in the basement of their house. The bellows didn   t work, so  she hooked up her vacuum sweeper that blows, and that   s how she got it  to work. We put it in the basement of her house, and that   s the way she  played it for the little Cub Scouts. (Laughter)  That   s pretty smart.  Then after she died, I told the boys,    I want that organ moved out to my  house.    We fixed it all up, and then I refinished it. There was a man  from Ringwood, somewhere down there, a preacher that got it all  working, so it works. It works. I wish I could play it.  Mom Ellen was always, I thought, a very interesting lady. She lived here  her whole life, was born down in the dugout. When I was little, she was  elderly at that time, and I spent quite a bit of time with her. She taught  me how to play piano. She would drive   at that time, she had a place  that was about a mile south of here. She planted a garden up there. We   d  get in the car, and she   d start talking about what it was like when she  was little. She would not remember that she had just told you that story,  so you got to hear it lots of times, which now I   m kind of glad for  because I heard them lots of times. She taught school, got her teaching  certificate and taught school.  She did that after she got older.  22  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  At some point as an adult, she got her passport and took a trip to the  Holy Lands, went over there. She did quite a bit of traveling and things  like that. She was the organist at the church for fifty or more years. Just  one of those mainstay people, I think, that was just kind of a pillar for  the community. That   s pretty neat.  And she was a Busy Bee.  Is that a home demonstration club?  We had two home demonstration clubs. One of them was   what was  that first one? Aline Homemakers. It was the Aline Homemakers. I was  a member of that, also. Then we had another one that started up, and I  can   t remember the name of it.  But it   s different from the Busy Bees?  Oh, yes. Busy Bee was a country club, a little country club. All the  neighbors here were a member of our Busy Bee Club. It was just, I guess  you want to call it, maybe, a neighborhood club. We had Mrs. Hood up  here, Mrs. Bradley over there, and Barrows, clear around. Then we had a  couple of ladies or three from in town that were a member of our Busy  Bee Club.  They made quilts for each of the kids as they graduated from high  school. The club had club colors, so it was kind of a     It was a    Road to Oklahoma    quilt.     lavender color and white. We each got a quilt that they hand-pieced  and quilted as we graduated from high school.  Now, Mrs. Bradley   s son did not want a quilt. He wanted a shirt. He  wanted a white, long-sleeve shirt. We bought him a white, long-sleeve  shirt. Everybody else got a quilt, (Laughter) but that isn   t what he  wanted. Whatever they wanted, well, that   s what we did. There was  something else Busy Bee that I was going to say when you were saying  that. Now I don   t know what it was. You know I   m eighty-six years old  now. (Laughs)  You   re doing great. When did Ellen and her husband move off of the  farm?  When we moved in. That would have been in    49. Granddad Runyan  was blind, and that   s why they moved to town, to take care of Granddad.  23  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  I want tell you about him. They had steep steps that go to the basement,  and being blind, he would still walk down those steps. In this little room,  there was a big mirror there. He would stand in front of that mirror and  shave. Couldn   t see. He was a wonderful, wonderful person. He was just  a blessing to go visit. I knew that he couldn   t see my children, and it  about broke my heart because everybody should have known Granddad  Runyan.  You won   t find a sweeter person in the whole world than he was. He  could see Janice. She had a little dress   my girls, they always wore  dresses. They didn   t ever wear pants. She was crawling across the floor  up there in her little white dress, and he could see the white dress. He  could see her moving. That was one of the biggest delights for me, that  he was able at least to see movement out of her. He had a little stand by  his chair and had a radio. He listened to that radio. They liked to go in  and sit on his lap and talk to him. He was just a fine gentleman, I   ll tell  you.  I didn   t know Grandma Runyan that well. She died about two years after  we were married, and so I   m not that familiar with her. She was a big  stout lady, and he was short. She was real active in church, too. They  both were. She was a homemaker. She never worked outside of the  home. They were just fine people, and they couldn   t have raised Mom  Ellen any better than they did. She was a wonderful, wonderful lady. I  spent lots of days talking to her, and I   ll never regret. You know, even  when I had my beauty shop, she would come in, and she was to the place  where she was getting Alzheimer   s. She would repeat, and I would  answer her like it was the first time she had ever said it.  Her daughter came in one day, and she says,    I   ve already told this to  you, Mother.    I told Ila, I said,    You   re wasting your breath. She   s going  to say it again,    and she did. We get like that, and I hope my children (I  know they will be because I know them) will be as patient with me when  I repeat, repeat, repeat.  You   ve already told me that. (Laughter)  Maybe I   m already doing it and don   t realize   You already said that. (Laughter)  We need to be very, very sensitive with the older people, like we were  with Granddad Runyan and like we were Mom Ellen and like I was with  my mother.  24  Nykolaiszyn  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Finchum  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Well, was there ever a time where your family thought you would lose  the farm?  No, not with my time.  To my knowledge, there   s not been a lien or anything on it at any point.  No. Never has been.  How many acres is it,160?  It   s 160.  There used to be a railroad tracks that went through here, and it   s been in  the last ten years     My uncle was driving the train.  It   s been in the last ten years that the railroad took those train tracks out,  so we purchased that land back. It was a part of that.  Have trouble with hobos?  You know, we called them tramps. I can remember when we were eating  in the kitchen, and we had this knock on the door. It was a, well, I   m  going to say tramp because that   s what we called them. They came up  the railroad track. He wanted something to eat. We were eating at the  time, and so we took him some food out to eat. I always thought,    Have  I done wrong by doing this? Is he going to show up again when Dean   s  not here,    but he never came back. He never came back, but we did feed  him. Yes, we gave him something to eat, and that   s the only person I can  remember.  When I was little, there was also somebody that flew an airplane that  landed in our field.  This field out here?  Yes, I was thinking it was out there, but I don   t know. I don   t remember  now who that was.  They used to have an airport in Aline. That was something we had, too.  Dean and Darrel both learned how to fly in there. He did, he landed in  this field out here is where he landed.  In your packet that you sent to get the Centennial designation, there was  25  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  a poem by Ora English.  Yes.  Do you know the story behind that?  We loved Ora. She lived in Aline, and she sold   what kind of products?  I don   t know.  Did I say in there what she sold?  No.  But she did, she sold something. She   d go door to door to do it, but she  did write poems.  Our Aunt Ila   s who, I think, filled out the Centennial application, and so  she included that in there. I   d have to look at it because I can   t remember  now.  It   s very neat. It   s a great poem. I just wondered if you knew the  background behind it.  I don   t know, except I knew that     She wasn   t a teacher?  No, no. She taught students expression lessons. They   d go to her home,  and she did teach them expression lessons. She did that.  I will say, like, looking back through, because I   ve gotten on  Ancestry.com and I kind of do some stuff there, people wrote poems  more then. We   ve got a few writings and stuff from some of   I don   t  know. Now I can   t remember off the top of my head if it   s Granddad  Runyan or     Granddad Runyan had some poems.     Granddad Thomas. They wrote more. Then the paper, of course,  you   d have a lot more, kind of, just funny things that people said in the  newspapers and things then. I   m always talking to my kids about how  now as I   m looking back through things, if you can find something in  someone   s handwriting, it   s pretty exciting. You feel like you   ve got a  little connection to that person. It   s like the stuff with Mom Ellen, that  you kind of get a little sense of what it was like for her in second grade.  26  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Now we   re all text message and email that no one   s ever going to see  those thoughts again. They   re gone.  And that   s sad.  Yes, you lose that   .  Our improvement, to me, is not improvement. I miss those things.  There   s good things and bad things, but looking back, the beautiful  handwriting and being able to capture that element of that person is gone  because people won   t   emails are private unless somebody saves it.  My handwriting they probably wouldn   t want, anyway. When I had my  stroke, they asked me if there was something that I really wanted to do  that I wasn   t doing at this time, and I said,    I don   t want to write like my  sisters.    At that point, I just about was. They gave me penmanship, so I  don   t write like my sisters. They did do that. They went ahead and gave  me penmanship lessons as part of my therapy.  It sounds like education was important for the Runyans, as well as your  side of the family, too.  We had lots of teachers. Of course, Mom Ellen was a teacher, and then  her daughter Ila. Oscar     Oscar.  Her son Oscar taught at Montana State University in Bozeman in  animal   I think he was in animal science.  Yes.  And then     Dean was in animal science.  Yes, and Ralph Thomas, he taught school here at one time, and then he  was out at Woodward.  His first teaching job was at Aline as FFA teacher. He was the first FFA  teacher in Aline too.  Really all of those three kids, except for Daddy, all ended up being  teachers. He probably should have been because Daddy was along those  same lines, too. Then my sister Phyllis was a teacher, (she   s retired now)  27  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  was a school principal here in Oklahoma for a number of years. We   ve  had lots of     Her husband is president of the college there in     They   re in...  In Arkansas.  Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  Pine Bluff. Lori   s husband is a teacher at Northwestern  Oklahoma State  University  in Enid. He   s also dean of students, and he also has his  doctor   s degree. I have several children that have their master   s degree,  and he and Steve, Phyllis    husband, both have their doctor   s degree, so  you can come out of these little schools and do good.  And do well.  Right.  You say    do well,    which is right, but they do good. (Laughs)  Mother and Daddy always encouraged us to go to school. They wanted  us to at least try it, so we all did some school, at least some school. Some  of us have done a lot more than     When our children were little        was anticipated.     we started in right then talking    going to school.    We started right  then talking    going to church.    We didn   t say,    Do you want to go to  church?    This is something we did as a family. Every Sunday morning  we went to Sunday school and church in our car, one car. These were  things that they were brought up that they were going to do, and we did.  We talked college to all of them, all the time. They had their own ideas  as to whether they really wanted to do it or not, but they also had our  push behind them.  I think that   s important because so many children don   t have that mother  and father that care whether they go to college or not. I know that my  children have all--Janice just went two years, but that was good. She   s  the one that just retired at Philips 66 in Bartlesville. She worked for  them for twenty-five years, and they just had a big thing over there for  her. So, you know, that two years did good to her. I don   t think college  28  Finchum  Thomas  Nykolaiszyn  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  is for everybody, but they need to be encouraged. If it doesn   t work out,  then they can do something else like Janice did. They   ve all done very  well, and I   m real proud of them.  Sounds like it. Well, we need to name them then. We   ve got Lori here  with us.  We   ve got Janice, Phyllis, Darrel, Cheryl, Lori.  I got it. (Laughter) Well, after your husband passed away what  happened on the farm?  My world came to an end is what happened. Without this one  Lori   being here, I don   t know what I would have done. I farm my farm  with   Monty Shelite, and he does an excellent job. I wouldn   t ask anybody  else to farm my farm as long as he can do it. I   ve got another farm   we  did purchase a farm over west, and Monty farms it, also. We   ve had  different people come in when we had alfalfa, to help cut, help with the  alfalfa. We   ve had high school boys when Dean and I was doing it. They  used to laugh at me. They   d come in. Oh, they were so dirty. That   s  when they  tied  the bales on the sides. They tied them on the sides.  They would just be awful, and so we   d hand them a hose and a tub, and  they   d wash off before they   d come in the house. We hired a lot of  young men to help us, whether it be alfalfa or wheat or whatever. Wheat  and alfalfa is just about all we farmed actually.  After Daddy died, Larry Cy, that was Ila   s oldest son, farmed this place,  really until he died. He had cancer, as well, but he farmed it. Then  Monty took over after that.  Then Monty took over.  How have you kept records through the years?  It   s tough.  Are you doing it, did you do it     It   s tough.     on the computer or by what?  I   ll tell you. No, I   ll tell you how I do it. His name is Ron Edwards.  (Laughter) I started having my bank stuff sent to him. All of it goes to  Ron. He was our tax man, Dean   s and my tax man, so I knew him. We  have all that sent to him. He does all my bookkeeping all year long, and  29  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  then I go up and do my income tax when it   s time in April. I save all my  little papers to take to him or send to him ahead of time. Then I go up,  and he has it all ready for me to do when I get there. It costs me three  hundred dollars a year. Now, that   s cheap.  I remember Daddy having ledger books that he wrote to keep track of  things.  Well, when he was sick, I think it was the last time, he knew his days  were numbered. He had me bring him one of those yellow pads  in the  hospital . When I went back up, (I stayed with him most of the time, but  I   d have to come home for a little bit) he had everything written that I  was to do for a sale, everything, what the combines would be worth. He  had everything on that paper ready for me. You just can   t imagine. He  was so thoughtful. He was a very   he was like his mother, actually, I  think. His dad, I loved his dad to death. He would come in, and he would  visit. I can remember (this was in the old house) this one day I was  laying on the couch in the living room. He came in, and he had his hands  in his pockets. He wore a hat. He didn   t wear a cap; he wore a hat. He  had it on the backside of his head, and he says,    Are we taking a nap  today?    (Laughter) He was such a pleasant man. They were just really  good, good people. He was active in church, also, and he farmed. He  even still helped Dean farm as long as he lived. He died when he was  fifty-nine. Dean died when he was fifty-one. That   s young, ladies.  We sort of now have the dilemma of what to do. You know, this place,  for us   don   t let me cry. There   s lots of heart and feelings about it for  all of us kids. Then it   s, like, what to do with it going forward. On one  hand, it   s only 160 acres, but we all have kids and whatever that we   ll  probably leave it to, but then you   re, like   it gets complicated. It   s a  business; it   s a farm. Of course, you can hire somebody to run it and  different things. We all live all over the world from Rhode Island to  California, the grandchildren do, so we   re sort of in that, I guess, swirl of  thinking about how are we going to deal with this because we all have  this connection and our kids have this connection to the farm because of  the stories and growing up here and how we   ve grown up. It   s a puzzle,  really.  I   ll tell you what     Our husbands are always like,    You guys need to decide,    and it   s like,     We   ll decide later.    (Laughs)     when I   m gone, what I   ve always thought they should do   I   m very  particular who I want to live in this house. I don   t want just anybody  outside my family to move in here and not take care of it. It has been my  30  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  pride and joy, and I have worked real hard. What I think would be nice if  none of them want to come to the farm, if they cannot come to the farm  and live   I understand that because they all, like she said, they all have  their own lives. They   ve made their own lives somewhere else, and they  all have their children. I have one grandson that I know of that has said  he would like to live here. He would never make a farmer, but maybe  I   m wrong. Maybe I   m wrong, but I think that they should rent, have  part of the farm, like, from there, down to where the barns are and across  and include the house, rent it to somebody and let them farm that farm.  Maybe they could run some cattle on it or something on that little bit. To  begin with, we said this farm would never be sold because of Granddad  Runyan, so that   s a dilemma they   re up against also, and I realize that.  We don   t want to sell it.  And they don   t want to     We just want to figure out what   s the best responsible thing to do. It   s  our puzzle to solve in the future, but it   s home. (Laughs)  And we have the other farm. I   ve told them to just sell it. (Laughter) The  farm right next to me sold for over three hundred thousand dollars  recently.  A hundred and sixty acres?  Yes.  Is there mineral rights? Do you have mineral rights?  We have the mineral rights. I have the mineral rights to that one. My two  properties I have in town, I have mineral rights there.  So she   s not going to figure it out for you?  No, I   m not. I   ve done it.  I keep telling the boys   because our husbands are like,    You guys need  to figure that out,    and it   s like,    We   ll figure it out when the time  comes.    We kind of talk around.  They don   t talk around, around me. They don   t.  No, but you don   t know   I mean, the truth is Mother   s family all lived,  a lot of the women have lived to be in their late nineties. She may be  here another ten or fifteen years. We may not have to decide anything  31  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  for a long time. It may be a whole new world by the time we have to  decide.  My two brothers died when they were sixty-nine, both of them, my older  brother and my younger brother. My sisters have all been in their  eighties except for Louise. She was ninety, and she was my oldest sister.  Now, then, I   m eighty-six. My sister that   s still living, besides me, is  going to be ninety her birthday in October. She   s still in good health.  And your mother was ninety-six?  Mother was ninety-six, yes, and her sisters were, some of them in their  eighties. Aunt Lucille was just  seventy . She had a cerebral  hemorrhage. That   s who I was named after. We   ve got a long lineage  there of age. I don   t know. We don   t know when our time   s up. You  know? My closest time, probably, has been when I had my stroke. I was  very fortunate to be in Tulsa at the time about two blocks from Saint  Francis Hospital. I had three people in my group that I was chairman of  this committee for that were nurses. I do not know one thing after I said,     I have headache,    and then I said,    I really have a headache.    I was at  this meeting. I don   t know one thing, again, until I woke up. I was there  for a month, and they moved me to Enid. I was there two weeks before I  knew anything. I don   t remember being in Saint Francis at all, don   t  remember the doctors, don   t remember anything.  You   re not meant to remember that. (Laughs)  But on the other hand, I had my children with me all that time. I had my  sisters with me all that time. My children are truly, truly a blessing to  me. God knew I needed four good girls, and he gave them to me.  Is that a good place to stop?  I think so.  On a happy note, we   ll stop there then. (Laughter) Thank you for  sharing today. It   s been great.  I want to show you some   can we look at some things?  Sure.  Did I say enough about the farm?  Oh, yes, it   s fine. It   s the whole picture we   re after.  32  Thomas  McMillin  Finchum  McMillin  Thomas  It means a lot to all of them, and I don   t want to take away from any one  of them because they all love the farm, and their husbands definitely  love to come to the farm. They were all somewhere else, from  somewhere else.  I think that, really, all of those people from Granddad Runyan and on up,  created a loving environment for all of us to grow up in, and a  community. They were very involved in the community in Aline. We all  treasure that. It   s not the place. We have the memories of the place in  our hearts, you know, but this is kind of where you feel that because  they all have that commitment to family and love. For me, a lot of what  they did was fairly simple living in some ways. It was hard, but it was a  simple life, and I kind of like that about it, that it was about family. I  think of that because that   s what this place brings to me.  We usually ask that: What   s your favorite memory on the farm? Do you  have a favorite one?  I do remember, when you were talking about Christmases earlier, we   ve  just always gotten all together. It   s a big to-do. Anymore, there   s lots of  extended family, and we kind of have a tradition now of on-Christmases  and off-Christmases so that we can all be together. With everybody   s  kids and grandkids, and now great-grandchildren starting to come in, we  might have forty-five people sometimes, so it gets crowded. We   ve had  it in town at the senior center, we   ve done it at our different houses, but  we   ve all made a commitment to be together somehow.  It means there   s a lot of people sleeping on the floor and a lot of people  sharing the bathrooms wherever you are. I think my memories are really  of all of us getting together. There was always singing, lots of laughing,  playing games, all those things you do as a family. We   ve never been a  family that there was fighting and carrying on like that, so it   s a pleasant  place to be. If somebody   s feelings get hurt, we work it out. It   s just a  nice place to be. So my favorite memories, really, probably, surround  holidays or times we   ve been all together.  One thing that was special to me with my children was nap time.  (Laughter) I would always lie down with them. We   d go get on a bed,  and I would read to them. I   d read a story to them, and they would go to  sleep. Then I   d lay there, and I   d pat each one of them for a little bit  until they went to sleep. That time with my children was very special to  me. I had a lot of special times with them. I loved playing with them out  in the yard. We   d have the swing set, and we had sand piles, and Darrel  had his tractor. We bought him a new John Deere tractor every year for  Christmas because he wore the other one out. He farmed all around the  trees. Lori liked to go farm, out with Darrel. They   d farm all around the  33  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  trees out there, and we didn   t care if they messed up grass or whatever.  We had a sandbox where they could build stuff in the sandbox, and it  was big sandbox. I liked playing outside with them. I liked being with  them. That was always special.  When they were real tiny, (and this was in the old house) when I   d iron  their little dresses   like I said before, they always wore dresses. I had  these little batiste dresses. You   ve probably seen them; maybe you  haven   t. Dean fixed me a clothesline across the kitchen, and I   d iron  those little dresses, and then I   d hang them on the clothesline. I could sit  back and look at them. I loved it. I loved it. You know what I still do? I  go to the basement, and when I iron, I still hang my clothes up and let  them stay there overnight. Then I go down, bring them up.  Doing things like that with my children, I loved doing things with them.  They liked being read to, and they   re all good readers. They were all  good students. I don   t think I had a bad student. We just encouraged  them to do things. You know, it broke my heart one time when I heard a  Sunday school teacher say that she called down to these people and said,     Is so and so coming to church today?    The father turned to him and  said,    Do you want to go to Sunday school?       No.    So he didn   t go.  Now, isn   t that sad? Why didn   t the father say,    Yes, we   re coming to  Sunday school   ? Well, they didn   t. Like I said before, we didn   t ask if  you want to do these things. We encouraged to do things. Therefore  they   ve done the same, likewise, I hope.  Do you have a favorite season on the farm, harvest time or planting?  Oh, I loved harvest  I loved harvest. It was so much fun to go to harvest  up North. My niece that lives in town here, we harvested kind of at the  same place we   d stayed. Our trailer houses were kind of in the same  place, and they   d cut somewhere else. We   d fix our meals and take them  out to the field at noon. Sometimes it was a long way out there to where  we   d have to take our meals. We   d put the pickup  tailgate  down and  get the food all ready there where they could come in and eat. Then  when we came back to town, we   d clean up our messes, Pat and I would,  and then we   d go shopping. (Laughter) Sometimes it was grocery  shopping, and sometimes it was shopping-shopping. We liked to do  things like that. Our boys that we got, like I said before, were such nice  boys. I had two nephews that used to go to harvest with us, and they  even talk about that yet. They lived in Tulsa. They lived in Jenks. They  certainly weren   t farm boys, but they did come out to the farm and help  us out. We did have a lot of boys that did that.  Daddy was good, I thought, to go up near into the Black Hills, up into  the Black Hills. A lot of those kids were, like Mother said, juniors and  34  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  seniors in high school, and so they hadn   t been any place up there. If it  rained or something, it was really good to take a trip.    Let   s go see  Mount Rushmore,    or,    Let   s go to Medora,    or whatever.  We did do that...  Lots of side trips.     and there   s one little place that we stopped, and they had this huge  slipper slide. I mean it was huge, and of course it had water. We   d  always stop there and let them cool off there and do things there, and  they liked that. We did take them, also, to the Cheyenne Rodeo because  we were just not too far from there. The time that we found out Dean  had cancer, we   d gone to the Cheyenne Rodeo, and I didn   t know that he  had been to the doctor. That night we were watching   who was the  singer? He was black, so good.  Charlie Pride?  Charlie Pride. He was at the end of his little stage thing, big ol    golden  moon right behind him, this black man standing there with that. We  were on the ground sitting on blankets watching him, watching his show,  it was so good. Then Dean said that night that he needed to go back to  the doctor on Monday. He thought he had pneumonia, and he needed to  go back to the doctor to check for sure. That   s when he found out. He  told him, he says,    You need to leave now and go home,    and that   s how  quick his cancer came on. I cried. I drove the pickup all the way home,  pulled one of the trailers, and I cried all the way home. It was so sad. I  hope we don   t leave on this note. Anyway, he lived a year and a half,  and we made the most of it. Like I said, we had all of our children. The  night before he died, he was talking to all of them. He had a really,  really nice visit with each one of them. Phyllis was nursing her little  baby, and she had to leave to go home and put Kyle to bed, so she  missed out on that. She   s always felt so bad that she didn   t get to be on  her Daddy   s visit, but that   s life.  He never regretted having dropped out of college to come back and     No. Never, never, never did I feel like he regretted doing that.  He did go back to college a little bit with Phyllis when she was in  college at Northwestern in Alva.  At Northwestern.  He took a couple of classes with her, so he didn   t completely give that  35  Finchum  Thomas  Nykolaiszyn  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Nykolaiszyn  McMillin  up.  You mentioned there was an oil well. Did it produce     Yes, we had a good oil well up here in this field and one down here. In  fact, the last three days, they   re busy cleaning up all the rock and stuff  from that. That   s what those     Did you name the oil wells? Did they have names?  They were Thomas   well I think then they were     Thomas One and Two.  They haven   t produced for a long time, and they   d abandoned them, so  we had them clean it up. They   re in the process of finishing that up.  Was the money a big lifesaver at that time or     Oh, yes, it put our children through college.  Okay.  Yes. Of course, they had loans, too. Don   t get me wrong on that because  they did, but it helped put our children through college, yes. They came  in just at the right time, yes.  Things seem to happen that way. (Laughter)  Yes.  Anything else, before we sign off a second time? All right.  One thing that might be interesting to add on here is Daddy did write a  story about the Run that Granddad Runyan, as he told it to him. It   s not  very long     He also wrote a story about that clock.     but I could read it if that would be   I don   t know if you want it or  not.  It isn   t long. I think it   s the one that   s in the     Oh, is it in there?  36  Nykolaiszyn  McMillin  Nykolaiszyn  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  McMillin  Yes.  If you already have it, that   s fine.  We have a copy. It   s actually written very well. We were reading it, and  I   m like,    This is very good writing.     Dean did that. He also wrote a story about this clock. Bring that picture  over here. I want to show her my family when I was little.  This one?  Yes.  This was Mom Ellen, and this was Grandma and Grandpa Runyan. This  was their fiftieth anniversary picture. That   s after he was blind. I   ll take  them back and show them pictures of the house, too. I was at Louise   s in  Bartlesville one time, and she had a lady that was coming and doing  genealogy stuff, and so she got me started on it. Every place I went,  then, I got information from everybody. I gave all that to Lori. When she  started doing it, then, I gave all my stuff to her.  I thought there was a couple of pictures here that you might find  interesting. My mother   s got this picture back on her wall     This was house number two.  Is the one across the street anything to do with this farm?  No. The little four-room house was before this one. This was the barn  that Granddad Runyan built. It was a big, red, wood barn. This one   s out  here now. These were chicken houses back here, and there was a garage  here. This house had a front porch on it. Dean built a bedroom on back  there. He built on this room and that room. The rest of it is the house.  We   ve changed walls, and that   s about it on the inside. We just changed  rooms and walls. He built that room on and that bedroom back there on.  This is the wash house that we talked about. The separator house is  down here in these trees. We still have this barn. It   s about to go.     .Dr. Bennett. They were members of the meat judging team, nationals.  That   s pretty cool.  Aunt Ila had saved these when Dad Cy died. They wrote such nice  letters from the college and different places because the boys were in  school there then. I just thought those were neat, that somebody might  like that.  37  Finchum  Thomas  Finchum  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Nykolaiszyn  McMillin  Thomas  McMillin  Thomas  They don   t do that much anymore. I guess maybe there   s too many  students. Hargis is around a lot, but I don   t know if he writes letters.  This was Dad Cy at our wedding.  Cy, C-Y?  Yes, Cyrus Calvin was his name, and they called him Cy.  I was just going to show you the other farm. Granddad Runyan   s family  came from Indiana. They had lived somewhere in Kansas, and I think  that   s probably where he met Grandma Runyan because they were from  Pratt. Then Louis Calvin Thomas, he farmed that other place. Cyrus  Calvin Thomas is my grandfather, so that was where he and Mom Ellen  met. That was his dad that farmed that place, so we had two Cys there.  That   s the one that Kent Thomas has. I was just going to show you a  couple of pictures from there. This one is of the house. Now, when you  guys go back, when you go out to Highway 8 and you turn right, it   s a  mile and a quarter     It would be the first   there   s two houses: one across the road and one on  this side, and it   s this one that has all the barns and all.  There   s Bud   s Salvage; the big salvage yard is there. Just past the next  mile line on the right is where this   this was the original house. That   s  where Louis Calvin Thomas staked his claim. They took these cool  pictures.  They   re great.  He   s playing the fiddle. Somebody   s up on the roof. Those are funny.  This is Louis and his kids. There was all the boys and then one girl, so  those are kind of neat. This was another one of them.  That   s Grandpa Thomas.  I think there was eight boys and one girl, I believe, in that family.  Aunt Mary was the only girl.  -------  -------
