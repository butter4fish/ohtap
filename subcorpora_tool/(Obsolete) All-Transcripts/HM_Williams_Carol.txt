Story_ID: 670996
Speaker 1: So, we're gonna start out and I wanna--we were talking about your father [Clarence Williams].  So, I'd like to start out by talking about your father.  And, if you could give his name and what you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father.  My father was a six foot three, handsome, Negro man.  He was born in Bolton, Mississippi in 1899.  He was old when we were born, I guess.  But, he was such a virile, smart, brilliant man.  He was third grade educated, grew up in the South, had a very interesting and difficult, I think, childhood that was typical of African Americans at that time.  He once told me a story which I always intended to write about which was on his right arm, I believe it was, he had a long scar that started at about mid-arm and went up to about, 'bout where his--the front part of his elbow was.  And, we used to ask him about that scar all the time and he'd never tell us what it was.  And, then, I think we were teenagers one time and he told me that he had gotten in a fight while in the South and with--he was working on a railroad, a railroad yard.  And, he was a teenager, very young, I think about thirteen or fourteen years old.  And, the gentleman who ran the whole thing apparently jumped on him or jumped him and he hit the guy with a shovel.  And, while hitting the guy with a shovel, he knocked the guy out.  And, of course the--I don't know if it was--he was put into this jail, and I don't know whether it was the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] or whatever, but he was supposed to be lynched that night.  And, but, everyone knew it and his brothers, of which he had three or four, and a couple of cousins broke him out of the jail.  They waited in the Mississippi and went from house to house until he could ride the train and then he came up to, ride trains and rails, as he call it, and that's how he came to Chicago [Illinois].  And, that scar happened while trying to escape from that jail.
Speaker 1: So, really, we're talking about--
Speaker 2: So, but, my mother [Betty Norment Williams] used to say, and I'd say, "Is that true?"  And, mother said, "Well, that's his lie and he's sticking to it."
Speaker 1: So, do you think it was true?
Speaker 2: I think it was true.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Because that would've been the early like about 1913, 1912, 1913 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was, yeah, it was somewhere in about, between 1912 and 1920.
Story_ID: 670997
Speaker 1: Did he ever share any other stories of his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But, it was very, very difficult because my mother's [Betty Norment Williams] background is totally different.  And, she was very guarded.
Speaker 1: But, can we stay with your father?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he share any other stories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can I hear some of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, he told us stories about the shack like conditions that he lived in.  How he went to school.  How he had to stop school in order to help on his farm.  The kind of work they did on his farm.  He told us about his mule, Doris [ph.], and how he would ride that mule to town, and--
Speaker 1: Her name was Doris?
Speaker 2: Her name was Doris.  And, he told us that--one of my favorite stories was his stories about being chased by a snake.  And, I kept saying, "Snakes don't chase you, dad."  He said, "Yes, they do."  And, he told me about--I don't really remember what kind of snake it was, or maybe he'd never told us.  But, how he was running and the snake was chasing him and he was hitting back at the snake.  And we kept thinking, no.  The snake was scared and you were scared and you both ran in the both, were running in the same directions.  And, he would tell us we were ignorant little kids (laughter).  And, we basically, we did not understand animals and, and so he, he told us just millions of stories about, about that.  One of my favorite stories that my father [Clarence Williams] told us was about--which I'm actually writing about right now--was about Santa birds.  And, when we were small kids he told us that--we lived on the fourth floor of this apartment building and in the wintertime, you know, the snow would come down so pristine at that time, and the sill of our window because the rest of the buildings around were smaller buildings.  And, so, we were the fourth floor high building, and, and the sill of our, the window sills would get these very beautiful pillows like white billows of snow on it.  And, every now and then we would go to the windows and we would see pigeon prints in it.  And, so, we told dad, "Come look at these--there are pigeons landing on our windows."  And, dad told us they were Santa birds and that they were sent by Santa Claus to watch little kids.  And, if we were naughty he would--they--the birds would report back to Santa and we wouldn't get anything for Christmas.  So, we were always on the watch out for these Santa birds (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, your father had a lot of imagination then too, right?
Speaker 2: He was an amazing storyteller.  He would have great wit, great intellect and he enjoyed to no end spending time with us telling us these amazing tales.  And, to the point that when you ask was this story true, or that story true, we didn't know.  But, we loved it.
Story_ID: 670998
Speaker 1: So, did he [Williams' father, Clarence Williams] know much about his family past, his, you know, his parents?
Speaker 2: No.  He did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He knew that his mother was born in slavery.  He knew that he had--she had been married several times, and he had twenty-three brothers and sisters.  A couple of them were Indians [Native American], he knew that.  But, he was not close to them.
Speaker 1: In the area in Mississippi, have you ever been there, that he was from?
Speaker 2: I have been there once because they still retain the land that they were, apparently that she was a slave on.  And, and that land has been passed down in the family.  So, it still exist.  So, I've seen the land.
Speaker 1: So, this, you said, was it Bolton, Miss- ?
Speaker 2: Bolton, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And, that's near where?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Jackson [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Jackson.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe, maybe it's Bolton County [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, could be.
Story_ID: 670999
Speaker 1: Can you tell me then about your, your mother [Betty Norment Williams]?  You were saying that it was a difference.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother was born in Whiteville, Tennessee.  And, that town is, was mostly like what the word is, Whiteville, Tennessee.  She, she was about twenty years younger than my father [Clarence Williams].  And, she told me once that she didn't know how old my father was when she married him.  But, she met him in church and she thought he was just the most handsome guy that she'd ever seen in her life.  My mother had thirteen brothers and sisters.  She was a salutatorian or valedictorian I can't remember, of her high school class.  She was very much a left brain, she was very much a--right brain woman.  And, my father was more, my father was left brain.  And, she, but she was a very, very refined woman.  She loved, you know, if you look deep inside, if you looked at her and the way she decorated and did things, she very much had a Victorian white woman inside of her.  And, she, that's the way she managed her household; very much in that sense.  Everything was lace and extremely feminine.  And, a very strong woman but with a very beautiful, artistic, delicate hand.
Story_ID: 671000
Speaker 1: So, in those thirteen children, where did she [Williams' mother, Betty Norment Williams] fit?
Speaker 2: I think she was either third or fourth.
Speaker 1: Third or fourth, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now, did she share stories like your father [Clarence Williams]?
Speaker 2: Ver- no, she did not.  She--we would ask questions and probe a lot because they did not look, they were not, they did not look Negro.  Her family was not inclined that way.  And, the way in which she would refer, as I grew up, referred to blacks, I realized that she was mixed with something.  I asked her once, did she know her grandmother, and, she said, "No."  And, she had seen her but she really didn't know her.  And, I said, "Why not?"  And, she said, "Well, we only saw her when she would come by the house.  She would not stay.  She would just drop things off and keep going."  And, and, we also found out that she didn't really speak to her grandmother.  They recognized each other, but her grandmother didn't really speak to them when they were out in public and vice a versa.  And, I asked her what her grandmother looked like.  And, she said she just look like a white woman to her.  So, I suspect there was that kind of situation going on and maybe her grandmother either was white or passing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Passing.
Speaker 2: --for white.
Story_ID: 671001
Speaker 1: How would you describe her [Williams' mother, Betty Norment Williams]?  You said that she, you know, you described her as a black woman who had white person living inside, and she liked finer things.  But, how else would you descri- you know, you described her as a left--right brain, right brain person. But h--
Speaker 2: But, she was--the one thing that was quite interesting about her, as I thought it, she was a very, though, she was a very strong woman, very educational oriented, wanted her kids to finish school, wanted to--she was very much afraid.  She had a lot of fear in her.  She was not a confrontational or challenging woman all the time.  She, she always erred on the side of, stay out of the way, rather than stand up and fight this battle.  She would ra- she really was very much about teaching you how to do good, but be invisible.  Don't really show yourself in order that you can be victimized, whatever, by your environment.  So, front and center was not her, way she operated at all.  Although she loved beauty.  And, she insisted on it.  So, it was really a contradiction in many ways because she would dress us in whatever so we would stand out in a crowd but yet she wanted you to melt in the crowd.  She really didn't, she was not a proponent of people getting inside your head or figuring out who you were.  No.  Not at all.  You know, they could see you but you kept your, your personality and what was inside you to yourself.  You did not share that at all.
Story_ID: 671002
Speaker 1: So, what do you think attracted your parents to each other?  Was it that your--your father [Clarence Williams] was so debonair and your mother [Betty Norment Williams]--what attracted, you think, your father to your mother?
Speaker 2: I think my father growing up in Bolton, Mississippi, and was very much attracted to this very fastidious, well dressed, beautiful, little, actually, because she was only 5'1", 5'1", 5'2", woman.  She had this gorgeous long hair and just marvelous eyes.  And, before you got to know her the words in which she emitted from her mouth were very gentle.  She was a very gentle creature.  But, she was very, very refined in those ways.  And, it probably was something that he had not come in contact with much.  And, and she was in church and they were, he told me and she was getting some water and he walked up and he--she was trying to turn on the water fountain to get some water and he turned it on for her.  And, he turned on that water and turned on her life I guess.  And, you know, she looked at--up at him and he looked at her.  And, he was representative of that strong--she loved lean, thin men.  He was long, lanky, and wore his hat ace deuce.  And, maybe it was a little bit of that bad boy that she saw.
Speaker 1: So, now, did they meet at--where did they meet?
Speaker 2: In church.
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Chicago.
Speaker 1: So, how did she come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: She had--she said she wanted to get away from Tennessee.  And, she came up here to visit her two aunts who lived up here.  They were two women who, again, if you met them you would not know they were, they were black.  And, she came up here and stayed with them.  And, they ran a, a house where people came to stay.  I don't know if it was a brothel.  I got a little hint that it might have been a brothel.  But, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I could never get her to say one--and when I push her on it, she'd just shake her head and walk away.  She would never divulge.  But, it was like she, when she got up here, she recognized the environment was something she was not okay with.  And, so, she then got a job in a dye- what they call a dye house.  And, I guess, they dyed goods or something.  And, she--her best friend at the dye house was this white female named Carol Henny [ph.].  And, they were--spent a lot of time together and went around together and it was during this time.  But, when she went to church, she went to I guess this church that was on that time called, I guess it was called South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive].
Speaker 1: It was South Park?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I'm remembering back then it was called South Park, and that's where she met my father.
Story_ID: 671003
Speaker 1: Carol Henny, isn't that your--?
Speaker 2: That's my name.
Speaker 1: So, she [Williams' mother, Betty Norment Williams] named you, she named you after her friend?
Speaker 2: She had named me after my friend--her friend.
Speaker 1: I see. So, they were really good friends.
Speaker 2: They were really good friends.  And, she told me once, because I thought Carol Henny when I was a little girl, I thought Carol Henny was such a dumb name.  And, she played me the ultimate compliment, which of course you don't realize until you get older.  'Cause I asked her one time, "Why would you name me Carol Henny [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams]?"  And, she said, "When, when my friend told me what her name was, I thought it was the most beautiful name I'd ever heard in my life."  And, I heard her say that when she was--when I was young kid.  But, at that time it didn't mean anything to me.  It didn't mean, you know, I had to get up in age and, and relive that before I realized what she was actually saying to me.
Story_ID: 671004
Speaker 1: How many kids in your family?
Speaker 2: There're five of us.
Speaker 1: There're five.  So, who--can you give their names in birth order and where do you fit?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My first is my sister, Betty [Betty Williams Thompson].  Her name is Betty Jane Williams, at the time.  And, then there was, is me, Carol Henny Williams [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams].  Next is Earl Williams.  Earl is deceased now.  And, then there is Gracie Antoinette [Gracie Williams Turner], and Clarence Williams, he's the youngest.
Speaker 1: So, there're three girls and two boys then?
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, how many, how many, what's the difference between? I mean, are there, were you every two to three years, or?
Speaker 2: There is about a year and a half or so between Betty and myself, and my oldest sister.  There was two years between Earl and myself.  And, then there was two to three years between Gracie and Earl.  And, then Clarence was about, it was a--mom [Betty Norment Williams] calls him a change of life baby.  He was about ten years later or something.
Speaker 1: So, so, what, so who are you closest to?
Speaker 2: I was very close to my sister Betty.  We were best friends growing up.  She was my only friend (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, why is that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very shy.  I was very, very shy.  Very--I don't know if I was shy or just totally intimidated.  Didn't know where I, who I was, you know, I had to go--being in school making top grades and the rest of the kids weren't making top grades.  And, they would call me stupid all the time. (Laughter) I didn't know whether I was stupid or not.  It was just very difficult environment at that point.
Story_ID: 671005
Speaker 1: So, what is your earliest memory growing up, of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have memories all the way back probably, well, maybe 'til I was about two years old, whatever.
Speaker 1: Can you share some of what you think is the earliest?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember how absolutely loving and warm our household was.  How my mother [Betty Norment Williams] seemed to always be in the kitchen cooking something.  And, it was always the issue of my not eating.  So, it was always a subject of conversation.  My position was I didn't like her--I didn't like the way she cooked (laughter).  Her position was, I just didn't like food.  And, so, if it wasn't sweet, I wasn't eating it.  And, so there was always issues there.  My father [Clarence Williams]--we lived in a building, it was 821 East 41st Street [Chicago, Illinois] in the rear, and I just remember my father would come home every evening and he'd always bring us something.  And, we would sit around the table and my mother would read to us or my father would tell us stories.  And, that's what I remember about my childhood.
Story_ID: 671006
Speaker 1: So, you, do you remember the block that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe that block and?
Speaker 2: That block was at 821 East 41st Street [Chicago, Illinois].  It was a short street that was between Drexel [Boulevard] and Cottage Grove [Avenue].  On Drexel was a beautiful park, lined street with these magni- what I concerned magnificent walk up brick and old stone dwellings.  It was divided by this beautiful little park that was with, that took you from about 39th Street all the way down to Drexel Square.  The park was divided, the traffic that went north from the traffic that went--that was driven south.  It was always quiet, beautiful, full of trees, all kinds of fountains, and just marvelous birds.  And, behind us was this, what we called the "L" track [elevated train] at that time.  So, and the "L" station ended up near Oakenwald [Avenue], which is right near the lake [Lake Michigan].  And, and we would catch the "L," when my mother [Betty Norment Williams] would take up downtown, right behind our building.  On the other side of us was Cottage Grove which was a very, very, very busy street.  At that time, it still had, when I was little kid about two, three years old, it still had streetcars and streetcar lines coming up and down them.  And, then Cottage Grove was just lined with lots of storefront places that went from cleaners to ice cream parlors to stores and then, constantly.  So, you could walk out on, at that time, on Cottage Grove and walk for blocks and blocks and it just be store after store after store; very busy.
Speaker 1: So, you know, you gave me, we like to ask sights, smells, and sounds.  So, you gave me some wonderful sights.
Story_ID: 671007
Speaker 1: So sounds?
Speaker 2: It is very interesting when I think about it because (pause) I know that butterflies do not make sounds.  But, there is a vibration that you hear a little kind of hum of them visiting the extreme wildflower areas that line the, the "L" track [elevated train].  And, also an area next to us that had--where tall weeds and wildflowers grew and it was always visited by millions of butterflies, just, they would be all over the place.  And, in that little area that's what we would hear.  We would only hear the sounds of the insect as we--when I was small.  As we grew older, we would hear other sounds of children playing or whatever.  But, in very young years, it was just very serene.  One would have to leave that environment and walk out towards Cottage Grove [Cottage Grove Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], and then you would hear the hustle and bustle of the traffic.  You would, you know, later years you could smell the tar from where they covered the, the streetcar tracks and that kind of stuff.  When you move toward Drexel [Boulevard], Drexel was very serene at that time.  And, the smells, you would only smell the, the dress of the, let me say of the trees.  It was, it was a whole separate kind of world.  So, it was very interesting.  You could go from walking to Cottage to Drexel you were in two different kinds of worlds.  Drexel was very nature oriented at that time, very much peaceful, you know.  That's where the ladybugs lived and caterpillars and butterflies and the birds.  And, you never saw those things on Cottage Grove.  Cottage Grove was filled with a whole 'nother kind of animal which prowled up and down the street.
Speaker 1: So, with, with, so, the house you lived in, what was the house like?
Speaker 2: It was not a house, it was--
Speaker 1: An apartment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) apartment building.  It was a four story apartment building.  And, there were four apartments on each floor.  And, each apartment was--we lived in the largest apartment that was--and the apartments up under us were the largest apartments.
Speaker 1: So, it was a kitchenette?  Were the apartments kitchenettes?
Speaker 2: No.  They weren't.  They were all full apartments.
Speaker 1: Oh, they were all full apartments.  Okay.  Okay.  So, did you fam--
Speaker 2: Well, the two that I went in, the one's that I ever went in were full apartments.  I can't say that they were all--that there wasn't a kitchenette there.  One of the apartments that's in the rear could've been one.  But, we never, I never visited those apartments so I never knew what was in there.  My mother [Betty Norment Williams] was very strict.  We were never allowed to go in anyone's house period.  The only place we ever went was with her into our relatives who lived farther out south or whatever.  But, in terms of visiting or going inside someone's house in that environment that we lived in, we were not allowed to do that.
Story_ID: 671008
Speaker 1: So, who were you--what was family life like then?  And, and I'm also wondering what you're like, you know, too, as a young person, 'cause you said you were incredibly, you said shy, right?  Or, not shy are you--
Speaker 2: I don't know if I was shy.  I didn't talk.
Speaker 1: And, why was that?  You didn't find--?
Speaker 2: I wasn't comfortable with it I suppose.  I never thought it much but I was a very quiet kid when I was in, in--very cerebral, I think.
Speaker 1: So, that meant you lived inside your head, right?
Speaker 2: Lived inside my head.  I was more of an observer than a participant.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I watched a lot.
Speaker 1: So, what were you thinking?
Speaker 2: I, I remember thinking a lot trying to figure out who these people were.  How they thought.  Why they thought.  Why they reacted to me the way they did.  They were not--they were very much friendly with each other and had good relationships when I was young kid.  I was unable to establish that kind of relationship with any single person.
Speaker 1: I see.  So, was that from the time that you can remember?  That you weren't able to?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but, you were close with Betty [Betty Williams Thompson] though?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is Betty like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did she take you under your wing--her wing?
Speaker 2: No.  Betty--my oldest sister had great appreciation and love for me.  She always mentored me from an intellectual point of view.  But, her gregariousness, her ability to make friends and whatever, it was not a formulaic thing.  I was just quiet and withdrawn, and she was okay with that.  She never addressed it.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have a nickname for you?
Speaker 2: Betty just called me Cal Henny [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams].
Speaker 1: Cal.  So, instead to Carol, Cal?
Speaker 2: Instead of Carol, Cal Henny.
Speaker 1: Cal Henny.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 671009
Speaker 1: So, can you share some--I just wanna understand family life, you know, I, I get the--you know, I know our mother's [Betty Norment Williams] strict but are there chores?  You know, what, what is happening in the household and, and it, and I'm asking the household because you didn't have a lot of contact with outside people.  Or, did--but, you--
Speaker 2: No.  We did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was very protective and really was very serious about outside people not having influence upon us beyond what she imagined was important.  And, I think that may have had a lot to do with her fear, could have.   She didn't trust people.  I'm not sure.  But, she was definitely very, very reserved when it came to us being exposed to anything that was beyond her control.  But, family life was--she was very rigid about how you dress, how you went to school, what the path you followed, and what time you get back home.  And, if you weren't inside that door--school let out at 3:15, she gave you fifteen minutes to get home.  If you weren't inside that house in fifteen minutes, she was outside looking for you.
Story_ID: 671010
Speaker 1: And, this, the period that you're talking about, how old are you at this point?
Speaker 2: I started school when I was about four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Initially, I went to Oakenwald [Oakenwald School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oakenwald?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, then, so, you went there for how long?  How many years?
Speaker 2: I went to Oakenwald for about three or four years.  I loved it.  It was beautiful.  I used to stand outside on the play yard and look over at the lake [Lake Michigan] and it was very, very diverse.  They had these incredible program that you had.  It's very learned program and involvement in--and, they gave us chocolate milk in the afternoon.  And, I just thought that was the greatest thing in the world (laughter).  And, then one day one of the teachers, a white female--'cause most of the school was white, it was just very few of us black kids there--called three of us up, it was three black kids in the classroom.  And, all the black kids lived on the west side of Drexel [Boulevard].  Drexel was mostly white and Asian and whatever at that time.  And, Oakenwald was, I mean east, and Oakenwald of course, was far east, right there on the lake.  And, she called us up and the school principal at that point--what was his name, was his name, was that Vandenburg [ph.]? I'm not sure.  But, at that point she called us up, I think I was in second grade, but you know, I had started school when I was four, so I was young.  And, she called us up and she gave us these pink slips and she told us we were going to another school.  And, I was very, very disappointed I remember.  And, I got home and I asked my mother [Betty Norment Williams], why did I have to go to a different school?  Because I loved Oakenwald.  I got up every morning at five o'clock in the morning, ironed my father's shirts because he went--he had to go to work early in the morning 'cause he worked at International Harvester [International Harvester Company; Navistar International Corporation], which was way on the North Side or West Side or something.  And, he'd catch the bus out on Cottage Grove [Avenue], right on 41st [Street].  And, my mother taught me to iron, and my father [Clarence Williams] really loved me to iron his shirts.  My mother thought I was the best ironer even when I was like four or five years old.  And, I just take my books and run to school.  And, she told me we had to, I had to go to a different school because they had changed the district.  And, I didn't know what that meant.  So, I said, "What do you mean they changed the district?"  She said, "Well, they changed the boundary lines."  And, I said, "Why?"  She said, "Because they don't want you Negro kids going to that school.  They don't--they're putting all the Negro kids out of the school."  And, of course, that was--I can feel that pain today.  And, I didn't know I was a Negro.

Speaker 1: Now, you said, you were five or six (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was about five or six years old.
Speaker 1: So, this was like 1950, '51 [1951], right?
Speaker 2: I was about six years old, yeah. I was about six years old in '51 [1951].  And, so, I began asking, what was that?  Why?  It was the point where her inoculation was no long viable.  That the world poured in on us and we found out that we were different.  And, that we were not held in esteem the way the other kids were.  And, all of the black kids then got shipped off to schools like Oakland [Oakland School, Chicago, Illinois], which was on 40th [Street] near Lincoln library [Abraham Lincoln Center, Chicago, Illinois].  And, and then some of those kids instead of going to Oakland, they went to Holy Angels [Holy Angels Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois].  But, we weren't Catholic so my mother [Betty Norment Williams] wouldn't let us go to Holy Angels though I asked to go.  And, she said no.  And, so, we went over to Oakland and we were sitting two in a seat in the classroom.  And, the desks were old and they had been scraped up by people writing their names on 'em.  So, when you put a piece of paper on the desk you would tear the paper because you would, your pencil would go, it would rip into the paper because of the grooves that were in the desk below it.  They had a coat room instead of lockers.  There was no chocolate milk in the afternoon, and there was a bunch of angry little kids because they had to sit two in a seat.  So, if you had to sit next to the wrong person they'd bump your butt and knock you on the floor two or three times during the day.
Speaker 1: So, that's when you realized you were different then?
Speaker 2: That's when I realized that I--that's when I started asking questions and began to realize, you know, there's a point most people don't realize that the child becomes aware that they're black.  That was the point I found out that I was black.  And, I would go after school sometime and, or when my mother would send me to the store and here's this six year old child walking out on Drexel [Boulevard] standing near--staring at the street trying to figure out how they changed the district.  And, why I couldn't go to the school I loved anymore.  And, I'd watch all these white, white and Asian kids happily skipping around up and down the trees and the birds, going home from school.  And, then I go back on Cottage Grove [Avenue] and there was two or three fights, and people breaking up fights, and people yelling and screaming and stuff.  It was, it was an amazing time in my life.
Story_ID: 671012
Speaker 1: You know, we, we all have sometimes those periods, sort of awakening.  So, that period of six years old was awakening. Now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you went--what was the school you went to you said?
Speaker 2: Oakland [Oakland School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: It was Oakland.  Okay.  So, you went to Oakland too, okay (mumbles). Okay.  So, at Oakland are the, are the teachers blacks or are they white?
Speaker 2: No, mostly, at Oakland most of the teachers were black.  There were a couple of white ones but most of them were black.  And, the principal was black.
Speaker 1: So, how was the student body?
Speaker 2: The students were--there were quite a few students that were very committed to education.  But, most of the kids--it was a diverse amount of black students.  All--the school, as I can remember was 100 percent black, and most of the students came from Ida B. Wells area [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  They all knew each other and they all talked to each other.  And, when we would get out, when we would get out of school most of them would go south--north toward their home.  And, once again, I was alone in my mind because I was the only one coming across Cottage Grove [Avenue] moving towards Drexel [Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there, was it, so is Betty [Williams' sister, Betty Williams Thompson], she's going at the school at the same time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was, she got transferred to the school too.
Speaker 1: So, she's navigating better than you, though?
Speaker 2: Oh, she's, she's much better than I am (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Because there were, there were two other black girls, young girls.  One who lived on the third floor below us and another one who lived in the building in front of us who had been to Oakenwald [Oakenwald School, Chicago, Illinois], who had transferred over to Oakland.  So, they were all in her class.  The, the two blacks that were in the class with me, both of them went to Holy Angels [Holy Angels Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois].  So, I was transferred actually out of my class, alone.
Speaker 1: Now, what subjects are your gravitating to at this point?
Speaker 2: I think I was gravitating towards English.  But, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they treated--the emphasis at that time at Oakland, as I can remember, it was, it was really on math.  In Oakenwald, it was pretty much on reading.  But, there was a lot of math going on at, at, at Oakland.
Story_ID: 671013
Speaker 1: Now, how--what is church playing in--how is church playing a role in your life?  Is it, is it every--are you guys going every Saturday? Is it Baptist church? Is your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's a, was an African Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, the name of it?
Speaker 2: Grant Memorial African Methodist Church [Grant Memorial A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: It's still there.
Speaker 2: It's still there.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, so, tell me what the church life was like.
Speaker 2: The church life was a beautiful life.  It's very interesting because my mother [Betty Norment Williams] never went to church.  Neither did my father [Clarence Williams].  But, they walked us to the church and they put us in Sunday school.  And, after Sunday school we would have to go to church.  And, so, it was a ritual.  And, so, every Sunday we would go to Sunday school and then we'd go down to Smitty's [ph.] after Sunday school and get a malt, and then we'd come back and we'd go to church.  And, as we grew up, we joined the choir, and the usher board, and all the girls and boys conference, and we got church mothers and fathers.  And, we started going to church on Thursday for choir rehearsal and on Tuesdays for usher rehearsal.  So, our life became life of church events.
Speaker 1: And, that happened even though your, your parents were not practicing religion?
Speaker 2: My parents were--did not go to church with us.  They stayed home all the time.  But, they made sure we went to church.  I would ask my mother why she didn't go to church with us and she'd say because she didn't have any shoes to wear.  (Laughter) That's what, that's what she would say.  And, I asked my father why he didn't wanna to go to church, and because he say he went to church all his life and he wasn't going to church when he was getting old.  We needed church, he didn't need it.  His church was inside of him, so.  That was fine with us.
Story_ID: 671014
Speaker 1: So, you were at, so you're at Oakland [Oakland School, Chicago, Illinois] for how--'til what age? To sixth grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, no. I was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, does it go up to eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Oakland went up to eighth grade.  But, I graduated from Oakland, from Oakland when I was in the seventh grade.  They just graduated me out of the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, were you put ahead at what grade?
Speaker 2: I was put ahead.
Speaker 1: What grade?
Speaker 2: Seventh.  I went from seventh to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, so, the seventh to high school.  So, what high school do you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Hyde Park [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Hyde Park, okay.  This now, so the Hyde Park that you went to is different than the Hyde Park that is there now, right?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, we're talking, let's see 1951, so, you're, we're in the late '50s [1950s], '50 [1950] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.  And, so, describe--I wanna have you describe yourself at that point because, you know, your earlier description is someone who is little, I would say, you know, not--a little fragile in some respects, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So, how have, how have you sort of morphed and grown?  Because, you know, Betty [Williams' sister, Betty Williams Thompson] is very much your supporter.
Speaker 2: Well, Betty had gone to Hyde, Betty had gone to Hyde Park.  And, at that point, I went to Hyde Park.  And, Betty was there and I had another cousin that was there that had moved to Chicago [Illinois] named Geraldine [ph.] who was my mother's sister [sic.]--and, she was at Hyde Park.  And, I went to Hyde Park and I think that I was, I was still very much withdrawn.  And, didn't really involve myself a whole lot with the kids there.  I was very much still observing.  They were older.  I was just twelve years old, and, and I was nearsighted.  It was very difficult for me (laughter).  I considered myself a very unattractive little kid.  I was very, very thin.  These kids were, what I called very well dressed, came out of robust households which were in the Hyde Park area [Chicago, Illinois].  So, they lived in homes and houses and what have you, and that was about the time I became conscious that I lived in an apartment building.  And, I lived in an apartment building that was not considered the best environment and the environment was changing.
Speaker 1: What was it changing?
Speaker 2: Well, it had ceased to be that wonderful little nature reserve that I had enjoyed as a child.  All of a sudden the very diverse environment that I experienced as a young child was disappearing.  The environment was becoming a hundred percent black, which was fine.  But, it was a different kind of personality.  It wasn't families any longer.  It was a lot of women with children.  Their children weren't from a single father.  They were from multiple fathers, which my mother [Betty Norment Williams] had a huge problem with.  That was a struggle.  And, and the fathers weren't in the home.  We were--it took me a long time to consider--realize that we were considered, as broke and poor as we were, we were rich because we had a mother and a father in the home; dedicated.  Didn't understand that.  Did not understand how we were regarded.  But, we were looked at, I just thought we were looked at that way because we were bookish.  But, it was the whole scene.  It was very, very interesting I think so now that I retrospect on it for other people.  Sometimes we, you know, we get challenged because we were considered, what was the word they used to refer to us, sidity or whatever, and--
Speaker 1: So, they said that about you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Story_ID: 671015
Speaker 1: So, you don't have much social life in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Not initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then what happened?
Speaker 2: I think what happened is, is, as I can remember, is that some boy invited me out (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, he invited you out.  Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Marvin.
Speaker 1: And, he--and what grade are you in?
Speaker 2: I'm in--no, no, no, his name was Kenneth [ph.].
Speaker 1: And, what grade are you in?
Speaker 2: I'm a sophomore.
Speaker 1: Sophomore, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I'm a sophomore.  And, he invited me to his prom (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was he older?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was graduating from Tilden High School [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that, that, so what happened after that then?
Speaker 2: Right.  He was a really, really wonderful, really smart guy.  He was friends with a guy who lived in the building we lived in who also went to Tilden.  And, he had a car.  He had this beautiful white and blue car and he gave us a ride.  We were coming home from school one day, and he gave us a ride home.  And, and so, my mother [Betty Norment Williams] got to know him and my father [Clarence Williams].  And, he was very, he was very likeable and fun guy.  And, so, my mother said that he could come to the house.  And, he would come over to the house and he would sit there a couple hours and talk to us and we had fun.  And, we'd go to the zoo, and we'd go to Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] and listen to the orchestra there.  And, but, he was always very respectful and followed my mother's and father's wishes.
Speaker 1: So, did you start dating after that?
Speaker 2: No, she wouldn't let me date.  Whenever he would take us somewhere, my sister [Betty Williams Thompson] would always be there and, you know, it's always a group of us.  He could never, we could never go anywhere by ourselves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I think when I, the first date I actually had is when he took me to his prom.  And, I think I was a junior at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were a junior.  So, that's like, isn't that 1958 then, at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now, you graduate--
Speaker 2: No, I was a junior.  That was--
Speaker 1: Oh, wait.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960] or '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], '61 [1961].  Okay.  That's--okay, okay.
Story_ID: 671016
Speaker 1: So, I had this teacher who--named Mr. Oliver [ph.] who was--I loved him, he was a great chemistry teacher.  And, so, I got, I became all fascinated with biology and chemistry.  And, despite my inwardness, I really did love people and always had, always wanted to heal.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. So, were you thinking, so, what did you, what attracted you, what attracted you--?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, what, what about biology attracted you?
Speaker 1: I think I've always been fascinated with what this is.  What is this?  What is this life?  What is this, what is this life?  What are we here for?  What are we supposed to be doing?  Why does this world exist?  And, what is all that stuff out there?  And, don't tell me it's infinity.  What the hell does that mean?  Why is everything in space round?  Why does it--and when it ends something must end it and what's beyond that?  I need to understand what's going on.  And, the average person when you start talking to them about what this is all about, they look at you like you're crazy.  And, so, I needed to move more in a circle that I could get answers to the questions I had.  Because I was involved in a circle of people, and I don't wanna say they didn't think, but they didn't think about the things I thought about.  They didn't--come on guys, let's get these brains thinking here.  I need to understand what, what life is.  I'm sorry, I'm not one of these people that just take it for granted.  I need to know where I--why I am here.  And, I need to understand where I was before I got here.  And, where I'm going after I leave here.  There was questions that have been basically not answered for a million years that has to do with how much control do I actually have?  Why can I access my past and not access my future?  How much can I control my life?  What is it that I'm supposed to be doing?
Story_ID: 671017
Speaker 1: So how di- how is it decided that you're going to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] though?  How does that happen?  'Cause we're in 1962, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So, you graduate from 19--in 1962?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in 1962.
Speaker 1: So, how is it decided that you're going to Northwestern?
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated from high school, I went to college but I--immediately, but I went to the University of Illinois at Navy Pier [Chicago Undergraduate Division; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but, I was--
Speaker 1: There were a lot of--that's where blacks were going sometime--
Speaker 2: That's where blacks were going.
Speaker 1: --at the Navy Pier.  Either that or Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Everybody was going there, and so, I followed Betty [Williams' sister, Betty Williams Thompson] to Navy Pier.  But, when I got into Navy Pier although it was an excellent school I realized that, it wasn't my school, it was Betty's school.  And, that's when I realized that I had to try to start finding out who I was and what I wanted to do.  So, then I went--decided that I would try Illinois Institute of Technology [Chicago, Illinois].  So, I transferred from the University of Illinois at Navy Pier into Illinois Institute of Technology.  And, I went there for another year.  Had a wonderful experience.  And, my experience there was I met a lot of African people that I had never met before.  And, these people from Biafra [Nigeria] at that time and what have you.  And, god only--
Speaker 1: Did you say Biafra?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Biafra at that time.  And, what an incredible education I got just really hanging around with Africans.  And, getting another perspective on the world.  Illinois Institute of Technology was just, had more Africans going to it at that time than anywhere, I guess, that I knew about.  And, it's not like I went there with that purpose.  I just went there trying to find Carol [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams] and trying to find out what I wanted to do.  And, I had the ability to get into these schools so I did it.  And, and I became immersed in the African culture.  And, really the education there was to understand better who I--where I come from; who they were; what the similarities and difference was; how incredibly blessed they felt that we as American blacks were; and, that slavery was a price we paid to be in this country and we weren't taking advantage of it.  And, that they came here to achieve the education that were made available to us.  And, that even though we were slaves as we left Africa, we came back as giants.  But, most of us did not understand that giantism, and how much we had been blessed and was in God's graces.  That was an amazing experience for me.  And, to be able to study Africa through--and its cultures through the eyes of those Africans that went to Illinois Institute was more important to my growth and even my visiting the continent at that time, which I later did.
Story_ID: 671018
Speaker 1: You then--so what happens next?  So, you--what are you majoring in there and what did you major in, in--?
Speaker 2: I think I was majoring in biology there, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, in bi- so, how did Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] come about though?
Speaker 2: Well, I soon found--realized that my stint at Illinois Institute [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] was basically that it--I didn't enjoy its curriculum or didn't find much there that I could take advantage of.  Although, it's an incredible school and had incredible curriculums, I, I wasn't feeling like I was finding Carol [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams].  And, being a spiritual person I felt like what I'd come there for had been accomplished which was to create more awareness of self.  And, it was done through my association with these great deal of Africans that had come from other countries.  And, I began dating a few of them and became best friends with some of the women.  And, it was, I had a wonderful, wonderful education there, if you will.  And, then from that I had gotten a job being a--at the same time because I was broke poor.  But, I was, you know, very much into the hippie cultures as were the Africans.  We were all broke and poor and wore sandals in the wintertime, and (laughter), and it was okay.  Then I decided that I needed to put some shoes on my feet.  I really couldn't deal with the sandals in the wintertime.  So, I had interviewed and gotten a job at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] as an editor and--in its catalog.  And, I met, and there was a black copywriter at Sears named [HistoryMaker] Barbara Samuels.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, Barbara and I became friends and I began, I displayed an interest in copywriting.  And, I began going to night school at Northwestern.  And, I--it might have been because Barbara had gone or done a stint there.  But, I didn't wanna go back to school full-time at that point.  So, I went and took some classes in the evening, and I began, and began writing.
Speaker 1: And, so, when you, when you, so, you and Barbara get together at that point?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, she's--that's--she's young in her career at Sears though at that point?
Speaker 2: She's young in her career at Sears.  I was, she was older than I wa- am, but, she was young, you know, because she was a young copywriter.  Never seen or had heard of a black copywriter before that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 671019
Speaker 1: Now, at this point, are you, are you hearing of people like Vince Cullers?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Barbara Samuels told me about Vince Cullers and she told me about Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor].  And, then through her network I began recognizing who they were and what they were doing, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so what--because this is sort of--we have to also describe Chicago [Illinois] at this point too, right?  There's want--sort of going on.  It's the middle of the '60s [1960s].  You've got a lot of black people here, you know, a lot of activity, Black Arts Movement, you know, happening.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so, what did you--did you meet Barbara Proctor around this time?
Speaker 2: I met Barbara Proctor when I, after I started work for Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.].
Speaker 1: So, how did you get on with Leo Burnett?
Speaker 2: I--Leo Burnett was a fabulous experience.
Speaker 1: But, how did you get there?  How did you find out about it?
Speaker 2: Well, two things came together in God's great graces simultaneously.  I was at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and my major was, I was in, I was pursuing at that time, had continued to pursue and grew in the whole idea that I was going to become a medical doctor.  And, so, I was taking a lot of hygiene and biochem [biochemistry] courses and that kind of thing.  And, at the same time, I had been told about the American Association of Advertising Agencies, and they had a course for minorities.  I was writing in this little workshop that was over at Northwestern.  And, there was a gentleman that came to one of the workshops and he saw some writing I did and he came up afterwards and began talking to me.  And, I found out he was in advertising.  And, I began expressing an interest in advertising and he told me about this American Association of Advertising Agencies class.  And, so, along with what I was doing with Northwestern, and everything, I petitioned to be involved in this class.  Which I believe was led by Bill Sharp and, and it happened once a week, and it was a writing class.  And, so, I attended the writing class and afterwards they then set up interviews for you, for one at the various advertising agencies.  And, at that time I interviewed.  I guess, I didn't really think it was going to happen but to follow the process through for what it was based for, I interviewed at Post, Keyes and Gardner [Post Keyes Gardner, Inc.], J. Walter Thompson, and Leo Burnett.  And, it was a gentlemen at Leo Burnett that I interviewed with name Jim Gilmore.  All three were very impressed with my book and that kind of stuff.  But, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had a portfolio?
Speaker 2: I had developed a portfolio through the class.
Speaker 1: Out of that class?
Speaker 2: And, they were very impressed with my book.  But, I doubt very seriously whether they were impressed with my interview (laughter).  And, it, a matter of fact, Jim later told me so.  He said I was the quietest little thing, but, but the creativity was very evident.  And, so, they offered me a job.  And, giving that I had, I was gonna continue to go to school--'cause they knew I was going to school or whatever--I thought it was about time that I earn a little money because I was broke.  And, I was having a lot of fun being a hippie which I wasn't (laughter), I guess.  But, it suited the purposes at the time.  And, so, I accepted the position and began my career at Leo Burnett.  The career at Leo Burnett was incredible.
Story_ID: 671020
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] at that time.  Where were they located?  Where was the office located (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were in Prudential building [One Prudential Plaza, Chicago, Illinois].  They were in the Prudential building at that time.
Speaker 1: And, who was in--who was president of the company?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Leo Burnett was still in charge of the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think there was a gentlemen named Jack Kopp [C.R. "Jack" Kopp] that was along with him and Gene Kolkey [Eugene Kolkey] was like the chief creative officer or something like that, or chief marketing officer, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, at this time who are their clients?
Speaker 2: They had United Airlines, Green Giant [Green Giant Company], Pillsbury [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota], Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], they were the creme de la creme, number one.  You worked at Burnett, number one.  You worked at Burnett, you were instantly coined a genius.
Speaker 1: So, now, is Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] here at that point?  Or, has he been there, or was he--?
Speaker 2: Tom Burrell, he was not at Leo Burnett.  I don't that, I don't know if Tom was ever at Leo Burnett.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He might have been but--
Speaker 1: He was.  He wasn't there at that point.
Speaker 2: He wasn't there at that point.  He was at, I think Tom, when I met Tom, Tom was at Needham [Needham, Harper and Steers; DDB Worldwide Communications Group Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, okay.  So, you, so how many, how many black people were there?  I mean, how large an organization is it as it is, and in the creative you have to start at the bottom anyway, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Burnett was, as I can remember, the largest advertising agency in Chicago [Illinois] at that time, I believe, if not J. Walter [J. Walter Thompson].  I think it was Burnett.  And, it was the largest advertising agency probably in the world, I think.
Story_ID: 671021
Speaker 1: So, you go there [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] and you start out in what area in the copier?
Speaker 2: As a copywriter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is the trick to being a good copywriter?
Speaker 2: Writing good copy (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, how are assignments doled out?
Speaker 2: Well, you receive assignments from, as a copywriter from your copy sup [supervisor], probably coming down from, you know, your creative director or whatever.  You're not involved a lot with the entire campaign.  But, initially, I was assigned, I think my first assignment was Pillsbury [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  I was assigned Pillsbury, and I was assigned writing--ooh. Writing a commercial for, a television commercial for, it actually was a television commercial for bis- utilization of biscuits during the Christmas holidays.
Speaker 1: So, what was the assignment then?  You had to--?
Speaker 2: That assignment was--okay, that assignment was to convince, to convince consumers to make cookies during the Christmas holidays from this cookie dough pack which Pillsbury had put out.  And, it was a special Christmas pack.  And, they could cut and make these little, and I think it got the little cut out things along with the pack.  And, you could just cut out the dough pieces and cut your little cookies out and sprinkle it with the little decorations.  And, you had Christmas cookies.

Speaker 1: Now, I'm--how long did you end up staying at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.]?  I just wanna have some context with that.
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) I was at Leo Burnett about ten years.
Speaker 1: Ten years.  Okay.  And, you started there in what year?
Speaker 2: I started in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].  So, you were there from '69 [1969] to '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is--I want you to describe the organization you're coming into, because are there other black people there?
Speaker 2: There were a few, there were quite a few other black people there.  There was Don Richards [HistoryMaker Donald C. Richards] who was an account guy.  And, there were two other account guys that were there.  I think one's name was Ron Samuelson [ph.], and the other one's name was, I can't remember his name right now.  He was married to Jesse Owens' daughter [HistoryMaker Marlene Owens Rankin].
Speaker 1: Oh, [HistoryMaker] Stuart Rankin.
Speaker 2: Stuart Rankin.  How can I forget Stuart Rankin?  I thought Stuart was one of the most handsome men I'd ever seen in my life.  And, Stuart Rankin was there, and Ron Samuelson was there, and Don Richardson.  They were all on the account side.  And, then there were several creators.
Speaker 1: Who were the creators?
Speaker 2: The creators were, one's name was, last name was Watson [ph.].  There was Barbara Mahone.  Sharon [ph.], I can't remember Sharon's last name.  There was a woman named Norise Roberts [ph.].  A couple other ones.  I can't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --remember their names.
Speaker 1: So, you, so, it felt--did it fell--but these were times when blacks were just getting into major white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were just coming into these major white agencies.  And, most of these people--well, who I named had come into those agencies through this basic ad class.  Now, the gen- the men I mentioned who--
Speaker 1: To the ad class that we were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We were talking about?
Speaker 2: Now, I don't think Stuart Rankin or Samuelson, or Samuels, if that was his name, or Don Richard had come in through that way.  But, they had come in, you know--most of the blacks, most of the creatives, which may have been about eight of them or so, had come in through the basic ad class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is the culture like that you come into?  Is it a dog eat dog or is it exciting, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  It was exciting and, and just absolutely busy, involved with a huge diversity of people from every aspect of life.  And, it was hustle bustle, and getting your work done, and people were in love and falling out of love and, you know, it was, it was--everything 'Mad Men' depicts (laughter).
Story_ID: 671023
Speaker 1: And, so, what would you say--so, it was during that time that you, I mean, you were already saying you were assigned to the Pillb- Pillsbury account [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  So, talk about your, your progress within, you know, on that account?  And, then what accounts happened after that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was working on several accounts initially.  I was working on Kentucky Fried Chicken [KFC Corporation].  I was working on Pillsbury, and I had--I was able to get campaigns done on all of them.  The big thing that initially happened is I think when I first went into Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] there was an assignment--I was--there was an assignment given.  It was interesting because all of us that had come in late were sitting on the twelfth floor.  So, a lot of the blacks were on the twelfth floor, and I was one of them.  And, all my group that I worked with was on the thirteenth floor.  And, I would go upstairs and hang around on the thirteenth floor and then I'd come back down, work on what I had to work on.  And, they were all working on an assignment that had been given--there had been a decrease in the consumption of biscuits in the South, for people eating biscuits where most of the biscuits were consumed, in the South.  And, they wanted to put an initiative on the air to encourage people to eat more biscuits.  And, they wanted to do this through a Pillsbury line of biscuits called Pillsbury's Best.  It was in a blue wrapper and all that kind of stuff.  And, so, every time I would come upstairs, they were working on, you know, the account, people and the copywriters and stuff.  And, I would walk in the room and it was all, it was all white people in the room.  And, you know, they, they were all very kind and nice to me, but they wouldn't say anything.  And I, I didn't say anything to them and, and I would just listen and they would talk about and present stuff that they had come up with.  And, Jim Gilmore who was the supervisor on the business was not receptive to a lot of stuff that was being given to them.  So, I went back downstairs and thought about the assignment and, and I wrote this campaign line that's: nothing's quite as good as biscuits in the morning.  It's Pillsbury's Best time of day.  And, I took it upstairs and gave it to Gilmore.  And, Gilmore stared at it (laughter), and then he turned and looked at me, and then he looked back down at it, and he said, "You wrote this?"  And, I said, "Yes."  And, he nodded his head.  And, then he called in the art director, named Jim Mackey, and said, "I wanna take this concept and lay it out in a commercial."  And, that was the beginning of it.  And, all of a sudden they began calling me upstairs rather than my wandering upstairs.  And, they began giving me other assignments, and then they came and told me that that commercial which I had helped write a line for was being produced, and he was going to send me on the production.  Not to run the production, but to begin learning.  And, that became my first time I'd gone on a production to see a commercial actually produced.  And, then they gave me other assignments.  And, all of a sudden my work began to move, and then they moved me upstairs with them.
Speaker 1: And, so, what, what period of time are we talking about?
Speaker 2: That all happened in maybe about a five month period.
Speaker 1: A five month period.  That was pretty amazing, right?
Speaker 2: That was pretty amazing.
Speaker 1: So, what are the other people saying, the other black people saying?  Or, the other women saying?
Speaker 2: They got very quiet and they only stared (laughter).  They wouldn't say much.
Story_ID: 671024
Speaker 1: And, what are you learning during this period though?  What are you--because I mean, the creative in those environments, the creative is, is critical.  Now, what is Jim's [Jim Gilmore] position?  Who--?
Speaker 2: Jim was associate creative director.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, who was his boss?
Speaker 2: His boss was Rudy Perz [Rudolph Perz]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was the creative director.
Speaker 1: And, so, Rudy had, so, how was Rudy viewed in the industry?
Speaker 2: Rudy, Rudy was huge.  Rudy created the doughboy [Pillsbury Doughboy].  He was--he is a brilliant man.  He's still alive.  I talk to him every now and then.  And, Rudy was one of the men.  You know, they were a coup- few men at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] like Bob Noel at that time who was considered a genius.  He had created the Green Giant.  Rudy Perz, genius; created the doughboy.  Dick Standwood [Richard Stanwood] who was up on top of United Airlines, I think it was, "Fly the friendly skies of United."  And, there was Pat Martin who had created, "You've come a long way baby," for Virginia Slims.  And, Peter Horst who had created Morris the Cat.  And, all of these men were there at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.].  And, at one point or another, I worked for all of 'em, including Gene Kolkey [Eugene Kolkey], who, Gene Kolkey was, I don't necessarily pull out anything specific Gene created but he was involved in all of this stuff. And, and so these men were created, you know, they were the advertising industry.  They were the brilliant.  They were everything. And they taught me advertising.  I learned from them.
Speaker 1: So, what did you learn?
Speaker 2: That, that creativity is an absolute brilliant form of intelligence.  That intelligence--that imagination is even more important than most people think that intelligence is.  And, that, that you really have to understand it and embrace it and be focused with it, get your joy from it, and, and you can create anything you want.
Story_ID: 671025
Speaker 1: You're here at--you know when we broke, you were talking about the accounts, you know, and, you know, how it even came about that you started to move up the floors.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because that's a big thing in advertising, right?
Speaker 2: It's a huge thing in advertising.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but, let's, I want you to take me back to that time which we're talking is 1969 you said 'til 1979.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, what is the environment like?  What is even an ad agency environment like?  And, what was Leo Burnett's [Leo Burnett Company Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it's, it was an incredible environment.  I supposed we would relate it to what you would call hot today.  It was very, its culture was very unique.  Lots of interpretive groups.  And, it was primarily dominated by men, very energetic men, love women, and a very, very brilliant, smart, creative, passionate guys that really, probably philosophical just believe in sucking all the juice out of life.  So, everything that was there and available, they were taking advantage of it.  It was--you had to really be on your game.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't tolerate, they did not tolerate you if you weren't.
Speaker 1: So, this was back in the day where you have the martini luncheons though, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, so, what were the hours and what were you--what was your work on a daily basis, you know?  And, you talked about work groups or creative groups.  So, how--you know, 'cause now people talk about creative spaces and all that.  But, what was the, you know, the ad agency, what did it look and feel like back?
Speaker 2: The look of it was absolutely forward and beautiful.  It had a creative environment but it, you know, they were just hundreds of offices with people in it.  And, so, I guess, we would call them cubes everywhere and then there were the window office.  Everybody of course strived to get a window office.  That's what it was all about.  And, we very much were desirous of that.  But, there were no blacks in window offices.  We were all in cubes initially.  As I can remember, I might have been the first black if--unless Don Richards [HistoryMaker Donald C. Richards] were to get a window office that I was cognizant of.  It was an incredible environment 'cause it was very competitive, and assignments would come down the pipe on a constant basis.  Not to mention the new business assignment.  So, you, your creativity was constantly challenged on a strategic level.  And, you were learning lots of different things at the same time.  But, let me just say, your learning couldn't get in the way of your creativity or vice a versa.  So, it demanded a healthy portion of the left side and the right side of your brain.  Because there's a science to it and then art.  And, you had to know all of that in order to succeed.  Not to mention the strategy of just navigating the corporate environment which is dominated by white men at that point.
Story_ID: 671026
Speaker 1: So, how did you navigate that environment?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I've been asked that question many, many times.  And, it's a very difficult question for me to answer; other than the fact that, I have always been the type of person that whatever your personal problems, they're your problems, they're not mine.  So, I have really guided my life on not picking up anybody's nonsense.  In other words, there were certain people at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] that the people felt, he's a racist.  Well, I don't see your racism as my problem.  It may present a barrier, but it's my job to find my way around, over, under, or through that barrier.  And--but, that you would, that you would condescend upon me or decide that I was not someone who could attain a goal because you saw the goal as difficulty, I would never pick that up as my problem.  That's your problem.  That ugliness is coming out of you.  I don't own any part of it.  So, I pretty much kept my focus on doing my job.  And, once you take that ball to the hole, which is what it was all about, is that yang or the money.  And, you make that money, then they have to get out your way.
Story_ID: 671027
Speaker 1: Your slogan got picked up for, for Pillsbury [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota]--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for the Pillsbury account?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, that happened you said within six--
Speaker 2: Six months of my being there.
Speaker 1: Six months.  Now, how old are you at this point?  You're?
Speaker 2: I think I was twenty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, you do that, and then tell me what happens afterwards.  So, people are--'cause the--it's--no, who was, who was, was it--no, it wasn't Bill Sharp that you, it was Jim Gilmore.
Speaker 2: Jim Gilmore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Jim Gilmore, so you report to him how long?  You become part of one of his team, his gang?
Speaker 2: I became part of Jim Gilmore's team.  And, as we moved forward, as I was promoted, two years after I came to Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.], I was promoted to a copy supervisor.  Then, my associate creative director became Don Morris [ph.].  Don Morris was this Greek guy, really good looking guy that was an--originally his, his main competency was art direction.  And, I began working with Don.  And, Rudy Perz [Rudolph Perz] was still the creative director.  And, then I was promoted to associate creative director under Don Morris, and Don Morris was put the creative director position, and Rudy became executive creative director.  Then, two--Don Morris left and Charlie Blakemore [Charles Nelson Blakemore] became my creative director and then Charlie Blakemore promoted me to a creative director.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, then, then a year later I was made a vice president.
Speaker 1: So, you were made a vice president in what year then?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977], okay.  So, that, how many black creative directors are there at that point?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: In the country?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: None that I knew, that I knew, know of, or knew about and have known about since.  I was the only one.
Speaker 1: And, so, how, so what does that mean in the Leo Burnett environment?  What does that mean, and what does that mean in the larger Chicago [Illinois] environment?
Speaker 2: I don't know what it meant.  It meant, it--I don't know that people had a lot of conversation to--with me about it.  I know that it was intimidating to some of my black friends at the time who worked in advertising.  Some of them would infer that I had some sort of relationship with my boss that was questionable.  So, that--it was an issue of whether or not I had actually earned it on my creativity or otherwise.  That was very interesting.  And, I was--it, it felt so natural and so real.  And, no different than when I was associate creative director or, or copy supervisor.  The struggles were all the same to manage people who were 100 percent white which was very frightening to me at the time.  Will they do what I tell them to do?  Mostly men, and I really didn't get a sense of how extraordinary this was until I won advertising woman of the year.  And, then I began speaking.  Then I began hearing over and over again where I was the only African American female in this position.  And, I began to look at the world through their eyes rather than my eyes because in my eyes I was just Carol Henny [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams].  In their eyes I was something else.
Story_ID: 671028
Speaker 1: You had the Secret--can we go back to the Secret account?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You got assigned that, right?
Speaker 2: Charlie Blakemore [Charles Nelson Blakemore] assigned me the Secret antiperspirant business in 1974.  I was a--I was associate creative director.
Speaker 1: And, so, when new products would come like, so was it a new product or was it a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Secret was not a new product.
Speaker 1: So, but had, was it, had it been, was it a new account that Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] had gotten, or they had it already?
Speaker 2: No. Burnett had had Secret antiperspirant in some form or another from Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio] for years and year and years, it had always been there.  They had been doing several campaigns with it, I think Katy Winters, or something, was on the air with it.  One day Charlie Blakemore who was my boss and really, really taught me advertising and, you know, helped me to really appreciate my talent.  He called me to his office and he said, that he wanted to give me an assignment but he was afraid I was gonna quit.  And, so--which I thought was quite humorous because, I was so grateful at being in the position I was in and being able, I mean, to be able to do and learn how to put film on the air and to write and create and travel all around the world doing this was such a privilege.  I would've stayed broke and poor to be able to do it.  And, I was making more money than anybody I knew.  And, and doing something that I love to do.  And, that's the most incredible blessing you could have to be able to make money and do what you wanna do.  Anyway, they call it work, but it was play for me.  And, Charlie called me in and he, and he said that to me and I smiled and said, "Charlie," because he was very, very good to me.  Charlie was one of those bosses that again, you know, if you had to have everything in by twelve o'clock--well not necessarily Charlie, but I had had bosses like that before.  And, sometimes you had to go down to the bars to find them in order that you could get your (laughter), they would be in the bar, "Come on over baby let me buy you a drink."  It was like, "I gotta get this assignment in, thank you very much.  I'll come back.  Check y'all later.  But, right now I need your signature on here so this can move on."  And, and you realize later, you were doing such a great job for 'em that--and what have you, that they could go off and play.  And, and I was one of the ones that didn't mind doing the work.  It was a privilege.  And, he told me that, and I said, "I would never quit you, Charlie."  You, you know, "What are you talking about?  What is it that you want me to do?"  And, he said, "I want you to write on Secret antiperspirant."  Well, I instantly understood what, what the issue was because everyone was clamoring to write on the hot stuff which was Virginia Slim, United Airlines, you know, I think it was RC Cola, that, you know, those were, those were the hot, hot things to write on.  You got to travel everywhere and produce all this film and what have you.  And, I said, "Secret antiperspirant, come on Charlie," 'cause, you know, it was Katy Winters, it was boring, all right.  He says, "Carol [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams], you know, they do a lot of commercials during the year," and blah, blah, blah, "and we need some help here because Secret is like number nine in the marketplace, it's dying."  And, P and G is introducing Sure antiperspirant to replace, probably replace Secret.  And, and Mary Wells [Wells Rich Greene] was getting Sure antiperspirant.  Burnett, it wasn't given to Burnett, because Burnett had not, I suppose done a great job with Secret.  And, (laughter), so, I agreed to work on Secret antiperspirant.
Story_ID: 671029
Speaker 1: I got involved with Bill Halgen [ph.].  Bill Halgen is this wonderful, wonderful man, and Peter Horst.  They were all--Peter, I can't--Husting [Peter M. Husting], I think his last name, they were all the account managers on Secret antiperspirant.  And, they immersed me in the business and basically, you know, Secret, found out that Secret actually in efficacy was parity with every other antiperspirant.  But, it was perceived as an antiperspirant that was for women.  Therefore, it was perceived as a very weak antiperspirant.  After a long jaunt committing to that positioning and recognizing that women in essence cared about a more efficacious antiperspirant than men did because women could not perspire.  That was very unfeminine.  So, the importance of, you know, a man perspired he was masculine.  We perspire, we were pigs.  And, so, we, most women at that time were using, Right Guard or Ban.  And, so, Sure--Secret was positioned as the antiperspirant that was made for women.  And, supposed by this nice little smell that was put in it, and it was given this--and, so, we went out and communicated it by creating this, what I call a conflict on air, of the viability of a man's antiperspirant versus a woman's antiperspirant.  And, women not letting their husbands use their antiperspirant because it was made for women but it, but it was as effective, if not more effective, than their antiperspirant.  No antiperspirant that they had could beat it in its efficacy.  And, that concept went on the air.  We called it, Jane and--what did I name that account, it had--some people's name at the time, and it's selling prompt--put on it was, "Strong enough for a man but made for a woman."  And, in six months Secret antiperspirant became number one in the marketplace and it stayed that way I think, maybe 'til today, it's still maybe number one.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: So, that was you?  "Strong enough for a man but made for a woman"?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was my campaign.
Story_ID: 671030
Speaker 1: I wanna go back.  Just that--if you would walk me through advertising 101.  So, is it the, is it the account people get the accounts, right?  And, then you have the research department.  I'm just trying to understand--I know that creative is, they're the key people.  But, the account people on the business side, so how does that work?
Speaker 2: Well, I doubt if, I doubt if a lot of the account people would say the creatives are key people.  A lot of the footwork and many times often the thinking, or what have you, may be done by other members of the account.  When you find--see, a lot of times, when you see a creative that advances quickly and high is because that creative understands strategic positioning and planning or what have you.  A place that you can occupy that, that in a person's mind that, that others have to fight to get through.  Especially, if--when it's an insight that you realize is very important to any give consumer or target or what have you and, it has not been recognized or recognized in a different way by other groups.  So, the primary responsibility of account people really is servicing the account.  Understanding the marketing initiative and platforms that the client, (unclear) the clients are putting out to be the main point of contact with clients.  And, then these selfsame account people would interact with research.  They interact with media, and they interact with creatives.  And, as a team, we all get together and kind of blow out and understand how you need to go to market or weigh in the market for a product.
Speaker 1: And, how long does it take?  Like that campaign that you did for Secret, how long did the whole process take?  What lead time to you have and--'cause there's research, you had to research there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, there're different kinds of research.  And, you know, there is research that takes a look and lays out the, all the strengths and weaknesses and, and threats, opportunities, whatever it is in the marketplace so you can consume.  You go look, you can look at research that look qualitative or quantitative research that looks at the values.  All those, and connects the dots in order to drive a strategy.  And, that strategy is then through, a lot of times, research driven is laid out to, to tell you what goal you're trying to achieve, okay.  For instance, in the case of Secret antiperspirant or the Pillsbury story [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota], we want to sell Pillsbury, this line of Pillsbury biscuits, which happens to be named Pillsbury's Best because--biscuits to people who are eating breakfast in the house to consume--to encourage them to eat more biscuits for breakfast.  Thus was born, "Nothing's quite as good as biscuits in the morning. It's Pillsbury's Best--," the line was named Pillsbury's Best "--time of day".  And, it all came together.  Secret antiperspirant, the objective, let me say, it could have been to convince women that Secret antiperspirant was an extremely efficacious or as efficacious as any male antiperspirant in the marketplace.  But, it was especially male--made for them because it smelled like a woman not like a man, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 671031
Speaker 1: So, what was your creative process though?  That's what I'm trying to understand.  How long did, did it take you to get to where you had a slogan like that, that was compelling?
Speaker 2: Well, the creative process is a mysterious and unbelievable engagement with yourself, or with your creative god.  Asking, it--how long it takes is almost asking how long do you engage in sex.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It is what it is.  It just depends on the moment.  So, you can get there, you can fly down the, the board and get, and through that bat ball down in a second, or it may be two or three days.  It's just what you're doing then.  So, I have never thought about it in terms of a timespan.  Now, in terms of the advertising process that's different.  But, in term of my internal creative process, who knows.  So, I've been there and, you know, while they're down voting me and immersing me in what all this is, (snaps fingers) the answer can come.  Or, you can be in the shower at night or in the midst of the most amazing sleep (snaps fingers), and there it is.  Or, you can have one after another after another and the ideas keep coming and it keeps getting better.  And, then, the process can engage you to the point that it's, it's unyielding and it's never over.  Even when you have to produce, you are still evolving and improving it.  So, it just depends on where you are, who you are, and how it, how whatever it is impacts you at the moment.  Now, once you engage the process and expose it to the client and the client buys it from the time that--the problem becomes different because your mind can behold a million different things.  But, that process to take this idea and pluck it from here and to put it on paper is a whole 'nother initiative.  And, then once you put it on paper, just because it's on paper doesn't mean that you can instantly bring it to life.  That process from paper to actually bringing it to life where it's impactful and it actually does what you want it to do is a whole 'nother kind of exercise in learning.
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: Because you got a lot of people you have to manage in terms of the art director, and once it goes to film then working with the director, working the producer the director, the post-edit house, all that kind of stuff to bring that piece, vision to life and making sure it ensures that it's doing what you say it doing in here (gesture).  Sometimes you do make it, sometimes you don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and so, you, okay, so, I unders- that was helpful, I understand that.  But, I guess, I'm also trying--so with, with the Secret campaign, how long did it take there?
Speaker 2: Once I put it on paper?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Once I put it on paper and it was approved to client from, from that to production, to the actual producing of the commercial probably was about a six month, five month, six month process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 671032
Speaker 1: And, so, you see, you know, always in the movies or on TV, the creative meetings, you know where the client is there and the advertising agency is pitching.  And, so, would you, how would you go about pitching?  Would you control your pitch sessions?  Or, would you have--you know, was it participatory?  How did you go about the process?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean, client presentations.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Oh, client presentations, yes.  You spend a lot of time pre- as you're moving through this advertising world--being trained as to how you present your piece.  Because we creatives tend to believe that the most important thing is the creativity piece.  But, really, clients, what they wanna know is, do you understand the strategic problem that I'm dealing with?  The background on the marketplace.  What's going on in here?  And, then once you have a nice healthy discourse on that, then strategically you have to lay out what you're attempting to do and why you're attempting to do it.  Now, let's take this piece I created and look at how it solves these problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, they look at it not only in terms of how it solves their problem, if it solves, they feel it solves their problem, but what are the little things that creep in there that might be distracting messages that really don't address where they need to be.  Just depending on how focused they are, you see.  It's like some clients--I experienced once, this client wanted to portray; what, what was it?  Hungry Jack biscuits, yeah.  He wanted to portray that these biscuits were big biscuits, and for hearty eaters, men, men are hearty eaters and, so this is the biscuit for them, and all that kind of stuff, good stuff, which was great.  And, so, I had done this commercial where the father was a hearty eater.  But, the uncle came over to the house who was the classic look in the pots, I want something to eat.  And, the only time he comes over here is when he's looking for food.  And, of course, there are these Hungry Jack biscuits and he was, he was gobbling them up.  And, so that, you know, that was classic.  Have you heard about Hungry Jack?  He's one big appetite, right?  But, what the client saw was the representation or the personification, if you will, if it is, this hungry appetite was in this uncle who was visitor to the house.  So, therefore, he felt that the commercial said, "These biscuits are for when you have company."  And, boom, that killed the commercial.  Had to go back and rewrite one that was specifically--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --a everyday one.  And, yes, they are that sensitive to side messages and being focused and what it is.  So, that's why often time executions will deliver you in a place that you don't wanna be.  You really have to understand how the mind works, how it takes in information, and, and understand the science of advertising.  That's why a lot of times you look at the TV and you see commercials that are wonderfully entertaining but you don't really understand what it's trying to tell you.
Story_ID: 671033
Speaker 1: But let's talk about this.  You had the package.  You had the looks.  So, when, when did the swan come?  When did she, when was she born?
Speaker 2: The swan was born.  I love that, referring to myself as a swan.  The swan was born--the ugly duckling start disappearing and the swan was born when I began understanding that in- indeed I was a talent.  And, that indeed I was--I had intellect and people wanted to hear what I had to say and I wasn't just this little sexual target.
Speaker 1: But, when did you become (laughter), when did you become sexy (laughter)?  I mean, you had thick glasses.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I hid behind my glasses.  I hid behind my glasses.  I hid--
Speaker 1: When did--is this like, when did you become a swan?  I mean, you said you didn't talk before you came here.  But, you did say that you were pleasing to the eye.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I began attracting the attention despite the Coke bottle glasses (laughter), I began attracting the attention of men when I was in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], which was very uncomfortable for me.  Because I saw it as being a sex object rather than--and I rejected that.  I wanted answers.  I wanted to know things.  I just wasn't interested in being cute and guys taking me to bed.  I wasn't, that's not what I was.  And, I found that that was what consistently went on which made me withdraw, was that the attention of, of a lot of guys and the agenda was always a sexual encounter which really offended me.
Speaker 1: But, that's advertising had that whole thing going on, right?  The industry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.  But, this was before advertising.
Speaker 1: Oh, this was (laughter), okay, okay, okay.  But, your pleasing looks probably helped you get hired, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I'm sure it did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure it did.
Story_ID: 671034
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna know, I wanna go outside for a minute.  Who, who are you associating with right now?  And, you know, you had mentioned just briefly about--oh god--you know, I had mentioned Vince Cullers and then your had mentioned--I really had wanted to interview her.
Speaker 2: Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor].
Speaker 1: Barbara Proctor.  So, what space is she occupying because she was the first, really?  People say she was the first here in Chicago [Illinois]; female, is that true?
Speaker 2: I think Barbara was the first black female.  She was the first black female that I'm aware of that had made any sort of inroads and also opened up her own ad agency.  Barbara Proctor apparently had her own ad agency.  She had come out of Post, Keyes and Gardner [Post Keyes Gardner, Inc.], and opened up an agency sometime about the same time as Vince Cullers. She--in the late '60s [1960s], I think '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: So, this is all happening at this time.  So you have you who are in a mainstream firm.
Speaker 2: I was in mainstream also.
Speaker 1: And, then you have Vince Cullers and Barbara Proctor.
Speaker 2: I had heard about Vince Cullers.  And, Vince Cullers had his own advertising agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].  I heard about Barbara Proctor and she had her own advertising agency.  She was to open up an agency somewhere near Pizzeria Uno [Uno Pizzeria and Grill, Chicago, Illinois].  And, when we go to Pizzeria Uno to lunch people would say, "That's where Barbara Proctor's agency."  But, I didn't know Barbara Proctor at the time.  I had not met her.  And, shortly after then, I think in her early '70s [1970s] somewhere, somewhere in the '70s [1970s] Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] opened up his agency [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois].  But, Barbara Proctor and Vince Cullers had been around with their own agency at some time, for some time at that point.
Speaker 1: So, they're really saying that they're, they, they're, they were basically saying, there is a black market, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with theirs.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, we deserve to have advertising come here.  And, we can speak to the audience that is the black market.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But, let me just say, they were saying some of that later.  I don't really know if black--if Vince Cullers and Barbara Proctor ever really went out and said there's a black market.  They just were committed.  They were fabulous advertising people and were committed to advertising and they went out and they opened up advertising agency.  Now, I am sure that both Vince and Barbara would have done any sort of advertising.  We're advertising people.  The first time I think that I actually heard of targeted advertising was when Tom began doing targeted advertising for Marlboro.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  But, up to that point, but then their target--I mean, Vince's and theirs target was primarily the black community.
Speaker 2: They, as far as I know, that's who they target.  But, I don't know if that was a result of assignments given to them by clients or they were actively pursuing it that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.
Story_ID: 671035
Speaker 1: You--but then there're the rest of you that are over here and that's when you're talking about Don Richards [HistoryMaker Donald C. Richards] and
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) others who are making their way, you know, within the white advertising agency.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so, are you all part of a group or is it sort of singular?  And, who are you associating with?  You know, because I think of people like, you know, [HistoryMaker] Dori Wilson, you know, she's the top model, you know, black model in town; trying to think who else.  You know, there're, I mean, there're--so, I'm just trying, I'm trying to get a sense of who are you associating with.  Who are your running pals?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You know, what is the--
Speaker 2: Dori Wilson, gorgeous woman, and she was there.  We would all come together during the huge parties that were given by the magazines or given by the photographers or the actors who were trying to get in and that kind of stuff.  And, we all knew each other.  We were all very cognizant of one another and interacted that way.  But, I did not have, I didn't have running buddies or whatever.  I maintained my friendships with two people that are Rhea Rhodes [ph.] and--who was my best friend coming out of high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And, another friend of mine who I met while I was in college.  And, then you have to remember that while at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] I was continuing to go to school in the evening.  So, I really didn't--I was, I really did not have extensive roots and relationships into the black community.  My connect to the black community was totally my parents [Betty Norment Williams and Clarence Williams] and my sisters and brothers and a couple of friends that I had maintained coming out of high school.  Once into college, I went into a complete white world and at Burnett the world was just about 100 percent bla- white (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's--it's all white.
Speaker 2: It was all white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so--
Speaker 2: And, I got really, for a while I got lost in this world.
Speaker 1: No.  And, I can understa-
Story_ID: 671036
Speaker 1: So, you're in the world, there're parties.  Now, I wanna understand the other thing, the difference between black agencies, whatever their client, and white agencies is what you've said at several times and you talked about film.  Because black agencies for the most part were not doing TV.
Speaker 2: No, they weren't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, they were doing print--
Speaker 2: Print.
Speaker 1: --but they--and maybe radio but--
Speaker 2: And, some radio.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  But, they were not doing TV.  You're talking about managing accounts where the--TV is always gonna be a--
Speaker 2: Primarily TV.  Print or radio was totally secondary.  When I was at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] as a creative director and a vice president, I actually did very little radio.  I did almost 99 percent television.  And, I was producing maybe up to about twenty commercials a year.
Speaker 1: So, in that process, you're managing.  So, who is your favorite, who's your favorite editor or, you know, post production house?  Who is your, who is your fav- or, do you have these favorites?  Or, who's your favorite photographer?  Who's your favorite shooter?  I mean, do you have favorites like that?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoy working with a great deal of all the best.  Whether it was Bob Giraldi, Joe Picca [ph.],  Tohtz and Sam [sic. Szabo Tohtz Editing, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], I'd work with them all.  And, I enjoyed it a great deal.  I didn't, I never got involved with a favorite (laughter).  They were all white.  They were all white editor houses.  I worked on so many different things at different times that different ones were good at different things.  Some of 'em were very good at casting, and some of 'em were spectacular--for instance, if I'm looking for certain things to work with when I'm working on Pillsbury [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota], I'm not primarily looking at the casting, I'm primarily looking at your ability to light and shoot food.  And, so it depends on versus whether or not I'm working on hypothetically a Green Giant [Green Giant Company], then I'm looking at an animation house.  And, who has the, you know, who has traditionally done Green Giant and therefore can do in such a way and in the integration of the food, editorial wise and otherwise can get me a first class piece of film.  It depends on what you shoot, how you--so, no, I never developed a favorite on anything because I was always looking, trying to get smarter, trying to advance the cause and what have you.  Plus, all my art directors, and producers and whatever were white, and they were men.  And, so, they were very, very, strong and passionate about who they wanted to work with and how they wanted to work.  And, the producers I work with were very strong and passionate.  So, it really is a team spirit.  It requires a lot of compromise and being able to work with these people but--'cause if I gotta produce it then once it go over to A and I'm stuck on B then we might get a compromised piece of film because we're not agreeing.  So, it is a team.  You--it's not just one person.  Even though I created the spot, I've gotta utilize the services of a bunch of people in order to accomplish the goal.
Story_ID: 671037
Speaker 1: So, who are the--the other question I have is--oh, god, wait--it just went out of my mind.  I was--it was a creative question about--okay.  I'll just let that go.  So--
Speaker 2: A lot of times, I have to say though, I found that the utilization of music on your commercials were very tough for me.  Because Burnett's tradition was using these all white music houses that I was often put in bed with that couldn't quite achieve the goal that I was looking at.  So, I never forget when I first chose a black man and I don't remember his name, he'd probably kill me if I can't remember, I can't remember his name right now.  But, he was always very wonderful to me because he says I gave him a start in laying down music.  And, Jesus, I caught a lot of heat.  Because I don't think any black musician had ever laid down a national music bed on a commercial before.  And, I gave this gentlemen his--that music bed and boy they were, they were heated.  He--it was if, here it was, it was as if blacks couldn't do music.  The whole idea about using a black man to do a music track on a national commercial for this client was unheard of.  It had never happened.  But, I did it, and it turned out beautiful and all they could do was smile.  And, the same thing that happened when, on a Secret commercial.  I mean, I don't really know this is true but, that Secret antiperspirant spot in which I cast, put a black cast on might have been the first, if not one of the first black commercials that was ever on the air or that a company like P and G [Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio] had ever done.  And, it was so funny because one of the people had came up to me and said, "Who told you to cast that commercial black?"  I said, "What do you mean, who told--does somebody need to tell me?"  And, he was very, very upset.  And--
Speaker 1: Was it, was this someone here?  Someone at Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somebody at Leo Burnett.  And, I went to my boss Charlie Blakemore [Charles Nelson Blakemore].  Charlie said it's a beautiful commercial.  It was a pool with three commercials and I did two of 'em.  I cast two of 'em white and one black.  Geez, one of those, they were, there were some people that were very upset about it.  And, Charlie Blakemore was like, "Don't worry about it, it's a beautiful commercial.  It's right in the, in the format and let's go with it."  And, P and G saw the commercial, my client at P and G and they put it on the air.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Never said a word.  P and G took off.  Secret took off.
Speaker 1: You know, because I was, I was thinking about this even with, with, you know, jingle writers, you know, 'cause this is--you know, I don't think things are done in that way but back then, you know, it was a lot of money spent by ad agencies for jingles for commercials (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and I remember when we were just doing [HistoryMaker] Valerie Simpson, you know, she said she and--oh, God what was--
Speaker 2: Ashford [Nickolas Ashford]?
Speaker 1: Well, Ashford and Simpson but she was a big jingle singer along with Patti Austin.
Speaker 2: Oh, they all were.  That's the way they all--I met 'em all.  And, they were all singing jingles and then backup singers in studios sing against the primary singers, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, making a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Donny Hathaway, all of those guys, Minnie Riperton, Chaka Khan, they were all in the studio.  They were all backup singers to--doing jingles.
Story_ID: 671038
Speaker 1: And, then so, how--what were the budgets you were dealing with?  Like when you would--'cause you're talking about going on location and I'm just wondering how much you travelled and what were some of your favorite locations for shoots, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I would al- I would always shoot, we mostly shoot in studios.  When we were work--when I was working on Pillsbury [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota] and Secret and whatever, those were all studio shoots.
Speaker 1: And, those are in sets (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) there're in sets.  Yes.  And, in New York [New York] it was always sets.  When, when we go on location those were shoots like when you do a soda or milk or something like that.  See, something that required activity and fun and they had specific place you wanted to shoot in.  A location like for instance if you were shooting something with pineapples, you probably went to Hawaii, you know.  United Airlines, it's, you know, it's someplace in Hawaii, you know.  'Cause they were doing a lot of promoting their travel back and forth from Hawaii in that time, so.
Story_ID: 671039
Speaker 1: So you're really living in a white world. That's basically--you get sucked up, you're, you're the head honcho but you're living in a white world.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so where are living at this point?
Speaker 2: I was living in McClurg Court [Chicago, Illinois] in Lake Point Towers [sic. Lake Point Tower, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, those were the places to be back then, right?
Speaker 2: Well, for white people.  If it was for black--us black people, we were just looking at it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right, we were looking at--
Speaker 2: We were looking at it from the outside.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And, so, when you, in 1977, when you became--named creative director and vice president, how many vice presidents were there at the time?  And, then, okay, answer that question.  But, I'm wondering is someone name Mike Hall [Michael Hall], has he come to Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] at this point?
Speaker 2: Mike Hall came to Leo Burnett right during the time I think I was leaving.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I do not know how many vice presidents there were at Leo Burnett at the time.  I do know that I was the only black female.  There was a media woman who I'd interviewed and recommended for hiring that later became head of Starcom [Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's Renetta McCann [HistoryMaker Renetta Earldeane McCann].
Speaker 2: Renetta.  Yes.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say, 'cause I was gonna as--she was gonna be on my, you know, I've known--there's Renetta McCann, there was Esther Franklin [HistoryMaker Esther "E.T." Franklin] but she's much later.  She was Renetta's protegee.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. Well, Renetta, I interviewed and brought her into Burnett just as I was leaving.  And, I--Mike tells me he was there.  I--he knew who I was, but I didn't know who he was.
Speaker 1: Because he was probably fresh out of business school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was fresh out of business school.  He was--as he says, I was big time.  He was little fish (laughter).
Story_ID: 671040
Speaker 1: So, you, what made you, what makes you decide to leave?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is 1980, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is 1980.  The world became aware of this young black woman who was doing all these incredible things at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.].  And, they just started shooting at me constantly, offering me deals.
Speaker 1: Headhunters?
Speaker 2: Just the phone rang constantly.  And, I became weary I think, 'cause I've always been--and, not only, we were just curious about what else was out there.  I started seeing a track whereas God, I was born here, I grew up here and I'm getting ready to die here.  I don't wanna die (laughter), and my life, as fabulous as it was, I mean it was--I had a job that I loved.  I worked with people that I loved.  My parents [Betty Norment Williams and Clarence Williams] were so unbelievably proud of me.  I was able to help them secure a beautiful condo right on the lake [Lake Michigan], you know, and I'm running around in the 4050SL [Mercedes-Benz 450SL] and helping to send my brother to school, and traveling all over the world.  It was, it was really, really beautiful.  But, then all of a sudden, I started thinking that there's more.  I'm not meant to stop here and I need to, I need to explore.  And, as I continued on that path, I just, it just, the pressure became greater and greater to, to move.  Because you have to realize that no matter how beautiful it is that I had gotten comfortable.  And, I was in a track where I was making more and more money and I found myself getting really trapped in a very interesting way of life.  I was losing my connection to my community.  I was really swept off in another world.  I wasn't going to--I wasn't finding time to spend, to contribute to my community at all.  It was, it was, it was a transitional time.  It was time for the exodus.  Everybody's life had exodus, and mine, mine was upon me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So, what, were there also changes at Leo Burnett at the top?  Was Leo Burnett still here?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Leo Burnett was, was changing.  Leo had died.
Speaker 1: When did he die, he die?
Speaker 2: Leo died somewhere in the mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then Gene Kolkey [Eugene Kolkey] died.  Then a gentleman got--I thought that my boss Charlie Blakemore [Charles Nelson Blakemore] was gonna be made head creative guy, and he wasn't.  Another man was, which hugely disappointed me.  I ran.
Speaker 1: So, where did Charlie go himself?  Did he stay?
Speaker 2: No.  Charlie, after I left I think Charlie stayed for--Charlie tried to get me to go to New York [New York].  He really wanted me to go to New York.  And, he was going to come to New York as I understood it.  But, I went west.
Story_ID: 671041
Speaker 1: I think at the time, I had gotten involved with Bob Peete who was a story consultant on Lear, Norman Lear.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  On several Norman Lear--
Speaker 2: Shows?
Speaker 1: --shows.  And, Bob was encouraging me to get involved and to write some, some sitcoms.  And, I think that's primarily where--why I went west.  I had, I had thought, "Well, let me take a look at it."  I had been offered a position by Jack Tohtz to become a director in--for his, his business.  He was a film director.  And, so, he was interested in my abi- you know, he was interested in supporting me to become the first black female film director.  Which I wasn't in love with quite honestly.  But, I was very interested in what Bob Peete was promoting me to do.  And, he had introduced me to Norman Lear to perhaps start developing my writing by writing some shows.
Speaker 2: So, when you said you went west, you went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 1: I didn't wanna go to L.A.  I didn't like L.A. much.  And, but, I got offered a job by Foote, Cone and Belding, which was in San Francisco [California].  So, I decided to use it as a stepping stone on my way to doing what I do.  And, I worked a lot with--oh, what was his name?  He was the voice of the Doughboy [Pillsbury Doughboy], and he and I had become very good friends.  And, at the time he was the Doughboy, you know, and I produced a million Doughboy commerci- Poppin' Fresh dough commercials, and I'd always worked with him.  He was the voice.  And, he lived in Northern California.  And, so, he'd always invite me up there and he use to encourage me to come to Northern California and I really like Northern California.  So, I thought it was a hop, skip and a jump, from L.A.  I could live up in Northern California and I could do what I wanted to do.
Speaker 2: But, that's a whole different environment there too.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it.  I didn't realize it until I got out there.
Speaker 2: So, when you got out there--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, when you got out there, what was that like?  Because, you know, I, for some reason I didn't know that Foote, Cone and Belding originated in San Francisco.  'Cause it--does he have offices here too?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Foote, Cone and Belding was here in Chicago [Illinois].  I don't know that it originated in San Francisco--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but, it had an office in San Francisco--
Speaker 2: It had an offi--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Foote, Cone, Belding, Hornik [sic.], which was a very successful office and the largest advertising agency on the West Coast at that time.
Speaker 2: So, what were their clients?
Speaker 1: Levi's [Levi Strauss and Company], Clorox [Clorox Company], Eddie Bauer [Eddie Bauer LLC], stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, when you go there, you worked on Clorox?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, so, how was that environ- 'cause that's a big change, culturally and everything.
Speaker 1: Huge change.
Speaker 2: And, you're in your early, you're thirty-one at this point?
Speaker 1: Yeah, early, yeah, early thirties.
Speaker 2: Early thirties, right?
Speaker 1: And, it was very interesting.  They were, they were more business driven, at least than what I was exposed to at Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.].  Burnett was completely, from where I was, creative was everything.  We ran everything.  We could stand on our heads or whatever and the guy could only wait with their baskets 'til the chickens laid their eggs to pick them.  And, you just didn't screw around with the creatives.  The, the attitude I found that was completely business driven in many ways very quiet, solemn.  It wasn't fun for me.  And, the creatives weren't special.  And, I was very used to being special (laughter).  So, it wasn't a culture that I could embrace.
Speaker 2: So, you were there just two years, right?
Speaker 1: I was just there two years.
Story_ID: 671042
Speaker 1: Let's just--so you left Foote, Cone and--but, you take an interest really in, you do take an interest in, in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I really love the Bay--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I really fell in love with the Bay Area.  It was beautiful and it was so different from what I was used to in Chicago [Illinois].  And, I got involved in that lifestyle.  Which was again, a white lifestyle to tell you the truth.  Foote, Cone and Belding was 100 percent white.  And, I was the only black person there.  And, then, my girlfriend from high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], the one that I met that was a really excellent friend of mine who had also I had known since I was four or five years old, she--'cause she had gone to Grant Memorial church [Grant Memorial A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois] with me and was one of the older boys and girls leaders which we used to learn crafts under.  She had married this white gentleman and had moved out to San Francisco [California] and was in the Bay Area.  And, she--it was my birthday weekend and I was, I was--Foote, Cone and Belding had made a deal with me whereas they sent me home every Thursday.  I was--every Thursday I would get on a plane, fly home, listen to my husband [Williams' ex-husband, Ray Lyle] in Chicago complain about me working (laughter) in, in San Francisco and why I was out there.  And, I would stay home and visit my parents [Betty Norment Williams and Clarence Williams] and everything over the weekend.  And, on late Sunday night or Monday morning, I'd fly back into San Francisco and spend the week working out here.  Which was fun for a while.  And, and my girlfriend who was out here with her husband and her daughter, whom I'm her daughter's godmother, she begged me to stay one weekend and to go to this party with her to celebrate my birthday, which was over in Oakland [California].  And, I had never been to Oakland, and I had never been--I had, I had just been in San Francisco and doing things.  So, I decided to stay and I would go home on maybe Saturday night and what have you.  And, so, I went over to Oakland with her and it was this black attorney name Carolyn, I think her last name was Strong [Carolyn Strong (ph.)] or something, she was having a party because I think it might've been her birthday a day later and I went to the party.  And, I met my--Dr. Tipkins Hood.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about him.
Speaker 2: He was absolutely a brilliant man.  First of all, I, I had never met anyone, I had never met anyone that had come from Camden, Texas.  And, when he began talking to me, he starting talking about him being from Texas and Camden, Texas.  And, I said, "Where is Camden, Texas?"  And, he said it was, it was about fifty-two miles [sic.] out of Houston [Texas].  And, I said, "Oh, there're black people in Texas?"  And, he just thought I was the biggest idiot he had ever met (laughter), in his life.  He was like, "Girl, where have you been?"  And, he began sharing his--we became friends and he began sharing his life with me and Tip Hood was an absolutely brilliant man who had grown up in Camden, Texas. He had graduated from--out of Houston and then gone to Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] where he became orthopedic surgeon.  He did his residency at Homer G. Phillips [Homer G. Phillips Hospital] in St. Louis [Missouri].  And, he was one of the chief of surgery in the Vietnam War.  And, so, he used to tell me stories about the Vietnam War and how he was a, he was [U.S.] Navy.  He was a Navy doctor.  And, but, he serviced the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  And, so, he'd tell me stories about he would come out in his chief of surgery regalia and stuff and they'd arrest him for impersonating an officer 'cause they, they didn't know anything about a black officer or whatever.  And, so, I never knew--you know, Tip was like my dad again, you never knew where the line of reality in his imagination is.  But, he had great stories and he and I just got to be good friends and fell in love and we got married.
Speaker 1: Oh that s- and, you had, you had a daughter [Carol Henny Hood, Jr.] too.
Speaker 2: I had a daughter.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I have one daughter.  He had a son [Tipkins Hood, Jr.] who became my son.  And, his son was about sixteen years old when I married him.  His wife prior to me had died of cancer.  And, so, we married and joined our little family and--
Speaker 1: And, you made San Francisco your home at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  We made--he lived in Oakland.
Speaker 1: Oh, he lived--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  I forget people make that distinction out there.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He lived in--
Speaker 1: Oakland, Berkeley [California]--
Speaker 2: It's all the same place but it's different places.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 671043
Speaker 1: So what makes you decide though--so, during that time period, are you working?  When you--between the time that you leave Foote, Cone and Belding, and you open your own agency, are you working, are you--?
Speaker 2: I was doing consultancies on different jobs of clients that I had worked for while I was employed.  So, I was doing quite well.  Actually, my clients were coming to me asking me to do various jobs, which I did.  And, it got to be so numerous and so many of 'em that I decided the agency just evolved from that.
Speaker 1: So, tell us about the agency.  So, what--this is 1986.  So, it's a different time though when you first got started?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what are you wanting to do with your agency?
Speaker 2: You know, quite honestly, it's like one of those things where the path just finds you whether than you finding the path maybe.  Different clients, Clorox [Clorox Company] clients, my Clorox clients, and Pacific Bell [Pacific Bell Telephone Company], they were just--who had just worked with me before would call me up and ask me to do different things.  And, I was just really having a ball doing it.  And, quite honestly, making a lot of money and working out of my bedroom.  And, my husband [Tipkins Hood] kicked me out of the bedroom and told me I had to go to the guest house.  And, so, he had this huge, you know, environment, mansion and stuff and so I worked out of the guest house.  And, then he said, "You know what?  You need to go open up you own office.  'Cause now there's too many papers and too many pencils and too many people running around here.  So, let's think about getting you an office."  So, I, I did.  We went and we opened up in the Kaiser building [Kaiser Center, Oakland, California], small office and what can I tell you, the assignments just kept piling in and we just kept moving.
Speaker 1: But, how did you build it?  How did you build it?  Was it all just word of mouth?
Speaker 2: Initially, it was just word of mouth with people coming to me asking me to take jobs.
Speaker 1: Now, were you looking for market positioning at that time?  'Cause--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And, and there was never any attempt by you to maybe call, you know, have a different name other than your name?
Speaker 2: No.  When I start consulting, and I start consulting under my name, which was Carol H. Williams Advertising.  And, you know, the initial consulting jobs were somewhere around three to four hundred thousand dollars a project.  And, then it moved from three hundred to four hundred thousand dollars to million dollar jobs.  And, when it moved to million dollars jobs, it really became real then.
Speaker 1: And, how long did that take after 1986 or so?  'Cause I, I just would like to know the, the path.
Speaker 2: Well, I actually started in about 1984.  By 1986 we were getting big jobs.
Story_ID: 671044
Speaker 1: So, who--so you're, you're there but Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] in the meantime has started his agency [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there's you, there--so, I wanna, let's, let's paint the landscape a little bit.
Speaker 2: There was UniWorld [UniWorld Group, Inc.] who was [HistoryMaker] Byron Lewis was in New York [New York].  He was the big fish in New York.  Tom Burrell was in Chicago [Illinois].  Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor] was in Chicago.  But, Tom had surpassed Barbara, and Vince [Vince Cullers] was still in Chicago.  I think that there was another agency whose--there was two black guys that started an agency in New York, who were really very good.  But, they didn't--the agency didn't last very long.  And, oh, Sam Chisholm and Caroline Jones [Caroline R. Jones], Mingo [Frank L. Mingo].  Mingo started, and Caroline Jones got together and opened up an agency in New York.  And, there was a rash of 'em for a while if you--six or seven black agencies can be called a rash.  And, Joe Muse opened up in, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: And, so, who are you, are you competing each of you?  And, do you find yourself competing at this point?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't think we were competing at that point.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: No.  It--traditional advertising was hot.  Clients were looking around in order to expand their market and understand more about--in recognizing that if you got blacks in your franchise you could really drive your product to a number one position in the marketplace and stay there.  I mean, McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] is a classic example of that.  And, and depending on what we were doing and how we were doing it. You know, it's like Secret antiperspirant.  Secret antiperspirant was, was number one in the marketplace because it was bought by more white women and more black women than any other single antiperspirant.  You see, so, the importance of the black consumer dollar was being recognized.  So, clients were actively recognizing the cultural difference, the importance of talking directly to these consumer, and going after the consumer.
Story_ID: 671045
Speaker 1: So, you--was your, were you still flying different places or were you, was your business at the beginning more West Coast focused or what--I'm trying to understand when you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, initially, when I opened up my business, it was primarily West Coast business.  Because it's primarily some Clorox [Clorox Company] business, some Pacific Bell [Pacific Bell Telephone Company] business, what they call ComputerLand, they had a little Armour-Dial [Armour-Dial, Inc.], that kind of stuff, which was in Phoenix [Arizona].  So, when I flew it was mostly to Phoenix.  It didn't get--I in business maybe four or five years before I began attracting West Coast companies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, East Coast companies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) East coast companies.  Okay.  So, was that a part of a strategic plan to grow it into a national agency?  Was that a strategic plan on your part?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It wasn't?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't really.  I was--'cause I--Nissan [Nissan Motor Company Ltd.] was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I got Nissan.  And, Coors [Coors Brewing Company] was in Denver [Colorado] and Coors hired me.  And, so, basically, I was very comfortable with pretty much functioning with clients that were west of the Rockies [Rocky Mountains].
Speaker 1: So, what you're basically saying, and I think I hear you saying is that you were, you, that you were--your name attracted you, you know.  Others were, of those others how many of them had been in creative director positions?  You know, when you look at Mingo [Frank L. Mingo], you know, are, are they all, are you all coming from that side?  Or, are any of you coming from the, the account side?
Speaker 2: Now, I don't want to misspeak, but I have been told and I'm pretty sure that none of them ever became creative directors at mass market agencies.  Mingo was an account man, and Caroline [Caroline R. Jones] was a creative.  But, I think Caroline left the business as a copy supervisor and became her own agency.  Mingo left at appropriately the same time.  Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor], the same thing.  Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell], I think the same thing.
Speaker 1: But, he considers him a creative person though, right?
Speaker 2: He was, yes, he was creative.  But, I'm saying he never became a creative director.
Speaker 1: Right, right. That's right.
Speaker 2: Not that that is, you know--
Speaker 1: No, no, but that's a big deal.
Speaker 2: But, he never became a cre--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He never became a creative director at a mass market agency (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: As I, as I understand it, I am the only one that did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 671046
Speaker 1: You don't have any growth plans it's just the mon- the business is coming to you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have no growth plans.  No business plan, nothing (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, how do control the growth then?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  Which is one of the things that really created a problem for me.  It just, it imploded really.
Speaker 1: Because you, you got, I don't know let's see, well, Luster Products [Luster Products, Inc.] but then you, you got the [U.S.] Army account, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, this was, this is all now.
Speaker 1: Now, but--
Speaker 2: But, when I, when I'm talking about it all of a sudden we put a few things on--I was on- doing a lot of commercials and next thing I knew there was Coors [Coors Brewing Company], there was G- there was Nissan [Nissan Motor Company Ltd.].  Nissan was a big piece of business and I was doing lots of television for Nissan and very well.  And, they were running media money through the agency.  And, that, you know, at that time the whole segmentation with separating media had not happened so, thoroughly.  So, they were running millions of dollars though the agency with media money and, and then P and G [Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio], and I got some Clorox [Clorox Company] business and it was, it was, it was, it got, it got pretty doggone big.
Speaker 1: So, with that, so, how much your billings, they grow to what?  How big?
Speaker 2: They didn't do, they amortized the bus- the billings at that time.  So, so, the revenue I'm not sure about.  But, amortized the business was about three hundred million [dollars].
Speaker 1: What, when did the other offices start opening?  You, and so your first and--?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, I had, I decided to open the Chicago [Illinois] office when actually I left, I left Nissan and accepted a contract with General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  And, actually, I'm trying to learn how to do business.  You have to know these things, and my client at Coors, Michael Jackson [Michael A. Jackson], who left Coors which was a very excellent piece of business and went to General Motors.  And, he was a, in the really high up position at General Motors and so he talked to me about six months about coming to work for General Motors.  I couldn't work for General Motors and for Nissan at, at the same time.  And, so, I left Nissan and went to work for General Motors.  Mike was in a very consequential position and had a huge respect for him and thought that was a good move.  And, at that time, I had Bank of America [Bank of America Corporation] also.  But, then Bank of America sold from, from a West Coast to Union Bank [ph.].  And, Union Bank then which was in the Virginias I think it was, then changed their name to Bank of America.  But, Union Bank had been doing some minority advertising with, with UniWorld [UniWorld Group, Inc.].
Story_ID: 671047
Speaker 1: That's--so we're talking about the mid-'80s [1980s].  So, by the time we're getting to the '90s [1990s] how are things changing?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time you get to the '90s [1990s] the business was huge, massive, in my terms.  Bigger than I ever thought it could be.  And, so, I'm learning how to run a business and--
Speaker 1: Which is different from being a creator.
Speaker 2: It's totally different from being a creator.  So, now, I'm in the position of getting away from all the stuff that I love trying to learn how to run a business [Carol H. Williams Advertising] that I don't know how to run.  And, especially when you got to the point of opening up different offices and people are out from under your eyesight.  And, and you're trying to keep the integrity of your product and, and the value of your name moving forward; very difficult.
Speaker 1: That is true.
Speaker 2: Very, very difficult.
Speaker 1: So, what did you--now who's supporting you at this point?  Are you seeking advice or--you know, because it's a, it's a whole different proposition?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm putting together a board at this point.  And, I'm getting advice from my husband [Tipkins Hood] who is an orthopedic surgeon and knows less about business than I do (laughter).  See, we think this thing of intelligence and reading a book suffices on every level, well forget about it, friends.  That's not the ingredients.  It might be a little piece of this in that glass but that's not really it.  So, I've got my husband over here, orthopedic surgeon trying to help me run my business (laughter), and he's going, "Why don't you close that stuff down and come home and make some spaghetti and forget about it," (laughter), "what's the deal with the, with the business.  It's not like we need money around here.  What are you doing?"  And, I just, "Oh, I'm having a ball."  "Well, I'm not."  And, "I don't wanna run this business, I got my own business to run."  I'm, it's, it's, and the business is just growing, unbelievable.  So, I'm trying to put the board together of which Mike [Michael A. Jackson] became a part and my brother [Earl Williams] who's an attorney and, and, and I wanted to keep the board small at first 'cause you know I'm trying to control this thing that was already out of control, I just didn't know it.  And, what can I tell you, it was fun.  It was a great deal of fun.  But, then the market changed.
Speaker 1: And, this is what, is this early two (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The market began changing--
Speaker 1: Early 2000?
Speaker 2: Early--really changing where I really began noticing it, you know, I mean, my life since I had walked into advertising was just--
Speaker 1: Had been golden, right?
Speaker 2: Shoot--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You didn't know, you didn't even know how to want for anything.
Speaker 2: Man, listen, alchemist, I look at it (snaps fingers); gold, you know.  I mean it was just that way.  Total, total envelopment in alchemism.  And, bought into it and believed it.  And, if it was laying in front of me it was something I was supposed to have.  That's just it.  And, it's not going out asking anybody for anything, everybody was coming and asking me for the talent.  And, so, it was just, I was having a ball.  And, then the market changed.  I had no concept of markets changing.  It remind me when the district changed when, when I, you know, as, when I was back at Oakenwald [Oakenwald School, Chicago, Illinois] when they handed me my pink paper and said, you know, "They changed the district." They changed the district on me.  What are you talking about?  And, and the market went digital.  And, it was, at first it was just a glimmer and then it became a glow, then it became huge.
Speaker 1: And, then that's, that's huge because TV and print all of that had, it just--
Speaker 2: It just had a--
Speaker 1: --it blew up.
Speaker 2: Blew, it blew up and had a incredible effect on my core expertise which was traditional advertising.  Absolutely.  And, it was experiential because how people viewed digital, how they work with it, and clients loved it because they didn't have to pay the huge dollars that they were paying on--in traditional media.  So, and then the position that digital and how it worked versus traditional media was so totally different.
Story_ID: 671048
Speaker 1: And, the ability to have a decent discourse in the area was, was quite different, so.  And, then the dollars on the traditional media side began being minimized in many ways and the questions of, you know, when you go out and ask blacks, "Do you wanna be targeted?"  Well, we're taught that targeting is bad.  We don't really understand that that's where the money is.  And, they're like, "No, don't target me," (laughter).  "No, don't talk to me, go talk to somebody else."  And, so, those strategies began employed and being used to minimize the value of cultural advertising.
Speaker 2: So, but, when do you feel you made the crossover to culture?  Was it with, it was somewhere in between the beginning of your ag- you know, the beginning of your agency [Carol H. Williams Advertising].  'Cause--did you start out you think as a cultural--?
Speaker 1: No.  My initial assignments were all mass market assignments.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But, then, you know, clients who really wanted to get to be number one in their marketplace and understand how to address, how to talk to African Americans in particular were, you know, they would seek that information because we are just such a prolific consumer.  And, we will definitely drive a product to be number one in the marketplace.  And, we, we're very loyal.  But, the way we think about a great deal of products are, are different than how the mass market thinks about it.  So, the way into the market a lot of times is, is quite different.
Story_ID: 671049
Speaker 1: So where are you now then?  Let me ask that question, you know, because it has been--I mean, first of all, I said 2000 but is that when you felt it?  Because there were several--well, I think the early 2000s there'd been several--
Speaker 2: The change came in the early 2000s. When I really started feeling it was about maybe about 2006, 2007.
Speaker 1: But, don't you have, still have an advantage because you understand mass market?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean, no one in the advertising business doubts my expertise.  They know who I am.  The name is a gold standard, and, and we put out great advertising [at Carol H. Williams Advertising].  But, it's just really trying to figure out in this, today's marketplace, how you navigate these waters, and getting the right people in the right places with the, with the right clients on the other side.  You gotta remember that the people that ran the marketplaces in, in the '90s [1990s] and stuff were all my peers and my friends and people with the, you know, most of them have retired and have moved on.  There is a whole different bunch of people running the marketplace now.  People who are in many ways kids to me, and, and their information is there.  They don't understand the old school creatives and how we approach the marketplace, and some of 'em don't have appreciation for it.  And, and we're not, we're not peers.  And, they've heard of the name, they respect the name, but they don't know me.
Speaker 1: Well, that is happening really all over the place.  I mean, all throughout the media landscape.  You know, whether it's print or--
Speaker 2: Print, TV (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) TV, movies.
Speaker 2: --movies.  It's all over the place.  And so, there's just upheaval, but I think when it settles down it'll be as it was.
Speaker 1: You do?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, that's fascinating.  Can we explore that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, the way you look at, the way you look at, the way people in which--the way in which people consume digital advertising through their computers and stuff, totally different than the way in which the television commands you.  And, you mostly look at, and the, and the--although they like to call the computer a social media, it's a social media in terms of the engagement with someone.  But, you're isolated as it relates to the computer.  You are--it's you and the computer and what your control is.  So, you more control the, control the computer.  They don't have that kind, for whatever reason they don't control the TV that way.  And, so, therefore, they look at the TV and consume it sometimes in family units with other people.  Their discourse in consuming the television is a little bit different and their engagement with it is different.  So, as a result, we find on many levels with certain culture groups and interpretive communities that the television is still king.  It's more powerful.
Speaker 1: You know, I heard someone say that recently, you know, because I was predicting that everything was gonna be moved to computers.  But, the young people are not using TV in that way.
Speaker 2: No.  No, they are, they do use TV that way.  They're just more selective in what they use it for.
Story_ID: 671050
Speaker 1: So, where do you see the future then, of, of C- you know, your agency [Carol H. Williams Advertising] in the industry itself?
Speaker 2: Well, I do feel that in order for any agency to survive, it has to have a digital product to it, aspect to it.  But, then, when you look at digital the way it's been developed, it is often said that digital doesn't recognize any race.  It's a, it is hugely discussed.  I'm still looking at it.  I don't think that's so.
Speaker 1: That it knows no race?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I agree with that. Yeah, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where do you see the future then?  Let's me ask you about [HistoryMaker] Carol H. Williams.
Speaker 2: In terms of where I'm going?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think we keep moving forward.  Improve and incorporate our digital product and share our strategic basis and continue to have dialogue with our consumers that on whatever means is necessary or medium is necessary.  That's who we are and keep putting first class communication and film out to 'em.
Speaker 1: Now, so, you're still sh- you're still on the TV side shooting and, you're still doing that?
Speaker 2: Well, when I shoot television, certain clients love it and will not depart from it.  Especially, depending on who you talk to.  But, we're shooting a lot of webisodes and, and putting banners and putting websites or the creation of websites on, on there.  So, the creativity has been reapplied and readdressed in another way.  But, in order to, to accomplish that and different intellects haven't been able--have to be brought to the table that really understands the medium.
Story_ID: 671051
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I have just some, some more philosophical questions to ask.  When you--have you seen a young you out there?
Speaker 2: I have not.  But, I have not seen a young you either.  So, I don't know what that necessarily means.  I've seen a lot of young people who are creative but they're doing it their own way.  They're not doing it my way, necessarily.  They're doing it my own--their own way.  I--it's very hard, you know, my father [Clarence Williams] once told me when we were watching Michael Jordan, he said, "Take a long look at that young man right there because when he leaves, you'll never see him again."  And, then I hear people compare Kobe Bryant.  I hear him--them compare this kid on the Miami Heat, and this new kid that's in, Derrick, that's in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Derrick Rose.
Speaker 2: They're great talents and they do their own thing but they're not Michael Jordan.  And, that's all right.  So, that's what I mean.  No, I have not seen Carol [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams] but I'm not sure I'm supposed to.  Carol was Carol, and that's--it.  I did my job.  Let's see Elizabeth.
Story_ID: 671052
Speaker 1: So, if you were to live your life again, over again, how would you change it?  Would you?
Speaker 2: I would not.  I'd be a little thinner now.  I'd take a little more exercise in my earlier days.  But, I'd do everything that I did right over just with more passion, all the good stuff, all the bad stuff; everything.  I'd--just with more zeal.  I have enjoyed immensely being a black female.  I wouldn't have it any way--other way.  Penetrating the world of advertising, learning from who I learned from, doing what I've done, loving who I've loved, it's been a ball.  I'm just getting started.
Story_ID: 671053
Speaker 1: And, when your, your husband passed away, how was that for you?
Speaker 2: When my husband passed away--Tip [Tipkins Hood] was such a brilliant man but I'm--greatly miss his intellect and his interchange.  But, then I realized that Tip had done his job and at real special moments, I can hear him telling me, "You need to go home and sit down," (laughter).  "It's okay Carol [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams], it's cool.  What are you talking about Carol, I'm over here saving lives and you're making funny pictures," you know, and I smile.  And, I have to smile because again all the questions came.  I didn't know why he was, why he left.  Why he was taken away.  Why that was all right.  But, then the acceptance of that and the grace of God delivers you and you move on.  What can you say?
Story_ID: 671054
Speaker 1: Now, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: The service of mankind.  Greatest thrill I have in life is when I go somewhere and someone says to me, some young kid says to me, "I heard you speak," or, "I saw this," or, "I read this about you.  And, as a result, I did this, this, this or this."  What a marvelous thing.  What a marvelous thing.  Creativity I think is the greatest intelligence one can have.  And, and the following of that creativity leads you to find things of yourself that can--powers that you never knew you had.  To be able to write something and say people will laugh here, here, here, and here.  And, then you put that out there and they laugh hear, hear, hear and hear.  Oh, my god.  What a God like experience.  To be able to influence, bring a smile to their face or healing to their soul.  That's what it's all about.  And, to be able to teach these kids how to do this, how to own their creativity and make it blossom into these kind of things that they thought they could never get to; it's great, wonderful.  So, right now that's what I wanna leave.  I wanna leave the power of creativity.
Story_ID: 671055
Speaker 1: I know that in your career you transcended race one would say at least in part.  So, what hopes or concerns do you have for the black community?
Speaker 2: I was--I am deeply, deeply concerned about us understanding who we are and what our responsibility is and recognizing we do have a responsibility as blacks.  I own my slavery and wear it like a badge because where I am now only says that I got to be a helluva person to have overcome that and be where I am and do what I did.  And, I can feel all of my ancestors and my parents [Betty Norment Williams and Clarence Williams] smiling on me with love and warmth every single day of my life.  It's very important.  They give us they labels.  I have known Negroes, colored people, African Americans, and others, whatever that is.  And, I can say that Negroes are absolutely the most incredible, powerful, strongest, most imaginative, intelligent people.  What they did, what they did is amazing.  What they did now that we've got them thinking, was absolutely amazing.  And, they gave birth to African Americans and we're walking around with our pants showing our asses.  Is that what those Negroes lived for?  Is that what they actually gave birth to?  Let's start thinking again.  Why are we here?  What are we supposed to be doing?
