Story_ID: 466270
Speaker 1: So we're gonna start, we're gonna talk about your family tree basically, and we will start with your mother's side of the family, and then as far back as you can go, and we will talk about your father's [William T. Williams, Sr.] side as far back as you can go.  So if you can give me your mother's full name and date of birth.
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Hazel Davis [Hazel Davis Williams].  Her date of birth, 2/10/22 [February 10, 1922].
Speaker 1: And her place of birth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And her place of birth is, I think, Hamlet, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: So she was born in the early '20s [1920s] in the South.  Did she ever talk to you about what her childhood was like in South- this is North Carolina?
Speaker 2: North Carolina.
Speaker 1: North Carolina.
Speaker 2: She did, she did.
Speaker 1: What did she say?
Speaker 2: It was hard.  She grew up basically in the rural South at a time when there was no running water.  There were basically no roads into the area that she lived in except dirt roads.  No electric, and very few jobs, so I think it was a minimal existence that they had, and as she said, she left North Carolina as soon as she could as a child.
Speaker 1: How old was she when she left?
Speaker 2: I think, well not as a child, she actually left when she was twenty-two years old.
Speaker 1: Twenty-two.  So what did she do during that time?  I mean did they farm on the land?  Were they, to make a living how did they, what did the family do?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother is one of four daughters, raised by my grandmother So- Sophia Jackson [Sophia Davis Jackson].
Speaker 1: Sophia Jackson.  What's her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Ah, my grandmother was born March 10, 1896, and she died I guess around eight years ago.  She died at ninety-nine.
Speaker 1: Wow. So she was born, Sophia Jackson was born also in that small town in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: She was born in North Carolina as well, the same area.
Speaker 1: Okay, so go on, she had four daughters.
Speaker 2: She had four daughters, Marie [Marene Davis], Lenard [Lenard Davis], Janie [Janice Davis] and Hazel.  Three of the daughters are living, as is my mother.  They are all in their eighties and late eighties now, and they all live within a mile of each other, proximity in New York [New York].  So they have stayed very close together as a tight-knit family.
Speaker 1: So what did they do, collectively, the four girls, your mother, for a living in the Carolinas during the early days?
Speaker 2: Well, during the summer they worked on farms, other people's farms.  During the winter I think they just tried to survive as best they could because basically there were no job opportunities whatsoever.  Basically, the only thing there was an [U.S.] Army base.
Speaker 1: Could they work on the Army base being black?  Were they allowed to work on the Army base?
Speaker 2: Ah, they could in really menial jobs.
Speaker 1: As janitors or domestics?
Speaker 2: As domestics. Janitors.  I think most of the work that was done was primarily in farming, agriculture, of one sort or another.
Speaker 1: Was it cotton that was in North Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was tobacco.
Speaker 1: Tobacco, okay.
Speaker 2: That's basically what my grandmother never worked for anyone else other than herself.  She was pretty much self-sufficient.
Speaker 1: So she had the farm, she had a farm.
Speaker 2: She did not have a farm, that was the--
Speaker 1: Oh, but she worked on other people's farm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, worked on other people's farms all the time.  And the daughters as they got older, basically migrated away from North Carolina one at a time.  First to Baltimore [Maryland], one to Baltimore, and then the other three to New York.
Speaker 1: And did Sophia continue to live her entire life in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: She did not.  She, my grandmother moved to New York in the late '50s [1950s].  The daughters finally just decided, she was in her, she was in her sixties at that point, to bring her to New York, or she decided to come, and she lived the rest of her life in New York.
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk about school in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: She did.  My mother and all of her sisters all graduated from high school.  That was one of the things that my grandmother was, I guess, adamant about, was the idea of education and that they would graduate.  Basically, they had to walk to school.  They, obviously, they grew up in kind of segregated school systems.  I think in given my knowledge of the three sisters or the four sisters, the remarkable thing is one, they had no southern accent whatsoever.  Two, they were all sensible, kind of down-to-earth women.
Speaker 1: Who did they know in New York?  Why did they come to New York?
Speaker 2: They came to New York because my father was in the [U.S. military] service and when he was discharged he came back through New York and then back to North Carolina.  At that point one of his brothers was in New York and he decided that he was going to come back, get the family and move to New York.
Story_ID: 466271
Speaker 1: Now you, we talked about Sophia [Sophia Davis Jackson], your, your [maternal] grandmother, do you know your grandfather's date of birth, his full name?
Speaker 2: I never met my mother's [Hazel Davis Williams] father.
Speaker 1: So Sophia Jackson was this single mom, she did this on her own.
Speaker 2: She was a single mom at that point.  I never, I never met him.  He passed away before I was, I guess, conscious of him.  If I did meet him, I wasn't conscious of it.  My grandmother's second husband, Elbert Jackson, I met and spent some considerable time with him.
Speaker 1: Because you would go back to--
Speaker 2: I would go back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) during the summers.
Speaker 2: I would go back to North Carolina every year until I was sixteen years old, and spend basically three months on the farm, three months.  By that time my grandmother had moved to another area, to Spring Lake, North Carolina.  And then in Spring Lake, there was a piece of land.  There was an extended kind of land of the Jacksons'.
Story_ID: 466272
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Hazel Davis Williams] say they did for joy?  What brought them joy in the midst of all of the hardship?
Speaker 2: I think family, each other, music.  Music was an important part--
Speaker 1: Music, and let's talk about, did they, what kind of music, who are the people she listened to?
Speaker 2: Well, they listened to a lot of blues.  My grandmother's [Sophia Davis Jackson] father was blind, but he was also a musician.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness.  What was my great-grandfather's name?  Thomas, Thomas.
Speaker 1: And he was a musician?
Speaker 2: Thomas Davis [ph.].  He was a blind musician that played the fiddle/violin.  I guess he was relatively well-known in that area.
Speaker 1: And he made a living playing music, pretty much?
Speaker 2: That was the way he made a living.  My mother, the music that I remember when I lived in the South, it was either the blues, rhythm and blues, or gospel music, and country western.  That was on the radio constantly as I grew up.
Story_ID: 466273
Speaker 1: Did they go to church down south?
Speaker 2: They did, we did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What type of church?
Speaker 2: Methodist, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 1: So they went to an African Methodist.  Was it in the town or the town close by?
Speaker 2: It was not in the town, again, we lived out in a rural situation and the church was actually in the rural situation.  It was a dirt road that actually lead to the church, and all of the extended families, the Williams family, my father's [William T. Williams, Sr.] family, lived in that area.  And, if I went to church, basically I would have probably fifteen of my aunts or uncles there, you know, thirty of my cousins in church, and then more extended family as well.  Pretty much every one in that church would have been some distant relationship of mine.
Speaker 1: And who was the pastor?  Was he related to you as well?
Speaker 2: The pastor at that point was not related to me.
Speaker 1: Had he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a Reverend Glover [ph.] as I remember.
Speaker 1: Reverend Glover?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Had the pastor prior to him, was he related to you?  Was there ever any time when there was someone in the family that was a preacher who ran that particular church?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't remember that.  In my family now, there are one, two, three, four, there are five ministers, so the church obviously had a, a huge impact on my family.
Story_ID: 466274
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father some.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did- where--what's his full name and his date of birth?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is William Thomas Williams [William T. Williams, Sr.] and he was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Date of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad's date of birth is 2/10/22 [February 10, 1922].  He was born on the same day that my [maternal] grandmother [Sophia Davis Jackson] was born on.
Speaker 1: And what did he, did he ever talk about his childhood?  Was his similar to your mom's [Hazel Davis Williams] or different?
Speaker 2: Similar.  My dad is one of thirteen kids.  Very impoverished background.  The difference is my father was in a situation where they owned the land so farming was a great deal.  My dad and his brothers all had jobs, pretty much got jobs at the [U.S.] Army base in one form or another.
Speaker 1: Is that Fort Bragg [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It's Fort Bragg.  But what they, what they really, the place that I grew is near, right next to something called Overhill [sic. Overhills, North Carolina].  Overhill is an estate that's owned by the Rockefellers.  It's a riding estate, just basically horses, and my family in one form or another worked on, at Overhill since it was, its inception.  I could walk out of my grandmother's door and within a hundred feet I would be on that riding estate.  And I could wander through the woods as a child in (unclear) and be on it.  It was, I think it was like thirty thousand acres or something.  It was just a very, very large place.  So that kind of, Overhill really surrounded where we lived on three sides.
Speaker 1: Did you live there because they worked at Overhill, or did it just, circumstances happened to work out that you were so close (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was, I think it was just circumstances that somehow this little hamlet of people was there and this estate kind of made itself around it.  And the happenstance is, is the two things.  Some of my relatives still work there.  It just developed that way.
Speaker 1: And so for generations and generations, you've had people working there, Overhill?
Speaker 2: Yep.  I think it's a circumstance of on one side you had Fort Bragg, the Army, the large Army installation, and then you had Overhill, so it was a very large chunk of land, probably a hundred thousand acres that's taken up between those two places.  So in a sense there's a kind of protected little hamlet that we lived in (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That will never be developed.
Speaker 2: Well, Overhill has since sold its interest to the Army base, so the Army base now is basically on three sides of this small little hamlet that my relatives still live in.
Speaker 1: So did your father work at Overhill?
Speaker 2: My father worked as a child in Overhill.  And then later on after he was drafted into the service, he came back and basically took off and came to New York [New York] and then worked for the U.S. Army in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 466275
Speaker 1: So he [Williams' father, William T. Williams, Sr.] was drafted, for--in what year? Do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was drafted in the Second World War [World War II, WWII] in 1942.
Speaker 1: And do you know what he, what his job was, in the [U.S.] Army, was he?
Speaker 2: My dad was a cook in the service.  That was his job all the way through the time he was in the service.
Speaker 1: Because he joined or was drafted during the time the service was legally segregated?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he would have, did you, did he ever talk about his experiences in the Army?
Speaker 2: He talked about traveling, because he was in North Africa.  He was in the Middle East, I think it was Morocco.
Speaker 1: What did he say about Africa?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  He just talks about being in Morocco when they were there.  He was in Italy, he was in France and I guess when he came back he had seen--
Speaker 1: Some of the world, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: -- (simultaneous) you know, yeah, he's been off the farm and he immediately kind of didn't want to go back to the farm, moved to New York.
Story_ID: 466276
Speaker 1: When did he [Williams' father, William T. Williams, Sr.] and y-, when did he meet your mother [Hazel Davis Williams], when did they meet?
Speaker 2: I think they went to school together.  That would be my, my summation is that they probably went to the same high school because it was only one high school in that area for people of color.
Speaker 1: And then they decide to come to New York [New York] together after his stint in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: They came to New York.  They left me in North Carolina with my grandmother [Sophia Davis Jackson], which was the norm, and a year later--
Speaker 1: They sent for you?
Speaker 2: --they sent for me and I came to New York.
Speaker 1: But you, did you, so you only stayed in the Carol- you were born in '42 [1942]?
Speaker 2: I was born in '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: He was drafted in what '40 [1940]?
Speaker 2: He was drafted in '42 [1942], '41 [1941]. Yeah.
Speaker 1: So then you spent a very short amount of time in the South, you, as far as living a little boy.
Speaker 2: I spent--living in the South, I probably spent six years.  I came to New York, went to kindergarten here.  My parents sent me back to North Carolina.  I went to the first grade in North Carolina, and then they sent for me to come back and then I went through the rest of my schooling in New York.
Speaker 1: Was it, did you see a difference as a little boy in the North and the South?  Could you tell that the places were vastly different?
Speaker 2: The schooling was vastly different.  The difference was my aunts were my teachers when I came to North Carolina, so discipline was immediate.
Speaker 1: So because they were teachers?
Speaker 2: They were teachers.  There was absolutely no, there was no discipline problems in the classroom because everyone was either a cousin of mine or, so discipline was immediate, physical, absolute.  I think the difference that I saw a problem, certainly I was aware of the segregated nature of the South. The difference (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even at five years old?
Speaker 2: Well, it's almost impossible not to know.  You go, at that point you went to the movies, the movies were segregated.  It was upstairs, downstairs.  The buses were segregated, you know, the lunch counters were segregated.  It would impossible not to know that.  It would be impossible also not to know that the communities themselves were segregated.  The churches were segregated, so I, I think, there's no way for me not to have experienced that and not to have known that.  I think the other difference between the two places, say the South, in the South I was in an environment where extended family was around me.  All the houses that literally were around where I lived were either an aunt or an uncle or a cousin's home, so I could wander from house to house to house all day and be in a very protective environment.  If I didn't come home at night, my grandmother could basically could start, at the time she had this (makes sound) and people would look up and they would locate me that way, where I was.  And so there was a comfort zone there in terms of this, this environment that I grew up in.  But it was also, it was a very rural kind of isolated environment with nature and with work and with family.
Story_ID: 466277
Speaker 1: Well that, like the, the calling for you sounds like a very traditional sort of African method of, you know, you--in getting you home.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Were there any other traditional sort of rituals that you, that were within that community within the family, like as far as maybe foods or any sort of traditional things you can think of?  The calling's a good one though.
Speaker 2: Well, my, probably the way I grew up it was similar to anyone that grew up in the rural environment.  Basically your diet is based upon what you can grow and what you can raise.  Very little beef because cows were just not raised and certainly they were not used as a food source, so primarily you're being raised on fish, chicken and pork.  And what can be grown in the garden, and what flourishes within that kind of way of growing and that way of subsisting, and a great deal of what you grow has to last through the, the winter, so it was a great deal of canning and a great deal of large rituals in, like hog killing time.  That was a time when the whole community came together to help to do that.  There was a great deal of--
Speaker 1: But, let's talk about that for a moment because other people have, you know, just a bit--so in the community because everyone was extended family, would purchase this hog together and--or somehow and then everyone would benefit from the distribution of it?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Everyone probably, everyone had their own livestock in this case, but the slaughtering of it and the dressing of it was in most cases going to be a communal thing.  There would be extended hands to help do it and help the process.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I do remember that.
Speaker 1: Was it something that was grotesque as a kid or something that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at all, not at all.  It was a part of living and growing up on a farm.  It's not something that you would think of, you know, twice, for instance.  You raised chickens and your grandmother would say, you know, go get a chicken for dinner and your job is to go out and get a chicken and to--
Speaker 1: Ring its neck.
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) we didn't ring, you know what, they didn't ring it.  They cut the head off (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) That's what they used to say in Mississippi but no, you know, okay--
Speaker 2: But the whole, the whole point is, is because so much of what we think of now is going to the grocery store, going to Pathmark [Pathmark Stores, Inc.] and getting something and that whole process, when I grew up in the South, that didn't exist.  I mean basically you raised your chickens, you raised, you know, hogs, you grew vegetables.  You exchanged vegetables among family.  You helped families out that, that ran out of food.  When canning time came, you would have four or five of my aunts would be in my [maternal] grandmother's [Sophia Davis Jackson] kitchen doing this.  It would be an all-day affair.
Speaker 1: Well what could they can, tomatoes?
Speaker 2: They--tomatoes, string beans--
Speaker 1: Okra.
Speaker 2: --okra, peppers--
Speaker 1: Peppers, peaches
Speaker 2: Peaches, absolutely peaches.
Speaker 1: Cucumbers they pickled?
Speaker 2: No, not too many cucumbers.  Butterbeans.
Speaker 1: Butterbeans.  I haven't thought about butterbeans in a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Field peas, right. Field peas, cabbage.  You would have all of that, that's what I grew up with and that experience of growing up in the South is one that I would never exchange for anything.
Speaker 1: That's probably why they lived so long.  All that healthy eating and the, you know, growing your own food and, you know, a chicken that hasn't been processed at all, he, you know, he's alive, and you free range.
Speaker 2: Well, you got that, but got all of that salt also on the other hand because, you know, the other, the backside of that is there is no refrigeration, so you eat fresh in terms of vegetables during the summer, but during the winter you're doing just the opposite, you're eating foods that have been saved with an extraordinary amount of salt, which is leading to, you know, all the problems we know now that salt causes.
Speaker 1: So to preserve those they would have to use a lot of salt to make it--?
Speaker 2: To preserve the meats.
Speaker 1: To preserve the meat you salt it and fr- okay?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So you were authentic country boy.
Speaker 2: I am an authentic country boy that went hunting.
Speaker 1: That is fantastic.  What did you hunt for?
Speaker 2: Deer, rabbit.  I literally grew up in a very rural situation where people did that, and still do it.
Speaker 1: This, I mean, yeah.  My uncles hunted rabbits and deer and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I can remember them bringing them all back and having to take the skins off on the clothesline, you know, you slit the--incredible times.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, that, that's kind of, it's not something that was unique to me.  It's something that I think many people who grew up that are my age, in the mid-sixties, have experienced that, or some form of that.  It might have been more severe for us because of where we lived.  We were not literally in a city, but in a rural environment.
Story_ID: 466278
Speaker 1: But I think that the, the porch, the extended porch in the late evenings, you know, after everything had been done, the exchanging of stories, the laughter, the joke-telling, I would never exchange any of that experience for anything that I, you know, that could have come if I wasn't there.  One of the, the fond memories, and I always kind of relate this, is my [maternal] grandmother [Sophia Davis Jackson] made all of the kids rake the yard in the late evenings.  And this was a ritual every day, work is over, dinner is over, kids have to go out and rake the front yard and she would meticulously instruct us of how to do it.  You couldn't just rake it, the patterns that were there, she was really very particular about the patterns and forces us to go back and really kind of manicure this yard the way she wanted it manicured.  And the odd thing, I was in Japan many, many, many years later, and saw a temple where the sand had been raked and it was like a thunderbolt had hit me, between that experience as a child and raking the yard out front, and this experience of having seen that in Japan.  Two things came together, and an aesthetic experience came to me, you know, the, it was more than just her implanting labor for us, she was implanting an idea about an aesthetic and about a, a kind of spiritual environment that she was cultivating, and certainly she was transmitting a kind of body of information to us as well.
Speaker 2: Where had that information come from, do you know?
Speaker 1: I have no idea.  My grandmother's house had flowers on three sides.  It is the thing that she spent the most time in, in this garden, other than working.  Once work was over, there were two passions, the yard out front and the garden, and there were just endless flowers.  There were some in the ground, some in buckets.  She would move these jars and buckets around, but that's, that's what I really remember about the South, a great deal of that.
Story_ID: 466279
Speaker 1: Coming to an urban environment, what traditions take, what traditions are rooted here that were not in the South?  I mean, you're still the same family, so what do you do in an urban environment to sort of keep the family together and to establish traditions?
Speaker 2: The interesting thing is when each one of my relatives came to New York [New York], they all came through one apartment and that was my Aunt Catherine's [Catherine Williams] apartment.  Everyone stayed there until they got their own place.  And my Aunt Catherine's apartment also was the place where the family met, probably every three weeks.  All the brothers and sisters and all the kids came to this apartment.  And it usually be either a Friday night or a Saturday night and it was kind of an extended family thing, very much like the rural South, and I think it was their way of holding on to the southern experience.  It certainly was the way of, of holding the family together.
Speaker 1: We have about two minutes left on this tape, but I want to talk about before we move away from your family, I wanted you to speak on the arts and crafts in the family.   They built furniture, the quilts, and I want to talk about that.
Story_ID: 466280
Speaker 1: So we're going to talk about the arts and crafts, [maternal] grandmother [Sophia Davis Jackson], who else built things and what did they build?
Speaker 2: The house that we lived in was built by the extended family.  Basically, the men came together and built all the houses in that whole area.  They were all built by the young extended families.  My grandfather was, Elbert Jackson I'm talking about, did chairs, kind of weaving of chairs, caning.  Grandmother and extended aunts and uncles made quilts.  If you walked through the woods in, all the houses there's always quilts on the line that had been made.  And they made things out of clay because where we lived, there was a clay bank, so a lot, you find a lot of things, forms, that had been made out of clay, bowls and things.
Speaker 1: For use or purely for--
Speaker 2: Purely aesthetic.  They were just forms that would just sit there, maybe catch water or put plants in 'em or something, but not used in terms of drinking or anything of that nature.
Speaker 1: Did that have any effect on you as a child?  Did you see that they were creating something artistic or, what did you think about it, what they were doing?
Speaker 2: I don't think I ever, I don't think I ever really, it was there, you know, it was a part of the way I grew up what I saw and it never, it never really dawned on me very much.  I think later when I was in art school, I started looking back at the things that I did, the way things were organized, the way people built things and began to kind of think a great deal about that.
Speaker 1: Did you ever cane?
Speaker 2: I did not, I did not.  I never learned how to do that.  Probably the thing that had the biggest influence on me were quilts, certainly quilts, the notion of constructing something through parts.  It's very much the way I still make, make art, the part to the whole.  The other thing that I can remember that had a huge influence on me was the whole tobacco thing, because there was the process of raising tobacco, then you'd go to the barn to cure the tobacco, and then the most interesting process is the grading of the tobacco, where the leaves have to be separated in relation to tone.  And you separate all of these leaves in terms of the tone of them and any nuance that's inside of it.  So that selection process was one that happens in the latter part of the summer and is probably the most contemplative part of that, the whole process, and that process I remember a great deal.  And these ranges of these incredible golden tones and they're being laid out across the porch, and, you know, piled three, four feet high all the way across.  I think that process had an enormous impact on me.  And certainly it's something that I still think about a great deal.
Speaker 1: In all those tones were all golds and browns.  You were trying to put the, they were organizing them in color from the, had to do with how dry it was?
Speaker 2: How, it was organized in terms of how much heat had hit them.  It was the darker leaves are sold for one thing.  The golden leaves are sold for something else and there was the ones that are closer to the golden tone, is you're going to get a higher price for those when you take 'em to auction.  Then you are the ones that have a streak of green in 'em are the ones that are too dark.  Some go for cigarettes, some go for cigars, so, you know when you, you can spend the whole summer doing this and then you fire it in the barn.  If you don't take it out at the right time, it's gets either too dark or it's not cured enough, and, you know, your whole profit is gone, so that the keenness of the eye of the farmer and then the keenness of the eye of the people that are grading it becomes extraordinarily important in terms of survival.

Speaker 1: So back to New York City [New York, New York], where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to elementary school in Jamaica, Queens [New York], first, and then my parents [Hazel Davis Williams and William T. Williams, Sr.] moved to Far Rockaway [Queens, New York], and I went to, in Far Rockaway I went to P.S. 39 [Queens, New York] and from P.S. 39 I went to Junior High School 198 [J.H.S. 198, Benjamin N. Cardozo Junior High School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one brother, or had one brother.  He just passed away a few months ago.  He was older, James [James Williams] and I did not grow up together.  James grew up in North Carolina, I grew up in New York.  Oddly enough, my brother was a professional soldier, career soldier, and came out of the [U.S. military] service and then became a minister.  So a real shift in his occupations.
Story_ID: 466282
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what do you remember about your childhood in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, Far Rockaway [Queens, New York] was a, when we moved from Jamaica, Queens [New York], to Far Rockaway, it was a drastic change because Far Rockaway is, is not quite, it's urban, but it's not urban.  It's near the beach, so you have huge expanses of ocean that's there, and openness.  We moved from Jamaica into a public housing project called Redfern [Redfern Houses, Queens, New York] and we moved in it and when Redfern was just being built.  Redfern was basically in a black community that was surrounded on one side by a Jewish community and an Italian section on another side, and then a small Irish section on another side.  The elementary school brought all those elements together in P.S. 39 [Queens, New York].  P.S. 39 was a good school in terms of academic.  Its downside though was you could be in 3-1 or you could be in 3-15, and there was a hierarchy, literally.  If you were in 3-1 you had excellent teachers.  If you were in 3-15, you probably had less of, less than a positive situation.  So it's a lot of kids in a, in a small elementary school.  I think I got a fairly good education when I was there.
Speaker 1: Who were the teachers there that inspired you or helped you along?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any of the teachers, literally, from elementary school, other than elementary school in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And in North Carolina, they were your relatives.
Speaker 2: They were my relatives.
Story_ID: 466283
Speaker 1: The first teachers that I can remember are junior high school.
Speaker 2: Where did you go to junior high school--
Speaker 1: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) P.S. 1--?
Speaker 1: I went to Junior High School 198 [J.H.S. 198, Benjamin N. Cardozo Junior High School] in Auburn, Queens [New York], and that was about forty blocks from where we lived.
Speaker 2: That's quite a distance.
Speaker 1: You had to take a bus and it was the first time they built the junior high school and then this really brought a lot of different elements together.  It brought the people from Far Rockaway [Queens, New York], the people from Hammels [Queens, New York], which is another large black community, and then people from even farther back, a more wealthy situation, together in one place.
Speaker 2: All black?
Speaker 1: Not all black.  198 was probably 25 percent black, 75 percent non-black.  It brought elements from Howard Beach [Queens, New York].  I mean really, really diverse, diverse neighborhoods together.  A great deal of tension.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was going to ask how did it work.
Speaker 1: An extraordinary amount of tension.  There were sometimes twenty-eight different, like you would be in 9-1 and 9-28.  I mean lots and lots of classes.
Story_ID: 466284
Speaker 1: For me it was a situation, there was one teacher named Mrs. Ross [ph.] and Mrs. Ross was the art teacher and somehow Mrs. Ross was also my homeroom teacher and she found that I was interested in art.
Speaker 2: How had you become interested in art?
Speaker 1: I just started doodling.  As a young child, when we lived in, in Jamaica [Queens, New York], when the art classes came up, I guess it was something I like.  There was, we lived, the house we lived in was next to a printing plant, and in the evening they would throw out all these little pieces of paper.
Speaker 2: Down south?
Speaker 1: No in New York [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) New York, okay.
Speaker 1: And I would get these little pieces of paper and draw on them, and it was, every evening was endless supply of paper to draw on, that you just had to go and take it and draw on.  And that stuck with me.  And that was the beginning.  Mrs. Ross kind of furthered my interest in art.
Speaker 2: And how did she do that?
Speaker 1: She did it in two ways, books.
Speaker 2: What books?
Speaker 1: Most of the books I remember was how to draw, you know, how to draw horses, how to draw birds.  There were, there were kind of instructional books.  Very little on particular artists, but much more on how to do mechanical kind of how to do books.  There was another guy named Tommy Heemans [Tom Heemans] who was the social worker in the community center in Redfern [Redfern Houses, Queens, New York] that also had an interest in art and he became an extraordinary influence.  He was an African American man, had gone to Niagara University [Niagara University, New York], was playing semi-professional basketball.  He was a basketball star at Niagara, and he became the social worker, community center director, and he provided me with my first studio in the community center, gave me a room.
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: I was at that point sixteen, seventeen.
Speaker 2: And you were producing work that he could look at and then say you should have some space for a studio?
Speaker 1: Yeah, by that time I was going to high school in Manhattan [New York].  I had taken an exam after junior high school [J.H.S. 198, Benjamin N. Cardozo Junior High School, Queens, New York].  I took an exam and got into the High School of Art and Design [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York].  The High School of Art Design is one of four, five, I think, high schools in New York, that are called special high schools, whatever that means.
Speaker 2: So the junior high school teacher, Mrs.--
Speaker 1: Mrs. Ross.
Speaker 2: --Ross, had prepped you enough to get you ready, at least take the exam for the art and design high school?
Speaker 1: I think so, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that was in your mind that you wanted to go an art and design school--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --after junior high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What did your parents [Hazel Davis Williams and William T. Williams, Sr.] think about that?
Speaker 1: My parents were totally enthusiastic.  They said go for it.  You know my parents never, never questioned once when I said I wanted to be an artist.  They just said go for it.
Story_ID: 466285
Speaker 1: Who had you seen?  Had you seen any other art up to this point that had the art itself inspired you?
Speaker 2: I met Jacob Lawrence when I was fourteen years old and Jacob Lawrence was teaching at something called the Five Towns Community Center [Lawrence, New York].  The Five Towns, Cedarhurst [New York] is right next to Far Rockaway [Queens, New York] where I had grown up and Tommy Heemans [Tom Heemans] had said, "There's this famous African American art, artist that teaches over here and you should go and meet him."  And I finally got up enough courage to go and, you know, said my name and I'm interested in art, and he was very gracious and, you know, talked to me and--
Speaker 1: What did he say to you?
Speaker 2: To draw a lot, to read about art as much as possible, try to get to museums.  You know I had no, no clue of any of that kind of stuff, and, but basically, I guess the three or four times that I saw him there, he was always encouraging, you know, are you drawing, are you doing this, are you doing that?  The ironic part is I meet Jacob Lawrence much later when I'm a student at Skowhegan School in Maine [Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine], and the summer I was there, he comes up.  And then he comes to Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York], and the last when I'm a senior at Pratt getting ready to graduate, he spends his, that year teaching at Pratt.  So it's like this, this reunion of this person I had met early on that certainly was a influence and certainly told me that as an African American I could be an artist.  His body of work was the first body of work of an African American that I came in contact with.
Speaker 1: And where did you come in contact with it?
Speaker 2: Again, junior high school [J.H.S. 198, Benjamin N. Cardozo Junior High School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: In junior high school.
Speaker 2: Tommy Heemans, and he was certainly the first, he was the first practicing African American artist that I came in contact with.  There was one who taught at the High School of Art and Design [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York] named Mr. Brown [ph.]. I don't remember his first name, but they, the two of them were the first artists that I came in contact with.
Story_ID: 466286
Speaker 1: So when you saw what Jacob Lawrence was doing did that, was that sort of a turning point or light bulb moment for you to say I want to be a painter?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, no, at that point I was interested in art, but I was more interested in design.
Speaker 1: And by de- design, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Making a living, basically, you know wanting to go into advertising, wanting to go into commercial art (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Commercial side.
Speaker 2: Right, where I could make a living.  I went to Art and Design [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see you take the test.
Speaker 2: I take the test.
Speaker 1: And you pass the test.  What does the test include?  What's the test?
Speaker 2: The test is basically, you have to draw still life. You have to draw (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you draw?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember.
Speaker 1: Can't remember, okay.
Speaker 2: You have to draw something out of your imagination.  It's a kind of standard idea to begin to see what kind of dexterity you have, what kind of invention you have, pretty straight forward.
Speaker 1: And you'd never taken an art class?
Speaker 2: Only in art school.
Speaker 1: Only in, I mean--
Speaker 2: In junior high school [J.H.S. 198, Benjamin N. Cardozo Junior High School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: --junior high school
Speaker 2: Most of what I'd gotten by that time was just on my own, learning to draw, looking at things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went from picking up all those little pieces of paper from the printing.  So you get into the school.
Speaker 2: Get into the school.
Speaker 1: Is there any hierarchy in this school, like the one through three to one or three to twenty-eight?
Speaker 2: No, this school there are total of four hundred and twelve people in the entire school, in the entire high school.  The high was divided into two buildings.  The ninth and tenth grade is on 51 Street and Lexington Avenue and the eleventh and twelfth is on 79th [Street] and 3rd Avenue.  The Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] becomes an extension of the classroom for us, because it's on 53rd [Street], four blocks away.  So we spend time between the classroom and the Museum of Modern Art.
Story_ID: 466287
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember the first time you went to a museum?
Speaker 2: Tenth grade, when I got to Art and Design [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which museum?
Speaker 2: The first museum, the first museum that I went to in the city was the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what did you think?
Speaker 2: Overwhelmed at the size of the place, the amount of objects that were there.  By the time I got into high school, I spent lots of time there, lots of time at the Met drawing from plaster casts, lots of time at the Modern [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York], going through that collection over and over and over again.  I think the, the luck of the draw that I went to that particular high school and to get to the Modern very early and get to the Met very early, kind of formed me as an artist and helped me as an artist.
Speaker 1: So you still in touch with Thomas [Tom Heemans] when you were at the high school?
Speaker 2: Yes I am.  He's still the community--
Speaker 1: He's still the community?
Speaker 2: Yep, he's still running the community center.
Speaker 1: And so now he gives you this studio?
Speaker 2: He gives me the studio then, but slightly before that when I'm still in junior high school [J.H.S. 198, Benjamin N. Cardozo Junior High School, Queens, New York] there was a room that I had been given to work in.
Speaker 1: And what do you create in this studio?
Speaker 2: I was doing a lot of drawings of kind of flowers and still lifes and just kind of invented stuff at that point, you know, kind of, just trying to learn how to draw at that point.  Not painting, just working in, in basically dry media, some wet media, but not, not much else.
Story_ID: 466288
Speaker 1: Continuing to move, you're at the high school [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I'm at the high school.
Speaker 1: And you have one teacher there that you said was influential?
Speaker 2: There was one African American teacher there named Mr. Brown [ph.], and Mr. Brown was a, taught in the tenth grade, and he was a person that was always very encouraging.  He would see me in the hallway, ask me how was I doing, et cetera, and kind of I guess, oversaw me when I was there that I was on the straight and narrow.  The thing about going to that high school, one was the discipline of having to draw every day and do that.  You did your academics in the morning and then the afternoons were art classes, all art classes.  But I had to get up at 5:30 every morning to go from Far Rockaway [Queens, New York] into Manhattan [New York] to that school, and take two trains basically to get there.  So the discipline of having to get up every morning and get to school by eight A.M. I think was one of the things that was really helpful during that period, and I think I missed, I was late twice in all the years I was in high school, and part of that was my father [William T. Williams, Sr.] would be up at that point going to work and he would get me up, you know like clockwork, and discipline me getting out of the house on time.  That relationship, I think, is another one that was kind of extraordinary for me, but transpired during that period of time.  You know, this determination on his part to get me out and get me out in the world and get me doing that, and then drilling it into me this discipline of you're going to do it, you're going to do it.  The train ride does two things for me and I'll come to that, you have to go across a body of water to get from Far Rockaway back into the mainland because Far Rockaway is really an island, and you go across a body of water every morning, pretty much at sunset, at sunrise, rather.  And when I came back at sunset, so this experience of the water and light and what the light is doing to the water is one of the things that was drilled in my head for four years of going back and forth, back and forth, that experience.  And I think that experience comes to bear on the work much later.  There is a series of shimmering paintings that I do that are very much about that experience.
Story_ID: 466289
Speaker 1: But, you know, in, in high school [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York] I had a lot of classmates that were terrific artists.
Speaker 2: Who are some of those people?
Speaker 1: Calvin Klein. A young illustrator named Antonioni [ph.], Marvin Tarfield [ph.], Otis Sullivan [ph.].  These kids were terrific, I mean really incredible people.  Obviously, Calvin Klein is probably the most famous of the people that came out of that, but the school was divided into people that were interested in fashion, people that were interested in advertising, people that were interested in illustration and--
Speaker 2: And any fine art?
Speaker 1: There was no fine arts at the school at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All stuff, all stuff that could make you some money.
Speaker 1: All--exactly.
Speaker 2: Were there any other, any sort of, was there a black student collective, any other black programs?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: Nothing?
Speaker 1: There's no black student collective.  There's no black power movement, there are, it's a school in the two hundred kids there, of the two hundred kids, probably maybe seventy-five are African American.  It's a strange environment in that a lot of, you have poets that are teaching English, so it's very geared toward the arts.  The academics are intense in the morning.  I mean you gotta do that, and then you go do the art for the other four and five hours in the afternoon.  It's a very disciplined place, extraordinarily disciplined.  Very laid back, probably unlike any other high school in, in the city.
Story_ID: 466290
Speaker 1: What became the turning point for you, thinking about your career as more than a commercial one, but a painter, an artist, a fine arts painter as opposed to advertising?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Does that happen in high school?
Speaker 2: It doesn't happen in high school.  It doesn't happen until I go to Art and Design [School of Industrial Art; High School of Art and Design, New York, New York], graduate from Art and Design, graduated in the National Honor Society, so I was, I guess, relatively smart.  My aunts had done their job.  And didn't have a clue about the rest of the world.
Speaker 1: Did you think you would go on to college?
Speaker 2: I had no interest in going off to college, wasn't even a thought until one of the teachers said to me, "Well why don't you go to New York City Community College [New York City College of Technology, New York, New York] and major in graphic arts."  So I applied and got in.  Tommy Heemans [Tom Heemans] stepped forward with a group called the Courtsmen [Courtsmen Athletic Association, Inc.], which was a group of professional basketball players and they gave me a scholarship, money, to pay the tuition.  I enrolled in New York City Community College, spent two years there, graduated and got a job working at Cash Box and Billboard, Music Week, which are magazines that are built around the music industry.  I worked there for one month and quit.  I couldn't take it, and I--
Speaker 1: What could you not take about it?
Speaker 2: I could not take the nine to five [o'clock]. I couldn't take the, the kind of regiment of doing the same thing over and over again, and I just realized that, you know, this commercial art world thing was not for me, you know, I just couldn't do that.  And on the way back, I saw an ad for Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York], got off the train (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did you see the ad?
Speaker 2: On the subway, subway poster.  Got off the train in Brooklyn [New York], walked over to Pratt, got an application, filled the application in, did the home test, gave it back to them and a few days later, literally, a few days later I got a call from admissions and, asking me to come in and I went in, and this was in late June, July, and I started in September.  You know, they just said okay come on and in September I started.
Story_ID: 466291
Speaker 1: And your major at Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: At Pratt my major still was commercial art.  That's what I had put down but the saving grace is foundation, everyone takes the same foundation, the same drawing, so I went through foundation and eventually ended up in the painting department.  I took a painting class, really like it, ended up in painting.
Speaker 1: Was that the first time you were painting?
Speaker 2: Very first time I had ever painted.
Speaker 1: And that was at Pratt, in this class.
Speaker 2: Took the class, took a second class, really liked it and then I got in the class of a man named Richard Bove, who taught--
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: B-O-V-E.  B-O-V--apostrophe over the E--E.  He was really instrumental in getting me to really, really paint and start thinking about painting.
Speaker 1: And he was your, he was an instructor?
Speaker 2: He was an instructor.  He was the painting instructor.  He then began to introduce me to the other people that were teaching painting there.  Lucian Krukowski and Jimmy Ernst- not Jimmy Ernst, I'm sorry, oh God, Ernie Briggs [Ernest Briggs], I'm sorry, and Alex Katz, Philip Pearlstein.  He would force me to go the library every day.  I would have to go after class, I would have to go the library and go through the art books, go through the art magazines and he was methodical, every day go over to the library.  And I would go over and look and look and look and look and look and try to play catch-up.  He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you were behind?
Speaker 2: I was behind.
Speaker 1: Because you were just starting as a painter?
Speaker 2: I just didn't know much about painters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was trying to get me to really look and become aware of it.  I started taking art history at Pratt.  That began to open me up more and more and more.  Then he sent me to see a show of Hans Hofmann at the Kootz Gallery [New York, New York] and I walked into the Hans Hofmann show and I said, I can do this.  It was like eureka, I can do this.  I was bowled over by the show, the person's use of color, the sensuousness of the paint, and I came back and just started going at it in the painting class and the more I kind of did my own thing, the more Bove would say keep going, you know, the more I forgot about what he had, the still life and stuff he had set up, the more he would encourage me.
Speaker 1: Were you becoming an abstract painter then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was becoming more and more abstract.
Speaker 1: More and more abstract.
Speaker 2: What he did the, my junior year at Pratt, I won a scholarship to go to Maine to the Skowhegan School of Paintings, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture [Skowhegan, Maine].  I went up, spent the summer there.  That's when it kind of overlapped, Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence] was associated with the school.
Story_ID: 466292
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me before though how you get the, the, what is it called, the internship?
Speaker 2: It's a scholarship (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The scholarship.
Speaker 2: The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture [Skowhegan, Maine].  Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York] has a annual competition and there are two competitions, one to go to Yale Norfolk summer program [Yale Norfolk Summer School of Art, Norfolk, Connecticut] and the other one to go to Skowhegan.  And I got one this summer, one to go to Skowhegan.
Speaker 1: Which is nice to be in Maine in the summer.
Speaker 2: It was nice to be in Maine in the summer.  First time that far north.  I had no idea about what Maine was about.  Got there, Maine to me was very much like North Carolina, so that experience of being in the, in the rural Northeast to me was very comfortable.  The school itself is kind of isolated outside of the town and it's really an old farm, so all of that was very comfortable for me again.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that you say that because when I visited Maine for the very first time, I thought, oh my God, it reminds me of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I swear.  The things, it's exactly what I thought.  I mean because, you know, driving along, I mean there are parts of it that look really poor and, you know.  So you're at Skowhegan.
Speaker 2: I'm at Skowhegan.
Speaker 1: There's one other black student.
Speaker 2: There's one other black student from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I think his last name was Dawson [ph.], I just don't remember his first name.  As summer goes on, I'm painting, painting away.  The faculty that summer as I remember it was Robert Andrew Parker, Alfred Leslie, god I'm blocking some of the instructors out.  Those are the two that I, that I remember most.  I'm sorry Jack Levine was another one.  Alfred Leslie has a huge influence on me during the summer.  He took a particular interest in my work.  At that point, he was going from abstraction into his big representational paintings, but he was really enthusiastic about the paintings that I was making.
Story_ID: 466293
Speaker 1: Very good summer. At the end of the summer, I win the Bocour, Lenny Bocour [Leonard Bocour] paint prize, and what the paint prize was, is Lenny Bocour, the paint manufacturer, would give you paint.  Well, it was one of the prizes that are offered that summer.  It's one of the lesser prizes. I came back to New York [New York].  During the summer I had met an awful lot of artists.  One artist that took an interest in my work was Louise Nevelson who was a governor of the school [Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine].  She like my work a great deal.  Henry Geldzahler, who was the curator at the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] came up, liked the work a great deal, and Frank O'Hara, the poet, came up, and really like the work.  So all of a sudden here are these people that are in the professional art work, looking at the work and encouraging me and saying it's really good, and please keep in touch and I came back to Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York] for my senior year, called Lenny Bocour up, told him I had won the paint prize, and he said, "Oh kid, come on up."  Well I went up to his factory [Bocour Artist Colors], which is on the West Side [New York, New York] and he took me in his office and we talked and he said, "You know, I collect paintings and I've done this," and, then he took me in the back and there are all these boxes with all of this old tubes of paint and stuff that had been returned from stores, and he just gives me all of these boxes, right?  So I come back in a few days with a car and take all this paint home, and maybe the stuff lasts me six months, and one day I get a call and its Bocour, and he said, "Well why haven't you come back?"  And I said, "You know, Mr. Bocour, I--," you know.  He said, "Come back up here and get some more paint."  Well, to make a long story short, this relationship lasted for almost fifteen years of him underwriting me, and it went from the tubes of paint to gallons of paint.  I was literally having this truck stop in front of the loft and whatever I wanted, bringing it up to the studio.  So he was incredibly instrumental in my development as a, as a, as an artist.  This lasted all the way into the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Now were you giving him some of the work itself?
Speaker 1: What he would do is he would come down to the studio once a year, once every year and a half, choose a painting that he liked and then he would, in some cases, hold on to the painting for a few years and then he would donate it to a, a museum.  He donated one to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  He donated one to, oh god, what's the place upstate?  I can't think of the name of it.  His family donated a number of them to the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] that they owned after he died.  But he was really, he was really a good friend, and he did more than that.  The thing that he would do is I would have a technical problem and I would call him up, and he says, "Well, come on up to the factory," and I would come up and I would show him the problem, and he would get one of the chemists to show me what to do.  I mean literally explaining the paint and what other kind of additives there were that could be used to do what I wanted to do.  So, from a technical standpoint, I had all of that technical expertise that he provided.
Story_ID: 466294
Speaker 1: So that summer of '65 [1965] was the turning point for you--
Speaker 2: That was the turning point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with all these people saying continue to do this, stay in touch, you win the prize.  What are you thinking you're going to become?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking about the idea of painting, wanting to be a painter.  I really like this activity.
Speaker 1: Ah, but we missed a big chunk of this (unclear) summer, Jacob Lawrence.
Speaker 2: Jacob Lawrence comes up that summer.  He's visiting [the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine].  I reintroduce myself.  We have a chat and then he says he's going to be at Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York] for the next year.  So my senior year at Pratt he's there.
Speaker 1: Did you study with him?
Speaker 2: I never studied with him.  He was teaching a, a class that I had already taken, so I got to see him, but never got to study with him.
Story_ID: 466295
Speaker 1: The ironic part that comes into this is my senior year [at Pratt Institute, New York, New York], I'm about to go off, drift off into never-never land and again, Philip Pearlstein asked me what am I going to do.  And I said I have no idea.  Alex Katz, the painter, asked me what I'm gonna do.  I said I have no idea.  Then Richard Bove asked. I said I have no idea.  And they said we want you to go to graduate school and I said basically, I have no money to do that.  I just can't do that.  They tell me where to apply and basically they gave me three schools to apply to and which was Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut], Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York].  I applied to all three.  I got accepted by all three and they said you're going to Yale, just like that, you're going to Yale.  There is a person there that really likes your work and that person was Al Hale [ph.].  Said he really likes your work and he wants you to come and study with him.  And that was the turning point, really.  I packed up and went to New Haven [Connecticut], studied with Al for a year.  The first year I had George Wardlaw as a teacher and the second year, Al Hale.  And it was a very intense relationship I had with him.
Speaker 2: Because?
Speaker 1: He pushed me more than any instructor ever had.  He was harder on me than any person that I'd ever met in my life.  He was more demanding.  He forced me to read more stuff than I thought I was capable of, and each week that he came up, he would come up with a stack of magazines and stuff and kind of put them on my studio and said next week I want you to know this stuff.  And it was intense, but, it was intense, but it was very good because he really, really prepared me well.
Speaker 2: Were there any other African American students at Yale at the time?
Speaker 1: There were, there were.  [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell was a classmate.  She was one year ahead of me.  She was there.  A painter named Peter Bradley, Bradley was there.  He was in the same year I was.  And then there was a sculptor, there was an African sculptor, God what was, Adour [ph.], I think his name is Adour, his last name A-D-O-U-R.  He was there as well.  There were other African Americans that were, George Bass [George Houston Bass] was in the drama school and the drama school was right next to where we were. (Pause) That was it, that was it.
Story_ID: 466296
Speaker 1: So you, during your time at Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut] you, in this intensive training, are you coming back to New York [New York] at all on the weekends?
Speaker 2: I'm coming back to New York probably once a month.
Speaker 1: Once a month.  And what, what are you becoming a part of the art scene in New York, are you observing what's going on.  Has the gallery scene start to develop by this time in New York City?
Speaker 2: The gallery scene is in full bloom. What was occurring, Yale has a program of bringing visiting artists up.  Every week there's another visiting artist, so between what's going on in the art magazines and what the people are bringing up, becomes one and the same.  You get a really, a one-on-one with a lot of those people.  I'm coming to New York to look at exhibitions, to see what's going on.  I'm going back and forth.
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe the New York gallery scene at that time?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], 1967, when I'm coming back, it's pretty much a closed ball game, meaning that it is 98 percent white.  The only exhibition artist, African American artist, that had galleries, as I remember at that point, are Ray Saunders [Raymond Saunders], Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence] and Romare Bearden.  That's pretty much it.  I'm sorry, and Bob Gordon, Robert Gordon, but that's it, there's--
Speaker 1: And Catlett [HistoryMaker Elizabeth Catlett] and Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] at this time were in Spain or they were out of the country.
Speaker 2: At that point, Ed was still in Paris [France] and I think Elizabeth was in Mexico.
Speaker 1: Right, Mexico, she was in Mexico.
Speaker 2: Right. She's not represented by a dealer in New York.  It was a very, very different art world.
Speaker 1: So it was only those three African American artists who were showing in the entire gallery scene?
Speaker 2: That's what I remember.  There were just three, and that was it, when I got out of school in 1967, 1968.  Graduated from Yale.  A lot of classmates that I had there are now extremely well-known artists.
Speaker 1: Who are some of those classmates?
Speaker 2: John Moore, Howardena [HistoryMaker Howardena Pindell], obviously, Jennifer Bartlett.  They're all doing extremely well.
Story_ID: 466297
Speaker 1: Now when you came back, you graduate Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut], you come back to the city, the sponsors, the people who were in your corner, are they saying to you, we are going to help you get a show?  How are you planning to break into this all-white world of art in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, no plan (laughter).  Literally, no plan.  I had a job when I was in New Haven [Connecticut] working at the New Haven Jewish Community Center [JCC of Greater New Haven, Woodbridge, Connecticut].  They had a tradition of hiring an artist to teach a class there and I got hired to teach this class.  There was a lady there who had a sister in New York that was an art collector, and she called her sister and wrote a letter of introduction to me to go meet her sister.  Well, this lady's name was Mrs. Ethel Schwabacher, and when I visited Mrs. Schwabacher, she lived on Park Avenue.  It was two doormen when you go in with white gloves and I show up to Mrs. Schwabacher's house, home, with a little dungarees on and a fatigue jacket and looking like an artist, and the doorman said can I help you, and I said I'm here to see Mrs. Schwabacher and then he looked at me like I'm crazy.  But finally they call up and she said yes, send him up, and I get in the elevator and there's, you know, the white gloves again, and we push up and the thing opens and I'm in a little foyer, never experienced that, you know, the elevator only goes to one apartment on that floor, and I'm flabbergasted, and in that little foyer there's a door, I step out and the door opens and, you know, the lady says, "Come in" and I think it's Mrs. Schwabacher.  It's not Mrs. Schwabacher.  As I walk in, there's, you know, I'm walking past a Gorky [Arshile Gorky] and then a de Kooning [Willem de Kooning] and all these paintings, and we get inside and finally Mrs. Schwabacher comes and she introduces herself and she's a wonderful kind of down to earth lady, and she says come on in and sit down and my sister has told me so much about you.  And we sit and we talk and she asked me the same question, what are you going to do, what do you want to do?  I tell her, you know, basically, I'll be getting out of school in a month, I hope to move to New York and make art.  And we started a conversation about, you know, abstract expressionists and she starts having people bringing these paintings out that she owns and we're talking about them.  Well, she says, "Well, I have some friends that I'd like to introduce you to and maybe some of them can help you."  What occurs during this process, one of the people that she wants me to go meet is Thomas Messer, who then was the director of the Guggenheim Museum [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York], and I make an appointment and I go with Mr. Messer and we have lunch, and basically Mr. Messer offers me a job that Brice Marden had had, and that's being a guard at the Guggenheim, and at that point, in my head, you know, I'm a kid that's come from the project, no dream of ever having gone to college, gone through a community college [New York City Community College; New York City College of Technology, New York, New York], gone through Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York] and now graduated with Yale, the idea of someone offering me a job as a guard at a museum was just outrageous in my head, you know, I'm, I'm thinking, I'm thinking of Ralph Ellison, you know.  I got this letter of introduction and, to make a long story sh- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, go ahead, this is a good story.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm thinking I didn't go through all of this education to get, you know, to be a guard at the Guggenheim, I mean I coming to you as an artist and--
Speaker 1: With a great letter of, you know, recom- yeah.
Speaker 2: What occurs is basically I go back and I talk to Mrs. Schwabacher and explained to her what occurred and--
Speaker 1: What does she say?
Speaker 2: I guess she gets an understanding of the obstacles that I'm going to face as an artist and certainly I got an understanding of something about the art world.
Speaker 1: Okay, because she sent you to him thinking he would help you out as an artist?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: He, you go back, he will only give you a guardship at the door.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  You got it.
Story_ID: 466298
Speaker 1: Circumstances present themselves a little differently a few days later.  I'm on 3rd Avenue and 10th Street waiting for a bus.  This lady walks up to me.  I'm reading Clement Greenberg's 'Critical Essays,' ['Art and Culture: Critical Essays'] and she looks over my shoulder and she says, "Why are you reading that stuff?"  And I'm taken back by this, you know, this white middle-aged lady saying this to me.  And I said, "Well, you know, because it's about such and such and such," and she said, "Well, there's other stuff you should be reading."  So I said, "Who are you?"  And she said, "My name is Dore Ashton," right.  Dore Ashton, the art historian, and she said, "Are you a painter?"  I said yes and I explain, you know, we have a conversation and one thing leads to another and I tell her I'm just graduated from Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut] and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and she says, "Well, when you come down to the city again, come and see me."  So a few weeks later I come back and I call her up and she comes over, you know, I go over and she introduced me to her husband who was a painter, Adja Yunkers.  She said, "How are you going to make a living?"  No idea.  She picks up the phone.  She calls the School of Visual Arts [New York, New York], and talks with Silas Rhodes [Silas H. Rhodes] who owns the place.  She says, "I have a young man I want you to, I want to introduce you to, that's just graduated from Yale and I'd like you to interview him."  He says, "Can he be here in an hour?"  I went up, he interviewed me and hired me on the spot.  That September I started teaching at the School of Visual Arts, a painting class.  And that was literally my reintroduction back into New York [New York].
Story_ID: 466299
Speaker 1: I got this studio because of a young artist or an artist named Jenny Snider, who came up to Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut] to visit and mentioned that there was a floor available in this building. And I came to New York [New York].  My parents [Hazel Davis Williams and William T. Williams, Sr.] loaned me some money and I rented this space.  When I rented this space, there was--Ken Noland [Kenneth Noland] lived downstairs, Joel Shapiro was above me and Janet Fish was, Janet Fish was in the building next door, and a guy named Copley [William N. Copley] was on the floor above.  It was a happy circumstance because Noland's work was one of the artists that I was really very interested in, and here he's living on the floor underneath me.  And we became friends.  It turns out Bocour [Leonard Bocour] was also supplying him with paint, so we had this other connection.
Speaker 2: So when the truck stopped you could all go outside (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's right.
Story_ID: 466300
Speaker 1: But, at SVA [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], are you, what year was that, because that was your first professional teaching job (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was 1969, '68 [1968] actually.
Speaker 1: Now did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's '68 [1968], '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That I taught there.
Speaker 1: And you taught painting?
Speaker 2: I taught painting, painting one.
Speaker 1: Now did you, you know the Guggenheim [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York], has been considered one of the most racist of all museum institutions.  There was at one point, people picketed outside, there's, because they didn't have any black artists and I think they were doing a show on collages and they didn't even have one of Romare Bearden's collages in, were you involved in that at all?
Speaker 2: No, I think you mean the Whitney [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York] was picketed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it is the Whitney.  I'm confusing that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Whitney was picketed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For that reason though, right?  Was it the collages and they didn't have any?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure, I'm not quite sure if that was the reason.  I think it had to do with trying to force more inclusion within the general exhibition idea, rather than the idea of a special exhibition of African American art.  The work should be included in all of these categories because there were probably artists of color that was making something that would fit into these categories.  In other words, open this thing up to American art rather than the sub-categories of American art.  I think that was really the issue for the, at the Whitney Museum.
Story_ID: 466301
Speaker 1: So do you think, and then we'll keep moving, do you think of white artists going to the Guggenheim [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York] to see, what was his name, Mr.--
Speaker 2: Messer [Thomas Messer].
Speaker 1: --Messer, would have received a different response than the one you received?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know.  You know, he paraphrased what he, when he was going to offer me that by saying Brice Marden had this job and did this, but from my standpoint given the time, the political times I was living in, that was not an option for me.  I didn't see that as, as an option.  I had been in the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York], I had been in the Modern [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York] for years and years and years and the experience of that is not what I wanted.  I didn't want to spend my time doing that, protecting someone else's culture.  I was interesting in making culture and there's a, there's a distinct difference between the two.  And I was very clear on that, the difference between those two, two activities.
Story_ID: 466302
Speaker 1: That's your first professional job at SVA [School of Visual Arts, New York, New York], what then becomes your first exhibition?  Is it around the same time?
Speaker 2: The first exhibition is at the same time.  The first exhibition that I'm, well, the first exhibition that I'm ever in is actually at the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] when I'm at Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York].  In my senior year, there's a show and NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] benefit exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum and that is the first show that I'm in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The next show that I'm in is the first, is the opening show of the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And that's the one that is in 1968, '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How does that come about?
Speaker 2: Well,--
Speaker 1: You're teaching now.
Speaker 2: I'm teaching now.  I have a teaching job.  I'm talking with Dore [Dore Ashton] and she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you have this studio, so you're working and teaching.
Speaker 2: I have this studio.  I'm sharing the studio with Peter Bradley, who was a classmate at Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut].  Dore calls me one day and she says, "I have some friends I want you to go and meet."  She sends me to the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] to the Junior Council.  In the midst of this conversation somehow the Studio Museum comes up. I had written a proposal when I was in graduate school to establish an artist in residence program.  Somehow the Studio Museum comes up and one of the persons says, "You should go up and meet the people at the Studio Museum."  I said okay.  They put me in touch with the people at the Studio Museum.  Somehow someone reads my proposal.  The trustees at that point invite me to come and meet them.  I came and met them, gave them a, a quick overview of this proposal of an artist in residence program, and on the spot they said we would like you to develop your proposal at the Studio Museum.  I accepted the offer, saw the space that they were opening.  At that point it wasn't open, it was just a loft.
Speaker 1: Is that the space they have now?
Speaker 2: That is not the space they have now.  This space was on 5th Avenue. It was above a liquor store.  It was just two old lofts that had been coat factories.  Very modest beginning.  Went up, found the space that they were going to have for the artists in residence program.  Mel Edwards [Melvin Edwards], the sculptor and I, physically cleaned the space out.
Story_ID: 466303
Speaker 1: The first show, the inaugural show [at the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] came up and I was asked to put a piece in, put a piece in.  The piece was seen by Charlie Cowles [Charles Cowles].  Charlie Cowles was a trustee of the museum at that point, but he was also the owner of Artforum magazine [Artforum International Magazine].  Charlie saw the work and said you know, "Do you have any other paintings?"  And I said yes, and he came down and the paintings I was doing in the studio were totally different than the one he had saw.  He was flabbergasted when he saw the paintings and bought one.  It is now the painting that the Studio Museum owns, a very large painting.  But Charles then proceeded to bring curators down, collectors down, dealers down, to begin to see the work, and in very quick order, less than six months of being in New York [New York], I had met most of the major dealers that were in the city.  The Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] called up and came by and bought a painting, bought a very, very large painting called 'Elbert Jackson' ['Elbert Jackson, L.A.M.F. Part II,' William T. Williams] and installed it in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art, and basically, that was the beginning.  In a very quick procession thereafter, had my first one-man show, all the paintings were sold.  Most of the paintings were sold to people who had a great deal of advice in terms of what to buy.  They weren't just people walking off the streets. (Pause) It was a, a real quick beginning, a lot of pressure.
Story_ID: 466304
Speaker 1: We were talking about, I think the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Studio Museum (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the beginning of the Studio Museum.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you cleaned out the space, the artist in residence program.
Speaker 1: We cleaned out the space, the artists in residence program has a place, but, the museum at this point has a director, they have me and they had another young person that's running a photography program there.  But there's no real program in place in terms of all of these exhibitions that are going to occur and there's no curator in place either.  So the first, first show was a Tom Lloyd show that comes in.  After the Tom Lloyd Show, there was a Haitian show.  The Haitian show end up, I'm installing the Haitian show, I'm doing a sand painting on the floor and all of a sudden I'm involved in all of these other things other than this program that I am, you know, kind of contracted to try put together.  At the same time I'm involved in something, we were painting walls in Harlem [New York, New York].  We have a group that's called Smokehouse Associates and one of the things that we were interested in is the idea of putting art, taking art out of the galleries and putting them in a public forum.  So we do a number of wall paintings throughout Harlem.
Speaker 2: And that's called Smokehouse wall.
Speaker 1: It was called Smokehouse Associates.  It was a group of Mel Edwards [Melvin Edwards], Billy Rose.
Speaker 2: Were you one of the founders?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Guy Ciarcia.  There were--
Speaker 2: Who else would you say was right there with you helping to, in the foundation of Smokehouse?  If you were to list one other person, who would that be?
Speaker 1: My wife [Patricia Ayr DeWeese].
Speaker 2: Your wife.
Speaker 1: I wrote the proposal (laughter).  I wrote the proposal, I got the funding, I put the group together.
Speaker 2: And the mission of that group was to take art out of the galleries and put it on city walls?
Speaker 1: This was, yeah.  This was a group of people who were interested in public art, and the idea that, trying to get people to think about the aesthetic experience and not have to go into the galleries, an alternative to the galleries.
Story_ID: 466305
Speaker 1: What did Romare [Romare Bearden], Jacob [Jacob Lawrence] and people, what was happening with them at the time?
Speaker 2: Okay. Jake, you know, Jake Lawrence was showing at Terry Dintenfass [Terry Dintenfass Gallery, New York, New York] and was pretty much having his shows every, you know, two, three years.
Speaker 1: Is that the gallery that was in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: That was the gallery that was in the '50s [1950s], no it was Halpert [Downtown Gallery, New York, New York] I think the first gallery he had.  Terry Dintenfass was, I think, his second gallery.  He was having a show maybe every three years or something of that nature.  She also handled Ray Saunders [Raymond Saunders], a really terrific artist.  And Romi was having shows with Claudia (unclear) and he was having annual shows, probably once a year he was having shows, and his career was absolutely exploding in terms of, about that time he's, he's doing the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] and exhibition, but his work is just reproduced everywhere and he is almost a larger than life figure in New York [New York].  You know Jacob Lawrence is not in New York.  Romare was kind of the elderly statesperson among his generation as well.  The thing about him that was extraordinary is the amount of time and the amount of kind of the way he extended his hands to young artists.  He would give advice if you asked for it, about the work, about the art world or about life in general.  But he would never impose his ideas upon you, which is the really pretty extraordinary thing.  He was, I mean he was the mentor of mentors.  I don't know how else to say it in relationship to him.  And because he was so knowledgeable in terms of his experience in the art world, there was always a kind of weight when he said something that you really listened to and you kind of weighed what he was saying in relationship to your experiences.  The other artists that were around, Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] was just returning to New York in 1969.  That generation of expatriates, Ed was the first to come back.  The old artists like Charles Alston was not, he was not exhibiting.  Richard Mayhew was not, didn't have a gallery at that time.  Norman Lewis did not have a gallery at that time.  Norman had moved from Harlem [New York, New York] down to Broome Street, so within a ten block area you had Bearden, Norman Lewis, Peter Bradley, Mel Edwards [Melvin Edwards], Al Loving, [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell, Vivian Browne [Vivian E. Browne], Danny Johnson [Daniel LaRue Johnson], [HistoryMaker] Camille Billops, really concentrated, and there are others really concentrated in this area.
Story_ID: 466306
Speaker 1: And that led to a very lively scene in that, there was a lot of dialogue, a lot of discussion about art, about the relationship of the African American art to the art community.
Speaker 2: What was that discussion?
Speaker 1: Discussions, depending on the group, the makeup of the group, sometimes it was about just pure aesthetics, sometimes the discussions were about the exclusion, the idea of strategies for dealing with the exclusion.
Speaker 2: Were there strategies that worked in dealing with the exclusion?
Speaker 1: There were strategies that worked.
Speaker 2: Were they the picketing strategies or were there, were they much less confrontational strategies?
Speaker 1: Well, it's an interesting strategy.  There was one instance where the Whitney Museum [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York] was not forthcoming in listening to the issues that we wanted to put on the table.  And Danny Johnson [Daniel LaRue Johnson] and I and others enlisted Dr. Bunche, Dr. Ralph Bunche, to intercede, because Dr. Bunche was a very good friend of Danny Johnson's father and, and Danny.  And Danny at that point was doing a large piece ['Peace Form One,' Daniel LaRue Johnson] for the UN [United Nations] for Dr. Bunche, which is there now.  And, you know, we went to visit Dr. Bunche, we laid the problem out, and Dr. Bunche called Jackie Onassis, or Jackie Kennedy [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis], and she interceded on our behalf at the Whitney to say you should listen to what they wanted to say, and lo and behold, people listened.  So, I don't think it was such confrontational, it was like, all right, let's find another strategy instead of beating our head against the wall.  Basically what we're trying to do is open a dialogue, suggest some of the grievances or some of the ways that we see things that could work differently.
Speaker 2: But what were some of the grievances?  What was not going the way black artists wanted them to?  What sorts of things were not acceptable?
Speaker 1: I think there was very little, I think there was very little inclusion in the museum exhibitions.  There was certainly very little inclusion in the gallery structure.
Speaker 2: Now were they, were there any reasons ever given as to why there was not the inclusion, I mean was it, did they say, oh, well you didn't, but you'd gone to Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut] so you didn't have that problem.
Speaker 1: No I think a great deal of it always had to do with this question of quality.
Speaker 2: Quality.
Speaker 1: A- and the question is, all right, how do we define quality?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and how is quality defined?
Speaker 1: Now that's a difficult one.  But it's a, it's a, it's, it's a word that allows a great deal of slippage.  And what I mean by that is you can, you can redefine this thing any way you want to do anything you want.  Our point was that there are people that are making art that are expanding this idea of what art is and what it can be, rather than what it is.  We are not trying to be a part of what that thing is, we're trying to express ourselves and our own ideas in terms of what aesthetics are about and what art can be about.  I think that message began to come through is that if you expand what you're doing, you are expanding what American art is about and you're telling us more about America and what America's dream can be.  I think eventually that's come through.  It's taken thirty years maybe, but it seems to me that the museums have opened up at this point to other kinds of possibilities.  You know, it takes time.
Speaker 2: It does take time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 466307
Speaker 1: So moving, you're at--who would you, you're in this, your first solo show, how did that come about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My first solo show came about, I walked into OK Harris Gallery [New York, New York].  OK Harris had run Castelli Gallery [Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, New York] and then he had opened a gallery in SoHo [New York, New York].  At that point in SoHo there were two galleries.  There was OK Harris and Paula Cooper [Paula Cooper Gallery, New York, New York].  And he says, I walk in and he say, "Bill [HistoryMaker William T. Williams], there's a person just came in was looking for you."  And I'm taken back, and he said, "There's this guy named Reese Palley that's looking for you."  And he said, "I gave him your number and he's gonna call you."  Lo and behold, this guy named Reese Palley calls me and he says, "I'm opening a gallery and I want to show your work.  I saw one of your paintings and I want to show it."  So I said okay.  Well he builds this huge emporium in SoHo and 1970 he shows it.  The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many pieces?
Speaker 2: He shows fourteen, fourteen paintings.
Speaker 1: And what were the paintings?  What was the body of work at the time?
Speaker 2: The body of work was large geometric paintings, a great deal of involvement with color and geometry, very complexed, a kind of space that collapsed on itself.  In the paintings in relationship at the time they were made were politely radical in that this is the height of minimalism, it's the height of the kind of reductive sensibility and these were just the opposite.  These were consciously flaunting every idea about minimalism, what one shouldn't do and putting them in paintings.  Something that much later a lot of painters began to do.  Well, the show sells out.  Reese sells every painting. (Laughter) I don't know what else to say.
Speaker 1: He sells every painting.
Speaker 2: He sells every painting.
Speaker 1: And does that take you to a new level cause it's your first show and you--
Speaker 2: It took me to a whole different set of collectors, like the McNeil Foundation [Colonel Stanley R. McNeil Foundation], Dominic [ph.], he and his wife bought a painting.

Speaker 1: Just before that Dore Ashton takes me to Europe with her for a show in the South of France.  She hangs me in a room with de Kooning [Willem de Kooning] and Rothko [Mark Rothko] and Clyfford Still.
Speaker 2: Which are some of the paintings she'd pulled out to discuss with you when you visited her in her home?
Speaker 1: No, no, that was, that was, a different person.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: She posed, Dore had taken two of my paintings and, and she consciously installed them in this room as opposed to in the room with the other young artists.  I think she did it for two reasons, one she wanted me to see my work in relation to those people, but she was also forcing the press to look at these paintings in relation to those paintings and seeing that it held on the wall, I think, as well as those paintings did.  That gave, obviously, gave me an extraordinary amount of, of confidence.
Speaker 2: Personally? And professionally (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Personally, it gave me an extraordinary amount of confidence, but also just pleasure of being able to see my work next to, you know, people that I had studied, and, you know, in getting me there.  Lucky enough I had just won an Ashland Endowment [ph.], and that gave me money to, to travel to Europe.
Speaker 2: And you won that endowment in?
Speaker 1: I won the endowment in 1970, 1970.
Story_ID: 466309
Speaker 1: What did you consider your work, Afrocentric or just, just art?  Did you have (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just my stuff.
Speaker 1: Just your stuff.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't, I didn't think of it as being Afrocentric at all.  I saw that the body of work had antecedents in both the history of art, but also in quilt making, that my work was being informed from two sources, certainly.  The southern experience, and the academic experience of, of having gone to Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut].  Those two things were coming together and it was clear for me from the very beginning, from, you know, the mid-'60s [1960s] all the way through that that was informing me, and I think there are, there are numerous statements in the late '60s [1960s] where I talk about quilts and the influence of quilts on the work.
Story_ID: 466310
Speaker 1: So you talked about, or you briefly mention that you had an exhibition at the Whitney Museum [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I was in the 'Whitney Annual.'
Speaker 1: In the 'Whitney Annual.'
Speaker 2: And then the following month I was in something called 'The Structure of Color.'
Speaker 1: But the 'Whitney Annual,' how did that come about?
Speaker 2: The 'Whitney Annual' came about, basically the curator saw my exhibition at Reese Palley [Reese Palley Gallery, New York, New York] and decided that I should be included in the 'Annual.'
Speaker 1: Now did they place your work with everyone else's or did they distinctly put all of the black artists' work together?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't put all the black artists 'cause I was the only black artist, so (laughter) it wasn't, it wasn't a question of putting it with the other black artists.  It was put in, in conjunction with other work of the same scale, physical scale, because in my case because it was ten by ten [feet], there was a context that it had to be put in in terms of where in the museum.
Speaker 1: Did you feel you were breaking any color barriers by having a piece at the Whitney--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --and being the only one?
Speaker 2: I don't think I thought in those terms at all.  I don't think that was, that wasn't what was coming through my, my head at that point.  I think it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was?
Speaker 2: I think it had more to do with where did the work fit in relation to the contemporary dialogue.
Speaker 1: To the contemporary art scene in general?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And what was it, what new information and ideas and signs and symbols was it bringing to the table in terms of contemporary art.  That was really the issue that I was kind of confronting and dealing with.  That painting that was shown was bought by Nelson Rockefeller.  This was again, you know, where all of a sudden something is confirming to me that I'm an artist and that the body of work has importance, that the body of work is informing this thing called art history, and that what I needed to do was just concentrate on what I was doing, that the issues of blackness were, if they were in the work, they had been internalized and I need not consciously think about that because that was an internalized experience rather than a conscious experience.  And that's pretty much the way I've thought about the work. It's not something that I have to consciously think about, you know, it's, it's, I think my aunts and my mother [Hazel Davis Williams] and my grandmother [Sophia Davis Jackson] and the experience of having grown up in the South, I never questioned who I was.  I never questioned about being black.  That wasn't an issue.  The issue was okay, now what are you gonna do?  And let's get on with it, and that's, you know, that was always the way I was brought up.
Story_ID: 466311
Speaker 1: So when you were living in the area [New York, New York] and you had all of the, like Camille [HistoryMaker Camille Billops] and all of you guys were in this, you know, this very small area, was there any opportunity ever to collectively do something amongst yourselves?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.  I organized, early in 1970 I organized this show called 'X to the Fourth Power.'  'X to the Fourth Power' was a show of Mel Edwards [Melvin Edwards], [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam, myself and a white artist named Steve Kelsey [Stephen Kelsey], another Yale [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut] graduate.  The thrust of the work were people that were making really large-scale paintings 'cause Steve was working, you know, like his painting, I think in the show is eight by eighteen feet.  Sam was working very large, I was working ten by ten, and you could not, if you looked at the work, you could not separate the work in terms of this thing called quality.  What you could see was that there was a commonality of an interest in a certain modern idea of art making.  You could see different sensibilities like Sam's sense of color was drastically different than Steve's sense of color and how color was going to be used.  And certainly different than my sense of color.  You--if you could look closely, you could see all of these sensibilities, the difference in sensibilities.  Well, I think what that show did, The New York Times reviewed it, Sunday New York Times, gave it center stage in terms of talking about it.  And the critic was sensitive enough to bring up the issue and suggest that here were four artists that were working on the highest level and that it, it is the dialogue about race becomes secondary and maybe unimportant in relation to this exhibition.  Later on, Sam and I and Mel showed together a great deal.  There were a number of shows that were organized during that time that were all African American artists, but the overriding thing was alright we were African Americans but it was quality of the art in the exhibition.  There was another show called 'Five Plus One' [ph.] that Sam Hunter organized.  Again, along artists that were in this case, primarily abstract, but again the underriding thing again was what are the difference in the sensibilities, what are the difference in the aesthetic, what are the difference in the ideas among these artists.  And that's the way we tried to, to focus and tried to do this.  There were endless panels I was on during that period of time, where the issue of black art came up, the issue of art in the community, and (pause) I think what we always tried to do during those times, we had a lot of conversations with, among ourselves.  We had a lot of conversations with artists that were not abstract. We had a lot of conversations with, with writers, try to come to terms with what we were trying to do as artists.  What is the role and the responsibility of the artist, you know, I mean, those discussions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were those answers?  What were some of those answers for you, the role and responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on if you see yourself as a vehicle.  In other words, if you see yourself as a vehicle for culture, and that you have an internalized experience and you may have the God-given ability to communicate those experiences to other people, then you are just a vehicle for maintaining those experiences and transmitting those experience to other people, and that's the primary function and role of the artist, as you are a God-given medium to do that.  Now I liked that idea a lot because it forces an incredible responsibility upon the artist that you not only have to see that, you have to internalize that and you have to realize why it's important to preserve that.  I, I like that way of making art and thinking about it because it, it, it's an, it's an accumulative responsibility of every lady that ever touched me in the church, my head and said, "Hey Scooter Boy."  Every uncle that I had that came home tired and took the time to ask how I was doing, to all of those kind of disappointments that people have.  It seems to me part of what an artist does is you become your collective consciousness of all of that and it's not you to illustrate that, but to realize that that experience that you've internalized is all of that's contained in it.  There's pain, there's joy, there's all of these other things contained in it.
Story_ID: 466312
Speaker 1: So what do you think about what you've created, if, generally speaking, or may, maybe the evolution you've gone through from, from the beginning to, you know, and we're only up to like the '70s [1970s], that body of work?
Speaker 2: I think the body of work that I did early on is the body of work of a very young artist.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Meaning that I was, I'm a twenty-four year old kid that has Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] bought a painting, that Nelson Rockefeller bought a painting, but I'm twenty-four years old.  I'm at the beginning of this, this adult life, and the things that I'm talking about at that point are the things that from a child to twenty-four years old, those have been the experiences.  When you're sixty-five, as I am now, I understand what Romare Bearden said to me when I first came to New York [New York].  He said painting is an old man's game, and what I think he meant by that and what I mean by that, is it takes a long time to kind of weed your impulses out.  It takes a long time to kind of hone your craft down, and then allow the craft to speak on its own, to speak about all of those kind of experiences you had.  Early on, it's skill, it's taught skill and you demonstrate those taught skills and you demonstrate your knowledge of the activity that's going on.  Later on, the work has nothing to do with the art world.  It has to do, I think, with a more human dialogue.
Story_ID: 466313
Speaker 1: Do you like teaching?
Speaker 2: I take teaching as a responsibility.  I like doing it, I like doing it in a city university because it's, it's brought me in contact with a lot of people whose backgrounds are very similar to mine in that a lot of them are first generation college students.  A lot of them are coming out of housing projects, low income, some middle class kids. Very bright kids, very energetic kids, all have incredible aspirations.  What I like is that you can impact their lives and if you're really good never rain on their parade, just encourage them.  I enjoy being with young artists.  I've enjoyed that a great deal.
Story_ID: 466314
Speaker 1: Do you still enjoy painting as much as you did when you were twenty-four?
Speaker 2: No, no, it's more work now.  It's more work because I accept less than I did when I was twenty-four, and I work on the paintings longer and I'm dema- more demanding of myself now than I when I was, when I was twenty-four years old.  It's also harder, physically harder, in that my eyes are not as good as they were when I was twenty-four.  My dexterity is not as good as when I was twenty-four.  So I'm having to rely on some other things.  The work has changed because of the difference in, in the physical nature of the body.  I can't make ten foot by ten foot paintings anymore, because I physically can't move them.  So I think your work changes as you get older.  I think the work has changed because I've had kids, and the experience of going through that with two other human beings and watching them grown, that's informed my work.  There just, I- I'm just about different things now than I was when I was twenty-four.
Story_ID: 466315
Speaker 1: Did the trips to Africa in the late '70s [1970s] change the work at all?
Speaker 2: The trips to, the trip to Nigeria changed the work a great deal.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: I was at an impasse when I left and went to Nigeria.  I was struggling with two ideas, was I interested in color and surface, or was I interested in drawing, and when I went to Nigeria I experienced two things immediately.  The difference in light and the temperature of the light in Nigeria, the lushness of, of the foliage, and the incredible use of pattern within textiles, and being in the street and seeing all of these patterns moving next to each other had an enormous influence on me because the patterns in, in New York [New York] or in the West tend to be geometry, like plaids and solids, but here you have, you not only have plaids and solids, but you have floral things, patterns on top of patterns, and then if you were in marketplace and you have fifty people moving that way, that influenced my work a great deal.  I came back with ideas about geometry and ideas about what pattern could do that I did not have prior to going.  And proceeded to produce a body of work that was in response to, to that experience.
Story_ID: 466316
Speaker 1: How would you summarize the '70s [1970s] and your art career?
Speaker 2: I'd break it down into two phases, 1970 to '74 [1974], highly involved in the art world, engaged in, in the idea of the cutting edge, engaged in showing, museum.  Nineteen seventy-four [1974] to the end of the '70s [1970s], almost no involvement in the art world, whatsoever.
Speaker 1: But you taught, you continued to teach.
Speaker 2: I continued to teach.  I pulled my- myself and my work out of the art world.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: I needed a period of quietness.
Speaker 1: Had the children been born?
Speaker 2: One child is born.  I needed time to get away from the pressure of all of that selling, selling, selling, selling and I just decided to take myself out of it and just consciously did it.
Story_ID: 466317
Speaker 1: We're gonna continue.  You were gonna tell me a big influence that you may have left out.
Speaker 2: I think, you know, one of the turning points also is I was asked to do an artist in residence at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and I went down and I met [HistoryMaker] David Driskell, and I would say that, that relationship was one of the turning points in my career as well.  This is 1973 I think I go Fisk and do the artist in residence, and David and I have remained friends over the last forty years or whatever number of years it is.  And David, when I was there, was instrumental in introducing me to Aaron Douglas and that in turn got me to thinking about a whole generation of African American artists that one, I didn't know about, or know enough about the history of each one of those persons.  That was really instrumental.  You know one of the nice things that occurred it is, when I was there I noticed a series of Aaron Douglas prints that David had and I inquired about them that, you know, "God I'd really like to have those," and I got a call from Stephanie Poe [ph.] who is teaching there, and she said, "Mr. Douglas heard that you were really interested in his prints and he has some that he will sell you."  So I said okay and I sent them a check and I got a package a few weeks later and I open it up and there's not one print, but there are four prints he sends me.  And he sent me the 'Emperor Jones' series [Aaron Douglas].  I was flabbergasted.  It was such a small amount of money that it was obviously a gift of love on his part to me, because, it, but it connected me to a generation and it also connected me to a whole series of other artists as I started reading more about Aaron Douglas and all of his associates.
Story_ID: 466318
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you include that now in what you teach?  Is it important that artists in general know the history of black artists?
Speaker 2: I include it in my painting class.  I consciously do that.  I consciously introduce as many African American a- artists as possible in context of the work, not as African American art, but artists who are doing a certain thing with color, look at this, look at the color in this, look at the brush work in this, so that the introduction is to the art, not to the coloration of the artist.  I do that as much as possible.  I think it's important for young artists to know that there is a history before them 'cause a lot of young, specifically African Americans, come into class and they assume that they're the first one and as I kind of open this history up that you're not only not the first one, you know, but there are hundreds, if not thousands preceding you that have done this going back to 1700.  One, there's joy as they begin to see it and open it up and begin to discover it themselves, but also I think it reaffirms to them that they, they can become artists. And it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you said, I'm sorry, that they can become artists.
Speaker 2: They can become artists and it's just a question of being dedicated to it, hard work.
Story_ID: 466319
Speaker 1: You said you pulled out of the art scene the late, from '74 [1974] to '80 [1980]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: For what reasons?
Speaker 2: I had become a father, and that remeant- that meant getting out of my own ego, and into raising a child and putting my heart and soul behind raising this child, as my parents [Hazel Davis Williams and William T. Williams, Sr.] did, and as my grandparents did them.  And that required an extraordinary amount of my time.  It required going to the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], going to Little League, going to all of those kinds of things, and I did that.  I did it for both of my kids [Aaron Williams and Nila Williams].  The art world was always second to those experiences, you know, to going to the little concert that they're giving, or going to the PTA meeting, going to meet the teacher.  That took precedent.
Story_ID: 466320
Speaker 1: How did you then get back involved with that, the school in Maine?  What's the name of the school?
Speaker 2: The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture [Skowhegan, Maine].
Speaker 1: 'Cause you become the director in the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: I became the director.  I was on the board of governors of the school, and the school at one point was in crises in terms of the director left.  There was an interim period.  The governor's--basically it's a school that's run by artists.  Trustees raise the money, but artists govern the school in essence and make decisions.  I was asked by the ot- governors to take the job during that summer, that year, to steer it until we decided on another person.
Speaker 1: Were you the first African American to become the director of the school?
Speaker 2: Yes. (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you the first African American on the board of governors?
Speaker 2: I was not, I was actually the second African American (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And who was the first?
Speaker 2: The first was Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence], and then myself and then [HistoryMaker] David Driskell, and now there are a number of others.
Speaker 1: Well, well you never gave me like the culmination of him meeting you again at Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York], Jake Lawrence, and tying it all together.  You're the student who was at the center and then--
Speaker 2: I meet him again at Pratt.  He's outgoing, friendly, extending himself as much as possible to me, go to Skowhegan, come back and eventually I end up on the board of the school.  It was one of those situations where the school was a perfect fit for me.  The founders of the school liked the work, instructors liked the work.  They invited me back I guess about two years out of graduate school [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut], to come and give a summer talk.  I did the summer talk and joined the board I guess about a year later.  I guess I taught at Skowhegan three times and then the fourth time as the pro-tem director.  I learned a great deal about artists that summer (laughter), a great deal about administrating programs and art education and thinking about all of that and realized that it was something that I never wanted to do again because you have to, you always have to put your, the role of yourself as an artist on hold to begin to administer things, and to get all of these things done.  And there are so many details that you have to be conscious of constantly, that anyone who runs an art department someplace, my hat's off to them, you know.  It's, it's, it's a very difficult job.
Story_ID: 466321
Speaker 1: So in the 1980s with the onslaught of pop art, does that change what you are doing at all, or, or your perception of art?
Speaker 2: It doesn't, it doesn't change, it doesn't change my, what I'm doing.  The pop art is actually a little earlier than that.  And it doesn't really change, it's not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, because it goes back with Lichtenstein [Roy Lichtenstein] and all those guys, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it goes back to the, to '60 [1960].  It really doesn't influence what I'm doing.  I'm, I pretty much, this is the same studio that I rented in 1968.  I pretty much come in here and do what I want to do and how other things fit around it, I don't think about too much.
Story_ID: 466322
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I guess what I was going for was the, was Basquiat [Jean-Michel Basquiat] coming onto the scene and what a, and what that meant to art and did he open any doors, or was he exploited?
Speaker 2: Don't know.  Basquiat's studio was around the corner [in New York, New York], literally around the corner.  I basically come in my studio and painted.  I never really thought about Basquiat and what he was doing.  The body of work was of a younger generation aimed at a different audience, and I never questioned what he was doing.  I loved the energy.  I loved the kind of no-holds barred.  I couldn't really say whether he was exploited or not, you know, I don't know.  Did he open doors?  Certainly the amount of money that his things are being auctioned off for are astronomical.
Speaker 1: Why is that though?  What do you feel that, that is because?
Speaker 2: I think it's because there are people who have an investment in those paintings.  In other words, you know his dealers or dealer sold those paintings to a lot of people.  There's a lot of money investing in it, and if there's that much invested, no one is going to allow those prices to fall and the prices just keep climbing and climbing.  They're at $3, 4 million apiece now.  That's astronomical.  You know I think that's probably, I don't know if there's any other artist of color that's getting those kind of prices.
Story_ID: 466323
Speaker 1: Do you feel that artists of color, the work is still undervalued?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Do--when do you--go ahead.
Speaker 2: I think it's probably the best bargain going in relation to the art world.  If there's an area to invest in, it's certainly the African American artist.  You know, you, I mean, my God, you can get a Tanner [Henry Ossawa Tanner] or a Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence] or Romare Bearden for a fraction of what they're paying for a Basquiat [Jean-Michel Basquiat].  I mean, you know, these are artists of incredible value.  I mean, you know, Norman Lewis is a historical figure, really important artist and, you know, he's, he's just not being collected, he's undervalued.  There are lot of very good artists of color.
Speaker 1: But he's still hanging in the moment.
Speaker 2: He's hanging, yes, he's hanging in the museums, but here's, here's the point that I'm trying to get to, there are a lot of artists that have lived and have painted that are really, really good.  And very often curators don't know of that body of work and they come upon one and they're amazed, that oh god, this guy was that good.  What needs to be done though is you have curators, you have art historians and you have galleries.  All of those things have to come together.  I mean there has to be some promotion behind the artists so the huge body of work is beginning to be exposed.  There are really, really wonderful paintings, paintings that have been done by artists of color.  You just have to have an interest in that area and begin to, to do it.
Story_ID: 466324
Speaker 1: Other painters like yourself, are there other African American abstract painters that you know of, that are producing work still?
Speaker 2: There are lots of them, yes. [HistoryMaker] Jack Whitten is still painting.  [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam is certainly painting.  He has a retrospective that's driving around the country.  Mel Edwards [Melvin Edwards] is not a painter, but a sculptor.  He's still making art.  There are, I think the artists of my generation, none of them have stopped making art.  All of them are still making art.  They are in their studios everyday doing things.  And they are a lot of very, very wonderful artists.  I would say, here is the, the odd thing.  There's an artist named Bill Hudson, put a show together of artists over sixty, and they're all abstract artists, but his requirement was that you had to be at least sixty years old, African American and abstract, and here's I think thirty-two artists that he found that are still practicing, that are vital human beings making art.  So here is a situation where it's a generation that hasn't stopped, certainly hasn't gotten its due, but they haven't stopped making art.  They haven't been crushed by the disappointment.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean they're making, they started making art because it was something they had to do and they continue making art because it's something they have to do.
Story_ID: 466325
Speaker 1: Is there a generation that has come after them that is doing, I mean, your generation, you're still making art.  Who are you passing that torch to?  Are there people coming underneath you?  Are you teaching, are you passing it on?
Speaker 2: There is a wonderful young artist that came out of my class named Nari Ward.  Nari Ward has won every prize there is.  He's won in the Guggenheim [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York], he's been in the 'Venice Biennale.'  He's won just about every, literally every award that's given out.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: It's Nari, N-A-R-I, Ward, W-A-R-D.  He's a terrific artist.  There's another young artist that came out of my class named Arthur Simms.  Arthur Sims has won a Guggenheim. Arthur Simms has won two national endowments.  Arthur Simms has been in 'Venice Biennale.'  These are two African American artists that are absolutely extraordinary.  They are on the scene, they're doing extremely well.  They are really well-known and they're terrific.  There are lots of them.
Speaker 1: So you're doing a good job of keeping it, passing it on.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm doing a good job maybe of trying to find them and providing an environment in a classroom where they can flourish.  These are, these, these young artists are most of the time self-starters and you just have to stay out of the way pretty much.  I mean that's my teaching philosophy (laughter) pretty much.
Story_ID: 466326
Speaker 1: So then have you, you had several teaching posts.  Which stands out for you?  You were at Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York], you were in Virginia, you were in Maine.
Speaker 2: I have con- I have stayed at the City University [City University of New York, New York, New York] for one reason.  It's where I started going to college, and I realize without that introductory step in the City University, I would not be an artist. The tuition is very low.  I think the full tuition is four thousand dollars, which makes it accessible to a lot of artists of color.  It makes it accessible to a lot of people without a lot money.  The university has kept their promise to me when they hired me in that I would be allowed to teach painting to function as an artist, to not get involved in too much administrative stuff, and that I would be able to run my classes and my program the way I wanted it run, and they have stuck to that for the thirty-eight years through three different presidents and that's why I've stayed there.
Story_ID: 466327
Speaker 1: What was the experience like teaching in the South?
Speaker 2: Teaching at Virginia Commonwealth [Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia]?  Virginia Commonwealth was, I was very aware that I was in the South and that was in my own head.  In other words, I was very aware that I was in Richmond, Virginia.  The classroom experience there was different because coming in I had to build trust with the students.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: I was distinguished Commonwealth professor (background noise) so I could come down once a month.
Speaker 1: Once per month (background noise)?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Virginia Commonwealth,
Speaker 1: You had to build trust you said.
Speaker 2: You had to build trust 'cause you're coming down once a month as I was going down, and you had to build trust in, in, in the students to get them to believe that you're coming down for their interests, their best interests, and that was exhausting, you know, just emotionally exhausting.  It was a situation where the person who was head of the program knew me very well.  We had started out in the New York [New York] art scene together, so he was very aware of my teaching over the years and how effective it had been.  And coming there, I guess some of my, my ways of dealing in the classroom is a little different and that I'm very blunt and very straightforward and I pretty much tell students outright, you know, if it's no good, I just say that, you know.  It's no good, don't waste my time, go do something else and come back.  That was very hard sometimes for graduate students to hear because they're so used to people kind of stroking them constantly, and that wasn't the way I dealt with it.  But, after that, it was a, it was a good experience, but the City University [City University of New York, New York, New York] is pretty much the most lasting experience.  Two other experiences in the South that were very good.  I did an artist in residence at Fort Valley State College [Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], which was probably one of the most important things for me because it was a historically black college [HBCU], very small, very small art department, almost nonexistent, and going there and talking to the kids that were interested in art there was very rewarding to me and it really told me this idea of, there are young artists all over this country in every backwaters that basically need exposure, and what it really says is that we need some mechanism to find these kids and develop these kids, because it's easier in the earl- the urban environment because it's almost like the grab bag is there with teachers and all of this, but when you start getting into the rural situations, you get out of New York, out of the urban areas, I think a lot of these kids are not being found and not being found early enough and put in art programs early enough.
Speaker 1: You said there was one other thing about the South, two things.
Speaker 2: The other experience again, was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  That was a very rewarding experience.  You know one of the, my first studio assistant went to Fisk, a young man named Buis Hardison [ph.], and he was a young student I met at Skowhegan [Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine] one year that I was teaching and he moved to New York, called me and I hired him to work for me, and I think it was a good experience for him in terms of working in an art studio, working with an artist, beginning to understand New York and galleries and all of that, learning craft.  He, we worked together for four and a half years, and it was a very good experience for me.

Speaker 1: So in the 1980s it looks like that there is a shift in the style of work that you are creating.
Speaker 2: There was, there was.  A lot of kind of things started to come together.  I had kind of condensed a lot of my ideas, became far more interested in pattern, became far more interested in thicker paint, more encrusted surfaces.  A lot of the experimentation in the early '70s [1970s] was really beginning to pay off in terms of what I knew I could do with the paint.  I wanted to frost the surfaces and things to get away from the brush.  I literally put the brush aside because I thought that was a, it was in the way, the brush.  If I did it, I was going to go back to drawing, and I didn't quite want that.
Speaker 1: Now which series, when do you use the, being on the, you know, he train ride when you were a kid from where you lived into Manhattan [New York] to school, when do you use those images in your paintings?  Is that in the '80s [1980s] when you do the strange fruit.  Is that the horizon?
Speaker 2: That's part of it, but it really starts in '76 [1976] when I come back from, from Nigeria, slight before that.  There's a series of shimmering paintings in the early '70s [1970s] that almost look like water, light hitting a water, and that lasts for between '70 [1970], 1972 and 1975.  I go to Nigeria, I come back.  When I come back I found a way of doing the same thing without the geometry.  And then that lasts all the way through the '80s [1980s], almost to the end of the '80s [1980s], and the horizon line comes in.  The paintings are divided into two parts and that dialogue about two parts is kind of almost like two plates coming together and two kinds of light in, in two separate things.  That began to come into the paintings, so that experience of the horizon, the water and the sky and the train, that lasts almost eighteen years in different forms.
Speaker 1: Why do you use the geometric part of it?  You just, you lose that because you find a more fluid way to--?
Speaker 2: Because I got tired of taping.  In other words, the process was, I thought, getting in the way of the motion at one point, so in removing the tape, it forced me to do something more immediate, more directly.  I came back to that.  In the '90s [1990s] I return back to that and I return back to it because geometry gives me an absolute.  And it gives me an absolute in terms of most of the time it takes me backs to parts, and this idea of the part to the whole again, the sum total of parts being distributed, but yet the parts being a whole.

Speaker 1: So d- the exhibition in California at the museum in Los Angeles [California], the Afro American museum [California African American Museum] in Los Angeles in the late '90s [1990s]
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What work did you show in that show ['East/West: Contemporary American Art']?
Speaker 2: I think I showed a painting called, oh goodness, I don't know what the name of that painting.
Speaker 1: Is that the same painting (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Cape Split" [William T. Williams].
Speaker 1: "Cape Split."
Speaker 2: "Cape Split" was the name of the painting that was shown.  "Cape Split" was a reference to a place in Maine.  Cape Split [Maine] is the home of John Marin, the early American painter, and his son and daughter-in-law invited me to spend the weekend at their home and I and Hugo [ph.], the director of the Colby College art museum [Colby College Museum of Art, Waterville, Maine], and Janet Fish, the painter, and my wife Pat [Patricia Ayr DeWeese], went to the Marins' and spent the weekend, and Cape Split, his home, juts out into the Atlantic Ocean.  Cape Split is the most eastern point of the United States.  It's literally the part that you--
Speaker 1: As far as you can go.
Speaker 2: Right.  And there's this expanse in front of it, of just water, and on three sides, so, and then the fog bank kind of rolls in in the morning and you have these little, little islands when you look out they're there, uninhabited, but they're small things that kind of merge out of the fog, and that painting is, is a reference to that place.
Story_ID: 466330
Speaker 1: Is that the painting that they used, which painting did they use in the book that--?
Speaker 2: 'Cape Split' [William T. Williams].
Speaker 1: 'Cape Split' is the, in the 'Art of History' [sic.]?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: 'Cape Split' in 'Janson's History of Art' ['Janson's History of Art: The Western Tradition,' H.W. Janson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'History of Art.'
Speaker 2: --they used a painting called 'Batman' [William T. Williams].
Speaker 1: 'Batman.'
Speaker 2: The experience of 'Batman' comes out of when my daughter [Nila Williams] was young, I used to have to go and pick her up after school and we had a ritual and what we would do on the way home, I would ask her about homework and all of that and she would tell me what it was.  We would come home, she would do her homework and while she was doing her homework, I would come in the studio and start to work.  She would then come into the studio when she finished her homework and we would watch 'Batman.'  So that music in 'Batman,' (singing) that kind of insistent music, it was the basis of that painting, that kind of pattern that goes all over.  That's where that painting come, came from, and that kind of, the painting that splitting it into two parts had a great deal to do with the notion of duality, duality of identify and duality of experience.
Speaker 1: So it was said that being included in that book was a breakthrough for African American artists.
Speaker 2: I guess it's, it's the first African American work of art that's included in that text that's used in 80 percent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Academia--
Speaker 2: --of all college art history classes.  It's a breakthrough in the sense that's it's the first time.  Some break- breakthroughs though are, it's not the first painting that should have been in the book, let's put it in context.  There are many paintin- painters and paintings that were done prior to that that should have been in that book, but that opened the door.  Now there are, I think there are nine African Americans in the text now.  It's extraordinary that that's happened.  It's extraordinary that they are going back and revisiting chapters that precede my inclusion, rethinking the 19th century.  In that sense, I guess it opened the door for some, some rethinking, revision, revisionist history, and I'm happy for that and certainly proud of that, but--
Speaker 1: You had a lot of exhibitions in the '90s [1990s] and the late, you know, in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s], any of these really stand out for you that as, you know, exhibitions that really meant something to you because the work meant a bit more to you than some of the others.  And we will change the tape while you think about it and that's where we'll pick up.
Story_ID: 466331
Speaker 1: Anacostia Museum [Anacostia Neighborhood Museum; Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.].  Is that located--where is it located?
Speaker 2: Anacostia Museum is located in Washington, D.C.  It's in the Anacostia section of Washington, D.C.  It's one of the oldest African American communities in the D.C. area.  It's an area that's neglected, historically really neglected.  The Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] built a, an extension in Anacostia that was called the Anacostia Museum.  I was on it along with [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam and Martha Jackson Jarvis, to open the museum for the Smithsonian when it opened in Anacostia.  The show was important for me for a number of reasons.  It's the Smithsonian, you know the high point of, I guess, the idea of finally reaching a mass audience, but also it was a, a sign that Anacostia was going to survive and probably was going to thrive.  It seemed to me the museum was an anchor and that we as artists again were bringing that collective experience to that community.  The response of, at the opening and during the time it was up, was extraordinary.  It was, for me the opening was like going to church, you know, like you haven't been home to North Carolina in a long time, you go back, the warmth, the, the extension, the, the expressions of, of pride, were extraordinary.  That was really an incredible experience for me.  And I will always remember that experience at the Anacostia.  You know, It's a--
Speaker 1: How is that museum doing now, do you know?
Speaker 2: It's still going, it still has, has shows, probably the, the, probably the difficulty is getting people to come to that branch because you have to, it takes something to do that, but there is, you know, there's hope the exhibitions go on and I am sure that there have been some new artists that have gone through that that it's helped them go on to be artists, and if it does that, it served its job.  If just one kid goes through there that becomes an artist, it served its job.
Story_ID: 466332
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) International, Venezuela.
Speaker 2: The show in Venezuela was a terrific show ['Espiritu and Materia: Estetica Alternitiva Norteamericano'].  The show with [HistoryMaker] Jack Whitten, Mel Edwards [Melvin Edwards] and Tyrone Mitchell traveled to Venezuela.  The Venezuelan people went out of their way to make us at home.  They cleaned that museum [Museo Alejandro Otero, Caracas, Venezuela] from top to bottom, I mean, literally cleaned it, and installed our show.  And they installed the show with such pride and honor and joy.  I had never been in an experience like that.  The show was beautifully hung.  We had the entire museum.  Every artist had a gallery to themselves, so it was basically four one-man shows in, in the museum.  The lighting was perfect.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  The American ambassador showed up.  We did the tour with the American ambassador.  He gave us a dinner, a formal dinner at the embassy.  We had numerous dinners with Venezuelan artists and the arts community there, extraordinary experience.

Speaker 1: So when you receive something like a lifetime achievement award from the Studio Museum of Harlem [sic. Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] and you're so young, because that was almost ten years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you think?  I'm still alive, I still have a lot to do (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was honored and I was, I was very happy that they acknowledged my contribution to the museum, to the artist in residence program.  And I was very happy that they acknowledged my work, and I was probably happier for the artist in residence program, because that program just about every major African American artist has come through that program, from David Hammons to, you name it, have all gone through that program.  So I was probably almost more happy that that program is still in existence, and still influencing a generation of artists.
Story_ID: 466334
Speaker 1: I thought maybe, just maybe, my generation needed to just keep working.  That was all we had to do was just keep working, everything would take care of itself.  It's, it's been a, it's been a wonderful ride.  I wouldn't change it for anything.  The only thing I wish I had done during that period is make more work.
Speaker 2: Do you?
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.  Lots of ideas that I locked away in notebooks, lots of other kinds of things I want to do.  That's probably the only regret during that whole period is, just that I wish there was more studio time.  I could have made more paintings.
Story_ID: 466335
Speaker 1: Where would you like to see all of your paintings end up?
Speaker 2: It's going to be up to my daughter [Nila Williams] and my son [Aaron Williams].  I hope they will give some away.  I hope they will look at institutions who probably can't afford to buy one and be generous with those institutions.  I hope most of the historical black colleges [HBCUs] that have museums, they will be generous with those museums.
Speaker 1: You are working towards that in a different way aren't you?  Aren't you doing something with black colleges there?
Speaker 2: I'm working toward it in a lot of ways, in terms of I have started giving things to colleges.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My, my hope is that there, assuming that the work gets to the point where it's valuable.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's valuable now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think both of the kids are sensible enough to know my interest and my interest has a great deal to do with education, and that they would set up a foundation and whose aim and goal would be toward education.  I think they'll do that.  I'd like to see the works distributed across the country, in many museums as possible, specifically, smaller regional museums.  I think that's kind of important.  I mean there's enough work that I think that can be, be accomplished.
Story_ID: 466336
Speaker 1: Just because for the sake of history, you know, I don't know how many people have the opportunity to take a peek inside of those notebooks, but what are some of the things in the notebooks that you can share with me on tape that you didn't get to that you would like to as far as things you'd like to explore in painting?
Speaker 2: I wanted to do some books, you know.
Speaker 1: Children's books?
Speaker 2: I would love to do a children's book.  I'd like to do some limited edition books.  I'd like to work with some poets where they do the text, I do the, the visuals.  I particularly want to work with one writer.  His name is Walter Jones.  Walter Jones is a playwright.  He wo- wrote the American classic called 'Jazznite.'  He also happens to have grown up in the same town that I grew up in in North Carolina.  He also happens to be an extended relative.  I hope to one day do a project with him where I can use his text and my visuals and be put into some kind of limited edition book form.  We did some early theater work together at Joe Papp [The Public Theater, New York, New York], so it's a collaborative adventure I really enjoyed with him.
Speaker 1: What did you do at the Papp theater?
Speaker 2: I did some stage sets there early on.  Joe [Joseph Papp] produced Walter's play called 'Jazznite.'  Walter was the person that discovered Chuck Gordone [Charles Gordone] who wrote 'No Place to be Somebody' that won the Pulitzer Prize.  It was Walter that found Chuck's play and found Chuck and brought it to Joe Papp, and Joe Papp eventually produced Chuck and then Chuck went on to Broadway and then went on to win the Pulitzer Prize.  So I hope one day to do something with Walter.  I think that's a, that's a project that's been on hold for almost thirty years and I think it's one that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What would you like to do, the book you said or is there any (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'd like to do a book.  I'd like to do, I'd like to do anything that allows the public to read the work of this man and read the, the breadth and depth of his experience, because I think here is a person that's has been enormously influential on a lot of playwrights and a lot of actors and people that he's been involved in, and yet hasn't gotten his due.  I think he's a terrific writer.
Story_ID: 466337
Speaker 1: So you spoke about your children.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How old are they now?
Speaker 2: My daughter [Nila Williams] is thirty-four, think she's thirty-four, I think she's thirty-four.  She's a lawyer.  She specializes in bankruptcy.  She works for a (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hope I never need her (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I hope none of us needs her.  She's a terrific lawyer.  My son Aaron [Aaron Williams] is my manager.
Speaker 1: How old is he?
Speaker 2: Aaron is twenty-five.
Speaker 1: You have a young manager?
Speaker 2: Yep.  He's twenty-five and he's--
Speaker 1: Can he take the work places it hadn't been before because he's so young?
Speaker 2: Well, Aaron is the one that designed, constructed the website, so he is taking the work and me in places that I never thought to go and in ways and levels that I never thought to go.  His first project was the website which is extraordinary in terms of what he did.  He has a whole different plan than I had.  He was an engineering major and business major so he's bringing his business background to what we're going to do.
Story_ID: 466338
Speaker 1: Who was it that taught you about the business of art?
Speaker 2: The business of art--
Speaker 1: You know you can teach a kid to paint, but someone needs to teach him to sell a painting.
Speaker 2: I think coming through that, I think my mother [Hazel Davis Williams].  My mother was a taskmaster.  My father [William T. Williams, Sr.] was a provider, meaning that he went out and earned money.  My mother was a saver.  My mother was a dreamer and my mother was a person who made the dream come true.  Her theory was always pay yourself first and I've always listened to that, pay yourself first, value yourself.  Understand your value.  I tried in terms of this whole idea of making art, I wanted people to own the work.  I tried to make the work accessible to people, understand its value, but try to make it accessible.  Aaron [Williams' son, Aaron Williams] has taken up on that as well, the idea that you're not making, you didn't start making art for millionaires.  You start to making art because you wanted to communicate with people and you wanted to communicate with people across the board.  I had been very conscious over the years to make prints, to make drawings, to make works on large range and a whole kind of up and down the spectrum in terms of what it costs.  When I got in the 'History of Art,' ['Janson's History of Art: The Western Tradition,' H.W. Janson] my prices did not go up.  I didn't overnight say oh, gee, I'm here and this thing is worth $10 million.  I did just the opposite.  I started making a body of prints that I started primarily because I wanted to make sure that there were bodies of works that could go to people who just were starting out and were interested in art.  And I have continued to make prints primarily because of that, because it's an accessible medium, it's meant to get to a lot of people, it's meant to communicate with a lot of people.  You know, the--art only has meaning when it's communicating with another person.  It needs that viewer.  That's important.
Story_ID: 466339
Speaker 1: Do you find that there are fewer black artists today than there were when you started? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There are more black artists now.  There are many, many more kids in the art schools.  There are many more kids that are now opting to become painters, going into the fine arts rather than commercial art.  And there are a lot of them that are very skilled.
Speaker 1: And your advice to them?
Speaker 2: My advice to them is that this is a long-distance activity.  It's not a sprint that you can get a great deal of attention when you're very early on.  The idea is to spread this attention over a forty or fifty year career, as Bearden [Romare Bearden] did, you know, as Jacob Lawrence did.  That is the hard part, is to make this career last a lifetime, as opposed to a flash in the pan.  The way you do that is you stay focused on making art as opposed to all the other activities.  I got a great piece of advice from Kynaston McShine, who was the curator at the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], African American, only African American curator at that point at the Modern, and this is 1969, after the Modern bought my painting ['Elbert Jackson, L.A.M.F. Part II,' William T. Williams], and he said, "Bill [HistoryMaker William T. Williams], careers are not made at cocktail parties.  Stay in your studio and paint."  And I never forgot that, the idea that you have to do the work.  All the other stuff may be helpful, but you have to have a body of work and that is what the bottom line is.  When I'm gone, the only thing left is this body of work and that body of work has to hold up.
Story_ID: 466340
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: My last painting.  That's it, my last painting.  That my last painting was good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, that's it (laughter) you know it's--I pretty much dedicated my life to two thi- no three things, family first, art and education.  That's been my thrust.  Family because that was what was drilled into me.  It's first and foremost.  I think that extended family situation I grew out of North Carolina kind of drilled that into me.  Education because that's what was drilled into me, over and over and over again.  And the art because that's what I had a gift for, that to, all of those things can come together but you have to have the right order to put these things in, and my order was always family, education, art.
Story_ID: 466341
Speaker 1: We only have a few minutes left on this tape, but there are a couple of things sort of that are just on the outside that I (unclear) to do.  There, you know, you came, is there any way, did affirmative action have anything to do with you making you who you are?
Speaker 2: Goodness, that's a hard question.  Certainly affirmative action set the stage for a lot of things in America.
Speaker 1: But not in art.
Speaker 2: Not in art.  Art is one of those activities that's outside of it.  I wouldn't know how to answer that, you know, I really wouldn't know how to answer that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I mean, it just came to me that there's way to apply it to art and, you know, there's no way you can make affirmative action work within, you know, within art, I mean you can't, I don't know, just--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, I don't know.  Well, there are probably other ways that works.  I mean you can say, well, all the museums in terms of hiring began to think about that--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're absolutely right. They hire curators (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they hire, they begin to hire curators, or they begin to hire other people--
Speaker 1: You're right, that's true.
Speaker 2: --so they're behind the scenes.  That behind the scenes then creates a context where it's a bigger picture to be looked at.
Story_ID: 466342
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So we didn't talk about that and that's very interesting.  We, how far have we come as far as behind the scenes?  We have more, you say we have more African American artists now producing work, but what about curators and directors, have we come as far in those areas?
Speaker 2: We've come a long way there, and again, that's, that's the gift of the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] because so many of those people that are now curators and directors were trained at the Studio Museum.  There are many, many more people behind the scenes than there were when I started.  I mean when I started there was two that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Who were those two?
Speaker 2: That was Kynaston McShine and Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims], and when I start, Lowery wasn't there.  So there was basically Kynaston McShine at the Modern [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York].  And that was it that I knew of.
Speaker 1: Is Lowery retired now, or she still at the studio.
Speaker 2: Lowery is still at the Studio Museum.  She is now president, but for a long time there was Lowery and Lowery was Lowery and Kynaston and then there were others that came aboard and there was Jackie, you know, Jackie Serwer [Jacquelyn Serwer] now in Washington [D.C.] that was at the national gallery and then at the Corcoran [Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.] so there are many, many more.  The curator of the McNeil Foundation [ph.] in Texas is an African American, so the infrastructure has changed a great deal.
Speaker 1: Does that increase the visibility of African American artists you feel to have curators who are African American?
Speaker 2: I think it increases the dialogue about African American artists because their interest might not be specifically African American art.  They may be, you know, 19th century specialists, or, you know, or the '30s [1930s] specialists.  But it certainly increases the consciousness and the dialogue thereof, and that's important that there's someone that's sitting at the table when the instance comes up where an African American should be included naturally, they can say it was this person who was part of that movement.  That becomes important, that the voice is there and that the conscience of the voice is there.  I think the infrastructure there has changed.  I think there are African American dealers that in place now that weren't there in 1965, they weren't in place.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Peg Alston, you know Peg.
Speaker 2: I know Peg well.  Peg is in place.  Peg is, this is probably her thirtieth anniversary.  The gallery's gone from when she started now to an extremely well-respected institution with a very specialized audience and doing an extraordinary job.  So it takes time for that to come in place as well.  It also takes time to, to put collectors in place.  There are collectors that are specializing in collecting African American art.  Museums are, are starting collections there.  And as all that happens, what begins to happen is certainly the work is more valued but the critical writing changes as well, and the scholarship changes and as the critical writing and the scholarship changes, when what we think of American art changes, you know.  And we're all grateful for one person for changing the whole scene and that's Dr. David Driskell [HistoryMaker David Driskell].  His scholarship and his insistence totally changed American art and certainly changed the way museums and writers deal with African American artists.  I can say singular I can think of no other person in America who had the impact and the influence and the vision to do it as he did it.
Story_ID: 466343
Speaker 1: I would like to end what did your parents think?  They'd watched you for all those years.  What did they think?
Speaker 2: My parents are wonderful.  All the years I was going to art school, they supported me.  My father [William T. Williams, Sr.] worked two jobs, my mother [Hazel Davis Williams] worked.  Sometimes my father worked three jobs to put me through art school.  They never complained.  I would say, you know, I need money for paint.  They never said it wasn't there.  It was always there.  Came out of graduate school [Yale School of Art and Architecture; Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut], they gave me probably half the money they had at that point, and my parents are not wealthy people, to rent the studio.  Always came to my exhibitions, got to know most of the artists, you know, Mel [Melvin Edwards] and [HistoryMaker] Jack Whitten and all of these artists got to know them, befriended them, invited them to, to my home, to--fed them.  One of the best things was last November when I won the Governors Award, the North Carolina's Governors Award [North Carolina Governors Award for the Fine Arts], was my mother came with me to the awards dinner, and she was sitting at the table and, unfortunately, my father passed away a year and a half ago so he wasn't there, and I went in my pocket and pulled out a picture of my father and she looked at me in amazement that I had this picture with me.  And she kind of nodded her head and didn't say anything and I came back to the table after I'd gone on the stage with the governor [Mike Easley] and shook hands and took the picture and got the little thing about my neck and came back and sat down at the table and I took the medal off and I kind of handed it to her.  And she looked at it and said that's very nice and kind of handed it back to me and said, "You earned it."  And I thought about that for a while and thought about that for a while and I realize at that point, that's the way she always were, go and earn it.  That was always her thing, go and earn it, do it right.  I mean I can, I can hear her in my ear constantly all the little things she used to say, and I could not have done it without them, you know, it's whatever their modest means, my father, they were always there.  I don't know how else to say it, they were always there for me from the inception.  My mother is still there, you know.  She's eighty-six years old and still there in terms of the art.  I'll sometimes call her and I say, "I'm tired you know, I haven't painted."  And she says, "What do you mean you're not painting, what do you mean you're tired?  Just take the time, get back in the studio."  I mean she still encouraged me to get in the studio, so I'm, I'm, I will forever be grateful to them, you know, for all the discipline, all the, all the things I probably didn't understand when I was young.  They did the right thing. I don't know how else to say it.
