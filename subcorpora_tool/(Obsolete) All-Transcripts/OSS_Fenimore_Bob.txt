 Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  My name is Janet Ahrberg with the Oklahoma State University Library,  and today is June 16, 2008. I   m at the home of Bob Fenimore here in  Stillwater, Oklahoma interviewing Mr. Bob Fenimore. How are you, Mr.  Fenimore?  Fine, Janet. Thank you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you, both of you.  Let   s get started and talk a little bit about your early life and get some  background on you. Give us a little insight into your early life, where  you were born, where you went to school, for your elementary and high  school years, and about the place you grew up.  Okay. I was born   in fact, Veta  his wife  and I both were born in  Woodward, Oklahoma, and went to grade school and high school there  before we went to college. She went to OU  University of Oklahoma   and I went to OSU  Oklahoma A M at that time .  So did you play many sports as a youth?  Yes. We didn   t have track in high school, but I played football and  basketball which took most of the year. When I came to college, I didn   t  play basketball. I just played football and ran track.  And how did you become interested in football?  Oh, we had a front yard that looked like a football field, and I guess  that   s what started it all. A number of my friends in the neighborhood  liked to play football so we would just get together out in the front yard  5  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  and have at it, you know.  At this point in your life, did you know what position you wanted to  play?  No. I played left end up until the time I was a senior and then the coach  moved me to the backfield. We had an outstanding back who played a  year ahead of me, and of course I couldn   t take his place but while he  was playing in the backfield, I was playing left end.  My understanding is that you were an All-State football player. Is that  right?  Well, that   s what they say. It   s been so long ago, I forgot, Janet.  (Laughs)  Well that   s quite an honor. It really is. So tell me, what led you to attend  Oklahoma A M?  We had a principal by the name of Joe Timpkin, and A M was the only  school as far as he was concerned, and that   s all I heard about was  A M. I never did visit OU. Veta Jo went to OU, and I was down there  every weekend, but I was going to school at OSU.  Was the University of Tulsa interested in you?  Yes, that   s right. They were. Henry Franco was the coach at Tulsa. I  visited Tulsa but I wasn   t really interested. The thing that got me  interested in Oklahoma State as much as anything was the interest that  our coach, Jim Lookabaugh, had in me. I remember I wanted a catalog  to see what I wanted to study in school, and I wrote him a note and  asked him if he   d send me one, and in just a few days here it came. So  he was outstanding   a good football coach and a good man.  So when you came to Oklahoma A M, did you have a major that you  decided on or     Oh, I thought I would   as most players think these days, they want to  coach   so I got into the School of Education. I got into the School of  Business first, but then after a couple or three semesters I decided that I  wanted to be a coach so I got in the School of Education.  How did you acquire the nickname the    Blond Bomber?     You know I really don   t know, Janet, how that happened. (Laughter) I  guess my hair was blond, but I don   t know where the    bomber    came.  6  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  (Laughs) Somebody made it up.  Well, of course you were at Oklahoma A M during 1943 through    46     That   s right.     and so you were there during the war years   World War II. What was  it like for an athlete to be playing during those war years?  Well, of course I had nothing to compare it to, but we had a full squad of  players and we worked every day from   oh, we   d start about three  o   clock in the afternoon and go till dark. And unlike the way they  practice now, we scrimmaged most of the time just like it was a regular  game   tackled and blocked and everything. As a result of that, a lot of  them got hurt, but that   s the way practices were held then.  Well were there any shortages? Like shortages for uniforms or gas or     Not that we were aware of. Possibly so, but not that we were aware of. I  can   t think of anything.  Okay.  Travel   how did you travel, Robert?  Well, we had about four or five men in Stillwater who would use their  cars and take all the football players to and from the games. So that   s the  way   we didn   t have a bus or anything. We just used cars like that, and  it worked out fine.  Now my understanding is that you played down in Oklahoma City. You  didn   t play on campus for football games?  That   s right. Well, we did     You played at Taft Stadium?  Yes. When I was a senior, we played all of our home games here in  Stillwater, but up until then we played all of the games in Taft Stadium.  And that was located where?  In Oklahoma City.  Okay.  7  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Out on Northwest 23rd.  So were a lot Oklahoma A M people able to get down there to watch  the games?  Well, there were. They sure made a lot of racket, the ones that were  there (Laughter) I know, but, yes, they were well attended.  I won   t dwell on this too much, but what do you remember when they  announced that World War II was over? You were still on campus at  that time. Do you remember where you were?  No.  You don   t?  No.  Okay. Do you remember how they celebrated when they heard that the  war was over?  No.  No? Okay. Did it change the atmosphere of the campus in the sense that  there was kind of a burdened lifted   a freer atmosphere with the war  being over?  I didn   t notice much of a change, Janet. There possibly was but not that I  remember.  Well Stillwater   s kind of isolated.  Yes, and we   re talking several years ago.  Yes, I know. Tell us a little bit about the coaching staff. You said your  head coach was Coach     Jim Lookabaugh.  Yes, and then your backfield coach was Coach Green?  Coach Jack Baker.  Oh, Baker, okay.  Toby Green was the line coach.  8  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  Finchum  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  Okay.  We had three coaches   Lookabaugh, Baker and Green   and of course  Jack Baker was my coach.  Okay. Did you have much interaction with them off the field?  Not much.  Were they tough? Did they make you work hard?  It seemed to me like, of course I had nothing to compare it to, but it  seemed to me like we were scrimmaging all the time. And we   d go out  there at three o   clock in the afternoon and finish about 6:00, 6:30, and it  seemed like most of the time we were blocking and tackling.  Okay. Can you tell us about when you did play those games   some of  the traditions that Oklahoma A M had as far as the fans? Did they all  wear orange? What was it like?  Well, first of all, I   m color blind (Laughter) so I was at a disadvantage. I  assume they all wore orange.  Okay.  I   m sure they did, but I couldn   t tell.  Okay. Well, did the crowd wear coats and ties   the men come to the  games in coats and ties?  No.  No? Everybody kind of   it was relaxed?  Very, very informal.  Okay.  When you traveled, did you have to dress up?  We had to wear coats, as I recall, but not ties.  Men wore hats in the stadium. Pictures show that all the men had on felt  hats. (Laughs) They all wore them, and they didn   t wear orange like they  do now.  9  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  Really? Okay. Tell us about when you went to those away games   like,  you said you didn   t travel by bus, there was a     No, we had four or five men here in town that would take their cars and  they   probably more than that with all the players we had, but that   s the  way we traveled.  Do you have any special memories or something in particular on any of  those away games that stand out as far as something funny that  happened to you or some of the players?  You know of anything, Veta?  Oh, I think you ought to tell them about when OU played you and they  came over and dropped the flyers over the practice field.  OU, let   s see, this was my junior year. OU didn   t send players or  anything, but they     They flew over the practice field and dropped pictures of you.  Dropped leaflets? Yeah, I guess that   s right. (Laughter)  Did you think the sky was falling?  It was a dumb-looking football player.  Oh, is that right?  With his numbers.  And they did that   they   d   oh, my gosh.  My number was 55, and they had 55 on the jersey, naturally. So we  decided that we were going to go down there and try to beat them 55 to  nothing. (Laughter) But that was before the day of the two-point  conversion. We got to 47, but there wasn   t any way that we could end up  with 55 unless we got them for a safety and we didn   t do that. So we  settled for 47. We wanted to make it 100, but our coach said,    No. We  won   t do that.     But you did beat them that year?  Oh, yes. (Laughter)  Well that   s a sweet revenge. (Laughter) How did you spend the time off  10  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  the field when you weren   t practicing and going to class? What did you  do for fun there?  Oh, write letters to her and read letters from her.  Okay.  We didn   t have dances that I attended, although they did have them. Pee  Wee Williams, our trainer   he was a great jitterbugger, if that   s the  term. He and a gal by the name of Melba Osborne used to jitterbug, and  when they did, everybody else quit dancing and they all circled around  the two of them and let them go. They were very good.  Have you stayed in touch with any of your fellow teammates?  Neill Armstrong is probably the best friend that I   ve got, and he was our  captain and played left end and played 11 years of professional football.  He was an outstanding player, and I remember we used to work out in  the basement at Gallagher-Iba and we were down there running one time  and he said,    Bob, why don   t you come out for track?    and I said,    No,  no. I believe I do enough. I like to go to Norman on the weekends, so I  don   t think so.    But I said,    I   ll tell you what. Let   s run 40 yards and if  you beat me, I   ll go out for track.    I didn   t think he could beat me, but  he did (Laughter) and I said,    Make it two out of three,    and he said,     No. A deal   s a deal. You   re coming out.    (Laughter)  So what did you run in track? Was it the 440 relay?  The dashes   100s and 220.  Okay, and what position did you play when you played at Oklahoma  A M? Your football position?  Tailback and single wing. We ran a single wing back formation, which  is the fullback and the tailback lined up about four or five yards behind  center and the other two lined up further to the right. That was my  position all the time I was in school.  Okay. Tell us about that famous Cotton Bowl game against Texas  Christian University  TCU  where you beat the Frogs   I think it was 34  to nothing.  Yeah.  Can you tell us a little bit about that game?  11  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Finchum  Finchum  Well that was the first bowl game that A M had gone to, and we didn   t  know really what to expect. We knew TCU had a good football team,  but we were quite a bit better than they were   why I don   t know   but  we just kept scoring touchdowns and stopping them. So we eventually  won the game.  Well this was, let   s see that was 1945, 44?     45 I believe   January    45.  Okay, and then the next year you went to the Rose Bowl?  No, Sugar Bowl.  Oh, Sugar Bowl, excuse me. Can you tell us a little bit about that game?  I know you played against Saint Mary   s.  Yes. They had a back by the name of Herman Weidermyer   a real nice  fella   and we became pretty close after the game, but we beat them. I  think the score was 33 to 13 and we wanted to beat them a lot more, but  our coach wouldn   t let us.  Now I know for the Cotton Bowl trophy, it was housed in the O-Club  Room on the second floor of Gallagher. Do you remember what they  called the O-Club Room? Was it a trophy room?  I don   t know. Are there trophies up there? I think the trophies are  downstairs, but the O-Club Room was the main room.  Was the main room? Okay. Okay.  How did you travel to the Sugar Bowl? How did you get there from  here?  Well, let   s see. I think we probably took a bus then. We flew to a lot of  the games back then when I was a junior, but I think that   s probably the  way we got there. It   s been so long ago, I   ve forgotten. (Laughs)  Did you have to work while you were in school?  We had to work an hour a day up until, I think, we were seniors and then  they discontinued that requirement. That was to get your scholarship,  and  15 a month which was our spending money.  One hour a day?  12  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  One hour a day.  What did you do for that hour? What sort of things?  Well, different ones had different jobs. My job was to close all the  windows in Gallagher-Iba of an evening. So I   d go up there (Laughs)  and shut all the windows, and that was my contribution.  Didn   t you do laundry?  Early on, I think, yes I did.  You washed the towels and learned to use the washing machine.  Yeah, yeah. I washed my clothes, too, while I was at it.  Well did you go back and forth home very much?  Veta was going to OU. She went to junior college in Woodward one  year? One year, and then went to OU, so I had a friend down there and  he had a bed that he let me sleep in. So I   d go down there on the  weekend and see her. I   d hitchhike all the time. That   s the way I got  around.  We   ve heard that a lot.  Yeah. Everybody hitchhiked.  So how long would it take you?  Oh, a couple hours to get to Oklahoma City.  And one or two switches in the cars or     Well, most generally we tried to   we hoped our ride was going to  Oklahoma City. Sometimes they wouldn   t, they   d just be going to  Guthrie. But we made it all right.  You played a lot of games. Is there one game in particular that stands  out in your mind as your best game that you played?  Well my backfield coach tells me that the best game I had was against  TCU when we were juniors. I can   t remember the score. We beat them  by several touchdowns, but that was my best game in that I probably  made more yards running than I did any of the other games.  13  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  Okay. I   m going to read some of your honors you   ve received, and I  would like to know your opinion or how you feel about how all this has  impacted you as you gained a little celebrity status in Oklahoma as  being among all the all-time great football players by the number of  honors and statistics that you have. You are one of the first two-time All-  American selections from Oklahoma A M, for 1944 and 1945. As a  player you set many school records. You finished third in the Heisman  voting in 1945, and you led the nation that year in rushing and in offense  also, and then earlier in 1944, you led the nation in total offense. In  1972, you were inducted into the College Hall of Fame and you were  inducted in 2007 into the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame. You were one of  the players that played on the only unbeaten and untied season 9 and 0  in Oklahoma A M/OSU history, in 1945. So with that being said, how  did you handle being a celebrity? And I assumed that you were kind of a  BMOC  Big Man on Campus  on campus being such a great player  and     Not really. (Laughter) Not really, no. Oh, football had its place but we  had other things that we did that we enjoyed doing and so it was just  something we did in the afternoon. But most every weekend I   d be out  on the highway hitchhiking down to Norman.  Did you get interviewed quite a bit by the press back then?  It seemed to me like there was a   let   s see   I can   t remember the  sportswriter   s name. Otis Wild was our, of course, publicity man.  Hal Middlesworth was the sportswriter in Oklahoma City, and I used to  talk to him a lot.  Of course you were there at a time that were probably the best football  years for Oklahoma A M, which was 1944 through    45 and also that  was the year, I believe   one of those years, that Oklahoma A M won  the national collegiate championship for basketball and so   that was  under Henry Iba.  That   s right.  Can you tell us a little bit about Mr. Iba   your impression and did you  know him very well?  Very well. He was always    Mr. Iba.    No one ever called him Henry,  except my brother. My brother was a basketball player and he played  here, but he would call him Henry   and every time he did, I would just  cringe if I was there because no one else (Laughs) ever did that.  Did you go to some of the basketball games?  14  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Oh, yes. Yes, all of them. That   s all we had to do really.  And one of his noted players is Bob Kurland.  Right.  Did you know him very well?  Very well.  Okay.  In fact, I talked to him the other day. He called for some reason.  Just to visit with you.  Well, he   s a good visitor. Bob was a very bright student   was an honor  roll student and made excellent grades, and went to work for Phillips 66  upon graduation and made a good employee there   stayed with them  until he retired.  Now you   ve lived in Stillwater   you were a native of Woodward, but  you   ve stayed here in Stillwater since graduating? I know you played  one year professionally for the Chicago Bears.  Right.  And was Chicago too cold or you just liked Stillwater? Why did you stay  in Stillwater?  Well, of course our family was   we   ve always been in Oklahoma, and  there was really no reason to leave. Had I played several years in  Chicago I might have stayed there. I don   t know, but hopefully not.  (Laughs)  Stillwater just felt like home for you?  Yes, yes   Stillwater and Woodward.  Going back to sports, what do you think are some of the biggest changes  in the game as far as the   let   s say, the players and the way the game is  played now?  Well I   d like to think that they throw the ball more now than we did, but  we threw it quite a bit. Passing is probably the biggest change over the  time I played till today.  15  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  Are the players bigger, more athletic, do you think?  Well, I don   t know that they   re more athletic. They   re bigger, but not  any better I don   t think. I would like to have our team play a team that  plays today, just to see how we   d come out. But we just had about 16  football players that played all the time. We played both offense and  defense. When we got through playing one side, we   d go switch and  play the other. So you had to be in good condition, and Lookabaugh saw  that we were. We ran a lot of sprints during the week, and we couldn   t  wait till the weekend so we didn   t have to do that, but he was an  excellent coach, had a good staff. The backfield coach was my favorite  coach, and his name was Jack Baker. He played here at OSU and was an  excellent football player as a fullback and was a good coach.  Did you play against many minorities?  No. As a matter of fact, I cannot recall playing against a black in college.  I did in pro ball. One year, of course, was all I played, but there were  several players that were black that played then.  Of all your athletic honors and records, is there one or two in particular  that you   re most proud of and why?  Oh, the College Football Hall of Fame probably would be the biggest  award that I got. I got others, I guess, but that was the best.  Now let   s go back to campus life and living. Where did you live on  campus?  I lived in Hanner Hall and one summer I lived at the Sigma Nu house  and as a result of that I pledged Sigma Nu, but I never lived in the house  after that. I always lived with the players in Hanner Hall. So I really  didn   t get the feeling of fraternity life like they do now.  Okay. Is there a particular place on campus that is special to you?  Swim   s probably. We all would gather at Swim   s and they had a dance  floor, and Pee Wee Williams was always a jitterbugger and he and  Melba Osborne would eventually end up on the dance floor and we  would all gather around and watch them jitterbug.  Were you involved in any campus organizations or groups outside of  athletics? You said you belonged to Sigma Nu. Were there any other  organizations that you belonged to   anything related to your major  perhaps that you might want to mention?  16  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V.

Fenimore  No. I was   let   s see, I think I was President of the Freshman Class, and  I was President of the Junior Class or Senior Class   I can   t remember     but other than that, that   s about the only honors I got.  Did you visit the Library very often?  The Library wasn   t one of my favorite spots. (Laughter) If I had any  extra time, I would hitchhike to Norman. (Laughter)  They took a day off when they won. They had walk-outs, they called it,  right?  Yes.  After they beat OU, you didn   t have any classes the next Monday   isn   t  that right?  That   s right.  And did you get thrown in Theta Pond at any point?  No, I didn   t. I missed that fortunately.  You missed that.  Yes. I   ve thrown people in, but I   ve never gotten thrown in. (Laughs)  You said you hitchhiked a lot, so I guess you didn   t have a car. It was  rare to have a car on campus was it not?  Yes, it was. Yeah. If you had a car, you had a lot of friends. (Laughs)  What was Homecoming like? Did they have Homecoming back then?  They had Homecoming. I really can   t remember what they did. You  know, when you play football at a university like Oklahoma State, that   s  about all you do. You go to class and play football   and come the  weekend, I hitchhiked to Norman. But that was about the extent of my  college career.  Can you tell us about any classes or professors that played a big role in  your life?  Dr. Orr?  No.  17  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V.

Fenimore  Who   d you take anatomy from?  I just took one class. I can   t remember the history professor.  How about Dr. Ball?  No.  Russell Ball?  No, he was economics professor.  You had a class with him.  Yes, but just one class   but I had   I can   t remember the professor   s  name, but     What did he teach that you liked?  History.  History. Do you remember some of the buildings you had classes in?  Williams Hall and of course we lived in Hanner.  Was Morrill Hall here on campus?  Yes, yes, had a few classes in Morrill. I was in the School of Business  for the first couple of years and then I decided I was gonna be a coach     big mistake, but anyway that   s what happened (Laughter) and so I  changed to Education.  If you were gonna get a drink on campus   to go get like a soft drink on  campus, where would you go?  Swim   s.  Swim   s?  That was the most popular place on campus.  Did they have anything in the Student Union at that time?  No, not much. I don   t think it was even here.  18  Finchum  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B.

Yes, the Y-Hut. I went there, but that was so small. Gosh, you had to get  there early to even get a seat. (Laughter)  It was just a little    ole white building.  Yeah.  Well, what is it about Oklahoma A M, or Oklahoma State now, that  sparks such loyalty, do you think, in the alumni and students?  Well you know, I can   t tell you, Janet, what or why. It certainly does,  but I     Is it the people and the friendships that you   ve made?  Probably, yes.  You say you   re still friends with Neill Armstrong?  Right.  You still talk to him and Bob Kurland?  Right. Right.  They   ve had reunions which were really great because they were so  close.  Just a close friendship that you   ve had with these people? That   s  awesome. What advice do you have for students or student athletes  today that are coming to Oklahoma State University?  Well get your degree for sure and get into the type of class that teaches  you something.  Have other members of your family attended OSU?  My brother got a basketball scholarship at OSU, and as a freshman he  played a little, but then he got into   what did you call it? It was     Intensified business.  19  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B.

Fenimore  Yes     It was just a two-year course.     and finished in two years and went back to Woodward to work in the  hardware store with my dad, which is where I was going to go except he  was there so the store wouldn   t support more than my dad and my  brother. So I took a job with an insurance company in Oklahoma City  and was with them until I retired.  So you just had one sibling?  Two. I have a brother and a sister.  And where did she  sister  go?  I think she came here one year.  Okay.  She didn   t graduate.  And then your children came here?  Yes.  What   s your favorite sport to watch now on TV?  Football. (Laughs) Although I enjoy all of them.  Okay, well I   m real curious. Did you ever throw a football around with  your daughters, Jo Ellen and Beth?  I don   t think so.  I don   t think so.  No.  Okay.  Tell them the story about the wrestler on the campus, when you   re  walking across the campus with the wrestler.  There was a wrestler, he weighed about 130 pounds, and we were  walking across campus. And I don   t know what prompted the story, but  20  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  I made the statement that I didn   t see how a 130-pounder could handle a  190-pounder, which was what I weighed, if the 190-pounder knew  anything at all about wrestling. He said,    Are you talking about  yourself?    And I said,    Well, yeah, I am,    and he said,    Bob,      pardon  this, but he said     You don   t need to say what he said. (Laughs)     I could make you kiss your own  pauses  in six seconds    (Laughter)  and I said,    Okay, you   re on.    And man, I tried my best to kiss it but I  couldn   t reach it. (Laughs) I think it would have broken my back if I had  (Laughs) but that was the extent of that.  Tell them the story about when you and Neill hitchhiked to Saint  John   s   hitchhiked all the way.  Yeah, we had a job at Saint John   s   paid us  300 a month and we  hitchhiked up there, and boy that   s a long ways.  To Wisconsin, yes.  Yeah.  They took their suitcases, and Neill tried to teach you how to     Oh, high hurdle. Neill was, in addition to being an excellent runner, he  was a hurdler. We would stack suitcases one on top of the other to make  it about as high as a hurdle, and Neill was trying to teach me how to  hurdle between cars, you know, (Laughs) and it didn   t work, but he tried  anyway.  And about the fella that picked you up   one of the rides. That   s what I  wanted you to tell. The man who had seen the Cotton Bowl.  Well he said,    You know I went down there to see this guy Fenimore  play       Of course he didn   t know I was sitting right beside him         but  he   s not much of a football player.    He said,    That Spavital was a  football player,    and I was elbowing Neill all the time. I said,    Tell him.  Tell him. Tell him.    I mean I   d heard all that I wanted to hear.  (Laughter)  That   s cute.  Finally he introduced me. I thought he was gonna wreck   in fact, we  were coming up to a    Y    and he said,    Well, you know, this is Bob  Fenimore,    and we just went right straight on. He just straightened that  21  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  V. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  road out. (Laughs) Oh, that was funny.  Then he said,    I think I   d better stop and buy you boys a steak.     (Laughs)  Yeah. So he stopped and bought us dinner.  That   s a good story.  Speaking of dinner then   when you were traveling, where did the team  eat? Or did they take it with them?  No, no. We ate at the hotel where we would stay.  And then on campus, was there a particular cafeteria that was just for  the athletes?  No, we just ate at the regular cafeteria with everybody else.  No one watched your diet as closely as they seem to now?  Oh, no. You   d just eat anything you want. He ran it off of us if we ate  too much. (Laughs)  Do you remember any particular campus traditions? Did they do  anything special, like before the football games?  Gosh, it   s been so long ago.  I think they had pep rallies.  Where was graduation ceremony when you graduated?  At Gallagher-Iba.  Was it?  Where did you study when you had to study? Did you study in your dorm  rooms?  Yes.  Okay.  In Hanner.  22  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Finchum  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Did you   of course, Veta was down at OU, but did you go to any dances  without her?  No.  Yes.  I did?  Jo Anne Halley. Didn   t Jo Anne Halley go to a dance with you?  No.  My brother fixed him up with Pi Phi   s two or three times.  Yeah, she remembers all the dates I had. (Laughter)  Did you remember having any interactions with the President of the  university at the time?  Dr. Bennett. You were trying to get in the service.  I was trying to get a commission, and I thought he could help me so I  went to talk to him about it.  Well, you were 4-F and you tried to get in.  Yeah. I didn   t serve either, so. But when I was a freshman, I injured my  left leg and as a result of that I had a severe injury but it calcified. Now I  still carry it   I have on my left leg a calcium deposit which is about that  long and it   s just there   doesn   t bother me, but that was the reason that I  didn   t serve in the military.  You said you   re from Woodward, Oklahoma. Were you able to go back  to Woodward much during the time when you were in school between  classes?  Well, I   d go home to see Veta Jo. She was there for two years     Did you hitchhike to get back home or     Yes, that   s the way we traveled.  Really? That   s a long way out there to Woodward, Oklahoma.  Yeah. It takes you a long time, too. (Laughs)  23  Ahrberg  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  B. Fenimore  Finchum  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Wow.  You said your dad owned and operated a hardware store. Did your  mother work as well?  Occasionally she did, but not much. She stayed at home most of the  time.  Did your parents ever come out and visit you?  Yes, my dad went to most of the games, and of course Mother would go  with him, but I would see them about every week during the season for  that reason.  Would they have lived in Woodward during the Dust Bowl then?  Yes. Yes, they did.  Do you remember any stories they had to tell about that?  No, but I remember being out there one day   it was a weekend   and I  saw the dust coming from the west. Man it was rolling in. I never will  forget it, and boy, I   ll tell you, when it got over us, it was just like night,  you know. Of course, no sun, no nothing, and you just had to wait till it  was over, till it blew through.  About how long would that take?  Oh, several days.  You   d have trouble breathing then, wouldn   t you?  We were in grade school in   36 when they had the really black dust  storm, and we   d tied hankies around our mouth. Of course we all walked  to school   didn   t have buses, and dust in the house by the window sills.  It was   you can   t imagine. Tell them about the time your folks came  over to see you because you   d spent too much money. (Laughter) He  was getting  15 a month and books and tuition.  Fifteen dollars didn   t go very far when I was trying to go to Norman  about every weekend, so I would write checks on my parents     They told him that   s what he was to do, you know.  Ten dollar amounts, and apparently I wrote too many of them because  one Sunday, Mother and Dad showed up in my apartment here and I  24  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  wondered why they were coming over, but I found out quite shortly  afterwards. They wanted to know why I was writing so many checks.  You know, I just couldn   t answer it other than the fact that I needed the  money, and so then they made me stop. But my grandmother came to  my rescue and she would either send me money or I would write checks  on her for the rest of the time I was in school.  That was like  20 probably.  Yeah. It wasn   t much. (Laughs) Of course,  20 would go a long way  back then.  Well, you know, some things never change. I remember writing  5  checks to the Student Union, and my mother could not figure out why I  was always writing  5 checks to the Student Union. She   d say    What is  it at the Student Union that you   ve got to write  5 for?    (Laughter)  Back then,  5 went a long way. That would last me a week.  Absolutely.  You talked about the dances and stuff. Was there   you talked about  jitterbugs, but this was the era of the big bands and, you know, Glenn  Miller. Is there a particular music or a band that you liked? Did you  dance? Did you and Veta Jo dance when you would go out? Were there  bands in particular you liked?  Yes. I don   t know if they had bands as much as they just played records,  didn   t they? When I would go down to   of course I didn   t date anybody  here naturally, but I   d go down to Norman on the weekends   not every  weekend of course   but I had a friend who let me stay with him, and his  girlfriend was a real close friend   probably the closest friend Veta  has   and we   d all go out together, and that   s the way I   d spend my time  down there.  So did you all like to go to dances?  We did. We loved Glenn Miller.  Yeah.  Artie Shaw?  The music was great then.  Yeah.  25  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Yeah.  Actually, the fella he stayed with played the drums in a band that OU  had   played at dances down there.  Well if you went down to OU so much, did you have to go incognito  considering who you were?  No.  You were the    Blond Bomber    after all.  Well, not down there. (Laughter) They could have cared less.  Well, tell them about the Monday that you had off, when you came and  we walked over and you were watching OU practice.  They had a coach by the name of Snorter Luster, and I was down there  and Veta Jo and I, we decided   she said,    What do you want to do?     and I said,    Well, let   s go to practice. I   d like to watch OU practice.    So  we walked over to practice. I was standing over there watching them at  the sideline with the others, and all of a sudden here comes Snorter  Luster and he said,    Bob      he said something about        We   re gonna have to get you down here.        We   re gonna have to do one of two things. We   re gonna have to get  you down here or get that girl of yours up there,    and I said,    Well, I  don   t think either of those things are gonna happen, coach.    He said,     Well, okay. What I wanted to tell you was we   re not doing anything  now. You can watch this, but when we get to time to work on our plays  and all, I think you   d better leave.    So I told Veta Jo,    Shoot, let   s get  out of here.    So we took off. (Laughter)  Well did your wife get a lot of heckling for dating the    Blond Bomber     from Oklahoma A M?  Don   t know. Did you?  No. The girls at my sorority all liked him. (Laughter)  They were a good bunch of gals.  Great.  Well, when Bob would come over, he didn   t have any money, and I   d  26  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  eat at the house and the girls would say,    Isn   t Bob here?    and I   d say,     Yes, and I   ll see him after dinner.    (Laughs) We didn   t have money.  We   d go to a movie and didn   t either one of us spend very much money.  No, didn   t have it to spend.  That   s right.  Well, you   ve lived in Stillwater a long time so you   ve seen a lot of  changes, both on-campus and town. What would you say you   ve seen the  biggest change? It   s grown quite a bit.  Yes, it has.  Is there something in particular you miss when you all first moved here  that   s no longer here?  Something you miss?  Katz?  The traffic is terrible. (Laughter) I believe the students have two cars  each. (Laughs)  Where did you go to the grocery store when you lived back here in the     50s?  We moved here in    54.  Okay. So what grocery store did you go to?  IGA.  IGA   been here that long?  Was Bill Self   wasn   t he     Bill Self had the store up on the campus when Bob was in school. He  went there, at the corner of where Chris    University Spirit is.  Yes, it was here when we were in school.  But I went to IGA on Washington Street. Kenny Fleming had it...  Okay.     and I   ve gone to IGA ever since.  27  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  V. Fenimore  B. Fenimore  V. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  B. Fenimore  Ahrberg  And wasn   t there a little Dairy Queen?  Bob mentioned that the other night. We went out Main, and Dairy  Queen was on   where the realtor     The Century 21        office is.     right? That was the Dairy Queen there. So you probably didn   t eat out  a whole lot back then, did you? Well, have you gone to all the games or  attended many games?  We   ve had season tickets ever since. Before we even moved here, we  came from Oklahoma City for the games, and we had season tickets to  the basketball. We still have four   we   ve got four club seats, and we  have four for the football and three for the basketball.  We don   t go to the basketball though.  We didn   t go this year. We gave them to the kids. You know Beth  moved back, and David is 16 and   oh boy, he   s a good OSU fan now.  Well it   s been a real pleasure interviewing you Mr. Fenimore.  Well thank you, Janet.  What an honor to sit here and talk with you and hear these stories.  You   ve done so much for Oklahoma A M and OSU with your  contributions and your athleticism and your patriotism, so I appreciate  it very much and     Well, thank you.     thank you again for having us in your home.  You   re welcome.  And to Veta Jo, thank you.  -------  -------
