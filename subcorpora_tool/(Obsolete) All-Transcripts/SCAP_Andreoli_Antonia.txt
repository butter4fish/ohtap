SCHNEIDER:	So my name is Hannah Schneider and I'm here with Antonia Andreoli for the Alumnae Oral History Project.  So where are you from?

ANDREOLI:	Western Massachusetts.  A little town outside Springfield called Agawam that was a farm town when I was growing up and now it's a bedroom community for Springfield and Hartford.

SCHNEIDER:	And how did you come to Smith College?

ANDREOLI:	I heard about a bus tour going from my college — my high school.  And my guidance director told me that there was no way I was going to get in, but it was scheduled on a day I had a French exam that I wasn't ready for so I signed up for it.  And I came up here and was absolutely seduced by the library and the living situation that wasn't dorms which at that point I already knew I was kind of afraid of the faceless dorm thing.  So I applied and I got in.  And then I had no choice.  I had to come here because my dad died a month before the acceptance letter came and so there was no money.  I got into UMass [University of Massachusetts] and I got into Smith, and with the full boat Smith gave me, Smith was cheaper than commuting to UMass with a car.  So I had to come to Smith.
And I found a note in the twentieth reunion book in our class archive room today, and I found the note I wrote that basically 30 years ago said my Smith education gave me the life I have.  Because if I hadn't gotten that scholarship, I wouldn't have gone to college, or at least not then.  So it was literally life changing.

SCHNEIDER:	What did it mean to you, if anything, that Smith was a women’s college?

ANDREOLI:	I liked that.  I was — I thought I was a really good student.  I didn't realize how much I had to learn about being a student until I got here, but being a smart girl in a high school in a town which expected girls to get married, have babies — big immigrant population in town, three Catholic churches, ours had five masses on Sunday, and the girls who were taking commercial classes were allowed to graduate in May, not June, so they could get a head start on their typing jobs in the insurance industry in Hartford and Springfield, because we all knew they were getting married pretty soon.  A lot of them were engaged by senior year.  So being a smart girl in a school like that it was really hard to speak up.  Although I was never shy and I did speak up, I always felt very marginalized.
I had two very close friends.  One was a guy who went to Dartmouth eventually and one was a young lady who was very pregnant on graduation day and I have no idea what happened to her.  But we were both kind of — they were both like I was, kind of outliers.  So, to be not one of a handful of smart broads, but one of hundreds was academically very, very satisfying.

SCHNEIDER:	And what did you study here?

ANDREOLI:	I wanted to be a philosophy major because until I was 16, I thought I was going to a little convent, and philosophy and religion were very central to me.  But Mr. Weinstein was my registrar and he said — he was trying to fill his government classes and he said, “At first government class, political science, is all theory, it's really philosophy, you should take that.”  So I did.  It was kind of a mistake, but I also took a lot of music classes, and I briefly was a music major and then fell in love with some history classes, and was a history major with a lot of music and English electives.

SCHNEIDER:	Did you have a favorite Smith tradition while you here like Rally Day?

ANDREOLI:	Friday tea.

SCHNEIDER:	Friday tea, what was that like?

ANDREOLI:	Our house mother was a very elegant widowed lady, like so many of them were, and she served tea in her parlor every Friday.  And beautiful china.  And I had grown up working class household, dad drove a truck until the last few years of his life and my mother worked in shops or in factories, and I’d never been to tea.  And the combination of camaraderie, of kicking off the weekend, and this glimpse at a very different world was part of my freshman education.

SCHNEIDER:	What house did you live in?

ANDREOLI:	Parsons.

SCHNEIDER:	Do you remember any of the rules or sort of codes that you had to follow when you were here?  I know you guys had blue cards that you had to fill out.

ANDREOLI:	For the weekends.  Well, the rule that had the most impact on me was the financial aid system.  And I talked to some of the young women who worked in food services this morning, and that's still there.  If you're a scholarship kid, your freshman job is in food service.  Now, I was part of — almost half the population here were public school kids.  I don’t know how many of the population here were scholarship kids, but Parsons House had about 60 people plus the annex, and the couple of us who were scholarship freshmen worked in our kitchen.  Because back then every house had its own kitchen and its own dining room.  Dining room had round tables so those women, three meals a day they sat around those tables and for many of — for most of my housemates and classmates I was invisibly waiting on them in an apron.  That class distinction really hit me.
My sophomore, junior, and senior year, I had great jobs in the music library or in the reading room downstairs.  I don’t know if it still works, but where things are on reserve.  And I loved my library jobs because I was a history geek, but that freshman year it really hit home that I was at a college dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant elitists primarily from the East Coast, and I felt very invisible.  And while the education here was wonderful my freshman roommate and I had nothing in common.  I made friends with another woman and she and I roomed together for the next two years.  She can't come, but I'm going to be visiting her.  She lives about an hour away from me with, you know, reports.  And she and I were good friends.  She is from, not a scholarship kid, but from a small town in rural upstate New York.  We had more in common than some of the girls who lived across the river from Agawam in Springfield but who’d gone to private school.
And that friendship lasted, but quite frankly, if I had not met my future husband on spring break when we went home — he was at UMass — we started to date and we got serious that summer — if I hadn't met him I don’t know if I would have stayed here because except for Molly I was very lonely.  And the other great drama of freshman year was I was told that I had to maintain a 3.0 or I would lose my scholarship.  Well, I didn't maintain a 3.0 freshman year, thank you, Mr. Weinstein, it was the wrong class, but I got my transcript and my mother that summer was still a year plus away from losing dad, she wasn't really someone you could bring problems to.  And I got the transcript and I said, Oh my God.  So I obsessed about it for a while, then I called the registrar’s office.  And I said, “I've got my grades.  Can you tell me if I should come back?”  And she said, “What do you mean?”  I said, “I didn't have a 3.0.”  She said, “Oh, they've changed that policy.”  It would have been nice if they had told us they were changing the policy.  A little agita that summer.
But so I came back and had problem with the 3.0 and my history major in English and music and so on.  And so I came back.  My husband and I — my boyfriend and I — he was able to get a car on campus at UMass and so I filled out the blue card with my mom’s address and I went home every weekend because I didn't have a curfew there.  And I’d gotten in big trouble freshman year when I didn't come back in time for curfew one night.  Mrs. Rumpf, our house mother, was in the front hall in her bathrobe with the house officers.  They had just called the cops and were ready to call Cooley Dick to see if I was in the ER.  And I was ten minutes late.

SCHNEIDER:	So your house mother had who with her?

ANDREOLI:	The house officers.

SCHNEIDER:	And who were the house officers?

ANDREOLI:	Girls we’d elected to be president and vice president and social secretary and they planned the parties.  But the old joke about Smithies is if two of them meet in a foreign land far from home, within half an hour one of them is recording secretary and one of them is social secretary.  But I was out on a Friday night and I didn't get back before curfew because I was — I misjudged how far from campus I was and the guy I was with was not — didn't drive and didn't care.  And so I ran through the door breathless ten minutes late and because I was the only one who hadn't signed in at the end of the night the girl who ran the sign-in desk, and that was a volunteer job, had gone up and knocked on Mrs. Rumpf’s door and said, “Antonia’s not back” and that triggered the whole chain of what she was supposed to do.
So being able to go home for the weekend — it was a half hour drive and we threw our laundry in the car and it meant not having to go to the laundromat.  So I loved the academics, I loved the music, but — and I had a good friend in Molly, but there were so many blatant examples of the difference.  And the number of women of color was incredibly small.  There was one woman, Helen, she’s a member of our class, I saw her, she’s back.  And there was another woman from Sri Lanka, but I don’t remember any other Asian women other than those two and you probably could have counted the number of black women on the Smith campus on your hands and feet.
It was literally — it was very, very obvious this was a white school.  And I don’t know if this is true or not, but I was told when I first started doing candidate’s work in the ’70s that one of the reasons — up until they stopped asking for it, I don’t know when they stopped — admissions asked for a photo to be clipped to your application so that they could make sure that Jane Brown from Little Rock was a white Jane Brown, not a woman of color.

SCHNEIDER:	Do you remember a lot of racial tension on campus then?

ANDREOLI:	I remember the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter on campus was very active and I remember signing up and going with them to a project in Hartford called the North End Community Action Project.  They called it NECAP and we were registering voters along with students from Trinity.  And they paired each of us white girls with a Trinity student who was a man of color because the doors in the north end would not get opened to a white woman.  The assumption would be she was from social services or something.  You know, checking to see if there was a man’s razor in your bathroom, that kind of thing.  Because you couldn't have a man living with you if you were getting social support.
So we went around knocking on doors.  My job was to carry the stack of voter registration stuff while Ray knocked on doors and introduced us.  And sometimes people took the material and sometimes they didn't, but that was very, very active.  And I remember when George Wallace, before he was shot he was campaigning and he was on campus at John M. Greene.  And many of us from the valley colleges were marching around John M. Greene.  I remember singing “We Shall Overcome” and other songs and I heard from people who were inside that they could hear us right through those stone walls.
And one of those little six degrees of separation moments, there was a guy that when I would go over to UMass to study with Lou, there was a guy at the student center who used to play the piano in the corner.  Really good, noodling around.  Big black guy.  I'm marching around John M. Greene and all of a sudden there was the most spectacular voice on my right and I look up and he’s taller than I am so we don’t — and I'm on the inside so it doesn't take long for us to be separated — it was Taj Mahal, who was at UMass at the time.  But he wasn't famous, he was just a UMass guy who was a musician.  But I remember wondering whether or not George Wallace had any idea how many of us were outside.  So this was — have you heard of Emmett Till?
I was ten when he was killed and I remember my mother and father, the only Sunday paper they got was the New York Daily News and there was a horrible headshot of him in his open casket that his mother insisted that his casket be open.  As she said in a documentary, she said, “I want the world to see what they did to my boy.”  So it's an awful picture of this poor boy’s head.  And my mother tried to hide the paper, but I had remembered that very clearly.  So that was 1955.  And in 1963 to ’67 that whole civil rights thing was still very, very active.  One of the women I knew, we weren't close friends but I knew her from campus, she went to Florida on a demonstration and wound up spending time in jail with Massachusetts Governor Peabody’s mother.
So it was very much an undercurrent and a poster-sign “Do this” public thing in our lives.  And the lack of diversity on campus didn't occur to me.  Then in 1970 I started grad school at Dartmouth and Dartmouth had a program called ABC, A Better Chance, in which they brought minority students to campus for the summer to give them a head start for college.  And so I saw a lot of African-American students on the Dartmouth campus that summer and it made me start thinking about what's Smith doing about diversity?  And I came into Neilson and I said, “How do I get here?”  The young woman who showed me how to get here was wearing a head scarf, she’s clearly not a white Anglo-Saxon Republican WASP from New England.  And the number of women of color on campus is very inspiring to me, but I also want to remember that diversity includes socioeconomic diversity as well.
And when I did candidate’s work recruiting in white bread southwestern New Hampshire one of the students I recruited who came here, and she never came home again, I'm not surprised — never came back to school to visit us which a lot of kids do.  She never did.  I shouldn't say never came home.  She may have gone to see her family, but she grew up in a converted Airstream in the woods.  Her father hunted for most of the meat.  Heated with wood.  Learned how to butcher rabbits when most kids are learning how to play Old Maid and first person in her family to go to college.  One my smartest students.  This was early ‘70s and I remember writing her a letter of recommendation for Smith and saying that what won’t show on her numbers, on her test scores, and in her own letter because she doesn't realize how unusual she is, is how much with both hands she has grabbed every opportunity she had to learn and she’s got incredible potential, but she has so many rough edges.
And I remember at one of the candidates’ workshops that the admissions office used to run for us alums who were called alumnae admission coordinators, a man from the financial office came, the treasurer’s office came, and said, “Remember that every time you raise a scholarship student for us” — and he used the term they would raise money — he said, “You've raised the cost of that kid’s tuition for the college because I can't put my hands on that money.  It's earmarked for scholarships.  So you can help the college, if you can't write a four-figure check you can recruit a scholarship kid because that will open the tap for the financial aid money to flow into the operating budget.”
So even though most of my life I taught high school history and I never wrote a four-figure check to Smith, I recruited an awful lot of scholarship kids.  But I think it's important to remember that there are visible — there's visible diversity, like the young woman at the desk at Neilson, and there's invisible diversity, especially — you know, America’s poor at first glimpse, they're wearing jeans, they're wearing sneakers, they're wearing T-shirts, until you look close and find out that the brand name is different or that the sneakers are really old or whatever you might not know that those two girls sitting side by side, one of them, her mom’s a CEO of a tech company and her father’s a lawyer or lobbyist and the other one is the daughter of a truck driver and a factory worker.  And their lives are very, very different.  And because of the affluence of the girls who came from a different background even what they do on the weekends is different.  So socially there was a divergence.
My mom gave me some spending money every month.  It was everything from pens to paper to the occasional cup of coffee on Green Street.  And on Friday nights if people wanted to go to Friendly’s because they didn't like the clean the refrigerator meal at their house I could maybe get a Coke and a tuna fish sandwich.  Well, my entire month’s spending money was not the equivalent of my share of a weekend car rental to Dartmouth, back when you could rent a car if you were under 25, you could do that.  Well, one of the very nice young women in our house, I liked her a lot and she didn't come back for reunion, and she came from a very, very established old southern family, great privilege, but like so many women for whom — who were raised right who came from that, she treated everybody the same.  She really was a sister, but she really had blinders on when it came to money.  And one weekend it was like, “A bunch of us are getting a car to go to Dartmouth, you want to come?” Well, my friend Elliot was at Dartmouth.  My share would have been my mother’s spending money.
So there were things that happened socially that bonded girls together that I couldn't participate in.  Thank God for Smith choir.  I did Omega freshman, I did the college choir, then I did two years of glee club and I was able to travel and share experiences with a lot of women — I've met some of them here — the only thing we shared was music, but that was something we shared and it gave me the confidence to go out and join the choir I’m in now, the chorale.  So the diversity that we see that is visible, that isn't necessarily all the diversity that's there.
And when I found out that — I asked this morning.  When I found out that freshman scholarship students on federally backed scholarships are still expected to do food service, and it's not quite the same as waiting on the table in the first floor of your house on the girl who lives next door to you, literally waiting on her.  And I didn't have any problem with the kitchen work.  I mean I grew up doing kitchen work, I had a catering business, I loved it, and I still have some of our cook’s recipes, but the work wasn't what bothered me.  What bothered me was you were stigmatized as a scholarship kid in that apron waiting on people who were your peers.  And if you're going to wait on them, they aren't your peers.  And that's something I really wanted to get on the record and I'm disappointed that it's still the rule.

SCHNEIDER:	So it seems like Smith students were pretty politically involved.

ANDREOLI:	Oh, yes, right.

SCHNEIDER:	So you mentioned civil rights protests and your concerns about class.  Were there any — I know there were some Vietnam protests?

ANDREOLI:	Oh, a great many of us wore black armbands to graduation.

SCHNEIDER:	Yes, please, tell me a little bit more about that.

ANDREOLI:	And I am embarrassed to say I read his speech this morning and I am blanking on his name.

SCHNEIDER:	Oh, it was Mr. Katzenbach.

ANDREOLI:	Yes.  And Nicholas Katzenbach was talking, a rather long speech, but he represented the Johnson administration and the draft was in place.  My fiancé was prime for that.  And we were very involved in signing letters and so on, but we couldn't sit quietly and listen to him and applaud so some of us wore black armbands and some stood and turned their back on him when he was speaking.  I heard that afterwards.  I was towards the front and I didn't see it, but I understand that that happened.  So that is secondhand.  It may or may not have happened.  The black armbands did.  And the ’67 was, it was before Tet [the Tet Offensive], it was before the whole country began to shift on this, but the fear that we were going to get deeper and deeper into this was — certainly it was in our popular music and it was in our lives for those of us who had significant others who were going to be draftable.
And it definitely played into — Lou decided and, as I wrote in the story for the reunion book, I was a good Italian daughter and I became a very good Italian-American wife and mother.  Lou decided that we were going to apply to the Peace Corps because the Peace Corps would buy you a two-year deferment.  So in the meantime, he had put his plans for law school on the back burner and done the student teaching program, as had I, here.  So we got into the Peace Corps.  We were part of what the government bragged about its 15% failure rate.  They had 85% good matches.  They took two certifiable teachers and put them in rural development.  And poor Lou was a city kid Italian and they had him debeaking chickens with a hot machete.  We left after seven weeks, came back home, got teaching jobs because of the teaching shortage and it turned out he loved it.
An awful lot of men chose teaching as an alternative to the draft and as soon as they did the lottery thing and they got a high number they finished their teaching year and left.  I know three guys like that.  Lou loved it.  He was so good at it.  At his memorial service we broke the fire law for the town hall because there were so many hundred people that came.  He was a great teacher, but the Vietnam War made him a teacher.  If it hadn't been for Vietnam his plan was law school and become a labor lawyer in Massachusetts.  So the Vietnam War put our lives on different tracks and politically it made us — we came from pretty conservative backgrounds and we were Democrats because we were blue collar working class, but we were socially very conservative.  We didn't live together before we got married.  We were very conservative.
But the liberal pressure on the government about the war, we got swept up, and the music and the culture changed a lot of us who might not — I was never a hippie which disappointed my high school students no end.  I never smoked marijuana in college.  It wasn't even around in my house as far as I knew, but the rumor was there were some girls in the quad.  But I mean I never participated in that aspect of what was called the counter culture, but I sympathized with it. And when the feminist movement was kind of reborn in the early ‘70s, thanks to Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, that felt like a piece with Vietnam and a piece with civil rights.  And so my political position became increasingly left of center as I recognized that it's all a human rights issue.

SCHNEIDER:	So unfortunately, we are running out of time.  So I'm just going to ask one last reflecting question, but just looking back at your time at Smith how do you feel about it now?  Maybe like just — sorry.  Looking back at your time at Smith, are you happy with what happened here and how it has affected your life, you would say?

ANDREOLI:	I would say that, as I said 30 years ago, Smith gave me the life I have.  What I remember best about Smith, other than the music and some of the classes were, you didn't watch the clock.  Some of the classes were inspiring discussions.  I loved the access and the libraries.  I spent so much time in the reading room in Neilson.  It used to be on the right-hand side as you walked in.  Great overstuffed wing chairs and good reading lights and I loved that I could just shelf-browse.  There were weeks I didn't read everything I was assigned, but I read four or five other books.  And I loved that sense that I had — and I didn't have that until I got here — that learning is just this incredible open door.  It's like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  You go back, you open that door, and you're in this mystical place where anything can happen and you can discover anything.
So while I felt boxed by some of the socioeconomic lack of diversity and assumptions about who I was, I felt liberated in my mind and my spirit by the academics and by the music.  And the life I built afterwards with my husband and in the last 15 years without him has been very much informed by intellectual curiosity and the need to feed both that intellectual side of the brain thing and to satisfy the music and the gardening and that side.  And what I learned here was that you could be a multi — sorry.  What I learned here was you could be multidimensional and define yourself.  My 14-year-old granddaughter, just turned 14, had to write a poem for a woman — about a person who was important to her.  And she wrote it about me and she mailed it to me and I had no clue that this young woman really knew who I am.  And the fourth line about it is, “A strong woman who made her own life.”  What more can you ask than to be that for another young woman?

SCHNEIDER:	On that note, that's a beautiful way to end this interview, I feel.

ANDREOLI:	To give her credit, that was Rose Elena Carrigan who wrote me that poem.

SCHNEIDER:	Beautiful.  Thank you so much for coming in and telling your story.  I really appreciate it.

ANDREOLI:	Thank you.
