KIT GRUELLE: In fact that is exactly what I’m going to do when I leave here.
I’m going to go find some purple glitter. I’m going to fairy dust everybody with purple
glitter this afternoon.

COCO WILDER: You could do the glitter bombing thing. You can go in and just
like ( ). [talking simultaneously]

KG: I could totally get credit for it. This was Coco’s idea. It was such a good
idea.

CW: Oh my gosh. We’re going to get you arrested. I heard that like you can’t
inng like the coat hangers anymore, or it’s something that like, you know how--?

KG: I’m not surpIised. I've got them drawn on my placards which I’m going to
wear today. But I’m not surpIised. I was going to get a ﬂoppy hat. But really what I think
we should do is rather than coat hangers, I think we should make little bitty sperm
because really that’s what it’s about. It’s about sperm worship and just have all these little
lost speImies trying to find their way into some woman’s uterus.

CW: [Laughter] I mean, wasn’t there a lady who put in like an amendment that
was like a woman has to be present if a guy is buying Viagra.

KG: Viagra. That was in Ohio.

CW: Yeah.

KG: And then I think instead of sending them, instead of sending them coat hangers we
should be sending them turbans because they’re turning into the American Taliban. So I mean
we need to have fun with it because if not, it’s going to give us all strokes. So we’ve got to figure
out ways to have fun with it.

CW: That’s yeah, that’s important because otherwise it’s like just what do you do. If you
go insane, it’s like I don’t know. It’s hard. But gosh, for this I guess ( ). Okay so, my name is
Coco Wilder and I’m here with Kit Gruelle who is an activist in the Violence against women
movement and documentary ﬁlm maker. It is July 8th, 2013 and we’re in Chapel Hill. So I just
want to thank you for taking time out of your day to come talk with me.

KG: Happy to.

CW: And I guess to get started, I was wondering if you could just tell me a little bit
about your childhood.

KG: About my childhood. Let’s see. I was born in Miami, Florida, given up for
adoption, raised in a pretty much upper class family. My grandfather from my adopted family
created Raggedy Ann and Andy. So there was a fair amount of financial stability that came with
that. But there wasn’t a lot of internal stability. And there were some real bad experiences that I
had with my adoptive mother who really wasn’t at all interested in being a parent and told me
later on that she had never wanted to be a mom. And as a consequence of the dynamics in our
home and also it was Miami and it was the [19]6OS and there was a lot of anti-war stuff going on
and I got very caught up in that, and very quickly became the daughter that they did not want.
They wanted me to be quiet and compliant and obedient and passive, and I was none of those

things.

So when I was sixteen, Ruth primarily, but my dad too started inviting me to leave home.
So I finally did when I was seventeen and lived in a commune in Miami for a while and then left
--because I’m just not a city person-- left and went to the North Carolina mountains where we’d
always spent our summers. And I had dropped out of high school and had gotten involved in
drug related activities, mostly because it was political but also because taking drugs makes pain
go away. It’s just that simple. And so I came up to the mountains and fell in with a crowd up
there and was taking drugs with them. It was a different reason there. I mean for the mountain
folks it was really about getting high. I did that for a couple of years but realized that it was a
dead end street and that wasn’t what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. So I stopped doing
drugs and then I got married and got pregnant quickly and had my first son. But his dad wanted
to keep on partying and I finally said to him, I said, “You’ve got to choose. You’re either going
to sober up and be a parent or you need to go.” So he left.

And then I met my second husband Jack who was the husband that was so Violent, and
we were together three years, three months and twenty days. We had a little boy to gether, and it
was, then he wound up being killed in an accident. But that marriage is why I do what I do for a
living because he was just extraordinarily Violent, extraordinarily controlling, and I think until
people have lived with that kind of Violence, they just couldn’t even conjure it up.

And so after Jack died and I moved down here, I got involved in the battered women’s
movement. And that’s kind of, it was one of the key moments of my life was seeing the ad to
become an advocate and going through that training. All the missing puzzle pieces just came
together. So it’s a long answer to what my childhood was like.

But and there were parts of it that were wonderful. I had a very close relationship with

my aunt, Alberta Murphy, who was a lesbian, decorated war hero, a concert cellist, a nationally

recogmzed social worker, an activist, a brilliant, kind, loving wonderful person who at an early
age started to slip me the New Y orker and say, “Here darling read this and call me and let’s talk
about it.” It was like this covert thing because my adoptive parents weren’t at all interested in
cultivating whatever I had in my brain. But Alberta seemed to think was something up there.
And she just wanted, she wanted to kind of dig around in there and see what came out. It’s so
interesting that the New Y orker really became a touchstone for us. And it thrilled us both, and it
continues to thrill me to this day. And it also is more than a literary magazine. It really is
symbolic of my relationship that I had with her. So I have to put that in about Alberta and
because one of the things that I found in working with battered women is when you’re living
with Violence all the time, you don’t have the luxury of thought because you’re having to try to
predeterrnine what the abuser’s needs are going to be, what his mood is going to be, if you’ve got
everything right, is the food prepared correctly, what kind of mood is he going to come home in,
and we lose so much intellectual fire power from women because they’re afraid all the time. So
it’s one of the things about doing domestic Violence work that I pull from my own childhood and
my own adult experience.

CW: How old were you when you started doing like these exchanges with Alberta and
her magazine? Like what did you talk about? What kind of articles did you read?

KG: Oh she would just, if I'd go see her, she was running protective services of Miami.
She knew that things weren’t good at home and she’d call me baby girl or darling. So those
terms of endearment were really important. And it wasn’t anything specifically in the magazine.
She’d just say, “Read this and see what you like and call me and let’s talk about it.” So it was the
idea that she believed that I had the capacity to think and that she was interested in what I

thought that was such a gift, and it’s one of the things for me that’s such a joy over the years

working with battered women is to look at them and say, “Tell me what you think.” And to
realize that they have, that that’s been removed from their lives, maybe because of this
relationship that they’re currently in or maybe they’ve never had anyone care about how they
think about things. So to me it’s one of the wonderful things that we as advocates can do is give
battered women time and space and interest and a curiosity of how they have thought about and
processed their lives.

CW: Yeah. Can you tell me more [about] what were you doing before you became
involved with the women, with the movement and then how old were you, you were talking
about these two marriages and then finding the classified ad? Can you take me through that
period?

KG: Sure. Let’s see. I moved to the North Carolina mountains on my own when I was
seventeen and then spent a few years just really kind of self—destructing or trying to self destruct
and then it just dawned on me that that was not the way to go. And so I got married when I was
twenty and had Matt three weeks after my twenty-first birthday, and his dad was gone within a
matter of months because like I said he wanted to keep on partying.

And then it wasn’t long after that that I met Jack, and he was like all abusers, incredibly
charismatic and swept me off my feet. And it was just incredibly intense the things that
happened, just awful, awful, awful. And then all of a sudden he was dead, and three weeks
before he died I tried to commit suicide. I took an overdose of pills. I knew that it was going to
take either me or him dying for the relationship to end because he had been in the United States
Marine Corps, and he would routinely pick me up by the throat and tell me that there was no
place that I could go to get away from him. He was trained by the United States Marine Corps to

hunt people down and kill them. And I should just forget about ever trying to leave.

And so I think what people fail to recognize is that battered women to a degree are
hostages. They might not be hostages in the classic sense like with a gun permanently held to
their heads, but bit by bit the abusers hem them in through words, deeds, actions, and then the
physical Violence is kind of the punctuation mark. It’s, “okay I expect you to do X, Y and Z and
if you don’t do X, Y and Z, this is how you’re going to pay for it.” And I just learned it well from
being with him and living up on the side of a mountain, and I wouldn’t wish that life on
anybody.

But the other part about it that we address in the film is it muddies the water when the
person who is committing these horrendous acts of control, abuse, Violence, intimidation is
someone that at some point in time you fell in love with. It just makes it really hard because
fundamental relationship dynamics are, you fall in love with a person, and there’s a period of
time when everything is wonderful and then as time goes by the person you’re in love with might
have a bad day or you might have a bad day. But it’s just kind of leveled out somehow, and
that’s the dynamic that is maintained. But with an abusive relationship it starts out intensely
wonderful and then after a period of time goes by, then the Violence starts or the control starts.
Women have a hard time reading it and understanding exactly what’s going on. And then there’s
an assault, and then the way the relationship changes is it goes from being one where it’s good
all the time with an occasional bad act to constant bad acts with an occasional good day. And
women learn to get to the place where they are craving that one good day out of every siX
months or whatever. And that’s how we lose women, when they have to reconfigure their lives to
think that their relationship should mean that for three hours once a month he’s nice. Then the

rest of the time he’s Violent and abusive.

And I've studied this by sitting cross-legged on the ﬂoor and listening to battered women
all these years and sitting with them in emergency departments and sitting with them in
courtrooms and talking to judges and talking to cops and talking to prosecutors. It’s just this
hidden world that no one’s aware of until they’re in it somehow. And I don’t know. We’re just
losing so much great stuff to domestic Violence. And that term even is wrong. It’s so cleaned up.
So I don’t really want to call it domestic Violence anymore. That just allows people to treat it as
if it’s just this little insignificant thing when it’s not. I’m sorry, long answer.

CW: I was going to ask, but I am interested in you saying the term domestic Violence
cleans it up. The range of terms like battered women, domestic Violence, intimate partner
Violence", how what do you think the impact of that terminology is and what language do you
think should be used to describe this?

KG: Well, I think the term allows people to conjure up this notion that it’s nothing
particularly bad or that what we have happening in this country doesn’t compare with what
happens to women in the Middle East. And on a lot of levels that’s right. What happens to
women in the Middle East is hideous. But for example several years ago in North Carolina a man
nail gunned his wife to the ﬂoor and then cut her throat. He then killed himself. She then pulled
her feet loose and ran. Also in North Carolina several years ago a man held his girlfriend down
and carved the word mine in her stomach. I mean these are acts of terrorism.

And it’s furmy, I was listening a few weeks back, on Sunday afternoon I was listening to
public radio. And they were doing a piece on Byron De La Beckwith and Medger Evers murder,
and they were referring to Byron De La Beckwith as a white supremacist. And on the ride home
I thought, “Wow, I wonder how it would change the discussion if we referred to batterers as

male supremacists and just start saying this because it’s what they are.” They have a strong sense

Gruelle ll

of entitlement just like white folks did in relation to black folks. They have a sense of
superiority, which white folks did in relation to black folks. They think that things are supposed
to go their way all the time, which is the same way it was for white folks in relation to black
folks. They expect women to be compliant, which is the same way that it was with white folks in
relation to black folks.

And so that night I posted a thing on the Private Violence Facebook page and said, “You
know, what if we started referring to these guys as male supremacists?” And it’s just lit things up
because when you kind of deconstruct the behavior, it’s the exact same thing, but we just cannot
allow ourselves to really think about it because there are, it’s just so engrained in us that women
are inferior and that women are supposed to be controlled.

I know when I interviewed Gloria Steinem for the film she was talking about the
historical stuff around the anti-slavery work and she was talking about how they were fine with
having this underground railroad to free slaves. But then when people who were concerned with
husbands beating up their wives said, “We’ve got to get this woman out of here,” Gloria said that
everyone said, “Oh no, no, no we can’t do that. That’s just taking it too far.” And so it’s kind of
amazing for me that this is 2013 and we’re fighting these battles over sexual Violence against
women, physical Violence against women, women’s reproductive rights. I mean women are still
by a sigmﬁcant portion of the population regarded as inferior to men, and I just wonder
linguistically what do we have to do to address this. What’s it going to take? How many dead
women do we have to pile up before we realize that we’ve got blinders up or we’ve got our
fingers in our ears and we’re saying la-la-la or both? I guess after all these years working with
battered women and seeing the challenges they face that are, the initial source is the abuser. But

then the state and the various agencies and institutions that she has to interact with to try to get

help, it’s like they drive the getaway car. The abuser commits the act, and then the state allows
him to get away with it. So I really don’t know what it’s going to take. I hope the film is going to
make people stop and think and say, “I wonder what goes on in my community. I wonder how
battered women are treated in my court. I wonder how the prosecutors handle these cases. I
wonder if law enforcement treat these crimes seriously. I wonder if DSS [Department of Social
Services] is punitive towards the woman rather than towards the abuser.”

CW: How have you seen the criminal justice system like changing, in like how it treats
these crimes? What do you think their role should be?

KG: Well, one of the problems is thinking that the response should solely be a criminal
justice response. I mean it is a crime. It absolutely is a crime. But because it happens in the
context of a relationship many, many, many battered women don’t want their abuser to go to jail.
They just want him to stop. They want him to go back to being the way he was when they first
got together. And I think one of the problems that we’ve sort of created is thinking that the
criminal justice system is going to be able to manage him socially to get him to go back to being
the way he was initially. If he doesn’t want, if that was an act and probably eight times out of ten
that was an act, it was the grooming process. So he doesn’t want to go back to being that nice
guy again. He wants control. He wants to be the dominant person in the relationship. So thinking
that dangling a jail sentence over him is going to be the remedy, it’s not. It has to come
internally.

So I think that our criminal justice system overall has at least started to recogmze that
crimes against women are in fact crimes. I remember years and years and years ago working
with a woman who was being beaten up in the K-Mart parking lot over in Durham. And

somebody called the cops and she was under a car, and the cop showed up, and they dragged her

Gruelle 13

out from under the car and screamed at her and said, “Aren’t you embarrassed to do this in
public? Take this home.” So it was hands off. I worked very closely with law enforcement in
Chatham County, and I’m happy to say that I think the Chatham County folks really do a great
job. But to be fair to law enforcement this is a frustrating crime to have to deal with because of
this emotional link, this bond that the two have.

I think for me the thing that makes me the most aggravated is we’re still stuck in this rut
of saying, “Why doesn’t she just leave?” And that, number one, is a Victim blaming question.
Number two, it’s the wrong question to ask. Number three, it’s taking the focus of the attention
off of him, the offender, and putting it on her. And number four, we don’t do this with any other
kind of crime. I mean when women are beaten up or sexually assaulted, we blame them, just
period. But one of the things I've started saying when I go do community ed stuff is, “think about
the last time a bank got robbed in your community. And law enforcement showed up to
investigate the robbery, and they got the evidence and the interviewed people, and then when
they were done with the investigation, they probably didn’t go to the bank president and say why
did you keep all that money here. Didn’t know you were going to get robbed? Do you like
getting robbed? We’ve been out here four or ﬁve times already. Why do you still have your
doors open? I can’t believe, you must like this. Do you like to expose your staff to somebody
showing up with a gun?” But we don’t do that. We just don’t.

But for some reason we just reﬂexively blame women for the Violent acts of men, and
that just, it’s so juvenile. And it’s so sexist, and it’s so wrong because when we do that we’re
basically giving him a green light and saying, “Carry on. Keep on going on with your Violent and
controlling behavior.” We’re just going to dump all the responsibility on her. We require her and

the children to leave their homes, leave their schools, leave their jobs, leave their family, leave

their pets, leave their friends and go hide out in a shelter. And even that doesn’t guarantee her
safety. So we expect battered women and children to reconfigure their lives completely around
his Violence and rarely sanction him with any kind of comprehensive sanctions. So that’s the
area. So we’ve addressed the law enforcement piece, but I think now it’s time to address the
larger sort of social response to gender based Violence and start to ask a whole new set of
questions.

CW: I want to get back to that--but what was your initial work in this movement look
like? You said you found an ad to be an advocate. How did you start and like how did you get to
be where you are right now with the social movement documentary piece?

KG: There was an old paper called the Spectator that was published here a long, long
time ago, and I just saw an ad in the back of the paper to do advocacy work for battered women.
At the time I had barely even self-identified because in the mountains nobody talked about it
because almost everybody was in an abusive relationship. So it was what it was. But then when I
came down here, I just got around people that had a bigger way of thinking about things. And I
saw this ad and the women’s center that was here down the road on Rosemary Street, Darlene
Wells was the director, and I went to go talk to her and she said she thought it would be a good
idea to do that. And so I signed up and went to the training, and it was just earth shattering for
me. On the first day we spent the day looking at the Power and Control wheel, which divides
domestic Violence up into the non-physical and non-sexual forms of abuse like coercion,
intimidation, using the children, ﬁnances all that sort of stuff. And I not only saw my relationship
with Jack just spread out there in black and white, but I also was able to understand that dynamic
in the home where I grew up. And it was just astonishing. So the ﬁrst thing I started doing was

being an on-call crisis line advocate, and then I started going to court up in Hillsborough and just

seeing how the little manipulative tactics by attorneys sort of play out in domestic Violence cases
and understanding the vulnerabilities and then also seeing how poorly our laws reﬂect the
seriousness of this crime. Seeing how badly women could be beaten, how much they could be
stalked repeatedly and the offender arrested but given a hundred dollar bond and he’d be back
out on the street just like that. So it just, the more I sort of got into it, the more politicized I
became. And the more I realized that there was so much more to it than just the relationship
between a woman and her abuser, that it was the woman, her abuser, and society. And it was
just, doing this work and the Orange-Durham Coalition back in the mid-eighties, it was intense
work, a lot of stuff going on, and then I remembered, I had started going to therapy, and I was
remembering who had helped me when Jack was alive and who hadn’t helped me. And one of
the people who had helped me was a patrol officer and one of the people who did not help me
was my ob-gyn who I went to see when Jack punched me in the face one time because I thought
my jaw was broken.

So I went to the folks at the Orange-Durham Coalition and said, “You know we need to
be talking to other people that are interacting with battered women,” and they were all slammed
so they said, “Great, go do it.” And I met up with a group of medical students who were
interested in doing a proj ect to respond in the emergency department to battered women. So we
wrote up a twelve-hour curriculum, and we did it over at Duke and UNC and it was strictly
voluntary. Medical students could come if they wanted to and not come if they wanted to. Well,
a lot of them showed up, and then they carried a pager. And when a woman would show up in
the emergency department and the treating physician or nurse suspected there was domestic
Violence, the medical students would be called in. And it just, things just started to come together

in all these, it’s just like I saw this bigger universe and realized that there were a lot more people

that should be ﬂuent to some degree in Violence against women issues than just as us advocates
because law enforcement were seeing them; paramedics were seeing them; doctors were seeing
them; clergy was seeing them; librarians were seeing them. And so I just started kind of trying to
get out in the community as much as I could, and I just worked with a ton of groups and schools
and agencies in the Triangle area to get them to understand the role that they played, not that it
was their job to fiX it because nobody can fiX it. Nobody can. But if there’s a more consistent
message from more people in community, then she’s not going to feel quite so isolated in this
relationship, and he’s going to get the message from other people besides us and courts that his
Violence towards her is not acceptable.

So and then twelve and a half years ago my son, my middle son Jason had been
paralyzed, and I was out of work spending time with him and looking after him, and when it got
to where I was able to go off for an hour or so, I went over to some friends’ house to pull weeds
in their garden because that’s therapeutic to me. I was like “I’m going to go pull weeds. I’m
going to go pull weeds.” It was just hard to see your kid permanently injured like that. And while
I was pulling weeds I don’t know it just popped into my head that most people don’t know what
domestic Violence is all about. They hear a story on the evening news about murder or murder-
suicide and they just make an assumption that this is what it’s about, those poor uneducated
women and they partner up with these guys, and the guys beat them up and they reconcile with
them and then they get killed. And that’s kind of summed it up. And so I just thought we need to
tell this story in a more comprehensive way. And I had been teaching in California and working
with a sort of training component, and the woman who did the training ﬁlms is a documentary
film maker, and so I called her and I said, “Inez, how would you feel about doing a film about

the battered women’s movement?” Are you, can you still pick--?

Gruelle 17

CW: Yeah. [break in recording] mow my lawn but not now.

KG: But and Inez when she was in graduate school and worked on the film The Eyes on
the Prize and or Eyes on the Prize and so when I called her and I said, “How would you feel
about this?” She said, “I think it sounds great. Let’s do it.” So when I got to where I could travel
again, I went to San Diego and Inez and I sat down and she said, “Write up the names of the
people that you think should be included in a film like this.” So I just wrote about probably thirty
names, people to do it from different sort of arenas, law enforcement, psychology, academia,
activism, survivors, --the whole nine yards--, and journalism. And we raised some money and
brought a bunch of people out to Mills College and did the initial set of interviews at Mills
College. And then we were kind of moving along for a while, and then the money ran out. And
trying to get interest in a film about domestic Violence I found was incredibly challenging
because most people just don’t want to talk about it or they think they’ve got their mind made
up, they already know what it’s about and never want to know anything else. They don’t want
their own belief system challenged. So I worked with Inez for a while longer, and then another
woman Katherine Salino came in and the money of course. People in the movement were excited
that the film was going to be done because they wanted the story to be told. The people outside
the movement were just, “I don’t want to talk about that. I don’t want to watch a movie about it.
I’m not going to give you any money. Go away.” But I was still doing direct services with
battered women, and every time I’d sit down and talk to a battered woman I’d just think, “My
God, she’s so strong. She’s so bright. She’s so confident. She just happens to be partnered up
with a Violent person who’s trying to do everything he can to diminish her life. But in the midst
of all that she’s still hanging on.” [laughing about a noise—leaf blower]

CW: I think we should be okay, sound wise.

Gruelle 18

KG: Okay. This is the way it always works. I know this from working on the film. I
mean, you can be in what you think is the best place in the world, and then it will be sirens or
something like that.

So anyway, after, in 2007 Katherine kind of said that she couldn’t do it anymore because
it was just too, it wasn’t consistent. There wasn’t any money coming in. I didn’t blame her. But
for me, I’m an advocate. This is my life’s work so I couldn’t walk away from it. And then we got
connected with Cindy Wade, and Cindy Wade saw the value in working on the film, and then I
guess it was three years ago, maybe four years ago, Cindy was at a Clinton Global Initiative
function and she saw Gloria Steinem and told Gloria about the project, and we had a little
twenty-two minute what we called trainer’s edition of the film. And so Cindy sent, Cindy sent a
copy of the twenty-two minute film to Gloria, and Gloria got in touch with Cindy right away and
she said “This is the best thing I’ve ever seen on domestic Violence. What can I do to help?” So
then she came on as executive producer, Cindy’s executive producer. And then she came to
Chapel Hill at the end of February in 2010 to do a big fundraiser and it was just a fabulous,
fabulous success.

And then I wound getting real sick for the last half of 2010. We picked things back up in
2011, and now here we are. We’ve just gotten word that Sundance has chosen us, one of they
said there were over 800, they said there are 800 ﬁlms submitted from eighty-seven different
countries. I don’t know how many films they chose, but they didn’t choose many. So we’re very,
very humbled and excited, and I’m hoping that the film will launch a real organic from the
grassroots up discussion about gender-based Violence and the interconnectedness between
Violence in the home and Violence in the streets and Violence in our country and Violence around

the world because it does begin in the home. It really does. So I feel kind of blown away.

CW: Yeah, why was, why did a documentary particularly that format seem like the most
effective to effect this kind of change?

KG: Well, I’m a big reader too. But I think documentary film can bring people together.
I know what a profound impact Eyes on the Prize had on how people thought about ciVil rights
work. The film that just came out The Invisible War about sexual assault in the military had a big
impact. So there have been, documentary films throughout my adult lifetime that--I don’t know
there’s something about hearing something come out of someone’s mouth combined with sort of
the contextualization of the issue in a way that people who don’t do the work can’t see. Like in
Deanna’s case, the woman who’s in the film, you see her photographs because I take her pictures
to the medical school because I taught at the med school for twenty-one years, and I would hold
up Deanna’s photograph, and I would ask the medical students what they thought Robbie was
charged with. And universally they said this is an attempted murder case. And when I’d say to
them, “No, actually he was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault on a female.” And it
just made their jaws drop because people just don’t understand what our laws do and do not say
about gender based Violence. So I think doing a documentary film is going to make people,
they’ll see the images. They’ll see what the laws say. They’ll see how our state, how the state of
North Carolina just shrugged its shoulders and continues to shrug its shoulders around this crime,
and maybe it’s going to led to an honest and open discussion about patriarchy, about misogyny,
about what our laws reﬂect, which is patriarchy and misogyny. And then these legislators who
claim to care so much about the fiscal health of this state will realize that when they turn their
backs on battered women and children, we’re going to pay for it sooner or later. They’re going to
pay for it horrendously, but we as a state will pay for it too. So that’s why to me documentary

film, it’s just so, it’s so important to do it this particular way. I could sit down and write a book, I

could write probably a three thousand page book about cases that I’ve worked over the years,
and it would curl people’s hair to see how our courts respond or whatever. But documentary ﬁlm
can be just real compelling.

CW: When you were talking about the resources and your different groups of people you
approach in trying to relay like experiences like your work in the Triangle. You live the
mountains.

KG: I live in the mountains, right.

CW: You referenced earlier that like in the mountains people don’t talk about it because
it was a reality for a lot of women. Do you think women in North Carolina, what are the unique
like challenges and experiences for women in the North Carolina mountains and like do they
have the same resources as women in the Triangle?

KG: Yeah, and it’s changed a lot. I mean, when it was happening to me there was no
battered women’s shelter, there was no battered women’s program or anything like that. Of
course this was over thirty years ago. And I do think slowly but surely it is changing, and now
there’s great programs up in Asheville and Haywood County and some of the surrounding
counties, but most of the women that are working in these programs are working for minimum
wage and a lot of them are working many, many hours without getting paid at all just because
they believe so much in doing this work. And I was asked a number of years ago to go do a talk
at North Carolina Central at the law school, and it was going to be a large audience, and I knew
there were going to be people in that audience that didn’t care about domestic Violence. It just, it
just hadn’t occurred to them that they should care. But pretty much everybody claims to be

concerned about fiscal issues.

And I have a very dear friend, Bob Trinkle, who was working at the capital defender’s
ofﬁce in Durham, and I called him one day and I said, “Bob, how many of these guys that you’re
representing grew up exposed to domestic Violence?” He said, “All of them.” And so back in
1992 I think it was the Duke Endowment did a study to find out how much it cost to adjudicate
one death penalty case in North Carolina. In 1992 dollars I think it was 2.6 million dollars per
case from the date of the murder to the date of the execution. And I was going over to Central to
do this talk I looked on the Department of Corrections’ website to see how many people we had
on death row and at the time it was 213. So you multiply 213 times in 1992 dollars 2.6 million,
it’s a lot of money. And that’s only the capital murder cases. That’s not the first degree; that’s
not the second degree, that’s not the manslaughters.

So this is why to me them wanting to close down battered women’s program or not fully
fund them or whatever, it makes me want to say to them, “Do you have any idea how much
you’re costing the state by making a decision like that?” We could be preventing so much
anguish, grief, Violence, repeated criminal behavior, gang related stuff, teenage pregnancies,
teenage runaways, high school dropouts. I mean you name it. When you sort of go back to the
source of all that stuff, almost invariably it’s Violence in the home.

And I remember reading one of the FBI proﬁlers talked about how domestic Violence
programs were the best anti-crime programs in the country and it’s true. Because if you can
stabilize a family, then the ripple effects go out forever and ever and ever whereas if you turn
your backs on them, then shame on all of us. So I just, I’m just a huge believer in prevention. I
see these domestic Violence homicides, and I see the ripple effects from those, and I, when you
look at how they play out, I’d say eight out of ten out of the women who are murdered in this

state, they could be prevented if we would just pay attention to his escalating behavior and attach

the appropriate sanctions to him whether it’s an ankle bracelet, whether it’s putting him in
custody under a high bond, whatever. But women’s lives could be saved if we’d just pay
attention.

CW: Yeah and I guess like sort of reminding me thinking about the word private in your
documentary, and I guess like the fear that like it’s a private issue, but then it affects the public
and--.

KG: It does.

CW: I guess that being frustrating and how you, when you’re relating to women like
because like as you talk about they’re all socialized in this like supporting, how do you convince
them that like, this is, this matters, their experience matters and that like they have a right to feel
safe and like--.

KG: It takes time. It takes a lot of time because for so many women the process of that
subordination process starts on day one. I’ve got a lot of nurturing genes in my body, and also
I’ve had the experience of being loved and cared for unconditionally. And my Aunt Alberta even
when I was doing the most off the wall stuff, when I was doing drugs and living on the streets of
Miami and whatever, instead of judging me, she would just, because she knew what the bigger
picture was she’d just say, “Darling I’m sorry you feel like you need to hurt yourself, and it’s
such a gift to have one safe place in the world you can go and not worry that someone’s going to
say why are you doing this? And why are you doing that? And if it was me I’d do this and if it
was me I’d do that.” Which automatically puts up a wall and based on my own experience as a
battered woman, as a high school dropout, as a druggie, as all these things, I have been in many
instances prepared to be judged. And what has made the biggest difference in my life is when I

interact with someone and they don’t judge me. So I know what a difference that makes to

battered women because they’re used to him, the court system, his family, his friends, her family,
her friends, “What did you do to piss him off? You should’ve known better. He seems like a
nice guy to me.” Which automatically puts the responsibility for what’s happening on her
shoulders rather than on his. And I don’t know. I just [feel] really strong about creating that safe
space where women can come and talk about things they feel the most afraid to talk about, the
most ashamed of, the most guilt ridden about and do it in a way that is absolutely non-
judgmental and provides them with the kind of nurturing and support that they deserve. I mean,
there has to be fertile ground. If there’s not fertile ground, they’re not going to grow and I know
that. Thirty years of this work tells me you’ve got to as advocates create that fertile ground and
that safe space. That’s what I love about being an advocate.

CW: Did you feel like anyone did that for you ( )?

KG: Yeah. Yeah. Alberta did when I was growing up. I mean, I could always go to her
and then when I became an adult, I spent as much time with her as I possibly could. But I
remember my family doc out in Hillsborough who I’m just real, real, real close to when my
daughter Noel was born, this is my third child of third different dad. Richard had left; Jack died,
and then I remarried and her dad left almost immediately, I mean literally left almost
immediately, and then when I had her, I was living in Hillsborough, and I had heard about this
family doc, Artie Axelbank who everybody in town really thought a lot of. And I knew that I
wanted to find somebody to take care of me and the kids, and so I called and I said I’m going to
have this baby. I don’t want to stay in the hospital a long time because I think the hospital is for
sick people, but I need to find a doc that’s going to sign off on that, on me leaving right away. He
said, “Sure. Sounds good to me.” So he actually was not there when I had Noel, I had her real

fast.

But anyway, when I took her in for her ten day checkup, I walked in. I had my baby girl.
I was so excited that I had a daughter. I love my sons, but I really wanted to have a daughter, and
Artie was taking our family history. And my history is complicated and it’s ugly. And I dropped
out of high school when I was seventeen and I had a drug history and three kids from three
different dads, and so for all intents and purposes I would be a good target for somebody to
judge. But he didn’t do that. And I remember as we were kind of going through stuff and I was
just sort of very timidly saying things because I expected that he was going to come down on me
somehow, but instead he’d say things like, “It sounds like you’ve lived a interesting life,” I’d say
something and he’d say, “I admire how you think about that.” Here was this doctor telling me
that he admired how I thought about something.

And I remember walking out of Artie’s office and I just leaned against the wall, and it
was like something shifted inside of me because we live in a society where there is a lot of
hierarchy and Artie leveled that playing field. It didn’t matter that he was a doctor and I was a
patient. As far as he was concerned we were equals. And it was profound to me. It was profound.
I’ve told him a hundred times. He’s almost never willing to take credit for the gift that he gave
me by being so kind and so humane. But it was what it was. It was a pivotal moment in my life
to have, to have a doctor treat me with the kind of respect he did. And when I would go to the
medical school to teach this class on domestic Violence to all the first years, I would say to them,
you know you might be the best teclmician in the world. You might be the best scientist in the
world, able to diagnose an illness. But remember that you’re working with human beings and
those human beings are coming in with complex lives. And if you treat them humanely, that’s
going to do as much to advance the healing process as setting the bone just right or writing the

exact right prescription. I mean I’ve just, I just really believe that.

CW: ( ) I admire the way you think about that and then how women in abusive
relationships can’t think, dropping out of high school. I read that you went to school, college at
App later in life. Why, like what was that experience like? What made you decide pursuing a
degree was something that should happen?

KG: Well, I just, I mean when I moved here to Chapel Hill from the mountains you
could, you can’t fall off the sidewalk without rumling into someone who’s at least got their
master’s degree. And I was tremendously, tremendously ashamed that fact that I was a high
school dropout, and after I had Noel I just went over to Durham Tech and got the books and took
the test to get my GED. But I had always been told when I was young that I was stupid and that I
wasn’t college material. And but then Alberta my aunt would say to me, “No darling, you’re
smart. You’re smart. You’re smart. Don’t let your parents tell you that you’re not. You’re
smart.” And then the New Y orker thing would happen. “Here darling. Read this New Y orker and
then let’s talk about it.” And then it felt like my brain was really starting to wake up in this whole
new way, and I started taking classes at the community college and doing pretty well. And as I
did well in the classes I started to think, “Maybe I’m not stupid. Maybe I can do this.” And then I
got the chance to go to Appalachian, and [pause] I remember walking in there. There’s this old
woman with a backpack and all these young students, and they were looking at me like, “Who is
this old person in class?” But the majority of the professors were amazing. And because I was in
the sociology department primarily and because I’d done what I did for a living, they like wanted
to hear stories from the street because they knew the textbooks say one thing, but let’s hear how
things really are out there. And so they were just astonishingly supportive and encouraging, and I
wound up doing really, really well, and as I was going through, you’re supposed to pick whether

you’re going to do marriage and family or whether you’re going to do deviance or blah, blah,

blah or whatever, but all my papers that I was writing were on gender based Violence. And so my
advisor Amy Page called me one day and said, “You know maybe it would be good for us to do
an individually designed program so you can just concentrate on it and just do it.” So that’s what
we did, and I graduated last year with a cum laude. Both my parents are dead. But there was a
very high degree of satisfaction of just knowing that I had transcended that kind of thing that
Ruth primarily had wrapped me up in that made me believe that I was just too stupid for school.
So it felt real good. It felt real good.

It’s part of a process of people starting to believe that they can think. And they can be
appreciated for what they think. And like Dearma the woman that’s in the film, she’s in school at
Appalachian now. It’s like women and their brains and the opportunity to be free and to express
themselves and to not have to worry about being afraid all the time. It’s just, it’s just this
untapped potential. And if there’s anything I can do to help to help women find that kind of
freedom then I want to do it.

CW: Well, there are a lot of questions but like a lot of things have just kind of come up
mostly. Do you consider yourself a feminist?

KG: Absolutely. Absolutely. But I also consider myself a humanist because I’ve got two
sons. And when Jack, when my husband died he was, we were down at the funeral home, and he
was just lying there in this casket and Jason was fourteen months old at the time, and he was
climbing on Jack’s body and sitting on his chest and I said out loud to Jack even though Jack was
dead, I said, “He is not going to turn out like you did. If it kills me he’s not going to turn out like
you did,” because part of what I saw when he would have his hands around my throat and I was
looking in his eyes was just this, it was like a wild animal. But he was of that culture, that

hypermasculinized mountain culture, and then it was combined with a lot of really bad family

stuff. And even before I got into really studied all this stuff it just occurred to me that when the
egg is first fertilized that there’s male information and female information, and I wanted my sons
to have access to all of who they were. So I tried to raise them to be whole people. So when I say
yes, I’m a feminist, I am a feminist. But I also believe that part of why the world is in the shape
that it’s in is we get so pigeon-holed based on sex. Boys are supposed to behave a certain way;
girls are supposed to behave a certain way. Ifboys behave in a way that is what’s considered a
traditionally female kind of behavior like if they cry or whatever then they’re stigmatized
somehow. Same thing for women. Women are called bitches if they behave in a determined and
forward manner. That just was not acceptable for me. I put my kids in Friends school because I
wanted them to have that Quaker experience. My oldest son Matt has three kids now, and he is
absolutely a spectacular daddy. He’s loving, he’s sweet; he’s kind; he’s funny; he’s gentle and
he’s a big strong guy. He’s a big man. He’s siX-foot three 230 pounds, very physical, very
athletic. But he’ll sit on the ﬂoor with the girls and they paint his toenails and then they’ll go out
and play soccer and his little boy Miles is going to grow up to be a whole human being. So for
me my activism is centered as much around trying to create an atmosphere where men can shed
some of the skin that’s been draped on them, that hypermasculinized you’d better be a hard ass
all the time. Because I think they lose a lot when they get into that mindset. I know over the
years I’ve seen families where the man is abusive and Violent and controlling, and in his mind he
equates fear with respect and they’re not the same thing at all. And when he dies, they celebrate.
So what I’ve tried to say to men that I’ve interacted with over the years that are controlling and
Violent is you think you’re family respects you because they’re afraid of you, you’re wrong.

They’re just afraid of you. That’s all there is to it. But again that socialization process starts on
