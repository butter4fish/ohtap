 Duffy  Glover  My name is Karen Neurohr. I   m a librarian at Oklahoma State  University, and this is the O-STATE Stories oral history project of the  OSU Library. Today we   re here with Jana Duffy, who works for the  OSU Foundation, and Edwin Glover, who is an alumnus of Oklahoma  A M College from the Class of 1947. We   re in the beautiful OSU  Alumni Building, and today is Friday, October 21, 2006. We really  appreciate you coming today, Mr. Glover, for this interview.  Thank you.  Mr. Glover, since this is Homecoming weekend, what were Homecoming  events like when you were here on campus?  Well, we had a wonderful parade and of course, house decorations were  extensive and they decorated the windows downtown. We had all of the  National Guard and all of the ROTC  Reserve Officers    Training Corps   cadets in the parade and, of course, the Cadet Corps at that time was  around thirty-five hundred men   because it was required to take ROTC  then.  It usually was cold and blustery, and the young ladies on the floats  nearly froze to death. The children loved it and we had bands from all  over the district. It was quite enjoyable. And, of course, we had  Armistice Day that went along with this. These were two of the big  parade days. We all went to see the house decorations and the parade. It  was quite a job to get to see these sights because we lived in the country  about three miles southwest of town on Western. We had to walk in  because we didn   t have cars or we rode an old iron wheel buggy and  iron wheel wagon to come into town. It would take us maybe three hours  to come two or three miles. Horses don   t walk very fast. It was a jostling  ride and very dusty usually and we usually had bad weather. I mean, it  5  Duffy  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  was either windy, raining, snowing or something on Homecoming. But  everybody looked forward to Homecoming and it   s a great tradition for  OAMC and OSU to follow and extend into the future.  What other traditions do you remember from being a student here at  OSU, aside from Homecoming?  Oh, when you   re a freshman you had the beanie caps and everybody  called you    Frosh.    You were always supposed to look up to the  upperclassmen, you know, and they hollered at you   you had to holler  some word back, I don   t remember what it was. They had belt lines at  that time and the belt lines could run from campus clear down to Main  Street and up Sixth Street back to the campus. I mean it was quite an  extensive operation and it was hazing really. You know it was quite a  hazing deal in those days because they used the belts and they ran the  young people through the belt lines and they just whacked them as they  went by. (Laughter) So it was something that we didn   t look forward to,  but it was one of the things that I remember.  Also just the campus, you know, at OAMC was always a beautiful  campus, mainly because they maintained the architectural d  cor, the  Jeffersonian d  cor, and the plantings have always been good. We had  some wonderful maintenance men who took care of the plantings on the  campus, and it   s always been clean and neat. Of course, Theta Pond is  an old historic point and it   s been filled up and dug out about four or five  times   I don   t know   a wonderful place for the fraternities to throw  their initiates in. A lot of the fraternities threw their initiates in.  Were there ducks and swans at Theta Pond when you were a student  here?  Oh yeah. We had ducks and I remember we had geese. I don   t remember  the swans, but there were geese there and, of course, children always  came and fed them. One time, rats got so bad on the island out there and  they killed a lot of the ducks and geese so they had to exterminate the  rats. There has always been wildlife in the area, small birds and squirrels  and rabbits, and a park for the children. They even fished there in the  summertime. They would catch those little mud cat  catfish . Oh those  are some of the things I remember.  Of course, the old power plant used to be quite a landmark, and it went  down, I think, in 1950. And that was one of the things that kept me in  school because when I started to school here, I got a job working for  twenty cents an hour digging a ditch from Life Sciences to Whitehurst  Hall. It was a ditch that was about, oh, I   d say twelve feet deep, and I  was digging it in August, and I was the only person on that, out there all  6  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  by myself digging that. I was happy to get the job, but I had no way in  the world of going to school. My dad had no money because of the  Depression and things like that. It was an opportunity for me to go to  school. Mr. George Givens was the chief engineer and he was a friend of  my dad   s, and that   s how I got the contract. So I worked for the crew  there for all three years before I went into the service to learn to be a  plumber and a steam fitter and helped maintain all the heating and water  and electricity for the campus. I hated to see the old power plant go  because I had a lot of fond memories there. We had quite a student crew  and we all liked each other and had a lot of good times together. We  worked on the holidays, too and we worked quite often.  You mentioned the military service. Could you talk about that a little  bit?  The ROTC was mandatory here at OSU and so when you came to  campus one of the things you had to do was go get your uniform.  Captain McDonald was the old military properties custodian. He was  about four and a half feet tall, grey headed and would take no guff from  anybody. If you barked at him, well he   d bark back three times at you.  And if you didn   t like your uniform, he   d just say,    Well come back  tomorrow and I   ll give you another pair,    and he   d throw the uniform at  them (laughs). He just wasn   t very nice to you, but we wore the uniform,  you know, two or three times a week, and it became part of our  wardrobe. We had clothes to wear to drill and had big companies. I said  the Cadet Corps was thirty-five hundred in size, and we filled the space  between the old gym and the stadium there. A lot of us, a select group of  us, became Advanced ROTC and that meant that you advanced in the  end to get a commission. There were about four hundred of us in this  particular group that I was in. They closed the ROTC office because of  the war and we did not get our commission, so we all had to go to our  branch school and earn our commission, our second lieutenant bars, and  most of us went through Fort Benning   the Benning School for Boys in  June of 1943 and got our commission, and a lot of us saw active duty  service in the Second World War.  Well, tell us a little bit about that, about the military and your service.  Well, most of us got our second lieutenant commission and that  qualified us to be what we called a small unit leader. It   s really a platoon  leader. We all became platoon leaders in whatever branch we were in  and joined the two divisions that had been organized. Most all of us  were replacement officers. We were not part of the original divisions. So  we went out as second lieutenants and joined all of the fighting units in  Europe and in the Pacific. But we had a sergeant   I forget what the  sergeant   s name was here at OSU. He was keeping a record and said that  7  Duffy  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  we had the worst casualty record of any ROTC unit that he had heard  of   said that we had well over fifty percent casualties, so we had really  seen a lot of action. We had people in all branches of the service. OSU  really contributed to the victory of World War II. I mean, it was   young  leadership   if we hadn   t had the young leadership, I don   t think we  could have won the war. It was very fortunate that we had the ROTC.  It   s too bad that we don   t have a big ROTC program now. I think it  would be much to our advantage to have one.  Mr. Glover, I know you graduated from OSU in 1947, but you   re active  with the Class of 1943 in terms of the ROTC. Can you explain more  about that?  The Class of    43? Well, this is what I was talking about. These were the  ones that did not get their commission here in ROTC and so we had to  go to our branch school and earn it. There were about four hundred of us  that went to Fort Belvoir, Fort Benning, Fort Knox   all of these schools,  and got their commission, and they were assigned out to the units. It   s a  distinctive group. We meet every April 6. That   s the day we left OSU  campus to go to the service. We have about twenty to twenty-five of us  that come here and have our reunion of the Class of    43. We   re pretty  close and we keep in good contact with everybody. It   s real  enlightening.  It seems like that Oklahoma State University overall has a lot of spirit  and a lot of alumni still participate in activities. Could you talk a little  bit about your career and what that   s meant to you?  My career here at OSU was very enjoyable. I had a better time working  than I did doing anything. I started out here as an intern in the  accounting department under Mr. Berry, and I worked as an intern for a  year and a half until I graduated. At that time, back in the    40s and early     50s, work was very difficult to find, even for the graduate. Oil  companies would hire, but that was about it. If you didn   t get a job with  an oil company or an accounting firm, you were pretty well out on a  limb.  Oh, I tried to get work with the city service up in Bartlesville and several  other places, and I was not successful. So I asked if I could join the staff  there at OSU. They hired me as an accounting assistant and that was the  beginning of my career. I was an accounting assistant for awhile and I  worked up to Assistant Chief Accountant. Then I was given the  opportunity to organize the Department of Internal Audits. Lewie  Sanderson was the business manager at that time, and he gave me the  opportunity to get started and begin my career. So I started out with a  half-time secretary. I worked on every floor and every corner of  8  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Whitehurst Hall (Laughs) and it was really a wonderful, challenging  career. I had nothing to start with and I started building it up and we  didn   t have a budget except for my half-time secretary and one full-time  person, and that was not very much. So I asked if I could hire students  and started hiring them in 1965 and   two little fellas, Gerry Box and  Cowboy Bingham. Anyway, they were farmer boys, and we started  training the young men and women to be internal auditors of colleges  and universities. We had ten interns when we started and eventually  about four hundred students went through the program, all outstanding  people and outstanding leaders across the nation and really in the world.  We have people in Hong Kong and the Hawaiian Islands and such as  that.  A lot of the internal auditing is really a management improvement  oriented profession where one goes in and lives within the organization  and helps the people do a better job. That was our objective, and that   s  why it became such an enjoyable thing because we finally converted all  the faculty and staff so they knew we were coming to help them and not  to find something bad about them. We lived on that and from 1965 until  1987 that was my job. I worked under Dr. Bennett and then Dr. Willham  and Dr. Kamm and Dr. Boger, all four presidents, all great people. We  had a wonderful feeling of helping the faculty and staff to do a better  job. The change in the philosophy was extensive after my retirement  because they started reporting to the Board of Regents. They no longer  lived in the organization. I had a wonderful professional career at OSU  and will always remember it.  The campus has certainly changed in the time that you   ve been here. Do  you have any special memories of any of the buildings or anything that  are on campus?  Oh yes. Well, the old Chemistry Building   it   s gone. The Post Office  was here. It   s gone. All of the maintenance buildings are gone, and the  old coffee shop   the Y Coffee Shop. The fellow who ran it was blind.  He and his wife both were blind and they had a seeing-eye dog. The  students all went there. That was one of the hot spots for us until the  Student Union came. Then, of course, it became the center of the hot  spots. Tiger Drugs, the drug store on the hill there, was another real  popular place and, of course, the upper floor of that was a dance hall,  you know. There were a lot of dances up there.  Do you remember when the library was built?  Yeah, I remember the old library.  Well, tell me about     9  Glover  When we came back from the service, why we used to   there was a  group of us   and the old library was a one-story building and it was     it   s a flat. The bookstore out here   the book depository   we   d always  go over there and sit on the steps and tell war stories (Laughs), you  know, and then when they tore it down, why it was kind of sad to see it  go, but there were so many stories.  The Bursar was John Houck. There was a reserve building off to the side  built out of bricks, and John said that he had classes in there and he said  one of the professors couldn   t see very well. He  Houck  said people  would come in, sit down and they   d check the roll, then they   d crawl out  the window (Laughs) but he was a character. John and my uncle, Horace  Andrews   yeah, they were both in the Bursar   s office and they  apparently didn   t have too much to do because they had an old billfold  that had a string to it and they   d put it out on the sidewalk and watch  people come by and try to pick it up (Laughs) and then jerk it out from  underneath. And of course Whitehurst Hall was about like it is now,  except an explosion occurred  in the Soils Lab  in the early    50s and  Mrs. Schidler was injured. I think she was the only injured person. We  used the basement of Whitehurst Hall for a coffee shop, and had an old,  old fella that was the janitor at Whitehurst Hall that ran the coffee shop.  We were always trying to raise enough money to send him back to  Mississippi (Laughter). Mr. Moore, I think his name was.  According to  Mr. Glover, Mr. Moore had white hair and took the joke real well. He  would throw monkey wrenches at the rats in the basement.   I officed on every floor   started out in northwest corner, went to the  north and southeast corner, then I went up on second floor about the  middle where the soils lab was and moved on up to the third floor and  finally got to the fourth floor. We got all of our staff up there, and finally  moved to Cordell Hall. That was where we finally ended up and that   s  where the external audits office is now. I guess they   re still in Cordell  Hall.  We had an organization called the Red Red Rose. I don   t know if you   ve  ever heard of it or not. Dr. Bennett brought it from over at Wilburton,  and it was a fun organization. Really the objective of it was to get  professors and straight-laced people to let their hair down, and so Clay  Potts was   you   ve heard about Clay Potts, I guess. He   s one of the  greatest cooks that ever hit OSU. He could cook chicken. He could cook  any type of food, but he always cooked them in a gunny sack (Laughs)  and he was our cook, the Red Red Rose cook. And this Red Red Rose  organization, we   d meet about three times a year (Laughs).  According  to Mr. Glover, Clay Potts was Grand High Provider and he was the  Grand High Scribe of the Ancient and Benevolent Order of the Red Red  Rose .  10  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Where did you meet at?  Oh, Animal Husbandry Arena, Camp Redlands, or the poultry  building   things like that. But Clay always cooked all our chicken,  chicken and corn   and we had chicken and corn and tomatoes and fresh  bread and slaw and iced tea and watermelon in season. But I   ll tell you, I  laughed more at those things   I laughed every bit of fat I ate (Laughter)  off. I   m sure it was because they were so straight-laced. They would run  through some athletic events and things like that, and the way they  reacted was really something. It was a really good organization. I don   t  think it is active anymore. I   ve heard former members wanting to  reactivate it, but it   s never gotten around the corner.  Well, let   s see. I took care of the insurance for the university. In 1950 we  had a hail storm that wiped out all of the clay tile building   you know,  everything   hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars, and it happened  twice. And the hail was stacked up about one to two feet, and it was  really heavy hail. And we had another storm, hail storm. They were  softball size hail stone, and one or two of them hit my car and came right  through the windshield. You know, I drove it in the garage and the hail  just kept coming right through the garage, banging away. Weather is a  big factor here in Stillwater, and we haven   t had many bad tornadoes or  anything like that, but we   ve had some severe drastic changes in the  weather and that   s why, I think, the people in Stillwater are a little more  tolerable than some other people. (Laughter)  What do you think about the changes that are occurring on campus  today?  Well, it   s kind of sad and kind of good. I think it   s a sign of progress and  the fact that Mr. Pickens was so generous. We ought to take advantage  of it and do the best we can. It   s going to be real interesting to see how  things turn out and see what, the results from the endowment will be,  you know, the new construction.  Do you attend sporting events on campus?  Every basketball and every football game I attend, yes. I wouldn   t want  to miss them. I   ve been watching OSU football since 1935. We used to  walk in from out on the farm and we   d get tickets and walk in and they  were always night games. That was way back in Exendine   s coaching  period,  Coach  Waldorf, way back there.  How did the students act at the games?  Same as they do now.  11  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Did they stand up and     Stand up and holler        make a big ruckus?  Yeah, it   s about the same. There   s just more of them. (Laughs)  Was Bullet around back then? Bullet or Pistol Pete?  No, Bullet is a recent addition. Pistol Pete was there. Pistol Pete   s  always been there. Yeah, I   ve helped carry Pistol Pete to other games,  you know   take his hat. Some of us faculty and staff would drive him  up and go to the ballgames, usually up in Kansas and Colorado. Now  that   s a great tradition. Old Pistol Pete was a real person, you know, and  that they have been dedicated to him and eulogize him like they have,  it   s great.  Did you meet him in person?  No, I didn   t meet him in person. I saw him in person, but I never met  him.   Mr. Glover begins description of his childhood home  Where we lived  out on Western, my grandmother  Lula Ash Andrews  staked a claim  from 19th to 26th and east, that 160 acres there, and I spent a lot of time  in that area. That   s the old homestead which is still standing there. Well,  I stayed with my grandmother and grandfather in the winters, and I  started school from their house. I went to Pleasant Valley School, that  little Pleasant Valley School there. I started in 1929 and I went through  most of the eight grades, except the one we were away during the  Depression. Everybody had to move where they had labor or had a labor  chance. That   s a good little school. My mother went there and her sisters  and brother, you know, it goes way back and a wonderful program out  there now. It   s still a school. And all the fourth graders go and they still  have some wonderful, dedicated people that teach and, of course, they  teach the curriculum like it was in 1899.  Did you say that your grandmother staked a claim? Was she in the Land  Run?  No, she was not in the Land Run.  Shortly after that though     She got the claim from a person that didn   t want any claim   through her  12  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  father, Mr.  John  Ash. I spent a lot of time with her learning wild  shrubbery and the wild herbs in the woods, you know. She came from  Pennsylvania and, of course, she knew all of those and how to plant  rhubarb and, oh, I think she was something. And she made me mind,  too. I was a little devil. (Laughter)  Mr. Glover   s mother married Harry  Andrews .  What did she have to do to make you mind? (Laughter)  Well, she put me under a washtub. (Laughter) We usually put chickens  under there for Sunday dinner.  Oh my. (Laughter)  She wouldn   t let me out until I promised I wouldn   t do whatever I did.  And I remember one time I had a real deal. I was supposed to empty all  the mouse traps in the pantry, and I really had a big bunch, you know.  So all of the women in the family lived upstairs and I thought, dang it,  it   d be a lot of fun to take those upstairs and see what they would do.  (Laughter) Oh, they just went wild, you know. I put those mice on the  floor and I got reprimanded for that   I remember that. We had some  wonderful times out there.  My grandfather, he was a firm believer in Santa Claus and he   d get all  the grandkids around an old pot-bellied stove Christmas Eve, and then  he   d go out and he   d get on top of the roof and stomp around, you know,  and come back in and say,    Did you hear Santa Claus out there?    And  he   d say,    Well you heard him, if you don   t go to bed, you   re not going  to get any of Santa   s presents,    and we   d go off to bed, get up the next  morning as early as we could, you know, and have a fabulous Christmas.  We celebrated everything, you know, all the holidays   Easter,  Thanksgiving and oh, beginning of spring and all the birthdays. Every  time we   d have one of these reunions, why there was just food   man, all  kinds of food. We really looked forward to it   the young boys and  girls   and they   d run us off when they got ready to cook and send us to  the woods. We   d stay out there and come back about the time we  thought it was done.  And we hunted a lot. We hunted possum in possum, fur-bearing, season  and we had lots of friends. My favorite cousin was Ralph Andrews. He  was my Uncle Leonard   s boy. And then the Jacobs boys, George and  Jimmy Jacobs  Carrie Jacobs was their sister , lived down the way and  every Sunday we would get together and go into the field, you know,  and hunt rabbits and squirrels because it was one of our responsibilities  to get meat there at home so we   d have some food. And, oh, there were  some funny things that happened, but I could go on for hours. (Laughs)  13  Neurohr  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  Duffy  Glover  Neurohr  Glover  I had an old donkey called Rastus. He was an army donkey. He was a  good donkey. He worked real hard. We   d hook him up to a buggy and  run up and down those hills, you know. When he didn   t want to work,  boy, you   d just better give up because he   d just want to go to the barn  dragging everything. And he   d stroll   turn him loose and he   d get to the  farthest corner of the pasture and start braying at you, you know.  (Laughs) In those old hills over there, we had a lot of fun.  Mr. Glover, have other members of your family attended OSU and are  they still   do you have any family members that are still here?  My son, Tom, lives over in Broken Arrow. He   s a developer  Glover  Realty Company . And Linda, Linda Kay  Mahar      she didn   t finish  school, but she went two years  to OSU . And my wife went back to  school. She   s in interior design and, I don   t know, she went three or four  years. She didn   t get a degree. None of my granddaughters or grandsons  went. My son-in-law  John Stewart Mahar  went. That was about it.  Tom and Linda went and, of course, a lot of the cousins went, you know,  the Goodman   s  Bill, Clinton, Bristol (brothers) and Afton (sister)  and  all that, but it   s always been a great institution for us.  Well, do you have any advice for current students or future students?  Well, go to OSU of course. (Laughter)  Great answer. (Laughter)  I think that one of the things that I   d advise young people today is to  learn to be resilient and go with the flow of people and the way of  things, and not to get too ingrained in any particular subject because  things change so frequently. Don   t be afraid to try something new. I  mean, a lot of people miss a big opportunity sometimes when they just  don   t want to try because they   re lazy, really. (Laughs) But I think land  grant institutions are great institutions, and I think of all institutions     and I   ve been on 400 campuses, and I   ve never yet seen one that   s  prettier than OSU and has a better student body or students or faculty. I  mean, we have one of the finest educational institutions in the United  States. I   ll stand behind that until I   m gone (Laughs) and afterwards. But  it   s a real opportunity to go to OSU because we have such a broad field  of education, you know. I mean, you can get anything   any kind of  education you want. It   s really great.  Do you have any final things that you want to share with us today?  I don   t know. What else did I put down there? I talked about my  boyhood, didn   t I? No, I   ve talked about everything.  Mr. Glover went  14  Neurohr  Glover  on to reiterate after the interview that he still believes OACM   OSU  are the greatest of land grant institutions and it was a privilege for him to  be a part of the school   s history .  Well, we thank you so much for participating in the O-STATE Stories  oral history project of the OSU Library today. It   s really been a pleasure  to hear your stories and your really fond memories of the university, and  thank you so much for taking the time to come out today.  Thank you for letting me share them, and I   m very pleased to share them  with you.  -------  -------
