Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was just wondering if I could hold off on that.

Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask.  They are lightweight questions, and they only require a brief answer.  They're kind of a warm-up, you know.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, broccoli.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, ma'am, do you have a favorite color?

Story_ID: 244550
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history now, and I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Clarence Blair] side of the family.  And I'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Well, you gonna be surprised.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Gladys--my mother's name is Gladys [James] Blair.  G-L-A-D-Y-S is the first name and Blair, capital B-L-A-I-R, is her last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that her maiden name or is she--is that her birth name?
Speaker 2: No, that's her marriage name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: James, J-A-M-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't really know, because my mother did not rear me.  I thought my mother had passed away, and she hadn't.  My aunt, Mary [James] Lloyd, reared me from six months old.
Speaker 1: Okay, well can you give us her full name and spell it for us?  What is her name again?
Speaker 2: Mary--
Speaker 1: Mary.
Speaker 2: Lloyd, and that is capital M-A-R-Y.  I think the last name is L-O, L-L-O-Y-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her maiden name, I guess, was James, too, right?
Speaker 2: James, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not know.  That's from so long ago.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Do you suspect that she--that your mother and her sister were born in Texarkana [Texas], or Arkansas, or in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: I think they were all from Texarkana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think they--'cause I had three aunts, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, are--how much do you know about your mother and your aunt's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I don't know hardly anything.  You see, my mother birthed me and married when she was fifteen years old.  And so in that day, she was just thought of as a child.  And my father was somewhat older, and he thought that--they said that my mother was still playing with dolls (unclear).  And he wanted to me--wanted my Aunt Mary to rear me.  So, at six months old, he brought me to Chicago, Illinois, and my Aunt Mary reared me.  And for some reason, Aunt Mary told me that my mother had died.  So, you see, I grew up thinking my mother was dead.  And it was about twenty-two years old when I found out that she was alive.  So that was difficult for me to know what you're asking.
Speaker 1: Okay, but your aunt didn't talk about that side of the family at all--about, about their history and how far back they go--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --or anything like that?  Okay.
Speaker 2: She didn't.  I don't know anything about my--I knew that I had an aunt, an Aunt Gladys and an Aunt Elizabeth and an uncle, Uncle Mac, and Uncle Robert.  Uncle Robert was the dentist.
Speaker 1: Okay, Robert James?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: Robert James?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 244551
Speaker 1: What was your aunt [Mary James Lloyd] like?  What kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: My aunt was a very elegant, classy lady.  In fact, she did not work.  My uncle, Uncle Lloyd must have passed for another race, he was so fair, because he made a big salary, and my aunt did not work.  But she was not a lazy person.  She was very, very firm, very strict, and my father [Clarence Blair] wanted her to rear me because he wanted me to be a classy, refined lady, and she was just that.  Aunt Mary was just that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your Aunt Mary talk about growing up to you at all?  Did she talk about what life was like when she grew up in Texarkana [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't--only that they were a prominent family and that they were Hawaiian-looking in color, and also they had keen features.  And the ladies had large legs.  And she said that they were referred to as the big-legged James girls in that day (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They thought that was something, I guess (laughter).
Story_ID: 244552
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Clar--my father's name was Clarence Blair, C-L-E-A-R-E-N-E [sic.], I think that's--and the last name, again, was capital B-L-A-I-R, Blair.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his--
Speaker 2: Clarence Blair.
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I really don't know that.  If so, I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But was he from Texarkana [Texas], too?
Speaker 2: And he was--yes, and he was--he passed away when I was seven years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you didn't get a chance to know him very--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew him well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He thought it was nothing like me.  He was always around, carrying me around, or whatever.
Speaker 1: So, did he move to Chicago [Illinois], too, or did--
Speaker 2: No, but he was in and out of Chicago.  And then he travelled a lot.  He worked for some meat factory.  And I know that they--well, his transportation was driven by horses in that day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So with being, you know, a kid, I don't have all that detail.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, they didn't talk about it, or whatever.
Story_ID: 244553
Speaker 1: But my Aunt Mary [James Lloyd] was very, very firm and very strict.  And she never raised her--in rearing me, she never raised her voice, never.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was always, "Auntie."  "Didn't Auntie tell you such and such a thing?"
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I had very little to do.  I wanted to be an actress all my life.  That's what I wanted to be.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my aunt gave me very little to do.  But something--because she wanted me to be responsible.  And one of the things--we had an icebox in that day.  Well, she'd empty the pan that was under the icebox to catch the water as the ice melted.  And I would always let it run over.  And to this day, I wonder if I did that purposely, or if I would really forget.  Because my aunt was very strict, and when she said something, she meant it.  So I would wipe up the spot, but Auntie would make me scrub the whole floor.  And I could never stand that.  I would say to her, "Well, Auntie, I wiped up the water.  Why would I have to scrub the whole floor?"  She says, "Because where you wiped up the water, it's cleaner."  And that was her way of punishing me.  And she taught me to iron.  She would leave like two or three pieces for me to iron.  And I was similar to the kids today.  I wanted to do it in a hurry.  I didn't wanna really do nothing.  And I would hurry and iron it and would be full of wrinkles.  And Auntie referred to that, those wrinkles, that as cat faces.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She said, "Well, you filled it with cat faces."  Now, she wouldn't come and fuss at me and push me.  But evidently, she would notice that and when I--if she said--if something could be going on, an event, like maybe a month from now.  And she'd say, "Well, [HistoryMaker] Maxine [Powell], you were naughty," or you did this or the other, "so you, as punishment, you will not be going to such-and-such affair."  Well, I would do like the average kid.  I--when it was near the time, oh, I'd do everything just right, trying to please her.  And I would get dressed--and you never left the house without saying, "I'm leaving," or I'm whatever.  And I would say, "Well, Auntie, I'm leaving."  And she would say, "Where are you going, darling?"  Always kind, never raised her voice.  And I would say, well, you know, today is such-and-such a day and such-and-such a day and such-and-such a day, and I'd just go on and on and on.  And she'd say, "Well, don't you remember that Auntie told you such-and-such a day, you were not going to this affair because you were naughty, you did such-and-such-and-such a thing?"  And, oh, I'd cry, and I'd beg.  And it seemed that I was always like a leader.  And the other kids that was going to the affair would be out front there at the door outside.  They-"Come on, Maxine, come out," and, "we're gonna leave you."  And I'd beg, and I would plead, and I would cry.  And my aunt would allow me to ventilate.  It would probably be on a Saturday, and she--then after a while she'd say, "Oh, Maxine, look how ugly you're making yourself.  Why don't you go and wash your face and take your clothes off and do your ironing."  And I would be so upset, I'd say, "Ironing!  Why, Auntie, I did that ironing.  I finished that on Thursday."  And she said, "Yes, I know, I know you did.  But you filled the ironing with cat faces.  So Auntie sprinkled them all over again.  Now go and do your ironing."  That was the kind of person--that was the kind of training that I received.
Speaker 2: Very stern training.
Speaker 1: Very, very.  And she was not mean and did not work me to death or anything.  But if she said--never raised her voice, very kind--but whatever she said you could do or you could not do, she never changed her mind.
Story_ID: 244554
Speaker 1: Do have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We went to church.  My aunt [Mary James Lloyd] made wine.  She made the grape juice for the church, and she made about four different types of wine.  Excuse me.  I remember they would be in barrels.  And she was the great baker.  Like, today you might serve someone that's visiting you food or a cocktail.  And my aunt would serve you wine, and she baked a three-layer jelly cake, a three-layer coconut cake, a three-layer chocolate cake.  So whenever you came to our home, you would get a glass of wine and also a piece of cake, whether you wanted it or not.  She called that hospitality, anyone that came over our threshold.  And then the minister--she served the--made the, as I said before, the grape juice for the church.  And then the minister would come to our house several times to eat.  And I hated to see him coming because my aunt--I loved the thigh of the chicken.  And he would eat up--she would cook--she liked to go to the poultry and have the chicken killed so that they would be first, and she wanted them to be two and a half pounds after they were dressed.  And she'd cook about three.  And that minister would eat every one of those thighs.  And I hated to see him coming (laughter).  But my aunt, her teaching was, anyone that came over our threshold, no matter how they act or how rude they were or whatever, we had to treat them with due respect.  And if we felt that they were people that you did not want to associate with or they were destructive in any way, then you didn't allow them in.  But once they came in, you had to treat them with respect.  Well, I found from that, I learned discipline.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, she was always teaching.  I learned discipline.
Story_ID: 244555
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in, in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, in Chicago I lived in--the first, I remember was 3124 [South] Dearborn [Street] in Chicago.  And that was because I went to the Keith School [Chicago, Illinois], and I think that was the Caucasian, all Caucasian school at that time.
Speaker 1: Keith School.
Speaker 2: I--yeah, I think it was Keith.
Speaker 1: K-E-I-T-H?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that was the nearest school to where we lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What now--so, your family then consisted of--is your, your aunt and her husband, right, your Uncle Blair, right?
Speaker 2: And my--no, my Uncle Lloyd.
Speaker 1: Lloyd, okay.
Speaker 2: Lloyd, yeah.
Speaker 1: Lloyd, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And then I had an aunt and--let me think.  Aunt Mary [James Lloyd] and Aunt Gladys, and she was married also to a Caucasian gentleman.  I think that he was thirty-seven years old when they got married.  And they were in the South--I don't know what part--at the time.  And he had received his inheritance.  They were--his family was in the steamship build--business.  So naturally when he married her, I think things were quite different, prejudice in that day.  So they had to leave whatever city that they were in in the South.  And, of course, his family disowned him because of marrying an African American.  And even when he died, they never came near.  They never recognized him again.  And then, I had an aunt by the name of Aunt Julia.  And the two of them, Aunt Gladys and Aunt Julia were very, very close.  Although they were close with my aunt, but they were inseparable, always together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I mean in terms of the, the household that you lived in, how, how many people were in, lived there?  Did your other two aunts live there, too?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Oh, they were rich, and especially Aunt Gladys.  No, no.
Speaker 1: So in, in your--
Speaker 2: In my immediate family, there was my cousin, my aunt's daughter and, and her husband and I.  It was just the three of us that lived together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so your aunt had a daughter, too?
Speaker 2: A grown daughter.
Speaker 1: A grown daughter, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 244556
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: What was what?
Speaker 1: Some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up.  Well, it was beautiful.  It was similar today that things were quite prejudiced.   And we lived in a real nice neighborhood.  But it seems that after nine or ten years, the neighborhood would look like just where we came from.  So, we would move to another nice neighborhood.  And I don't know, I think that goes on today.  But--and my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] was a great Elk, an organization called the [Benevolent and Protective Order of] Elks.  And they travelled a lot.  And, well, really, they had an annual convention, and my aunt would go.  And she would travel with the drawing room, 'cause they--wasn't planes, wasn't popular at that time.  It was the train.  And she believed in going in the drawing room, and she and her daughter travelled together all the time.  So they only needed two other people.
Story_ID: 244557
Speaker 1: And growing up I would listen to my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] and her friends.  They talked all the time about the topic of the day, like Communists and prejudice and whatever.  And I would listen.  So at twelve years old, instead of out playing, I was always listening and trying to figure out how to be helpful in helping African Americans to survive.  And so I was always around listening to what the older people were talking about, especially if it was something about the topics of the day and something in growth.  I was always interested in the mind and always interested that there was a--that whatever the problem was, that it could be solved, see.  I never believed that things had to stand still.  And I would hear my aunt speaking about how the African American male would go into war and fight to save the country, United States, and then come back and wouldn't be able to get a decent job or treated as a first class citizen.  And I would listen and listen and then I would say--I always spoke up.  I'd say, "Well, why should they go?"  I said, "Why won't they refuse to go to war if they're treated like that."  And my aunt said, "Well, they have to go."  And I'll say, "Well--" I said, "well, why don't they refuse to go?"  My aunt said, "Well, because they'll put 'em in jail."  And I said, "Well, what difference does it make if they go to jail?"  You understand, I was young and a kid.  I didn't realize that they may be beaten or even lynched.  They were lynching in that day.  I didn't realize that.  I just thought that they could refuse to go.  And she explained that to me.  Then I began to think--and there wasn't colleges.  There was the black colleges [HBCUs], but then, in that day, most African American didn't have the money.  They were just trying to survive.  They didn't have the money to send their children to college because they would have, they were mostly in the South or somewhere and we were in Chicago [Illinois], you see.  So, I began to study, and I asked my aunt all kind of questions like--I was trying to figure out, why were the Caucasians so mean, and why were they seem to be so smart?  And I know it was from being educated, and some were born into financially secure homes and in educational home and socially accepted.  And then I looked around and, of course, we lived well, and then their friends lived well.  But then there were so many poor people or people that couldn't function as they should because of lack of education and lack of funds to do that.  And so I was thinking, "Well, will we have to wait hundreds of years through growth?"  I said, "Well that isn't fair," I said to my aunt.  I said, "Well, I want to think of some way to help African Americans--" and, of course, in that day well you were called colored or Negro, "--to survive and have some of the better things in life in an honest way."  And so I said, "Well, wonder what is the difference between the African Americans and a Caucasian other than color?"
Story_ID: 244558
Speaker 1: You were talking about the difference between--you raised the question what is the difference between white and black--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I wanted to know--I knew there was a difference in the color.  And so, I asked my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] to take me to the library, and she did.  And I discovered that human beings were begotten, regardless of who you were, any--all human beings were begotten the same way.  Two people became intimate with each other.  And when the lady discovered that she was expecting, well, she came up with names and whatnot and--to name the child.  And then, at that time, it took nine months to develop a beautiful, unique human being.  And then, unless it was an unusual birth, they were all born from the same part of the body.  So then, I developed in my thinking, then, that it had nothing to do with how you were born or begotten.  I decided that, after a while of research, that it was the caste system and society that set up the rules and regulations and dos and don'ts around the world.  And then I began to think--what could change that so that we would be recognized?  And yet, and still, we didn't have the money to go to college to get an education.  I figured that--I was reading that, in slavery, there was some Negros or colored or whatever that taught themselves.  So, I figured that we had libraries and whatever, and we could teach ourselves and speak better and learn to be a better person.  And I thought, well, now how would we do that?  And I kept searching and searching and doing research, and I found out that class, style, and refinement, and especially class, would turn the heads of kings and queens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I began to work on that.
Speaker 1: All right, now, when you were in school, what was your favorite subject in school?  Did you, did you--
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did that help you sort of research these topics out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that helped, um-um.  But I relied a lot on the library.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--what, what library did you go to in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I done forgot the name.  It's been so long ago.
Speaker 1: I think I know.  I, okay, I forgot the name, too.  I think it's the one that--
Speaker 2: Well, I did research not only library, wherever I could.  And I was always a great listener.  And in and out of our house came prominent people.  And they were always discussing.  And even after I grew up and got older I went to Hot Springs [Arkansas], not to take the bath, I didn't have--I was a young person.  I went six years straight, because at that time it was the only place that African Americans, or Negros, or whatever we were called, could go to a resort.  No matter how much money you had--that was like in the '40s [1940s]--no matter how much money you had or whatever or how much education, you--there was no place you could go.  It was prejudiced, except Hot Springs.  And that was only about two blocks.  They had two hotels there.  I've forgotten the name of one, the one where we shopped (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 244559
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Keith School [Chicago, Illinois].  And what other grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, now let me see.  I went to [Frances] Willard [School, Chicago, Illinois], that's the elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other elementary schools?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I did, but I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you went to Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then when you went to Hyde Park there weren't many black students, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What was it like and were there any teachers there that really helped you and influenced you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.  I never had a big problem with prejudice.  If I did, I ignored it.  See, I always knew how to get around it.  See, I can from a classy family, see, a classy family.  And I ignored ugliness.  See, my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] never raised her voice.  She never got mixed up--if they fussed or argued, I never heard them, my aunt and my uncle, my Uncle Lloyd and my Aunt Mary, you see.  And we had a loving home.  And, and I guess she was always teaching me discipline, you see.  Because when she would say, "Didn't Auntie--?"  She always referred to herself as Auntie.  She never was-"Didn't I tell you!"  No, always pleasant.  "Didn't Auntie tell you?  Did you forget?"  And then she was not mean.  I'd cry and carry on, and she'd allow me until--she called it ventilating.  She says, "Auntie knows how you feel."  But she says, "Auntie do not have all of the answers.  But I've lived longer than you.  I have more experience than you, and," she says, "and I'm responsible for you.  And you're going to be a classy, refined lady.  That's what you're going to develop into."
Story_ID: 244560
Speaker 1: When you were coming up, what were--I don't want to make this too general--but what were people like in the black community?  I mean were they--did you--was there, was--
Speaker 2: Most of them worked for Caucasian people in their home.  And I imagine they were imitating them, because everybody had nice homes.  And I guess it--that we, that I was connected with, see.  And as I said my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] was an Elk [The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks], and they were always going on--well, once a year at least--on trips.  And they travelled by train, and it was a drawing room.  They only needed two people.  I think it was four to a drawing room.  And I was always learning something, because my aunt would say, when they were searching for these two people--her daughter, and her daughter was named Bernice [ph.].  They were searching for these two people, my aunt would say, "Well, we can't ask Ms. Jones, because she's a troublemaker," and then she'd name someone else, and she would say, "and they're deadbeats; they don't want to pay their share," and on and on.  And then I always would speak up.  And I said, "Well, Auntie, I thought you liked Ms. Jones."  And she says, "I do."  I said, "Well, you, you're talking about her."  And I said--and she said, "Yeah."  I said, "Well then--" I always had the big mouth--I said, "Well then, you're two-faced then, right?" And she says, "No, [HistoryMaker] Maxine [Powell], I'm not two-faced."  She would explain everything.  She said, "When you go on a trip, and you've saved all year for it, you want to invite people, or you want to be around people who are pleasant and who are honest and who know how to relax and responsible and do what they're supposed to do.  Ms. Jones talks about people, and she seems to enjoy arguments and confusement.  So you don't invite people of that caliber on a trip.  If you've saved up all year for the trip, you've got your wardrobe together like you think you like it, you're going to enjoy yourself, so you don't invite those kind of people along."  So she always explained, then I knew.  But I would definitely ask.
Story_ID: 244561
Speaker 1: How did people in the black community conduct themselves when you were growing up as opposed to now?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I know we had a lot of people--they came up from the country in those days, from farms and so forth.  But how did they rank in terms of how they--did they respect elders?  How did they treat one another?  I mean, what was the general state of our people, in terms of how they treated one another and how they acted, you know, as opposed to today?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, the ones I were around, they treated each other kind, looked out for each other.  In other words, we kids would be doing things that were not kosher.  Maybe we would--they call it sassing that day--when you talk back.  And maybe we would sass someone.  Maybe we were doing something that we shouldn't do.  I don't know what it would be--maybe with a Crayola or something, marking on somebody's house or marking on, in front of somebody's house trying to make a hop scotch or something--I don't know, well, whatever we were doing.  And, and they would tell our parents.  And then they would speak to us about it.  And by the time we got home my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] already knew what I had been doing.  And, and we went to church on Sunday and stayed all day.  And I think we went to something, B-Y-P-U [Baptist Young People's Union (BYPU)], through the week, and we went to a prayer meeting or something--I don't know what day.  But we were always in church.  And so you were always around people that were talking positively in many ways.  And most of them worked as a domestic worker, giving service.  And they would come home and act like they'd see their--the madam or, or their--whoever their boss was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you're saying that black woman--there was, a lot of the women and I guess some of the men, too, no matter where they came from, if--once they got to Chicago [Illinois] they would work for well-to-do whites and come back and imitate--
Speaker 2: Well, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, or whatever job they had.  Some of them were maintenance people or some of them were janitors or whatever you'd call 'em or whatnot, because they didn't have a lot of education.  'Course, some worked in a grocery store or whatever, whatever they were doing.  They tried to act like--because the Caucasian people had the business, and they seemed to try to act like and try--and then some of them were nannies and so they tried to rear their children in that way.

Speaker 1: --You see, my aunt [Mary James Lloyd]--they lived well because--like they're wearing beaded dresses today.  My aunt, when I was seven years old, had beaded dresses--not sequin, beaded dresses.  And they wore large hats with them.  And I remember those hats were twenty-five dollars, and that was a lot of money when I was seven years old, you see.  And they just lived beautifully, I thought.  And--but then there were quite a number of black people who did not know how to live, evidently, because we moved often--every ten or twelve years--because the landlord and then the people--they would destroy the neighborhood or let it run down or whatnot.  They didn't own the building, you see.  So I find that--they doing that same thing today.  And all the while I lived in Chicago [Illinois] I was all, we were always moving, as I say every nine or ten years.  It would look just like we came from, where we came from.
Speaker 2: So do you think it was like a lack of home training maybe, or it's just, I guess, a lack of exposure to--
Speaker 1: No, I just think it's self-destructive.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, because of the ugliness that was imposed on them.  It was easy to be ugly to each other.  They're afraid to be ugly to the people that was imposing their ugliness on them, because then they would get lynched or lose their job or whatever.
Speaker 2: So it's almost like venting then, like you were saying, venting, but we would vent on each other rather than on those who really were--
Speaker 1: Well, we do that today, you see.  If something goes wrong--the lights are not working on a street, or this is not happening and whatnot.  Instead of taking off from work and going to the city hall and protesting and finding a person who was more or less could be a diplomat or whatever and let them speak for them, they all go down and holler and scream, and they aren't doing anything but ventilating, because they don't get any answers or any promises.  And they do that today.  Only thing they do it in a more organized way--they protest.  So, they walk around with signs now and protest and walk up and down.  That's some improvement.

Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], were you involved in high school clubs and high school activities and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not that much.  You know, I was always getting home so I could study, and so I could write, and so that I could do someone's hair and try to give a manicure, and I was always into beautifying and then a nice little hustler, too, because I would go around and pick up bottles and whatnot.  And, you see, when I ended up eighteen years old, I had five hundred dollars, you see, because I--
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money for those days.
Speaker 2: That's a lot of money, yeah, but I always believed that--I was always solving problems.  I just didn't believe I had to stand still because the caste system said so.  See, I had already checked that there's no difference in the races, see, in how they were begotten.  It's a difference in how they're trained and their environment, see.  And I teach that today.  I'll tell my people, I'll ask 'em, "Who are you?"  And they'll tell me their name, you see.  And I'll say, "That's not who you are.  Someone gave you that name."  And they'll look at me strangely.  And I'll say, "Well, when your mother found out she was expecting, she and your father and maybe other relatives and friends discussed you being born, and they came up with different names that would be befitting for this beautiful, unique human being that was gonna be born into the world."  And I said, "So you see someone gave you the name.  You have to make the name outstanding," see.  So, from my research and being with, and being reared by my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] I knew those things, see.  So all I do as--it's called the [HistoryMaker] Maxine Powell System--is, I teach all of these things today, which is opening people's mind.
Story_ID: 244564
Speaker 1: Were you thinking about going to college when you graduated?
Speaker 2: No, I was--they didn't mention college or anything like that, and I was always so far ahead of solving problems and whatnot, I don't think they even thought I needed to go to school too much (laughter).  You know, they thought I was smart.  I was brilliant.  And so I was always solving problems.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your aunt [Mary James Lloyd] and uncle didn't really think about sending you to college or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, they never mentioned that.
Speaker 1: Did, did either one of them go to college?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, so when you, when you graduated from high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know about my uncle.  He may have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He may have.  But I didn't think my aunt--but they, but they weren't--they didn't speak poor English, none of them.  They were well-livers and I think in the South that they had some kind of land or something or whatever--you know, the family, the James family.  I think they were one of the fortunate one that--they, they knew their place, but they always lived well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--so did, did you--what did you want to do when you were about ready to graduate?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be an actress, see.  So when I was fourteen years old, I went to Baron James [James Baron] in Chicago [Illinois], and he had a drama studio, and I told him, all my life, I'd wanted to be an actress.  And one of my favorite actress was Billie Davis, I mean Bette Davis.  I loved to play character parts, because I thought it was more of a challenge.  I had--did play straight parts.  And, of course, he listened to me.  His name was James Baron, and he said to me, "Well, [HistoryMaker] Maxine [Powell], you have a high voice.  And by the time it reaches the audience's ears, it's gonna sound like a bad record."  Oh, I was crushed.  Oh, I felt so bad.  He said, "But I can help you."  And I perked up--"You can?"  And listened.  And he said, "If you will come to my studio for a half an hour, Monday through Friday, I will help you develop your voice to the third register."  And I said, "The third register--what would that be?"  And he said, "Do re mi, mi, do re mi.  I'll have you speaking, singing in do re mi, mi, mi, the third register."  For eight years, eight long years, I was in Mr. Baron's studio for a half an hour, unless I had a cold.  And I spoke in the third register and was one of the top model--one of the top actress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I used to try to dance, and I was in--known all over the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] as an actress, a dramatic reader, I pantomimed, and they presented me in two one-woman show while I was there.  I don't know how I got mixed up here (laughter), 'cause I was already--
Speaker 1: So, you had a one-woman show and--
Speaker 2: Yes, two.  Yeah, because I was--I would do one act plays and pantomime and put it together like I do today.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what was the name of your shows?  I mean, did--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the shows was--I done forgot.  But we even appeared downtown in Chicago, Chicago Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], and that was unusual.
Story_ID: 244565
Speaker 1: So you mounted two one-woman shows.  Can you think of the name of any, of either one?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just 'An Evening with Maxine Powell.'
Speaker 1: Okay, good. Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I--and if I pantomimed I was telling a story.  I was--I had a job where I worked in an office somewhere.  But I had a little girl--I guess it was a little girl.  And when I came home in the evening, I would greet her.  Well, all this is--I'm pantomiming.  And I would greet her and then this one particular evening, I--she evidently was sick, and I came and picked her up and kissed her and was throwing her up in the air and playing with her and whatnot, and all of a sudden, I could see something was wrong with her.  And then I began to get very concerned and call 911 or call somebody--I don't know it was the 911, but whatever you did in that day for an emergency or whatnot.  And I know I was performing for a group.  And they went and got a doll, you see, and tried to hand it to me, and I wouldn't take it, because I wouldn't be doing my job if you couldn't follow me.  I wouldn't have to have a doll, 'cause then you would know it was a baby or whatever, you see.  So I always wanted to do what I was supposed to do and master it.  And I didn't feel bad if I didn't master it.  I figured it'd do something else, you know, because I figured I think everybody is qualified and everybody is--can be great.  We're born to be great in some way.  Some people--and everybody is somebody, see.  Because I don't care how much money you have or what color you are or where you're from, everybody came into the world helpless and innocent--couldn't walk, couldn't talk, couldn't take care of your toilet where, toilet, or any kind of way, see, regardless of who you were.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: See, and then I always thought that, as I said today, allow me to help you unmask and discover what a beautiful, unique human being you are, because is somebody and everybody was born to be great in some way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some people live a lifetime and never find out who they are or who great they can be.  You don't have to be number one, you can be two, three, or four, long as you're great in your field in whatever you do and you master it, not among your race, but around the world with anybody.  That's what I teach today.
Story_ID: 244566
Speaker 1: James Baron was your teacher then, right?  In terms of all this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was his--
Speaker 2: And then I had a--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, but what was his background?  Can you tell us something about him?
Speaker 2: Well, I--well, I--the only thing I know about Mr. Baron is that he was a great play writer.  None of these writers today like Spike Lee and all of them touch that man with a ten-foot pole, you see.  And he wrote plays, he wrote one-act plays, he wrote all kind of skits, and then he taught, and he was a director, and he could bring the best out.  And what we did, we appeared before the [Benevolent and Protective Order of the] Elks and the Shriners [North America; Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine] as far as Gary [Indiana] and as far as Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And that was what we did.  And there wasn't enough money, so I was--all my life I was kind of surrounded with models and sculptors and dramatic readers and all of that sort of thing, you know, painters and whatever.
Story_ID: 244567
Speaker 1: You were working with the Negro Drama League under the direction of James Baron--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you had like one-woman shows and--
Speaker 2: --and this studio was--his studio was--think it was [East] 48th [Steet] and [South] Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And his wife had a beauty shop, a beauty salon, in the front, and his studio was in the back--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the building.
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the other people that were with you in those days that--
Speaker 2: Emily McIntyre [ph.], John--I'll have to get their names.  Johnny and--he was a good actor.  But he was in the real estate business.  And then there were--oh there was a group of 'em, I have to think of their name.
Speaker 1: Did you know [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon by any chance?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or, let's see, I'm trying to think of who else--
Speaker 2: And Emily will remember a lot of their names.
Speaker 1: Did you know Sammy Dyer in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was my teacher.  I was in--as I was telling you, I used to dance, and he was my teacher, Sammy Dyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to try to dance for a living.  But I didn't like the travelling.  And I didn't like how they had to live, you know.  I came out of different type of family, and here they're cooking on a hot plate, on the road, and things were so prejudiced and all of that, you know.  I liked acting.  And I liked dancing.  I did exotic dancing--not shake dancing--but he showed me how to do--it was more like a showgirl, beautiful costumes and all of that.  And I didn't like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, did you ever perform--
Speaker 2: Well, I travelled on the road and everything, and I didn't like it--
Speaker 1: Did you per--
Speaker 2: And at clubs, and at top clubs you'd have to--the owners would want you to go and sit with old men, and all of that.  And I thought that was ridiculous, you see.  So, a lot of things I didn't like about it, and I'd figured I could do better.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I didn't have to do that.
Speaker 1: So did you ever perform at the Club DeLisa in Chicago [Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah!  I was at the Club DeLisa for a while, 'til they found out how young I was and put me out (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were too young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was too young, yeah!
Speaker 1: So you were performing in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know whether, where I was, but I was also doing something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, always doing something.  But anyway I know that, I know that they put me out (laughter).  I know I had gotten a job there (laughter), and I think Earl Hines was playing then.
Speaker 1: Earl ["Fatha"] Hines, "Fatha" Hines, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: "Fatha" Hines (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could get in in any place.
Speaker 1: And where else--did you perform at the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] at all or--
Speaker 2: No, I never performed there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there.  We didn't live too far from there--429 East 48th Street.  I went to Madam [C.J.] Walker's--I went to the cosmetology school under the directions of Madam Walker's sister, which was right there next door to the Regal, upstairs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to round out my work.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But also, I wasn't doing what I'm doing now, you know.  I was known as an actress in Chicago.
Story_ID: 244568
Speaker 1: --And then I had an adopted family.  When my aunt [Mary James Lloyd] passed, then--
Speaker 2: When did your aunt die?  Did she die when you were in high school [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Did she pass when you were in high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that must have been kind of tough then, right?  You know, 'cause you didn't have that many family members, but--
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it was tough.  I've just always been a person that could make it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.  I don't know--she died--that's been so long ago.  I think she died--I don't really remember the year.  But--
Speaker 2: So did you still live there in the same place--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  My uncle had died before that, and then she died.  No, that's what I was telling you.  My first apartment was there on South Parkway [Martin Luther King Drive].  It's a church.  I don't know if it's--I think it's [East] 49th Street or [East] 48th Street.  That church is still there, I think, on the corner.  And as I said earlier they--the nuns lived there.  And so they developed it into an apartment.  I guess that needed the money or something, you know.  And my girlfriend and I took an apartment there.  And there was a group, two sisters, Lois Parham [ph.] and Ruth Nemo [ph.], and they're--they were in the millinery business.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they lived 4806 [South] Vincennes [Avenue] Chicago, Illinois]--I remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they sold hats, and Lois was a genius in making hats.  She could do anything with her hands.  And they had a gift shop, and they made rugs, and they made beaded bags.  They beaded them from the little seed b-, beans, you know, one at a time.  When you're talking about a gift shop, they really had a gift shop.  And like they make the shawls out of wool, Lois could make the fringe this long, see, and it would be--'cause I came here with one.  And make it in beige and it would be--you use it as a wrap because it would be so wide.  You put it around your shoulders, and it come all the way down here, and that fringe hung like this.  And she'd make those--what is considered fringe--out of the wool, you know, just beautiful.  They had that kind of place.  And they had hats--two rooms of hats.  And they had it set up like a hat store.  And they had dollar hats, two dollar hats, three dollar hats, five dollar hats.  And they could make you a hat for twenty-five dollars and make money, long as it wasn't fur or beaded.  And I bought--and there was a Jewish man, was two of them that came in the Negro neighborhood and sold hats, sold slips, like underpinnings, satin-backed crepe, full of lace.  They'd charge a fortune, but you could pay for it, you know, two dollars a week or a dollar a week or something like that, you pay so much down.  And then there was another one, and he sold coats, not cashmere, but the cashmere color with a fur collar.  And they, too, they'd hustle up and down the street there.  And they--and we were their customers.  And so these two black ladies, Ruth and Lois, we went over and bought a hat, different hat we wore every week, and Lois bought three grades, four grades of veiling and four grades of flowers.  And so with this dollar hat, she could dress it up by taking so much--she was so talented--of the veiling and maybe a flower or whatever was necessary to enhance it, and hold it up, and then--at the hat--and then you could see how it looked, and she would then tell you how much it cost.
Story_ID: 244569
Speaker 1: --I never had no steady job.  I would try to learn different things and quit.  I always had a little money on the side, see.  And I could do--and then for--to be an actress, I didn't, I couldn't have a job, to study like that and to practice and whatnot.  I would take--I think I had a, for a while, a job, and it was called personal maid.  But I was doing the same thing.  This rich, rich lady married a very--she's Caucasian--a very rich man.  And his family disowned him, because she was the type that worked.  She was a person that worked in--they used to have like a coffee shop where they sold coffee, and you would go in and get it ground and eggs and cheese and things like that.  So she worked in this shop.  And then she would go--they had a place, like we had the Graystone [Ballroom, Detroit, Michigan] here--I don't know the name of the ballroom.  But she would--and her girlfriend--would go to this ballroom and dance, you know.  And like we went to the Savoy [Ballroom, Chicago, Illinois]--what was that on South Parkway [Martin Luther King Drive].
Speaker 2: I think it was the Savoy.
Speaker 1: Was it the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois]?  What was it?  The Regal was a theater.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But they had a ballroom there.  Savoy?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, anyway, that's where we would go.  Well, they had a place on the North Side in--
Speaker 2: In the Aragon [Ballroom, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I think so.  And the whites--no blacks--the whites would go there.  And that's where she met this fellow, you know, and he was rich.  And he married her.  And she had one daughter, Kay [ph.].  And I went in, and naturally, she didn't know by that time, I knew how to set table, you know, and how to do all those things and what not.  And I went in and you were called a personal maid, see.  I didn't do no housework, but I pressed her dresses and showed her how to dress and how to entertain.  And then I got all--she didn't allow her daughter to wear a dress but one time, that sort of thing, you know, to an affair.  So I got all of Kay's dresses.  I couldn't wear her shoes.  My feet were too large (laughter).
Speaker 2: So as a maid in this situation, you were actually instructing your, your boss.
Speaker 1: I, yeah, I know, but I'm telling you at that time you could not be called a finishing instructor.  That's what I really am.  I--and they called them personal maids, see.  Personal maid--that had nothing to do with the housework, you see.  So then when she would have company, I would--we'd serve the food--not family style--and I--
Speaker 2: Buffet style?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, they didn't have nothing like that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Too classy for that (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: That's stand--that's like a soup line, this buffet, standing in line.  Nobody did that, nothing like that, you know, at that time.  And I would wear a plain black--see I didn't have to do such things.  See, I had no children or whatever.  And I could quit anytime if I had took a job to learn something.  I could quit anytime I got ready.  And I didn't allow anybody to talk to me ugly.  And I didn't talk to them ugly, see.  So Mrs.--she loved me.  And they would go to Florida every year, and she'd pay me.  I worked three days, but not all the time.  And most of the time, when I met her I worked three days.  Now when he went hunting, I would go with her--she liked to go to the walkathon--some things you just don't get out of people, you know what I mean?  And she couldn't do it until he went hunting.  He and his buddies would go hunting.  And so she--and she'd take me to go with--I'd go with her.  And then when they went to Florida, she always paid me for those three days; otherwise, I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be there when she got back.
Story_ID: 244570
Speaker 1: When she would have company, and she had prominent people, see.  She had the couple--Jewish--they, they owned and the rye bread, the rye, yeah.  What was the name of that bread?  Oh, I can't think of it.  But anyway they owned this company and they were Jewish so was rye, rye bread.
Speaker 2: They, oh, they made rye bread, you say?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.  I can't think of the name.
Speaker 2: Wasn't Heinemann's [Bakeries], not Heinemann, was it?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I might have been.  I'll think of it.  It'll come to me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, you know, even if I have to write in to you all, I'll be in and out of there, and I'll, you know, bring you up to date on different things and drop off things when I come.  But--and she was kind of prejudiced.  But Mrs. Sterling [ph.] wasn't.  And I wore a black dress, and then I hired two other people to help me.  We had somebody in the kitchen washing the dishes, 'cause they didn't have a dishwasher.  And I don't know if Ms. Sterling had cooked the food herself or had--'cause she--I don't think she had a cook, you know.  If she did, it would just be for special occasion.  And I wore a plain black dress--no, no uniform--plain black dress, a bracelet, but one that didn't, you know, hit together and make noise or whatever, and a little imitation pearls, see.  Nails done, you know, 'cause I was an actress.  And, and then I did the serving.  Now whoever I hired followed me.  We'd have the formal dinner, you see, where no food's on the table.  I always wanted her to be outstanding, you see, more than they were.  They--and so we'd serve the food.  I always served the meat.  That was the main dish, you know.  And then they would bring the rest of the food, you know, behind me, two other people with vegetables and whatever and salad and all that, you know.  We--I'd put it together right.  And I remember once that that, that Mrs. Piper [ph.], she was kind of--I'm holding the meat platter, and she's busy talking to whoever she had sitting next to her.  And I stood there for, you know, a second or two or so, and she ignored me and I just went on.  I was that kind--went on to the next person.  Well, Mrs. Sterling learned how to be a gracious hostess as like in Washington [D.C.].  In Washington, they said that as many congresswomen and senator wives, but there were only two or three that you'd fight to get an invitation, 'cause they were so gracious.  They knew how to be a hostess.  Because in the first place, you're watching everything, but you're smiling.  You don't, you know--and everybody follows what you do.  And that's a great hostess.  And so anyway Mrs. Sterling would--and I served everybody and took the plate back, took the platter back into the kitchen.  They--to keep it warm and then bring it out again, you see.  And she came back and she said, "Mrs. Sterling doesn't have any meat."  And I said, "Well, you saw me stand there, and she ignored me."  She says, "Well, serve her."  And I did.  She--'cause if she'd have been ugly to me, I'd have walked out.  And that's what I would do--walk out.  And--if they were ugly to me.  And so anyway, 'cause I was never ugly to them.  I always thought that they needed me, and I needed them.  They were rich, and they needed somebody to help him in whatever they needed, and I needed the money.  I figured if I was rich as they, I would have somebody.  That's the way I was taught, to come in and help me.  So I didn't take no stuff, and I was always class and a lady.  And that's what I expected from them.  And I didn't have, you know, I didn't have to be there.  So anyway I did.  I wasn't ugly.  I just took a plate back, took the platter back, and she took some food that time (laughter).  She took the meat.
Story_ID: 244571
Speaker 1: You did this kind of [personal maid] work up until--I know you didn't come to Detroit [Michigan] until '45 [1945], right?
Speaker 2: No, but anyway--but I didn't always do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing many things.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, acting--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember I had a job in a pickle factory.  And I think I made eleven dollars, and I learned that.  And then there was a time I had a job in a date factory.  And I found out that those dates was as dirty as they can be, and that they--and that when you go to shop and buy dates, the same dates, and they put 'em in a fancy box, you know what I mean, and charge more.  And I learned all those things.  Then I'd quit.  And so I had many little jobs that if I wanted to do something extra--that was before I met Mrs. Sterling [ph.], you see.  But then after I met her and became her personal maid--I pressed all her clothes and showed her how to live and what to do on a classy way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long--
Speaker 2: And they were called, in that day, personal maids.
Speaker 1: So how long did you work for her?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember.  It's so long ago.  A long time, you know, until I didn't need to work, I guess, anymore or something--
Story_ID: 244572
Speaker 1: When did you start getting involved in fashion shows and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did that--well, I was the--I modeled my--Lois [Parham (ph.)]--I didn't tell you how I got adopted.  You want to hear that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: By them.  I got off.  I--
Speaker 1: Oh, by the Parhams--
Speaker 2: Yeah, by the Parhams.
Speaker 1: Lois Parham--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and Ruth Nemo [ph.].
Speaker 2: And Lois and Ruth.  Well, from buying those hats--and everybody came, you know, all the lawyers' wives and the doctors and the undertakers and the teachers and, and--what do they call 'em--case, case workers--what do you call 'em?
Speaker 1: Social workers?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Social workers?
Speaker 2: Social workers.  All those people came.  And so, anyway one day--and we came very friendly, where I would--they had, that was their mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. Bond [ph.], Parham, Mr. and Mrs. Barker [ph.] was their name.  And he was--their father was a minister--he was assistant minister in a church--and his wife--I'll think of her name.  But the girls were interested in me.  They had two daughters, which was Ruth and Lois.  And they had a son, Abiram [ph.], but he didn't live there.  He was married.  And then Ruth had--was married.  Her husband was a great guy.  And they all lived together, see.  They had like eight-room house at 49--what did I tell you--4906, I think it was, [South] Vincennes [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  They had nine rooms there.  And they all lived together--Ruth and her husband.  Lois wasn't married; she had been married.  Mr. and Mrs. Barker and Aunt--and their aunt.  So that meant six people, right, lived in the house there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Beautiful, beautiful.  Baby--not a baby grand, a grand piano, hardwood floors, oh, just fabulous, just beautiful.  And they said to me--and I came, we got friendly where we would have dinner, or I would, I've always been a person that always brought something.  And they didn't like vegetables; I didn't like vegetables.  Auntie, Aunt Viola [ph.], she cooked, see.  Nobody touched--went in her kitchen.  And their mother worked for some rich people twice a week.  And they, those two girls, sisters, had the gift shop.  And you know from that humble beginning, they became millionaires.  The wholesale house, the Jewish young man that owned it, loved them.  And they had to come at six o'clock in the morning, because they couldn't come when the customers were there, because if they did it would ruin his business, things were so prejudiced.  So he taught them, "Don't worry about that."  And they did work for Marshall Field [and Company], but Marshall Field didn't know it.  Those rich white people would want this ribbon or often this or often that, and he said to them, "I can get you that kind of work.  But you can't use your label in the hat, and you can't be known."  But they say, he said, "Money is the thing.  Long as you make the money, and you know how talented you are, see.  So you don't worry about what they think about you or what they know about you."  And those girls, two girls, together became a millionaire from that.
Story_ID: 244573
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, one day they [Lois Parham and Ruth Nemo (ph.)] looked at me--oh, I'd known them for about five years.  And I was an actress.  They had a club.  One of the outstanding--the Fashionettes was known all over Chicago [Illinois] as an outstanding group.  And I--for their teas and different affairs--and they were also a member of Olivet, Olivet Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Olivet, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the big one where--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was the big (unclear).
Speaker 2: --we have Joseph [H.] Jackson was the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--oh, yeah.  And they, they used to come to the house there.  And then finally, they moved to 429 East 48th Street.  But in the meantime, they looked at me one day, and they thought I was so smart and out on my own.  And I don't know I might have been eighteen or nineteen or something like that.  And doing such a great thing, you know what I mean.  I was an actress.  I was accepted everywhere, all over.  And so one day they say, "You know, we gonna take you over and adopt you.  You out here butting around."  And I resented that.  I said, "I'm not butting around, you know.  I'm not butting around, you know.  I live beautifully, real beautifully, you know.  I'm holding my own."  And that's when we had the--my girlfriend and I had the apartment.  I never tried to outdo anybody or to live--I always knew how I was gonna pay my bills, see.  And I always managed well.  I never overspent, see.  And I don't do that today.  I can save up.  If I need two thousand dollars or whatever I need or a hundred or whatever, I just put away five dollars, ten dollars or something.  And when I had my first apartment, with a refrigerator--I bought one the way you put a quarter in a day, and then at the end of the month, you had the payment.  I did all kind of things like that.  So I didn't know what she meant when she said butting around.  But they did adopt me.
Story_ID: 244574
Speaker 1: Well, you had just been adopted [by Lois Parham and Ruth Nemo (ph.)].
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yeah.  And this amazed me when he [sic.] said to me, "Out there butting around."  I said, "Butting around?  I'm not butting around," you know (laughter).  But anyway--and we became like sisters--close.  And they just admired me and--the whole family.  And when I took the cosmetology course under the direction of Madam [C.J.] Walker [sic.], they just had a fit.  And I took it, the course, so that I could round out my work.  'Cause I knew I was gonna be doing something of a--you can act just so long.  And I knew I'd be doing something, and I wanted to be prepared.  And I loved all my life to style hair, lift (unclear)--that's what they called it back then, then.  And I tried to give a manicure, and I would cut off every little thing.  And then when I would see whoever my customer was, I wouldn't charge them.  Maybe they'd give me something.  And I'd see 'em, "Okay, I'm gonna give you a manicure."  They'd hide their hands behind 'em.  "No, you're not gonna give me a manicure," says, "because I couldn't put my hand in water for a week after you got through with me," (laughter).  So then I knew that I had to go to school and learn how to do it without making people's fingers sore.  And so that's why I took the course.  Well, I knew I wasn't gonna do no hair.  I didn't like to do that.  And 'cause, to that--and then I--but I did love to do the manicure.  Look like it was like operating, you know what I mean?  I could shape the nails.  I did more than just put some polish on and file, you know.  I could shape the nail.  And people that were biting their nail, I stopped them from biting their nail, and all that sort of stuff.  Well, anyway, Ruth and Lois had a fit.  I often wonder, how and why did I leave all of that and come to Detroit [Michigan]?   And it might have been to get away from them, because we discussed everything at the table.  I had dinner together.  Everybody set down and had dinner.  And whatever your day was or whatever your problem was or whatever you had accomplished you would discuss it at the dinner table.  So first I joined the WACs [Women's Army Corps], and I was--and I signed up to travel abroad.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what year that you joined the WACs?
Speaker 2: I never got there, but I signed up for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: When did you sign up for it?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, I'd have to think about that a minute.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it during the war [World War II, WWII], the war itself, or was it before the war?
Speaker 2: Well, I was here when the war ended.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'd have to think about that and come back to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.  Well, you signed up for it.
Speaker 2: But I signed up.  And I was--and I signed up to go abroad and to further my education.  And they--oh, Ruth and Lois had a fit.  They were kind of snobby like.  And they said, "What?"  When they got through talking about those WACs, they were prostitutes, and I was gonna end up the worst prostitute in the country.  And we always respected each other, so then I didn't do that.  I gave that up.
Story_ID: 244575
Speaker 1: Then when I finished the cosmetics, finished the course [at Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty Culture, Chicago, Illinois], I--oh, and I said I didn't like to do hair.  I wasn't gonna do that.  But I did like a manicure, to give m--oh, they [Lois Parham and Ruth Nemo (ph.)] had a fit!  "Oh, you're gonna go up on 47th Street there and get into one of those windows and disgrace us!"  And they thought that a waitress and a manicurist were two of the cheapest professions that there was.  And so, they talked me out of that.  I didn't do that.  So I often wonder why did I leave Chicago [Illinois], where I was well established, and it might have been because I wouldn't want to embarrass them.  And I probably would have gone up there.  I wouldn't have stuck with it, but I probably would have, you know, and worked in a white shop 'cause that's what I came here and did, to see what I could do.  I was always trying out to see how good I was or what I needed to learn in whatever I did.  See, 'cause I wanted to master it.  And at that time when I was learning, I didn't think of training anybody, you see.  I was learning and mastering.  And so anyway I didn't do that.
Story_ID: 244576
Speaker 1: And, but I was so tired after taking the course [at Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty Culture, Chicago, Illinois], I said, "I'm so tired I'd like to go someplace and rest for a week."  And I read in a magazine where the Gotham Hotel was a black hotel that equaled and could hold its own with any white hotel in the City of Detroit [Michigan].  And I said to one of the girls, Ruth [Nemo (ph.)] or Lois [Parham (ph.)], "I think I'll call up--I'd never been to Detroit and it isn't too far from home here, Chicago [Illinois], and see if I can make an appointment for a week and rest up."  So I called and I talked to a Mr. [W.H. "Bob"] Robinson who was the manager.  And I never dreamed that I would ever get to really know him and meet him.  And he--I asked him if I could register for a week, and he said, no they were too busy.  He could put me up for a couple of days.  And I said, "Well, okay, I'll take that."  So when I came, I came in the lobby, and it was full of men.  And I registered--younger, you know, in--must have been in the '40s [1940s] 'cause I know I was sitting giving a manicure when the war [World War II, WWII] ended.  And I went upstairs, 614.  It was the largest single room that they had.  And I didn't come down.  And this might have been like on a Tuesday.  So I didn't realize that they--people were nosey and just wanted to know who was this attractive-looking person with nice luggage and everything.  They come in and haven't, and haven't been seen since.  So, they called up on Saturday and pretended that they were concerned about me.  They hadn't seen me.  And what they were doing was being nosey, because the bellman was bringing me food.  And I fell for that.  I thought, "Well, what a different than Chicago," you know.  So I came down--had a dining room in the Gotham Hotel called the Ebony [dining] room.  And it was second to none--no greasy spoon.  And I dressed and came down.  I waited forty-five minutes to be seated.  They were just that busy.  And the people that were coming from outside of the hotel, they were doctors, lawyers, or whatever, coming from church in fours and six and eights and ten.  And finally after forty-five minutes, the maitre d'--he was in, wearing a tux--it was really classy.  And he--the hotel was classy.  And he came, he came to me, and he said, "You know, I really feel bad that I've kept you waiting so long."  He said, "But you can see I've had no seating for one.  Said you can see how they're coming in, four, six, eights, and ten."  He says, "But there's a lady that lives in the hotel--she's a very nice lady--and I asked her if I could seat you with her.  And she said, 'yes.'  So now if it's all right with you, I can seat you right now."  And I said, "Oh, I would be delighted."  So then I did.  And it was a nice-looking brown-skinned lady.  And to make a long story short, she turned out to be the niece of one of the top funeral homes here, Stinson Funeral Home [Stinson Funeral Homes, Detroit, Michigan].  And she was getting a divorce, so that's why she was living in the hotel.  Her name was Leila King [ph.].  And she wanted to know how did I happen to come to Detroit, and I was telling her that I lived in Chicago and all of my doings and whatnot, and I had just finished a course in cosmetology at the--under the direction of Madam [C.J.] Walker [sic.], and that I didn't like to do hair.  I didn't intend to have a beauty salon or anything like that.  But I did like to give a manicure--
Story_ID: 244577
Speaker 1: And she [Leila King (ph.)] said, "Well, you--oh, well, fine.  Then you can give my boyfriend a manicure."  And I said, "Oh, no, I couldn't do anything like that."  I said, "I didn't bring any tools and I came to rest."  And she says, "Well, what do you need?"  And I named about seven or eight things.  And she said, "Well, that's no problem, she said because my boyfriend owns the drugstore."  So I'm in a pickle (laughter).  Here this nice lady has allowed me to join her, and then I said--so she says, "And where are you in the hotel [Gotham Hotel, Detroit, Michigan]?  What floor are you on?"  I said, "I'm on six, 614."  She said, "What a coincidence!"  She said, "I'm right across the hall from you.  I'm in 617.  I have a suite of rooms there."  So, okay, so we became friends.  And I did her boyfriend's nail.  Then the owner of the hotel, John [J.] White, wanted me to do his nails.  Well, I did his nails.  Then he had a partner, Mr. [Irving] Roane, and I did his nails.  Aw, they buttered me up.  They never had a manicure like that before and blab, blab.  And then I massaged your hands and all, you know, the ladies up over the elbow and whatnot.  I had to be different, and I had to really soothe nerves other than just give a manicure.  And so they wanted me--they had--it was a beautiful hotel.  The florist was in the middle of the floor when you come in the lobby.  It was just absolutely beautiful.  And then to right of the lobby was the men's haberdasher.  And to the left was the lady's apparel, you know, they--blouses and all kind of jewelry and things like that.  And, and then this fabulous dining room called the Ebony [dining] room.  And so anyway they wanted me to come back and assist in running the barbershop and have a manicuring concession.  Well, I wasn't that interested.  But I stayed--they said that they couldn't put me up but for a couple of days, and I stayed ten days.  And they introduced me to everyone that was worth a quarter, see.  And I thought that everybody in Detroit [Michigan] was rich, because they were money people and people that stood for something.  And I stayed ten days.  And then they called me, sometime twice a day, after I got back home [Chicago, Illinois] and just kept inviting me and inviting me, until I came.  And I was supposed to come and stay two months, three at the most.  And that's how I got here.  And then, I lived in the hotel.  And I came out of a beautiful home that was, let's see, fifteen, thirteen or fifteen rooms.  Was it--with Ruth [Nemo (ph.)] and Lois [Parham (ph.)].  There was three bedrooms upstairs and that's where Ruth and her husband lived.  And then Lois had in the front when you come up the stairs, the front bedroom was Auntie's, Aunt Viola's [ph.], and then Lois took two rooms and knocked out one of the walls and made hers huge, you know, like a master bedroom.  And then there was two others and--two other bedrooms 'cause it was a large place.  They bought that building.  And everybody lived together.  And so that's why they could live so beautifully, 'cause each family didn't go out and get an apartment or whatever and buy furniture and whatnot.  So it was absolutely--Lois loved beautiful thing.  She had derigold [ph.].  I have it today.  And it--and, and they don't even make that no more.  And with this fashion--this club, they were so elegant.  The Fashionettes--it was thirteen in the, in the--no, it was sixteen in the club.  So she had, instead of twelve, sixteen of everything, you know, the finest of china and all that.  I have all of that.  And I have my own so I don't, you know, I'm scared to use it because (laughter) I don't want to--I don't know--I'm going to use it, though.
Story_ID: 244578
Speaker 1: This is about 1945 I guess, right, when you, when you went to Detroit [Michigan]?  That's what I read.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was that, well, because I know I was there when, here when the war [World War II, WWII]--must have been, because I think it ended in '45 [1945] or something like that.  But I know I was in the barbershop [at the Gotham Hotel, Detroit, Michigan] whenever, whatever year that was.  I seem to be poor at keeping up with detail, just doing, you know.  But some people say I do pretty good for my age, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: So you moved to Detroit in '45 [1945]?  Does that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I must have.  I was here, you know, and I'd been here before.
Speaker 1: And you started off doing manicures in a barbershop?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the barbershop.  That's just what I'm saying, you know.  And then I got tired and then I'd write home to Ruth [Nemo (ph.)] and Lois [Parham (ph.)].  Everything that went on--those people, the reason they called up to see how I was and whatnot 'cause they were nosey.  And it was a lot of number men, see, in the lobby.  And they were nosey and wanted to know who I was and how to get next to me and this, that, and the other.  And so, then after I gave the manicure, they found out who I was.  And then when I finally came back, you see, and, and I had more than I could do, see.  But then I would write home to Ruth and Lois all kind of things goes on in a hotel.  And I never was exposed to things like that or--and I wrote it like a play, you know, scene I, scene II, and whatnot.  And they about had a fit.  They were kind of prumish-like [sic. prudish], you know (laughter).  And they came here.  They came here once a month (laughter).  I came home once a month, 'cause I'd never been away before.  And people that knew me well, they'd say, "I didn't even know you had moved.  I never missed you," (laughter).  But I got over that after a while.  But they didn't--they kept--they just thought that--they never heard of such a thing.  Now we heard of the Jones [ph.] boys that was number men, you know, but nobody had anything to do with them.
Story_ID: 244579
Speaker 1: And then Ruth [Nemo (ph.)] and Lois [Parham (ph.)] were so high up on 'til Joe Louis and Marva [Louis Spaulding], they wouldn't--and I knew Marva, 'cause we used to model together a lot of time.  She--her father was a postal worker, and she married Joe Louis.  And she--they would have them for their club, but they would never invite 'em into their home, because they were supposed to be a different type of people.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: The amount of money he had didn't make any difference--
Speaker 1: No, no.  They were like my aunt [Mary James Lloyd].
Speaker 2: He couldn't overcome a class barrier--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's the way they were.  But yet and still, they were down to earth, you understand.  But my aunt was that way, too, you understand.  She didn't believe--but she was kind and nice to everybody.  But she believed in principle and character, you see.  And they were of a different caliber of people.  And then, that's how Ruth and Lois are.  You know, I didn't argue.  I don't push and shove with anybody.  But I'm, you know, to me all people are people.  But I do like principle and character and loyalty, those three things.  See, I don't care how much money you have or what color you are--loyalty, principle, and character.  None of us are going to be perfect, you see.  But you grow.  But you have to have something in your background to keep you from going overboard in a destructive way.
Speaker 2: Was there are a lot of prejudice in those days against darker-skinned black people?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, well, you know how we are.  We had that going.  You know, 'course in tho--in my day there were more light people than dark people, see.  Now I see more dark people.  I don't see a lot of light people.  But it was so many people that was like Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] and all of 'em.  They were so white, you know.  My aunt, my uncle was white-looking, see.  And--but I don't see a lot of that today.  And--but things were prejudiced because while I was here, they lynched Emmett, that boy, you know.
Speaker 2: Emmett Till--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was in the '50s [1950s], '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  So--and, and they were shocked over [Charles] Diggs.
Story_ID: 244580
Speaker 1: --We were friends, because [Charles] Diggs and--had all his affairs at my place of business.  And Reverend [C.L.] Franklin--and I worked with Aretha [Franklin].  We used to stand her up on a box.  I was--I joined the [Benevolent and Protective Order of the] Elks, because in 1954 Erma Henderson, who was a council, ended up the Detroit [Michigan] city council president for I think almost ten or eighteen years.  And she came to me in 1954--I had the building then.  And it was 275 East Ferry [Street], down the street from the Merrill-Palmer School [Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute for Child and Family Development, Detroit, Michigan]--that was a brilliant mind school.  It was not a rundown neighborhood; 275 Ferry always was beautiful.  Across the street from me was Fritz [Funeral Home] undertaker, and it's still there.
Speaker 2: Now how did you come to, to purchase this property and to start--
Speaker 1: Well, I, well, I opened up my school in 1951 in my apartment.  And, well, there--I was trying to get to that.  I moved out of the Gotham [Hotel, Detroit, Michigan].  I got tired of living, you know, in one room.  But in the meantime--I'm a little ahead of myself--I wanted to fix it up.  So Leila [King (ph.)] took me to a department store here called the Crowley's [Crowley Milner and Company]--it's closed now.  And I got some kind of credit there, and it's coupons or something.  You paid by the month, but you could spend them like money.  And I bought lace--I had two windows.  I bought two pairs of lace curtains, and I bought a green satin spread and two pairs of drapes.  And I tinted the--Ruth [Nemo (ph.)] and Lois [Parham (ph.)] and I were great tinters--could tint bedspreads and everything and could bring 'em out even.  And I tinted these curtains.  I wanted the room a little, a pink and green.  And the curtains were pink and the drapes were green.  It was a light shade of pink that blended with them.  And I used two of the--one pair of the drapes to drape across the top to make a flounce and the other pair to hang on each side.  And then the bathroom was small, but I wanted a dressing room.  So I asked them, I wonder if you have a little end table.  And they went and looked down in the basement, the maintenance man, and they found a table that fit into the corner of the wall, see.  So then Leila knew somebody and we found some material and had them to make a skirt to go around the--and tacked it with thumbtacks to go around to the floor, you know, and made a skirt.  And then somebody cut a glass to fit it.  And I bought a mirror and put over it.  And I fixed it up.  And that gave John [J.] White an idea.  And he sent down South and got some person that he knew to be a housekeeper, you see, and they fixed up the rooms like that, because then they could see it didn't cost that much money, you know.  So everywhere I go I'm always teaching, and--today--and learning, and leaving something, and waking people up, and making things better, see.  And so, that's what I did there.  Then I got tired of that.  And one of the number men bought a block and a half and they--of apartment buildings, apartments, and they called it Commonsville [ph.].  So this fellow that I was dating, where the Urban League [Urban League of Detroit and Southeastern Michigan] is on Warren [Avenue], 262, that was my first apartment.  And that's how I got in trouble here, because I took his apartment, and he moved in the Commonsville--that's what they named this building that this fellow had bought.  And I bought furniture, and I got stuck here.
Story_ID: 244581
Speaker 1: I stayed there [Gotham Hotel, Detroit, Michigan].  And I joined an organization.  This is--it was so beautiful.  And you must hear this.  And it's called the Zontas [Zonta International].  And there was a white Zontas, but this was a black group.  And they called their self the Zontas.  And now their function was to buy a building for youngsters and train them in growth of--and how to be a secretary or to do whatever--have many different programs there that would help them, female and male, to grow and to be prepared to move forward into the world in whatever field they wanted to.  And so they had a annual fashion show.  And the other function was to open doors for rental that was closed to blacks.  And I became the chief negotiator and entertainment director.  So, the Music Hall [Center for the Performing Arts, Detroit, Michigan] here--I don't know if you've heard of that--but that's the Music Hall, beautiful, downtown where all them dances and all kind of beautiful things are presented.  And I negotiated--it took me a year, but we did get in.  And we had our fashion show there.  And for the time we wanted it, on a Sunday, it rented for $250 and they charged us $500 to keep us out.  But we paid the $500.  And then what was so funny, Helen [ph.], the director and founder of the Zontas club ran overtime, and it was at a time when they were moving on prop instead of dropping it, you know (chuckle).  And those Caucasian fellows was taking down the prop while those girls were still modeling, you know (laughter).  I laugh at everything.  Everybody got angry, but I thought it was so funny (laughter).  And the next place was the Latin Casino, not the Latin, the Latin Quarter [Detroit, Michigan], and that's on West Grand Boulevard [sic. East Grand Boulevard] right off of Woodward [Avenue].  And it's set up like where you can have a production show--oh, just beautiful, just beautiful.  Tables on each, each--lamps on each table, and then on the side was where the tables were, it was like you'd make up, you'd come up a couple of steps, you know, and tables all along on the side of the wall all down from the entrance to the stage.
