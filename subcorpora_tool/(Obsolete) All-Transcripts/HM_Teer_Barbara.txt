Speaker 1: And lastly, your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Right on (laughter).
Story_ID: 315719
Speaker 1: We will start with your history, your ancestors.  Can you talk to me about your mother?  Your--what was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was/is Lila Benjamin Teer.  My father's name was/is--notice I say, was/is, Fred Lewis Teer.  There were, on my father's side--and I was born in East St. Louis, Illinois.  So, it wasn't Missouri, but it's--East St. Louis and St. Louis [Missouri] are just like New Jersey and New York.  But my father's side was born and reared in East St. Louis.  So, my grandfather [Cornelius Teer], who was a 33rd Degree Mason, and he never got out of the second grade.  My grandmother [Lottie Teer] was a school teacher and she taught school.  Now they were born in Shuqualak, Mississippi actually.  And during a very heated race riot kind of thing, they came to St. Louis, East St. Louis.  You need to know that East St. Louis, in 1917, had the worst race riot in the history of this country.  And my father was born in 1912.  So, my grandfather was very active in that activity.  Let's call it activity for lack of a better word.  Now, my mother and my father met in college.  They both went to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and back then, that was a big thing.  There were five children in my father's side.  And all of them went to college 'cause my father graduated first.  And then, he worked his way to let the other four come to college.  My mother was an only child, and she was born in Chicago [Illinois], but her mother [Mary Benjamin] and her father [Howard Benjamin] were born in Bolivar, Mississippi [sic. Bolivar, Tennessee].  So, they moved to Chicago when my mother was like three or four.  Interesting thing about that side of my family is my mother's mother worked for the third richest family in Chicago, the Chichesters [ph.].  So, my mother was brought up in an environment of opulence and wealth, even though she was my mother's [sic. grandmother's] child (laughter).  And my grandmother lived with the Chichesters, and they bought my mother's--my grandmother's first house in Chicago.  And my mother went to college because they supported her, et cetera, et cetera, so that's an interesting mix.  She went to high school in Chicago.  My mother also was the roommate of [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, who was a very famous, you know, woman of--well, the world, and she lives in East St. Louis--Katherine Dunham.  She's ninety-six now.  So, my mother and father married right out of college, and my mother moved to St. Louis, East St. Louis, with my father.  Her mother came to East St. Louis by herself, and looked around and said, "Now, this is my only child.  Y'all better take care of her, but if you don't like anything she does, put her on a train, and send her back home."  That's the nature with which I grew up in.  So, I have one sister [Frederica Lila Teer] who died in '79 [1979].  I named this block on this corner after her.  And my mother was a very powerful leader in East St. Louis in the educational field.  She started the community branch of the college, Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois].  My father was an educator.  He was a politician, and he had his own printing press, and he did his own newspaper.  He was very, very popular.  He was a coach in my hometown.  He coached track and basketball.  Now, I can go on about my family forever because they were activists.  And everybody's grandmother was living in my house at one time or other.  My house was built by my father and my grandfather, and I am going to memorialize it very, very soon.  My father played tennis.  He was a tennis champion.  He played bridge.  He roller skated.  He--my father did everything.  He was a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity]; very, very clear about his roots and his culture.

Speaker 1: I don't know if I need to say anymore except I graduated from high school when I was fifteen.  And I went to an all-black high school because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you give me the name of the high school?
Speaker 1: Lincoln High School [East St. Louis Lincoln High School] in East St. Louis, Illinois.  I went to all-black schools.  And the joke is I never saw white people until I was fifteen (laughter).  Well, of course, we saw the people that came to collect the insurance and stuff like that.  But East St. Louis was basically an all-black town.  So, my education was quality because my teachers loved their work.  And, of course, my father [Fred Teer], being a school teacher and a principal, I got a lot of special treatment.  I was very clearly blessed.  And when I graduated from high school--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Now, I don't remember, 19-, whoo, it's either, it's either '54 [1954] or '55 [1955], I'm not sure.  But the fact of the matter is--I think it was--anyway, when I graduated, they had a meeting--my mom [Lila Benjamin Teer], my sister [Frederica Lila Teer], and my dad to decide where I was going to college 'cause everybody graduated from the University of Illinois in Urbana [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  I was a very energetic, joyous person (laughter).  And they wanted me to have some culture other than your culture.  So, they decided to send me to Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina].  And Bennett College, at that time, was called the Negro Vassar of the South.  So, everybody took me down there, and I lasted for only one year.  I couldn't stand it.  The president of the college used to call me in for running.  We had to wear long white gloves to events.  I never--when, when Vassar College [Poughkeepsie, New York] came, 'cause they were our sister school, they all had on jeans and dungarees and cigarettes hanging out of their mouths.  And we were sitting there, like little ladies with long gloves and were--it didn't work, it didn't work.  So, I went to the University of Illinois--I transferred.  And my instructor there at Bennett wanted my family to let me major in dance, because they thought I was exceptionally gifted.  Well, that was a big thing because, you know, you don't major in no dance.  So, I was allowed to do that.  I went to five universities with my mentor and my--I was a protegee of the woman who invented the distinction, modern dance.  Her name is Mary Wigman.  She's in theater, of course, and she's in Berlin [Germany], she lived in Berlin.
Story_ID: 315721
Speaker 1: So, when I graduated, summa cum [summa cum laude], from the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I was shipped off to Europe.  And I studied there with everybody you can think of because of who I was within the dance profession.  Now, I left Europe after Switzerland, and London [England], and, and the whole thing.  Now, I came to New York [New York] to work on my master's [degree] at Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York].  But I was bored with school because I never saw anything that represented where I came from.  It was a different, a different kind of culture.  And I did well.  However, when Pearl Primus came to the University of Illinois with her drummers, and her husband was Percival Borde.  All these people are probably dead now--I mean, they're not probably--they are.  There were five hundred young women in this gym for this master class of Pearl Bailey--I mean, Pearl, Pearl Primus.  Actually, I work with Pearl Bailey.  And she started playing the drums, and I just went crazy.  And everybody else didn't know what was happening and I did, and I said, oh, I have to go somewhere and do what my heart is pumping.  So, I went to Pearl Primus.  I came to New York.  I stayed at the Henry Street Playhouse [Henry Street Settlement; Henry Street Settlement, New York, New York] with Alwin Nikolais, which was, again, a derivative of Mary Wigman, Martha Graham--all those names.  I mean, I was really in that profession until I hurt my knee.  My daddy [Fred Teer] was a coach.  He came to New York to try to help me with my knee.  And I met all these wonderful actors who were in 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], and because one of the leads in 'Raisin in the Sun' came from St. Louis [Missouri].  The rest is history.  Lonne Elder [Lonne Elder III], Lorraine Hansberry, Sidney Poitier, [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks--all of these people became my friends, and my whatever.  And I left the dance profession after travelling with Alvin Ailey, and [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson, and going to Brazil.  I mean, I did a whole lot of stuff.  And then, I came into the world of theater and acting, studied with Sanford Meisner, and Philip Burton, and Paul Mann, and Lloyd Richardson.  You name it, you name it, you name it, until finally, my instructor at the time was Sanford Meisner, who was the most important acting teacher.  And, of course, at that time, everybody was talking about Stanislavski [Konstantin Stanislavski] and the message and, and Lee Strasberg, and all that stuff.  And Sandy Knox [ph.] said, "You know, Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Teer], you don't need to study anymore, you need to work--"
Story_ID: 315722
Speaker 1: My sister was a civil rights activist at that time.
Speaker 2: What was your sister's name?
Speaker 1: Frederica Lila Teer.  She was a very strong humanitarian.  She started, she was one of the founders of the free breakfast program for the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] in California.  She was one of the organizers for the March on Washington.  She was one of the founders of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  She had a heavy hitting civil rights background.  She went to jail many, many times.  Her friends were Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin], [HistoryMaker] James Forman, Bayard Rustin--you name it.  So, she was the one that said to me--and we were very close--how could you be in New York [New York] doing this stuff when your people are, you know?  So, she helped me start an organization called the Committee for the Employment of the Negro Performer because all we were doing there was complaining about Broadway didn't have any roles for people of color.  And so, we picketed shows, and we picketed the union, and then we did all these kind of good things.  And nothing really changed.  Subways are for sleeping, like we don't sleep in subways, you know, just on and on and on.  And one day, after winning a couple of awards off Broadway, the Vernon Rice Award, and I just said, "Okay, I'm finished." I was one of these fast actresses on the rise.  I had photographers and publicists and made--you name it--the business was my business.  I was married to Godfrey Cambridge at the time, and he was a very well-known comedian.  And I was in that, that paradigm.  One day after much thought, I walked away from it.  And I've never looked back, ever, ever (laughter).
Story_ID: 315723
Speaker 1: We're gonna move back a little bit because there are some things I want you to talk about, but you've given me a great overview of things to talk about.  And I want to talk about your home life.  What are some of the events you remember about being at home?  Were there--I mean, you talked about the riot [in East St. Louis, Illinois] and that was talked about in your family.  What other historical events that you can remember being talked about as a child within your home?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  You'd be surprised.  Christmas, Thanksgiving, family reunions--my family was very close.  We didn't talk about historical events.  We lived a culture that was very empowering.  We took care of each other.  Everybody knew everybody in the whole town.  You couldn't do anything wrong, 'cause somebody would tell you before you got to, you know.  I remember when my [paternal] grandfather [Cornelius Teer] put a radio together from nothing in the garage.  And the whole block was standing around waiting to hear the fight--I think it was Joe Louis or something.  And he did that with no knowledge of technology.  He just figured it out, but he was a Mason, you know.  I remember when my father [Fred Teer] bought a printing press from whoever died and left it, and built a house in the back of my house, and started a whole printing company, and had a newspaper that came out every week.  And I remember when my father had restaurants.  He had three restaurants, and he so, so--he was excited about his recipe for snowballs, lemonade he used for--and he wouldn't tell anybody his recipe.  And everybody would come to get these snow--I mean, things like that.  I mean, you know, I was a cheerleader, I was in a dance when my aunt had a dance company.  And we were little kids doing tap dancing and ballet, and all that kind--my home, my home town is an incredible place to grow up in.  And Ascent Davis [ph.], who was the best man at my, my wedding with Godfrey [Godfrey Cambridge], he said, "Colored people can have a whole lot of fun when ain't nobody looking."  And that's really true because the lifestyle and the culture was so rich, and so empowering to me.  My [paternal] grandmother [Lottie Teer] used to say, "Don't you walk with your head down--keep your head up, girl."  I mean, I walked, more than anything, with my head up so high, you know.  Those were the, the kinds of experiences--oh, braids, I love braids.  And every year I'm in the Harlem [New York, New York] parade; people think I'm absolutely out of my mind.  But my father--my grandfather was the Potentate, the Grand Potentate of the Masons, and my grandmother was an Eastern Star [Order of the Eastern Star].  So, there's a big parade in St. Louis [Missouri] called the Veiled Prophet Ball, and the parade is before the ball.  So, every year, we have these big parades, and we got to ride horses and my grandfather, with a big baton, got to lead the parade.  So, I loved parades.  I love fireworks.  I love all these energetic things that give you a sense of who you are, so that's my remembrance of my hometown.
Story_ID: 315724
Speaker 1: Can you remember the sorts of things your father [Fred Teer] wrote about in that newspaper?
Speaker 2: God, you know, I can't, because one of the things that was most distressful was that the only thing you put in newspapers were crime and who killed who, and who robs what, and who had drugs, and all those things that we tried to stay away from.  I think one of the best things that ever happened to me was that there was no television when I was a child.  Television came out during--I think the, I don't even remember, Second World War [World War II, WWII], something like that.  And everybody was a big deal, but we didn't, we were with, we were raised with radio shows.  You sit and you listen to the 'Fat Down Who Knows The' [ph.]--all that kind of--the "Shadow Know" ['The Shadow'].  We listen to radios, giving you a very strong family connection because it was an activity.  And we did a lot of creative and artistic things, dance and sing and--.
Speaker 1: So, what were you like as a child?
Speaker 2: I was an energetic--well, first of all, my mother [Lila Benjamin Teer]--I was born with gray eyes and gray hair.  I had a big streak of gray hair all my life.  And my mother used to say, "That's your wealth." So I always thought it was great.  Now, people say, "Oh, you have gray hair."  And everybody's trying to dye their hair, but I had gray hair most of my life.  Now, I was born feet-first.  When you're born feet-first, you're considered a breech baby or something.  And a veil over my eyes so, immediately, I knew--I didn't talk until I was two.  I, I wouldn't say anything, and they're making jokes about--and she never stopped talking since.  Now, I know that, that means that you're marked.  And I have a whole thing about marked souls, so I was marked.  So, I was highly energetic, highly creative, a very much longing always for love and attention.  That's why, probably why I'm in the theater.  I used to sing and dance when I was two and three, and they used to give me money, and I loved it.  That's how I loved to learn, learn to love money 'cause every time I'd sing a little song, they'd give me a little dollar, and I'd put it in my little poc--you know.  I was born creative, intuitive, insightful, fearless, bold, very sad, though, very sad child because I, I had so much and there was no medium to put in, to house it in.  The box was too small for me.  The American culture, as it was taught, you know, even when I did my student teaching at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], they had to have five department, five trucks, and, and police to escort me to do my, my student teaching in Joliet, Illinois because at that time, you, you know, we had this color thing.  When I went to Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], I couldn't sit in the, in the train (unclear).  We had to sit in the black section.  They had to put bags on my head to try on hats in the department stores.  That was during the time when they had signs that said, colored water and white water, and I couldn't understand why I was down there.  It didn't make sense to me in Greensboro, North Carolina.  And I was miserable.  But that's, you know, I don't think about those things very much, but it did scar me.  My mental ability to think through things was, was jammed, so I left the South, came to the University of Illinois.  Now, at the University of Illinois, everybody and his grandmother in my family graduated from there, so it was a different environment.  And my mother was a founder of Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], so I, you know, my sister [Frederica Lila Teer] was the president of Delta Sigma Theta.  So, I just walked right into a, a different environment.  And I was very sheltered, so I didn't know the difference.  I was just glad to get rid of that part of my history.
Story_ID: 315725
Speaker 1: What was elementary school like?  Do you remember elementary school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was so special (laughter) because my father [Fred Teer] was a teacher.  My aunts were all teachers.  My [paternal] grandmother [Lottie Teer] was a--I mean, you know, I was a Teer, you know, I was very special.  I was on the patrol squad too young.  I got skipped three times.  That's why I graduated so young.  I was just, you know, I was very special.
Speaker 1: Were there other teachers that were special to you outside of your father and your--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody was special, 'cause my father and my [paternal] grandfather [Cornelius Teer], my mother [Lila Benjamin Teer], they all ran this town [East St. Louis, Illinois].  I mean, you know, I was just special (laughter).  I haven't thought about that in a long time.  Thank you for the question.
Speaker 1: So, then you move into high school.  What type of teenager were you?
Speaker 2: Very active.  I was in this, I was in the cheering squad.  I was in the band.  I was in the Honor Society.  I was in everything.  My father was a teacher of--when I first started, my father was a teacher of civics, history, and Spanish.  Then he became assistant principal so, you know, in a small hometown like, you say, where everybody knows who you are--you're a little Teer, here she come, hmm, she thinks she cute, you know, that kind of stuff, very sheltered, but very active.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, can you remember, then--I mean, were you aware of historical things happening--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --say, in '54 [1954], Brown v. Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]?
Speaker 2: No, well, my--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --of course, my father being a history teacher, I hear all that stuff at the dinner table.  But I was not actively thinking about those things.  My family was, but I wasn't.  My sister [Frederica Lila Teer], of course, became a civil rights activist and the founder of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], and all that stuff.  Obviously, it was very impressionable to me.  But, me, personally, I was a baby, and I was a brat, and I got to do whatever I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So, what were you thinking about (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Singing, dancing (laughter), performing.  I used to write poetry.  I was--all those creative things that one does.  I wasn't thinking about anything.  I was just being a child, you know.
Story_ID: 315726
Speaker 1: I mean, I left East St. Louis [Illinois] at fifteen years old.  I never went back, really--I mean, for vacations and things.  But they tried to get me out, out.  That was a design to get me to New York [New York] to get me out, to send me to Europe, get me cultured, you know, put me in a different world.  So, I got into a different world.  It's very sad.
Speaker 2: Why is it sad, why was that sad?
Speaker 1: Because that world was an imitation of authenticity.  And so, therefore, I would constantly be put down or teased, even, even in the way I speak.  I mean, I was in Caesar ['Julius Caesar,' William Shakespeare], and you learn standard English and you speak Shake-, Shakespeare.  I walked out of two Shakespeare crap.  I was colored (laughter), and I was molded, reset, to be accepted in the mainstream.  That's my sorrow because mainstream for a child like me was very painful because everything was in the imitation.  I did not look like white people.  I did not act like white people.  I did not, I did not, I did not yet--I had to learn to do that.  Why?  It's enough room for all of us.
Speaker 2: Was it standard at the time for black people like your parents [Lila Benjamin Teer and Fred Teer] to think that a way to get you into a broader place would be to, to send you into a, a white culture?  I mean, was it standard throughout black people, I'm saying, was it--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 2: --a custom that black people did--
Speaker 1: --yeah, it's, it's even standard in Europe--
Speaker 2: --of the time?
Speaker 1: --in, in Africa.  I mean, you know, I did more work in Africa than I did here.  I mean, we're very chosen here because we live in both worlds.  And we could interact with both worlds.  We don't have to react--see, when I, when I started, entered into that world of culture, I was reacting to the programming.  It's not the people--it's the programming.  Property, we were held as property; slaves. That history does not give you any dignity and aliveness.  It makes you angry so that history that I stepped into, in the desire of my parents for me to make it to the top, was very painful because I had to rethink, reset, re-behave, condition--everything changed for me.  That's not healthy, but I did it, and I did it well.  But I kept walking out of shows.
Story_ID: 315727
Speaker 1: I want you to describe for me your--the block that--or first, the name of the street you lived on.
Speaker 2: In East St. Louis [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: In East St. Louis, describe the block, the neighborhood, the community, and talk to me about the restoration of the house that you're going to preserve.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's nice.  My address is 1624 Tudor Avenue in East St. Louis on the south side.  My block, it's--one end of the block is a church, and the other end of the block is a church.  And across the street, there is a lot, a vacant lot, which I am going to buy that you can look straight through to the park, Lincoln Park.  And my father [Fred Teer] used to play tennis every day.  He was a tennis champion.  So, you can look out over there and see him on the tennis court playing tennis.  Now, on the corner of my block, there was a grocery store, which we called the man who owned it, Mr. Cheating Man, because he used to cheat us all the time.  And my mother [Lila Benjamin Teer] didn't mind him cheating us because she said, he needed the money, so just don't say that.  So, we used to say, "Are you going to Mr. Cheating Man?"  So, those kinds of things are funny.  Now, there were one, two, three, four--four houses on one side of my block, and one, two, three, four--five houses on the other side of my block.  Now, my mother did a Christmas card every year for at least fifty years, and she called it the House of Teer on Tudor.  That was the name on the card.  And she used to bring people up-to-date about what was going on with her two girls, where they were, what they were doing.  And she used to draw beautiful little pictures, either of something, and then, she'd put on it--love.  She was really very talented in her ability to do calligraphy and, and draw things.  Now, this house was built by my [paternal] grandfather [Cornelius Teer], and my father, and the community.  When I, when my father came from college [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and brought my mother, they all lived with my [paternal] grandmother [Lottie Teer], of course.  That's the way you do it.  And so, we lived in a big house on Market [Street], which was two blocks and a half from my house.  So, we lived at 1724 Market, so 1724 Market is where I was raised, and where my sister [Frederica Lila Teer] was raised.  However, when I was about five, they had built the new house, which was two and a half blocks away.  You have to go through the park, and you're in it, now (laughter).  My--I loved my grandmother so much I didn't want to move, I didn't want to move to that house.  And they, they would let me come to the big house on weekends.  The rest of the time, I lived with my grandmother.  So, my aunts lived in that house.  Everybody got married.  My uncles, they lived in the house until they got on their own, and then they moved out--like that. So, that's, that's basically--the block is a very famous block for me because my father was a coach.  And every time, there was a championship game, and people in East St. Louis, Jackie [Jackie Joyner-Kersee]--there're so many--Miles Davis--there were just so many very powerful people who come from East St. Louis--Donald McHenry, et cetera, et cetera, etcetera.  Well, my house was the house.  It was the place where everybody came for whatever.  It doesn't matter what the domain was.  And when there was a championship game, and there were lots of them, all the boys would live in my house 'cause my father didn't want them going in there--. And then, that was me, you know, and my sister, which we got to be mascots a lot.  So, that's basically--my house was very popular.  It was like a center of energy and it must be remembered.  That's all I have to say about it--
Story_ID: 315728
Speaker 1: What about the neighborhood [in East St. Louis, Illinois] itself--the community?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood, same thing.  Everybody knew everybody.  We had a main street.  We had churches on every corner, liquor stores in the middle of the block on some corners.  You know, I say, if, if you counted all the liquor stores and churches in the black community, that's, that's the extent of it--grocery stores, liquor stores, churches.  The rest of it is residential.  I've written a lot of, I've written a lot of about that, you know.  At least, it would be a theater on every corner, and not a, not exclude that to glorify the culture, because you go to a liquor store to feed your spirit, you go to church to feed your spirit, you go to the grocery store to feed your spirit,  So, why are you feeding the spirit all the time?  There must be a reason for it.  And so, I say that these places or, or if you observe them properly, tell you who we are, you know.  So, food is very important.  And all of these things are foods, different kinds of food to feed the soul of the people, hmm.

Speaker 1: You talked about your house [in East St. Louis, Illinois] being a center, a focus.  Who are some of the leaders, community leaders, that came in and out, or came through, or even involved (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at that time, they were not leaders.  They were young people going to school.  I mean, Miles Davis used to be my babysitter.  Don McHenry [Donald McHenry], who was an ambassador to the UN [United Nations], was one of my boyfriends.  Leon, Leon Thomas, who's dead now, was a famous jazz singer.  My father [Fred Teer] loved Leon, and he used to yodel.  He was the person that started the whole tradition of yodeling with his voice.  He sang with Count Basie.  He--so, you know, hmm, who else--well, Tina Turner, Ike [Ike Turner], Josephine Baker, Jackie Joyner [Jackie Joyner-Kersee].  There's a whole book on people who came from East St. Louis [Illinois].  And all of them, in some way, had to come through my house, my family, during my day.
Story_ID: 315730
Speaker 1: So, as it is today, what sights, sounds, smells remind you of growing up in East St. Louis [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Laughter, funk, a certain kind of dignity, nobility.  I mean, we used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress.  Every-, everybody it St. Louis knows labels, the shoe labels, the hat labels, the clothes, the colors.  We dressed, cars--oh, God.  Everybody wanted a Cadillac.  Everybody would see who could outdo who with clothes, with cars, with houses, actually, with lawns, how pretty your lawn was, how many trees you had.  We had a little--my mother [Lila Benjamin Teer] had all these fruit trees all around the house--lemons, and apples, and peaches, and cherries, and birds.  And they used to look for the birds to sing on this.  You know, I mean, we were just a phenomenal race of people, absolutely beyond, beyond.  And you can't--we sang a lot, sort of stupid (unclear), sang a lot.  If you, you know, if you took away the boom box--ha, in, in other, in other communities, suburbs, you don't have loud music, you don't have boom boxes.  I just said, one of the things I'm going to do is ride into the white community with a boom box and blast it, you know, I mean, just silly stuff, you know, because we're not quiet people.  We're energized and we're energetic and, you know, offends the other culture many times because we--it's not, they say, we make noise.  That's not noise, maybe nowadays it is noise, but into my day, it was not noise.  We make sounds with slapping our hips and our thighs, and using our mouths, and clicking and clucking, just an incredibly gifted people.  That's what my hometown was like.  That's--we used to see who could outdo who in, in--oh, we used to play the dozens all the time, you know, I mean, all of those things.  Who could outwit; who could outdo; fun things.
Speaker 1: Smells?
Speaker 2: Smells, smells, smells, smells?  I don't know too much smells except the smell of flowers, and the smell of freshness, and the smells of--you know, my mother was a home economics graduate from the University of Illinois [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] back in the day.  And she used to cook by colors, have red, and we'd have oranges, and we'd have greens, you know.  And we, we have, what, the plates had to be colored, and the napkins had to be a certain way, and the silver, and the china.  I mean, we were raised like that, you know.  Everything had--she loved flowers.  She'd go out in the back, and she'd cut leaves off the trees and flowers, and she'd position them on the table, so that things were very pretty in my, in my, in my way of being brought up.
Story_ID: 315731
Speaker 1: And we went to church every Sunday, and everybody sang in the choir.  And my aunts would giggle all through the choir.  And then, we'd sit on the front row and watch them act like fools but, you know.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 1: Wesley Bethel Church [East St. Louis, Illinois].  It's a Methodist Church, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 2: And where was it located?
Speaker 1: It moved--the first one.  I don't know where the first, where the first one.  We built three churches and the, the last one is on--what's the name of that street?  I don't know the address, but it's on a major street.  And they just changed the name of it to Trinity, I think, but it's west of the Bethel.  That's--I grew up in Wesley Bethel, and I don't know the name of the street.
Speaker 2: For the record--well, I just want you to list the name of your elementary school and your high school.
Speaker 1: Dunbar Elementary School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, East St. Louis, Illinois], Lincoln High School [East St. Louis Lincoln High School, East St. Louis, Illinois].
Speaker 2: And both of those are--
Speaker 1: And, oh, I went to Hughes-Quinn Junior High School [East St. Louis, Illinois].  They just split them up just before I went for the seventh, eighth, and ninth grade.  I went to Hughes-Quinn Junior High School.
Speaker 2: Now, at the time, were all of these schools predominantly black schools, or were they mixed schools?
Speaker 1: All black--ain't no white people around me.  I didn't grow with white people (laughter).  That's why I'm so crazy, ohh (laughter).  I'm not crazy-stop it, shh, shh, shh.  That's why I have a different view, a perspective of life because my upbringing was not in any way reactionary or interacting with another culture.  I'm a purist.
Story_ID: 315732
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: After graduating college [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], what happens?
Speaker 1: I was shipped off on an airplane to Europe.  I didn't even walk.  And I was summa cum [summa cum laude], so I should have walked.  I'm magna cum, summa cum, one of the--.  But my, my pro-, I was a protegee of the Wigman [Mary Wigman].  And my dance instructor was here for five years on a fellowship, Margaret Deeks [ph.], and she was going back home to Berlin [Germany], so I had to go with her.  So, I was swept off to Berlin, a real culture shock.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: They hadn't seen black people very much.  And they--every time I would sit and eat, everybody was staring at me like I was some monkey, or some crazy person.  And they would walk up and touch my hand and say, "Schon, schon, and schon," which meant beautiful, but I didn't know it at the time.  Very intrusive people because it was like--who is this lady, this young lady?  So, and I didn't speak the language so that didn't help.  But in classes, I was very special.
Speaker 2: I was about to say, you spoke the language of dance, which I assume was universal.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: What were those times like in Europe, travelling?
Speaker 1: They were not very happy because, again, I was unusual, different, outside of the norm.  It's not a very nice feeling because I was used to being in an environment of, of closeness, of intimacy, of caring, of nurturing, of loving--not some specimen to be observed.
Story_ID: 315733
Speaker 1: So, you leave Europe, and then what happens?
Speaker 2: Come to New York [New York]--
Speaker 1: And what, what, now what year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) only because I was going to get my next degree, 'cause that's what my family wanted me to do.  It was okay to dance as long you had degrees.  You couldn't dance and just be a dancer--I mean, really?  That didn't have any culture in it.  So, I came here to go to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York].  And after two or three weeks, I was absolutely bored out of my mind.  So, then they got together again, and decided that I would go to the Henry Street Playhouse [Henry Street Settlement; Henry Street Playhouse, New York, New York] to study with Alwin Nikolais, who was a derivative of Hanya Holm and Mary Wigman, so still, I was in that family.  And I stayed there three and a half years.
Speaker 1: So, at the Henry Street Settlement, this was sort of your--but during this time, this is your initiation into a culture that was outside of the black culture.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And, interestingly enough, I stepped into the modern dance world, and I was sent to Alwin Nikolais.  Alwin Nikolais is the epitome, or was, of abstract everything.  Cage [John Cage] was the music--the, the, the, the feeling was a no-no, a no-no.  Emotion was a no-no, so you could imagine what that did to me.  The first assignment that I recall at the Henry Street Playhouse was go to the museum, any museum in New York, and pick out a gestalt, a painting that you love, and choreograph a piece to that gestalt.  Well, I, I'm, I, I graduated with a degree in dance so, you know, I know all that stuff.  And I did labanotation, and all that kinds of stuff.  I go to the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], and I looked and looked and looked.  And I see nothing that I understood or liked, except one painting, which happened to have been a Picasso [Pablo Picasso].  Now, I did not know anything about Picasso and his African roots, and so forth.  So, I pick a Picasso, and I came back, and I picked the music for Miles Davis because Miles is Miles.  And I grew up in a family where the boys used to sit in my house, in my front room, and listen to jazz all the time and play cards.  So, I came from jazz, and there I go, there I go.  Everybody sing lips, everything, you know, that kind of culture.  I came from a jazz culture.  So, I picked with Miles Davis and Picasso.  My instructor, who was Alwin Nikolais, set back (unclear).  When I finished, he said, "Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Teer], that looks like a nightclub routine."  And I went--I was so embarrassed because up to this point, I was still (unclear), and I left.  Well, I hit my knee in, in the wings coming--I, I was so embarrassed, and that was one of the first things.  And my history is always like that.  When you see the difference, observe the difference between the two cultures, it's like night and day, and it's not very pleasant.  That's it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you, you hit your knee.  He makes this comment.  What--?
Speaker 2: Well, he made the comment way before I hit my knee.
Speaker 1: He makes the comment--. What year are we talking about that you were at the Henry Street Settlement?
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: First part of the '60s [1960s] because in '64 [1964], Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated [sic. 1968], I think.  I founded the National Black Theatre [New York, New York] in '68 [1968].  Before that, I was directing and acting, and I had started a school called the Group Theatre Workshop with [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks.  And that turned out to be the Negro Ensemble Company which was also very famous at the time.  Those were my friends but--and I used to perform a lot in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 315734
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about those days.  You, you leave dance, and you pursue--you become an actress (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I leave dance and I--because my knee was really not working well.  Before I left dance, I did two Broadway shows.  But the one that's significant was 'Kwamina,' and 'Kwamina' was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, and we won a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for that.  And there were like fifty dances in that.  It was a huge de Mille production, and it was about Africa--somebody returning to home, and that's called 'Kwamina.'  I auditioned like you know, you know.  And I, and actually 'Kicks and Co.' was across the street, and that was Oscar Brown [HistoryMaker Oscar Brown, Jr.] who turned out to be a good friend of mine.  But I auditioned, I got the job.  I was very--I may be about seventeen, nineteen--I was nineteen.  And all these were seasoned actors and dancers and Broadway.  And she gave me this part, and she made me the dance captain.  That was not good because I was treated so badly by my peers.  They weren't my peers because who was I?  I was just somebody they--and she said she never met a dancer who didn't know how to take labanotation.  And so, I became--in fact, she includes me in a part, part, portion of one of her books, and I forgot the name of it, about my work.  So, I did 'Kwamina.'  We were nominated and won a Tony.  That's the way my--every time I touched something, it, it did that, you know.  And then, I did--I did about three or four Broadway shows.  I did--God knows how many off-Broadway shows, and I won awards for that.  And my father [Fred Teer] used to come back and forth, and back and forth to help me.  I then started studying acting because I thought it was important.  And so, that's when I started studying with Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd Richards]--well, actually 'Raisin' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] was very important, 'Raisin in the Sun' at that time, because Lloyd Richards was directing 'Raisin,' and I studied with Lloyd.  And I was the understudy for Diana Sands who's not here anymore.  She's dead, and she was the most incredible actress in the world.  And Jimmy Baldwin [James Baldwin], when all that crowd, that was my crowd.  So, Lorraine Hansberry, so, but I was this little, little, little, little girl.  I was not hit, you know, I was understudy, and that was, so I did all of that.  I studied, studied, studied.  I studied with Lloyd.  I studied with Paul Mann.  I studied with Meisner [Sanford Meisner]. I studied with Philip Burton.  I studied--until they kicked me out.  They said you need to stop studying--go work.  Then I started writing.  And the first major article I wrote for The New York Times in the Sunday section of the Arts and Leisure said, "We could be who we were born to be.  But I'm not going to be a maid, a matriarch, or a prostitute." Oh, just, I just did all kinds of stuff.  I really did (laughter).
Story_ID: 315735
Speaker 1: So, just to go back to the Henry Street Settlement [Henry Street Playhouse, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk to me about [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson?
Speaker 2: Louis Johnson, Louis wasn't at the Henry Street Play--Playhouse.  He's there now--
Speaker 1: Interesting, okay.
Speaker 2: --but back in that day, Murray Lewis, Alwin Nikolais, this was Alvin Ailey, and Louis, and Walter Nicks, all those dancers, Danny McKeon [ph.], they were not, they were struggling dancers.  They didn't have a Henry Street Playhouse.  And because, again, I was in a particular environment, I was in a modern dance environment--not any modern dance because now, you can see that Alvin and them would be more connected with jazz dance.  Dunham, [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, all of that crowd--that, that ilk were put in another category.  Pearl Primus was primitive, but it was not the high art of Wigman [Mary Wigman].  That's who I studied with; Nikolais studied with; Hanya Holm studied with; Jose Limon--all of those modern dancers, that's where I was living at.  So, Louis wasn't in that ilk.  Now, when you want to talk about black dancing--and I say it with the greatest pride--I'm not saying that black dancing.  I'm not black, I'm just universal.  That's crap.  Black dancing comes from a different cultural perspective.  So, that's, that's the people you talk--Louis, Alvin, Walter Nicks, Danny McKeon, and the mother of all of that would have been Pearl Primus.  And in that, would have been Katherine Dunham.  That's a whole another era, another, another domain.  And when I crossed over into that domain, I worked for Alvin, I worked for Louis, I worked for all of them.  I travelled with them, but I had lost the glamour of being a dancer.  Dancers work hard.  They, they don't have very good environments to work in.  They're not treated with any respect.  They don't make any money.  The locker rooms look like crap.  Now, that was then, so I wasn't happy in that environment.  And I wasn't accepted in that environment, like I was in a Nikolais environment, where I was special 'cause I was different, you know. In a Alvin Ailey environment, the only thing that would make you special is to have something like Judy Taylor [ph.] where a, a split or elevated leg that goes up behind your ear, and stuff like that.  I didn't have any of that.  So, what, what I had was energy, and sensualness, and directness, what you call soul.  So, I wouldn't have been accepted in that environment as such because I didn't come in there with splits and elevated legs.  And I didn't study ballet, so I wouldn't know how to do tour jetes and--that wasn't me, that wasn't me at all.  I was very raw.
Story_ID: 315736
Speaker 1: Talk to me about what you wrote in that article, The New York Times article, and give me the title of that article again.  You said the caption (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'We Can Be Who We Were Born to Be' ['We Can Be What We Were Born to Be,' Barbara Ann Teer].  That was the first one.  I wrote four articles for The New York Times.  They loved me.  And I stopped writing for them because my peers in Harlem [New York, New York] were saying--she, she, she crossed over.  She, she, she--and I felt so bad until I stopped writing.  And then, they started writing and getting their articles in there.  And Seymour Peck, who's dead now, who was the editor of the Leisure Arts and Leisure section, said, "Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Teer], why are you falling for this stuff?  They would love to get their articles in this paper.  Why, why--keep writing."  But I pulled out, very sensitive, I pulled out.  Now, the first article I wrote, Seymour Peck gave me a man, who I now hear is in a senior citizens' home.  His name was Tom Johnson [Thomas A. Johnson].  He was a very powerful writer for The New York Times, and he was black.  They assigned him to me to work with me to write my thoughts.  I resisted it because I didn't like journalism.  It took all the, the juice out.  It was too clean, it was too (gesture).  So, we fought a lot.  And at the end, they printed my article without my permission really because I thought they were sick of me.  And I went on with my life.  A phone call, and there it is, and actually, the front page of The New York Times, Sunday Arts and Leisure section, had a picture--half the whole page was a picture of me.  I was like, "Whoa," and that was my introduction to the writing world.  The article was basically--I don't remember, it was in '64 [sic. 1968].  I was passing--I was walking down the street, and I saw this old lady standing on the corner, bus stop, with two big bags of groceries, and she was really too old to be carrying them.  And something flashed and was like, such dignity there, such honor there.  So, I started by talking about, we can be who were born to be.  We don't have to be like this.  We can rethink, reset, re-change, we can transform the paradigm of struggle, and hard work, and subservience, and second class.  And we can, we can change all that.  And that was the seed with which I wrote 'We Can Be Who We Were Born to Be.'  I was basically like that.  I've written a lot of those kind of articles.  I did one for the Amsterdam [New York Amsterdam News] called the 'Reinvention of a People.'  And I do the same kind of thing, you know, take the computers, and tap on the computers like you beat on the rhythm of a drum.  Well, I just, you know, hey, make a--(laughter).
Story_ID: 315737
Speaker 1: So, we were up to 1964, '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had left and you were writing for The New York Times.  You'd empowered yourself in a sense.  You'd discovered that there is something you want to do.  Talk to me about how that started and where you were going to take it.
Speaker 2: Okay, '64 [1964], 6-, well, again, my father [Fred Teer] was very key in all of this because he used to come to New York [New York] to support me with my, my knees and everything.  And he introduced me to all the guys in 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] because somebody in there, Nick Kilpatrick [ph.], was from St. Louis [East St. Louis, Illinois].  So, they used to play bridge, poker, and stuff in my house.  And I didn't know very much about black history as such.  And [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward, who's the founder of--was the founder--well, he is the founder of the Negro Ensemble Company, gave me a book to read called 'Up from Slavery' [Booker T. Washington].  They decided that, you know, I always say, they decided 'cause I was just--wind her up, and push her out there wherever that I should study with [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards.  And that's how I got into black plays.  In the meantime, during that time, because I was civil rights orientated--I mean, my apartment used to have people like Fannie Lou Hamer, Eldridge Cleaver, all the Panthers [Black Panther Party] hiding from something, because of my sister [Frederica Lila Teer], so I was in the mix.  And, of course, political activists could not tolerate theatre.  It was like a waste of time.  Why are you doing dancing and (unclear), and so, I just didn't listen, you know.  And they were serious.  They--I'd say, "Y'all have no fun, y'all just sit here and talk all this."  So, I was like on the outside of all of that.  And when my sister, whom I love dearly, and we were so close, used to say, "You gotta do something.  You can't just be sitting here doing these, (unclear) fashion shows and, and, you know, glamour stuff."  And I'd been to the White House [Washington, D.C.] because by that time, Godfrey [Godfrey Cambridge] was--Cambridge was my husband--was getting to be a big deal, and all that kind of stuff.  So, I was split.  Now, I went to--[HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks was doing Imamu Amiri Baraka's production of--what's that one with the white girl in it on the subway?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  'The Dutchman' ['Dutchman,' Amiri Baraka].
Speaker 2: 'The Dutchman'--I thank you-'The Dutchman.'  And young people used to come and see that show.  And I was very close to Robert, and they would stand backstage and they would be uhh, so I said, "Why don't we teach them something?  Put them--," you know. Because before that, I taught school at Harlem [New York, New York] at Wadleigh Junior High School, just so I could make some money while Godfrey was waiting to make his big break.  And he made his big break on 'The Jack Paar Show' or something like that.  I don't know.  But anyway--so I started teaching young people.  And we named it the Group Theatre Workshop.
Story_ID: 315738
Speaker 1: And it was so powerful 'cause I--first thing I choreographed and designed a piece, which now Ntozake [HistoryMaker Ntozake Shange] calls it choreopoems.  But those days, I took a Gwendolyn Brooks poem, which was eight lines, called 'We Real Cool,' and I developed it into a whole evening.  Well, Joe Pappa [Joseph Papp] was a big deal at the time.  He's now dead too, Public Theater [New York, New York]--he saw it, and he loved it, and he wanted me to come and do something for him.  And I said no.  But he put 'We Real Cool' on the mobile unit that toured all the boroughs of New York [New York].  So, all my little kids who were 14, 13, so got to get a taste of show business.  That was the beginning of the Negro Ensemble Company.  So, when Douglas Turner [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] wrote an article ['American Theater: For Whites Only?' Douglas Turner Ward] for The New York Times about black people in theatre--he called it Negroes--he got a lot of opportunities to get grants.  But we were in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] at St. Mark's theatre [St. Mark's Playhouse, New York, New York], and we were doing Imamu's [Amiri Baraka] plays.  And I was just acting all over the place.  So, what happened was when they got that first big grant from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], they changed up on me.  It was called the Negro Ensemble Company, and I--that was just offensive to me.  It's black, like we're going to call it Negro, you know.  It was in the Village.  I thought it should be in the black community--like that.  And they were picking plays that didn't have anything to do with the culture that I knew.  So, I left them--my friends, I left them.  I'm always leaving people.  I left them and I came to Harlem [New York, New York].  With the reputation of wanting to start an authentic black theatre company, not one in the Village, but one in Harlem.
Story_ID: 315739
Speaker 1: So, I was directing an off-Broadway show at the time that was called 'The Believers' by Jesse DeVore.  And I had a company of very talented young people, and they asked me to teach them acting.  I said, "You can't teach acting to two or three people."  So, we moved up here to the Elks club [Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks] around the corner and, and I started teaching.  And before you know it, I had fifty, sixty students.  And then, there was during the time of The Last Poets.  And The Last Poets were my friends, and we moved to a loft, which was two doors from here where we are now.  And that was when Imamu [Amiri Baraka] came up with Larry Neal, and I--and we started the Black Arts Movement.  The difference is, is that they were very political and very militant.  And I was spiritual, and was talking about new art forms and not killing white people.  That was not my thing.  I just thought that was beneath me, so we didn't get along too well at the time.  But The Last Poets and I were very close, and so we continued to do what we were doing.  And then Imamu got arrested.  And then, I took all of Imamu's poems, and put them into a piece called 'We Sing A New Song,' and raised money to get him out of prison, uh, jail.  And then, I did another movie on the life of Malcolm X, which was called 'Rise--A Love Poem for A Love People' [Carolyn Rodgers].  And we did it right here in the park, and I put it on the streets because I was trying to show them you do not have to wait for these big grants, and you do not have to beg and crawl for peanuts.  You can--you have the talent.  You can just do stuff on your own, so I started doing a lot of that--
Story_ID: 315740
Speaker 1: What was Harlem [New York, New York] like at the time?  I know the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] opened about the same time in '68 [1968] and then--
Speaker 2: The Studio Museum was in this building.  We were in the same building.  The Studio Museum was on one side, and we were on the other side.  Actually, we probably--no, the Studio Museum was on the floor beneath us.  We incubate a lot of people.  We bring people in.  We let them have space because space is really the bottom line.  The Studio Museum moved out.  Now, they have a big place on 105th Street.  The Nation of Is- [Nation of Islam], Islam was here.  This was Malcolm's [Malcolm X] Mosque No. 7 [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York].  We incubated them.  Mr. Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], dear friend, they stayed here for ten years.  Now, they have their own building.  We incubated a couple of churches.  The comedy club, before there was a comedy club, we incubated them here.  Most of the comedians came out of here so like that.  We--back in the day for eight years, we did what we called blackenings.  They were symposiums where we invited everybody who ever heard of with politically--entertainment, and Patti LaBelle--all of those people started here--Nona Hendryx, Nina Simone, everybody came here and talked to the community about what they were up to.  Now, we were a home for that.  We had a little restaurant and we--our waiters were called lovers.  And we had a little solo incense and all that kind of--.  This community was not a pleasant community.  If it were not for the, the Nation of Islam, we would probably not be here because they would march around the blocks every day because that's what they did.  And they protected us for a long time.  It was heavily drug-orientated.  Nobody really wanted to be in Harlem--but us.  And since I came from East St. Louis [Illinois], I was comfortable with all of that.  So, when Minister Farrakhan came to speak, there was a semi-riot outside with them.  Men picketing said there are no women leaders, there are no women leaders, you know, I mean (laughter).  I've been through it.  Okay, so that was, it was a rough time.  It was not a time that people understood what we were doing because we were quote spiritual.  But I was developing an art form that spoke to the sensitivities of people of African ancestry because the art form that I came from did not speak to those sensitivities.  I got a Ford Foundation [New York, New York] fellowship.  I went to Africa to justify my discoveries.  Oh, my discoveries were phenomenal.  And then, I made Nigeria my second home, and back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

Speaker 1: So, I want to go back to The Last Poets--
Speaker 2: Last Poets (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because we'd like to know which ones were friends of yours.
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: Can you list them, name them?
Speaker 2: Sure.  The head of The Last Poets was somebody named Gylan Kain.  Gylan is living in Europe now.  Felipe Luciano is now politically running.  He was, he went to television.  David Nelson, who I think is in St. Louis [Missouri], and he's a minister now.  Those were the original Last Poets.  Now, everybody is the last poet--Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole]. There's a lot of them now, but the original last poets were Gylan Kain, David Nelson, and well, Felipe, actually.  Yeah, they were phenomenal.  We used to work together all the time--Gylan, David, and Felipe, um-hm.

Speaker 1: What about the Spirit House [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Spirit House was Imamu's [Amiri Baraka].  Larry Neal, and Imamu Amiri Baraka started Spirit House.  That was the beginning of the Black Arts Movement.  They were very violent.  They used a lot of force.  I said, it is force, and not power.  They had guns.  I think Larry got shot a couple of times.  They did not understand the power of women.  They didn't appreciate it, in my opinion, so we didn't always agree.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with Imamu?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: Imamu and I (laughter)--now we're very close.  I did all Imamu's plays.  Imamu is a brilliant writer, and he wrote characters that you could--most people wouldn't even know how to touch them because they were so out there.  And I could do them and I did them well, and I did most of Imamu's crazy parts, so we had that relationship.  I respected him to the uttermost.  And that's why, when he was put in prison, I did the--we sang a song with all of his poems at I.S. 201 [Dyker Heights Intermediate School, Brooklyn, New York].  I used all his poems, and I put them together and, and it was brilliant.  It's actually phenomenal.  I did a lot with poetry which, you know, it turned out to be now called choreopoems.  Ntozake [HistoryMaker Ntozake Shange] gets the credit for it, although she's very clear where it came from, 'cause she used to be up here, too.  So, yeah, that's, that's about as much as I want to say about it 'cause I don't really want them in a negative box because we were different, we were very different.  We had different visions, different--and, and they thought what I was doing was weak and mamsy-pamsy 'cause they didn't understand spirit and that's okay, you know.

Speaker 1: What about Paul Carter Harris [HistoryMaker Paul Carter Harrison]--
Speaker 2: Oh, Paul Carter Harris.
Speaker 1: --and the ritual theatre?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: And the ritual theatre?  Is he associated with the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Paul writes about me in his book, 'Nommo' ['The Drama of Nommo,' Paul Carter Harrison].  He does a lot of very fine assessments about my work.
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about Paul?
Speaker 2: Paul is academic.  He's a wonderful writer, researcher.  You see, I, I have things that I observe as programming--not the people.  I'm not talking about the people.  I don't want to spend time assessing the people.  The programming that we were all born into in this, this diaspora is the real enemy.  So, we're constantly reacting to the programming that Europeans designed.  Not only are we reacting to the programming, we are imitating the programming.  So, authentic black theatre should not be in either one of those categories as far as I am concerned.  You can interact with the programming, but not react to the programming.  So, Paul--all of them, you know, they're either assessing the, the power, and all of it is secondary power as far as I'm concerned.  And none of that is primary power.
Speaker 1: Joseph Walker [Joseph A. Walker]?
Speaker 2: Oh, he did 'River Niger' ['The River Niger,' Joseph A. Walker] here.  He's good.  He's a very brilliant playwright--all of them.
Story_ID: 315744
Speaker 1: What do you consider to be authentic black theatre?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, authentic is indigenous.  It's like if you see a flower that's been cross-breeded, and instead of it being a red rose, it's red leaves with purple, whatever, whatever.  That's not authentic.  That's not--and I hate the word, purist, because that sounds kind of high art, but it's not the rose.  It's an off-breed of the rose.  And it was consciously designed to do that, and it's beautiful.  But I prefer the power and the intensity of the rose without all of the stuff on it.  Theatre uses every tool of healing--lights, colors, sound, preacher rhythms, rhythmic words, movement, dance.  It is a healing art.  You go to the holy water, Pentecostal church.  You see people running up and down the aisles, and getting the spirit, they call it.  But they elevate themselves into complexed, speaking-in tongues, connecting to their ancestors.  That's theatre for me.  The rest of it is just some secondary, intellectual, linear, wonderful stuff.  They make a lot of money (laughter).  I think that it's just a different paradigm.
Story_ID: 315745
Speaker 1: So, how would you define what you were doing within the Black Arts Movement in the '60s [1960s]?  How were you defined, how did you define yourself?
Speaker 2: Paul Carter Harris [HistoryMaker Paul Carter Harrison] puts it pretty well in his book ['The Drama of Nommo,' Paul Carter Harrison].  Whenever the National Black Theatre [New York, New York] performed and we--I trained all my performers in a technology--would--originally, it was called pyramid process of performing; now it's called tiers of technology of the soul.  It's a technology and it's ritualistic at its best.  People weren't talking about ritual then.  It was just me, and I was labelled juju, voodoo, hoodoo, whatever, you know, so.  But when those seventy performers hit any environment because I took away the distance, the psychic distance between audience and stage, we were all just one congregation, one community.  And the so-called liberator--that's what I call my performers--the liberator was a liberator of love.  And we were here because you don't even get Academy Awards [Oscars]--now maybe--for anything that's lyrical or loving.  It's always bitches and, and, and prostitutes, and tearing down scenery, and screaming and yelling, and that's supposed to be acting.  And I wanted to do something that would return us to love that would give us lyricism and beauty and, and the things that inspire and touch the heart.  I invented something called action art.  An action art is art that flows from the heart.  And it moves you, and it transforms you, and it inspires you, and it uplifts you.  And you should be different when you walk out of that door than when you come in just to see a play, and say, oh, she's cute, or he's pretty.  I'm a leading man.  I'm an ingenue.  All of that stuff is not what I'm about.  So, I invented an art form that allowed people to touch, to hug, to be unified, to be one, to sing together, to hum together, to moan together, to cry together, to laugh together--together.  Celebrate the richness and beauty inherent in the form and feeling of black lifestyle means that we will celebrate the joy and oneness of being human.  And then that goes to--well, what does it mean to be human?  And people don't know what it means to be human because they don't understand that spirit is a fundamental source of your humanity.  And soul is different from spirit.  Now, I don't want to get too much into all of that intellectual stuff 'cause it's abstract.  At its finest, it has to do with what I call energetics.  And when I was a baby, you asked me how--I was born into energetics.  Intuitively, I go where the forces tell me.  I go where spirit tells.  I don't sit there and wait for the teacher to give me an A, and I get A's.  I challenge, I challenge, and the things that I challenge were always things that nobody knew about.  Then, how did I know about it?  'Cause I would put drummers on the stage and tell them to play certain rhythms, and see people go crazy.  And then, I didn't know why they was going crazy.  They didn't either.  And when they came back, they didn't know that they did that.  "Well, what is that about?"  That's ritual.  "Well, what is the ritual?" Then, I start going to holy water, Pentecostal churches, studying the process of ritual.  Of Reverend Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] marking the passing from one space, hmm, outside in, to another more highly evolved space, hmm.  Well, outside, in itself, conscious.  Then I call it self-conscious art.  Inside, in a fullness, inside out is soul, and I call that God-conscious art.  And God-conscious art is action art, and it's art that flows from the heart.  If you don't touch it, if you don't move it, if you don't feel it, if you ain't got a funk and soul, it don't count to me.  Otherwise, I'd go to sleep.  So, in that time--well, the hip-hop movement has made a difference.  But at that time, people didn't know what I was talking about.  They really didn't.  And I didn't know what I was talking about either until I went to Africa.  When I went to Africa--boy, you're talking about, whoa.
Story_ID: 315746
Speaker 1: What year did you go to Africa?
Speaker 2: I went to Africa the first time--I've been to Africa thirty-five times--I went to Africa the first time in 1972 on a Ford Foundation [New York, New York] fellowship.  A European named Uli Baio [ph.], who's written many, many books, and was considered the foremost authority on African art, came to this country on a Ford Foundation fellowship.  And he had on a dashiki, and he had a long beard, and he was German.  And he found his way into my theatre [National Black Theatre, New York, New York].  And when it was over, we were doing whatever rituals and so.  He came over to me and he said, "Where did you learn all this?"  And I, I don't know.  And he said, "You need to go to Africa."  He said, "You would be more important to Africans than you are here because Africans need to know what you are doing."  And so, he took me to the Ford Foundation, and I got a very attractive fellowship.  And I went to, supposedly seven countries, but I only went to one, and I stayed in one village the whole time, Osogbo [Nigeria].  And all, all of my theatres from Osogbo have very strong, strongly in Nigeria.  And I've been all over Africa, but Nigeria is really my second home.  They knew me.  They knew I was coming.  I have all these young people--children were born, all out of this whole thing.  I mean, my daughter's [Sade Lythcott] the lead in 'Dorothy Dandridge' ['Dorothy Dandridge: Before, After & Now'].  My son [Michael Lythcott] is one of the--I--those children have turned out to be the most powerful energies you can think of.  They're now in their late twenties, their early thirties, and they said that we had to have children.  We had, the staff had children--twelve, the first twelve children came one month after the next one, January, February, March, April, May.  One of them you've heard of.  He's a big deal, he's in Hollywood now.  He, he did 'Clueless.'  He did 'Scrubs.'  He's doing--done a lot of movies--Adeosun [Donald Faison].  He's big-time out there--meet people, remember Adeosun because Adeosun is in the films, in the media.  You can see his face.  Oh, my daughter is in London [England].  She's a big deal in Goldman Sachs. She's graduated from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], undergraduate from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], straight A student.  I mean, my daughter is a--it goes on and on and on and on.  These kids are doing phenomenal things, and they were raised right here underneath us.  They didn't go to school--they went to our school.  We had a fire in '83 [1983], and then they had to go to school.  One of the things that makes you indigenous is that if you don't allow that culture to condition you, to program you, because when that happens, it's, it's over for you 'cause then you want to get it right.  You want to be pleasing.  The universe is not divided into two kind of people, the good people, bad people, right people, wrong people, pretty people, ugly people.  That's not the way it goes, but that's how we're taught.  So, we want to please, and then we got some God in the sky somewhere.  You're so far away, you can't see Him.  You're supposed to pray to Him, and He's supposed to do something for you.  But if you got a problem, you don't go the president of the United States with the problem.  He doesn't even hear you.  You're connected, you know.  The gospel say, "I got a telephone in my bosom.  I'll ring him up, call him up."  You ring him up, call him up.  Anyway, I could go on forever with this (unclear) (laughter).

Speaker 1: Did Malcolm X ever see any of the work you were doing here [National Black Theatre, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I met Malcolm three times, but he's--we weren't--no, he didn't come here--I mean, to see my work.  See, Malcolm said, "You got to stop singing, and start swinging."  That, to me, left an impressionable mark because what we needed to do was to start singing, so we could stop swinging--ain't gonna study war no more.  Because if we understand energetics, if we understand the power of soul, if we understand that our ancestors only hear the feelings; the energy from our longing is what is heard. You--mumbo-jumbo, praying, screaming, yelling forever, and they don't know, they're not, they don't know what they're listening to.  See, I said, divine race of people were called into existence to carry out the work of the most high.  These marked souls went beyond reason to learn to love, went beyond color to be loved, went beyond sound to hear level, went beyond fear.  And it goes on and on and on and on; return to love, a vibrant toy frequency that is so powerful and omnipresent that if you step in the room in your primary power, you can intend whatever you say to be so.  Otherwise, you are always at the effect of programming that says you're just a little, little person who don't have no power.  We have to always march and picket and scream and yell and be angry and get all kinds of diseases from the stress of just fighting a system that doesn't want you in it in the first place.  And that's not why we came here, because we chose to be here.  Now, I teach that stuff.  Some people, it works for, and some people, it doesn't.  But when you're put in a category called spiritual, you're putting it in a category called weak, and people don't, you know, they just want to know how I'm going to pay my rent tomorrow, where as far as I'm concerned, this is how you pay your rent, not the other way.  So, I rejoice in what I consider to be--people call it blackness.  I say it's an overwhelming creative force.  It's an omnipresent power when you close your eyes.  It's just blackness, and I step into that every morning.  That's not a skin color.  That's too mundane.  That is not what they categorize.  You hear people say, "I'm not black, I'm an American."  That's ridiculous. Or, "I happen to be black." That's ridiculous.  You chose it. But what does that mean?  There could be books written on this, books and books and books and books.  But that's why I own 64,000 square feet of property, went through five-year foreclosure action, had a building that burnt down to the ground.  And then now, it's awesome--built back up.  That's Gideon's army; (unclear) tired though (laughter).
Story_ID: 315748
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, 1977 FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria], you went to--
Speaker 2: FESTAC Second World Festival, Black Arts and Culture--by this time I was a strong force in the Nigerian cultural world from the president on down.  I, I was one of the judges to select the groups from Nigeria to participate in the festival.  And so, I was bringing my company [from the National Black Theatre, New York, New York] over there to participate in the festival.  There was some process that you had to go through to be, be accepted to go to the festival, but I didn't have that process.  So, I'm not really clear what it was.  But, at any rate, they built--the Nigerians built a whole village to house everybody.  And my company was full of engineers and plumbers, and all that kind of good stuff.  I mean, we were liberated.  And we went over there and we built a whole area for us to stay in, which was quite unusual.  And we took the piece that I had choreo-, choreographed, directed--I call it--creatively developed, called 'The Revival' ['A Revival: Change, Love Together, Organize!' Barbara Ann Teer].  Hmm.  We did a film while we were over that.  It's a beautiful film about us returning to the motherland.  I had taken my company over there twice before the FESTAC, so they were familiar with the protocol, the ritual protocol.  Now, we performed in FESTAC and the whole stadium went wild.  It was awesome.  I went back later to get the footage, but it was too dark, and you had to transfer it from one system to the other.  So, I don't really have it on tape, but it changed a lot to the people who performed with us.  And it made me very clear, it rooted me deeply into my work.  It made me very clear that what I was doing was necessary with the essential.  And even though it was a sacrifice for mainstream glitz, glamour, or fame, fortune, all that good stuff, that I had to do it.  I think that's the first time I chose to do what I'm doing, 'cause the rest of the time, I was always unhappy, and how come I can't--nobody invited me to this, and this one, and that.  So, FESTAC was powerful.  They have never recreated it.  It's almost like it was designed for us because we were the stars of FESTAC.
Speaker 1: And by that, you mean--.
Speaker 2: Like James Brown in those days.  If you're James Brown, everybody goes crazy.  They stop the cars and they--you know--we did something for African people in, in a domain of their dignity and identity, that's authentic and noble because we were born in America of African descent, and we were clear about that.  And I used to say we're human beings of African descent born in America--not we're Afros, we're African Americans, we're black, we're Negro, would you say.  No, we are human beings, and I would say it even different.  We are human beings and spiritual bodies, but we are human beings of African descent born in America.  That's very different.  And we went back to our roots.  And we went back with great respect and great love, and great appreciation.  And when you give it out, you get it back.  You can only get back what you give out.  So, our impression left in Africa was awesome, it was awesome.  And to this day, I'm treated very well in Nigeria.
Story_ID: 315749
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories about that experience you can share with us?
Speaker 2: We worked very hard, very, very, very hard.  It, it unified the company [from the National Black Theatre, New York, New York].  It gave us an opportunity to exercise skills other than performing.  We had to build everything from scratch.  We didn't live in the best situation because everything was being developed--the housing, the accommodations.  We travelled a lot.  We didn't stay stuck in Lagos [Nigeria] like most people who went did.  We had buses and we travelled all over Nigeria because I wanted people to see the part of Nigeria that was indigenous that I loved.  Like I said, we lived in different places.  We did a film while we were there.  I went to the Durbar--ohh, this is a, a celebration.  It's only done once every fifty years, and to see all of these imams on these huge horses with all this jewelry and metal.  And, uhh, it was--spears, and horns, and such ceremony, such celebration, such (unclear).  You know, it's no way African people can be ignorant to their power when you are in, in those environments.  These people don't even know anything about slavery.  They don't know anything--African Americans say, they don't know anything about us over here.  They say we're white--they really do.  They don't have the foggiest idea, nor any sympathy, about our story.  That's why I say, the historical circumstances of my enslavement is now over.  The Middle Passage is complete.  I am now highly pleasing to myself, because that is an illusion and it is a story that they don't honor at all.  I went back to Africa in '84 [1984].  I did a whole forty-page position paper called 'Forgiveness Ritual' [ph.].  I was going to forgive my ancestors for putting me on the boat.  That caused a lot of mess (laughter), really, but, you know, it is what it is.  Yeah, so FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] was an incredible opportunity for the people that I brought over there to have their lives changed.
Speaker 1: What did you present over there?  You talked about this piece.  Can you talk to me about it?
Speaker 2: It was the piece that we did for seven years, called 'The Revival to Change, Love Together, Organize!' ['A Revival: Change, Love Together, Organize!' Barbara Ann Teer].  And I based the opening on the Gettysburg Address, "Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth to this--."  It was fabulous (laughter).  Reset it, rechange it, rethink it, figure out how come we--how come we supposed to be subservient, second class?  How come?  Who said that?  That's not real.  I brought nine Nigerians over here to build the interior of this building.  It is all gorgeous relief art with instruments that were seven generations old.  Now, how are you going to bring people over here to do this kind of art seven generations if, if they was these poor little uh-um, uh-um, uh-um?  So, you know, that's why I left show business.  It was a joke--for me.  I don't have to go over there.  I have to go in here to ask my ancestors in here, "What'cha you want me to do?  Is that what you sent me here for?"  Okay, I volunteered myself into a serving position, serving position, to learn the ways of the West.  I am in a sub-serving position.  I'm not subservient.  I'm sub-serving.  I surrender to no one but God.  That's the way I am, so words like subservient, like victim, like--I just rethink them, recha-, change them around because they are not relevant.  Even if I'm dead, I'm still alive.  And the only way I will not be alive is that you don't remember me.  Because I'm alive in your memory, and as long as I'm alive in your memory, I live.  And if I've chosen you to pray to the ancestors just because you can't see them doesn't mean they're not here.  It would be a different world, 'cause death wouldn't be the end.  When Oscar Brown [HistoryMaker Oscar Brown, Jr.] died last week, they said he had sixteen grandchildren.  He brought them all into the hospital room and he said, "Don't grieve over my passing because I had a good life.  I enjoyed it, every minute of it, and death is a natural process.  So, I'm going to another place, and I want you to hold your visions, to keep in touch with your dreams, to stay focused, and materialize what you say you want."  Now, he said that to his sixteen grandchildren so, you know, he's okay.
Story_ID: 315750
Speaker 1: So, what is it about, about what you've done, about all you've accomplished that you would like to be remembered; I mean, why did you agree to be a part of The HistoryMakers?  What is it you want to share or leave behind (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that my responsibility to pass on what I've done is important because young people nowadays suffer greatly because of ignorance and blindness.  You know, I tease my daughter [Sade Lythcott] all the time.  They know nothing about energy or maybe they do, but if they do, it don't show.  So, you got all these women, young women, on these videos shaking, what I call money makers, shaking and shaking, and being called bitches and dogs, and being abused when the women are the most powerful force on the planet.  They hold the creative life force.  It's like the earth.  It's called mother nature.  The earth does not make a distinction between color or anything.  If you plant a seed into the soil, which is black, it will grow beauty.  And I say the more problems you have, the greater your grace.  If you plant a seed in mother, the nature of life, it will grow.  Everybody that walks on the planet came from the womb of a woman, and now that they've discovered it was an African women called Lucy, that makes a lot of sense to me.  But the fact of the matter is women need to honor themselves.  They need to get that their responsibility and function is to nurture, to nourish, to care for.  We are the caretakers, and we haven't done a very good job because of, because of, because of, because.  However, if you set the record straight, you can get--that's why I'm doing a series of five women icons--Billie Holiday, Dorothy Dandridge, Marian Anderson, like--you have to rethink, reset, reformat their contribution to the world.  They were pioneers.  And they are remembered as tragic figures.  That is another one of those tricks that is played on us.  So, my job becomes to present them in a way that gives young people an understanding of their plight because it's universal, but also to ennoble them, and to have people say, "Oh, wow, she did that?"  So, for me, that's what my job is.  I, I know that entertainers, actors, performers, artists are ancient healers, and they chose to come here to heal.  And if they're doing anything other than transforming the culture that we exist in, or healing the people that come, or healing themselves first, they're wasting their time.  They got to come back again, and come back again, and come back again, because that's why we're here.  It's not by accident that the only thing that black people have done that is really remembered is sing, dance, and act.  Now, singing, dancing, and acting have been reduced to mun-, mundanity or whatever.  Like I said, if Malcolm [Malcolm X] say, "Stop singing, start swinging."  Or 'We Shall Overcome.'  We changed the world with song.  The Berlin Wall [Berlin, Germany] came down.  They were singing, 'We Shall--.'  We evoke a vibration.  We release an energetics that is so powerful when we sing 'cause it comes from our heart.  What did we doing on slavery day?  We stood out beside, we stood outside the master's window.  And we sang to him, and we put him to sleep, and we made him feel good--oh, we need to re--, you know, I really want to do 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' [Harriet Beecher Stowe].  I want to redo 'Uncle Tom.'  'Uncle Tom' is one of the most powerful figures in the history of this country.  But yet, we have been reduced, we have reduced Uncle Tom to some Uncle Tom; some subservient property who couldn't do nothing, but serve white folks and say, "Yes, boss, yes."  You read that Harriet Beecher Stowe, you read that thing real carefully.  And I'm putting it out there 'cause I should keep it to myself, so I can do it myself.  But if you really read, re-read that, you'll see one of the most powerful figures on the planet--how you could go through--and that's the Jesus Christ story.  The Jesus Christ story is really a collective black story for me.  That's who we are.  We came over here on these boats, crucified, sacrificing.  Everything is a sacrifice.  Life is a sacrifice.  You always have to give up something to get something.  So, that Jesus Christ story is another story that could be rethought as a collective Messiah.  That's us.  That's what I say.  And it ain't--it's not in any books.  It's not on any tapes until the--it's not--because I carefully select what I say because most often, it'll be misunderstood if it is not spoken into a discourse.  See, now, people are talking about quantum physics.  They're talking about reality shifts, virtual reality.  It's easy enough.  Quantum physics, who--we are the mathematicians.  We are walking mathematicians.  We are the quantum physicists.  We're the scientists of the planet, but we don't know it.

Speaker 1: So, when you look around you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you've created a wonderful space here [National Black Theatre, New York, New York].  And 125th Street has changed.  What do you think about the black arts community or the black theatre community as it looks to you today?
Speaker 2: Let me say this.  We're sitting inside 64,000 square feet of property.  I think I am the first, if not the only black woman, who has been awarded a loan back in a day that committed itself to a high risk community to build something cultural because we're not cultural country.  We're all into capitalism and art and stuff as a leisure and this is entertainment, and it's ha-ha-ha, he-he-he.  But this piece of property is 64,000 square feet.  It's got 32,000 on one side, and 32,000 on the other side.  According to my research, the first Africans who were landed in the 1555. From the year 1555 to the year 1619, which is the note, which is the date we think we've been taught we landed,  that was sixty-four years, so that's sixty-four missing years.  Those sixty-four missing years are represented in an energy station, a power station, which is this block corner, 5th Avenue, known all over the world for opulence, 125th culture known all over the world for culture.  You put culture, and you put opulence of wealth together, and you get this corner.  Underneath this corner, this building is a river.  The river runs from one side to the other side.  The river Osun in Osogbo [Nigeria] is symbolic of the art work that's running around in these walls in this building because we say that that is what we were sent here to do.  So that's why I know that when you are energetically rooted, you can get through, through the needle's eye, through anything.  This building is not so much the building.  It's the land.  It's the crossroads.  It's a wonder of the world for me because it represents the interaction between us coming here and us being here.  For the next generation to study how we got over because it's not in a book.  It's a living testimony to the power, the primary power of people of African descent.  And I happen to be a woman.  Took me a long time to get comfortable with that 'cause women are supposed to be subservient.  And I'm not that way, which means in a man's world, which is patriarchal, and this is a man's world, I'm real clear about that, it's a patriarchal world.  And it is also a world where controlling and conquering and, and conquest is the thing--obey the command position.  And you said any time--well, just sit down.  Well, if you're like me, when you walk in a room, people say, "Oh, God, here she comes, hmm," because I am not easy to get along with sometimes.  But I believe that culture is the bowl that holds it all.  You can put a little of this in it.  All these distinctions, politics, money--you put it in a bowl, and the bowl colors how you come out.  So, the way I was colored to come out, colored, colored, future thoughts, I could choose your words.  I say, that this omnipresence that's inside me does the work.  I just show up.  And if you do your ritual properly and you show up, you do whatever they tell you to do.  And a lot of times, it's not very comfortable for me because, you know, people say, "Who she thinks she is?"  And "She intimidates everybody." And "She's this, and she's"--and I don't actually.  I just do what I'm told to do.  And I, you know, when we first finished this building, I organized 3,500 school children.  And they held hands from river to river in T-shirts that say, "The endangered species is the African elephant," because the African elephant is endangered.  So, we held hands from river to river.  And I had three live elephants leading the parade, stilt dancers, steel drummers--you could name.  Now, nobody knows that, but the people who were here. People had never seen no live elephants running down 125th Street.  I blocked the street out from river to river and had these long lines, and it's on, it's on video.  But the fact of the matter is I've done things like this from the time I've been here.  And you don't see me in none of these books and in none of these televisions and stuff because I'm not going for the marketing.  I'm going for transforming the culture of the lives of the people that I serve.  And if that's what I'm doing until I have no more breath in my life, in my body, I will do that.  So, I think I answered your question in a roundabout way.
Story_ID: 315752
Speaker 1: So, as you look back over some of the things you shared today or possibly some of the things we've even forgotten to talk about, what do you think stands out most as you look back?
Speaker 2: That I was crazy (laughter).  People say, "Oh, she's crazy."  It used to hurt my feelings.  It doesn't any more.  What I think--my contribution has been the clarity of the programming and not the people.  I'm not angry at the people.  It's the programming that I attack, I attack, because the programming keeps us small.  And since I know it's only stories, illusions that somebody made up, they don't frighten me.  I want to be remembered for taking God out of the sky because there's no such thing, for taking the concept of heaven after life out of the books because there's no such thing.  It's all the programming.  And the other thing I want to be remembered for is that those--that programming is secondary power.  It's not primary power.  So, I want to be remembered to say to people, sit in the seat of your command, of your primary power.  Your primary power--take a command position, and sit in the seat of power, power.  Don't sit in the seat of--I can't have, I don't have no students like that, "Umm, I'm scared."  Scared of what?  Ohh--I call that self-conscious art.
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Teer [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Teer], if we had to throw a label on you, which are you willing to accept?  You are a--how do you see yourself?
Speaker 2: I'm an, I'm, I'm, I'm, I am an innovator, and I am a visionary, and I clearly live in my vision.  And I live in the vision from day to day.  I don't sit back and say, "Oh, one day--."  No, no.  I live the vision, and the vision that I live requires that I innovate everywhere I go.  And my innovation is to re-invent, to reset, to re-identify a victimized culture.  People who celebrate tragedy and suffering and struggle, into a celebration of life.  That in itself is an innovation.  And I will not do plays that celebrate victimization.
Story_ID: 315753
Speaker 1: So, why do you think it's important to be here today?  Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: History is important because it is necessary to tell a story of the past that will ennoble people, and lift them up to a higher vibration of being.  If history, they say, his story, if history only keeps you stuck in the past where you have no way of being ennobled, where your culture is one that doesn't let you walk and breathe, enjoy, then it is worthless.  So, for me, doing this is, again, like you drop little water on the sidewalk, on the concrete, if you drop it long enough, the concrete will crack.  So, maybe what I'm doing might make a difference to somebody somewhere at some time.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 315754
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes now for the black community?
Speaker 2: Hope is a word that is not in my vocabulary because there is no action in hope.  Now, having said that (laughter), this community [Harlem, New York, New York] has totally transformed itself from the drugs, and the rats and the roaches, and the crime, and the bullets shooting over your head, a park that you couldn't walk in because you never knew if somebody was going to snatch your pocketbook.  It's a beautiful park a block away from me.  I own three brownstones on Striver's Row, which I bought back in the '70s [1970s] for my theatre staff [at the National Black Theatre, New York, New York].  And everybody else has sold their brownstones because the price that we bought them for has quadrupled.  I mean brownstones go around a million five [$1.5 million], two million, millions--.  And I still hold onto mine.  So, my whole community, my block has transformed itself into a community that I don't really know, because most of the people who buy the brownstones are not black.  So, you come here on Sunday, you see lines around the block to get to the churches 'cause they want some soul.  And you see very few junkies or drug addicts on the street.  All the vendors from 123rd Street from river to river were taken off brutally by the government, the city, because the store owners didn't want them there.  So, there's no more glamour and glitz in selling stuff on the street.  It's clean.  And I'm told that all this was designed years and years and years and years ago.  So, that means that people do plan for the next generation, and the next generation, and the next generation.  We don't, but people do because we've been locked into struggle.  So, now, this community is transformed, and it's even more so coming.  I mean, hotels, three or four hotels are being (unclear), you know.
Story_ID: 315755
Speaker 1: Hotels, you said you, that's where you were--
Speaker 2: There, you know, Harlem [New York, New York] doesn't or didn't have any hotels, so.  And, actually, Harlem didn't have any theaters, live theaters, movie houses, no social--nothing social was here, which meant you had to go downtown if you wanted to dance, if you wanted to look at a movie.  Anything to give relief was not in this community.  So, the money would go downtown.  You couldn't buy anything that was halfway decent.  We always got the second-class of everything.  So, the people themselves were not served at all.  But now, that this whole gentrification, naw, naw, naw, naw, is here, they're opening up all these big stores, and we have a movie theatre.  And, you know, there was no sports.  There was nothing in Harlem and that's all changed.  The parks were very unsafe.  Now, the parks have been gardened and landscaped.  They're beautiful and, unfortunately, we feel it's not a cause of us.  It's because other people are coming in, but the property value--there's no place left to buy, or to build but here.  So, Harlem is one of the--you could--there's a bus on every corner.  There's a subway on every other corner.  It's a phenomenal piece of property.  And it is sought after now--like mad.  So, it's interesting to live through that and to watch that.  This community is no longer--it's the pride of New York [New York], of Manhattan now.  And I happen to be the only one that's black that owns anything from river to--you know.  It's, it's not--I don't feel good about it.  I feel very sad about it, but it's never a moment you can rest.  You always see respect.  Space produces the result.  If you don't have a space that I can stay here as long as I want to--no union is going to tell me, turn the lights off.  It's time--we got to go.  I, I couldn't live like that.  So, the rest of the theatres don't have their own space.  And they honestly say they don't want to be responsible for it.  So, what is the price that I pay?  The price that I pay, the sacrifice is that I don't perform--I don't write books.  I don't do mainstream stuff because I'm always busy doing this.  So, if I want to write plays and perform in plays, you know, I could do that 'cause I own the space.  But I get such joy out of watching--my daughter [Sade Lythcott] playing the lead in 'Dorothy Dandridge' ['Dorothy Dandridge: Before, After & Now'].  Now, she's fabulous, and I enjoy watching her every night.  I just do.  And I think that at a certain point, I let go of this, the paradigm of glitz, glamour, fame, fortune.  Success is my name in lights.  And one day, I, I let that go.  First, I didn't let it go with joy, but I knew I wasn't going to go through what you need to go through to do that.  Or half your budget goes to marketing, and I wasn't going to do that either.  So, Harlem has changed.  There needs to be a black theatre on every corner.  I wonder--my question, as I said to you before, what comes after integration, you know?  You swim through the ocean, and you dive through all the sharks.  And then, you get to the bank, and you stand up, and you shake the water off, and you say, "I'm here!"  And it's like, "What?"  It's more of the same.  So, I don't know what comes after integration.  I do know that I'm not--I took struggle out of my vocabulary.  I took surrender out of my vocabulary.  I'm here as long as the gods and the ancestors want me to be here on this corner.  And I am a teacher by nature, and anybody comes to me, I will give them what I got.  And I have very little patience for bubbling actresses and actors who want to make it on Broadway.  I think that's necessary, and it's good, but that's not my direction, so I don't encourage that in this space [National Black Theatre, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What do you encourage in this space?
Speaker 2: Family, healing, transformation, serving, loving, unity, oneness, holding on, being vulnerable to each other, being respectful.  My vision is to create a new cultural leadership of entrepreneurial artists that will bring dignity and autonomy into the communities in which they work, live, and serve.  I choose to be in this community.  I didn't have to be in this community.  I choose to stay in this community.  I don't have to stay in this community.  It's the difference.
Story_ID: 315756
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Global--I want it to be global.  I want it to be all over the world--that the Western world was transformed into a celebration of life and joy and aliveness by a world wonder on the corner of 125th Street and 5th Avenue [at the National Black Theatre, New York, New York]--not through television, which would be all right, but that the media was oral.  It was passed on from generation to generation.  That's authentic--that it did that because people said, "Did you know," and have--people don't even know what this building is.  They pass it and they think it's a museum.  They see the stuff inside and they go like--we have not been graffitied.  Beauty is beauty.  It speaks to the soul.  Those are the experiments that I want to pass on.  All these things they say about people, black people, it's not true--for me.  My black is gorgeous.  I changed it.  And every day we're out there sweeping--not because of a anti-poverty program, grant to do whatever.  So, my art form, I want it to be remembered, and I want it to be taught, and I want it to be mastered.  The beauty of the environment, I want it to be duplicated because we must live in beautiful environments.  We must pay attention to detail, and we must not be hate nuts.  The concept of scarcity is a lie.  The universe is not scarce.  It's abundant.  So, I have worked very hard to break the poverty law to let people know that the healing, and our finances, and our economics is necessary.  But if you do it the other way, you're going to always be broke.  But three-dimensional reality of outside in, that power position will never make it.  Black theatres will never make it.  You must get that.  If you don't rethink how come we're broke all the time, how come we never have any money, how come we're always complaining, that just is giving power to another group of people.  So, that's what I want to be remembered for--breaking the poverty law, changing the concept of scarcity into, into abundance, and knowing that the universe is abundant, knowing that you can have whatever you say you want just because you said it--not because nobody, just 'cause you said it, 'cause you have the power of the I-am-ness within you to intend what you want to have happen.  That takes a lot of work.
Story_ID: 315757
Speaker 1: So there are a few things we're going to go back to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get some more theatre stories.  Can you explain to me what FESTAC '77 [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] was--
Speaker 2: FESTAC '77 [1977]--
Speaker 1: --FESTAC.
Speaker 2: --was the festival of arts, cultured art, the first one.  Festacs are the festival, fes- festival of culture and art, African festival of culture and art, whatever.  Now, I forgot, what Festac stands for--festival of culture and art, Fes, F-E-S--.
Speaker 1: International festival of African culture and art; culture, yeah.
Speaker 2: African, African culture and art, yeah.  And it was hosted by the Nigerian government and it was in Lagos, Nigeria.  And for at least a year and a half, they toured all over Nigeria looking for the finest representations of art and culture.  We made a distinction between secular and sacred.  There's lots of art that's sacred--ritualistic.  There's--and there's lots of people who would like to be powerful like sacred art, but they can't, so they do secular.  So, it was that combination of that; bringing everybody together, and then they invited every country, African country, so there were fifty countries from Africa represented in this festival.
Speaker 1: And the purpose of the festival was to do what?
Speaker 2: I think it was to unify us, and get us powerful to know that we had this gorgeous phenomenal experience.  But it was to let African people meet African people--let, let everybody get to, to be a community, know that we are the culturists, the, the artists of the world, and like that.  So, we got to meet people that we would never get to meet.  We got to exchange conversations about culture and, and its expression.  We got to, to be one, you know.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of those conversations?  What did people talk about when they were--?
Speaker 2: Well, for me, I was in a position of leadership.  I didn't get to talk about nothing but problems (laughter).  I was constantly--we had to do, we, we produced a film.  We travelled throughout the countryside.  We--I took my company [from the National Black Theatre, New York, New York].  I had all these people, uhh.
Speaker 1: What was the title of the film?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even know anymore.  We have it.
Speaker 1: Is it still around?
Speaker 2: We, yeah, we have it, we have it, we have it.
Speaker 1: What's the film about?
Speaker 2: National Black Theatre coming to Africa, and what we went, where we went.  We met--how we did it, how we prayed at the river Osun.  It was--it was a historical document of our return home.
Speaker 1: So, in two years, 2007, that's the thirty year anniversary of you having gone?
Speaker 2: You know, I never thought about that.
Speaker 1: So, we should see that film up here, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: They got it in the office.  We show it every now and then.
Story_ID: 315758
Speaker 1: So, you said you met Malcolm [Malcolm X] three times.  Can you--what was the nature of those meetings?
Speaker 2: Just talking in a restaurant.  My husband at the time, Godfrey Cambridge, was the reason that I got to meet him the first time.  [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis was the reason I got to meet--Ossie Davis was the best man at my wedding.  My husband at the time was the lead in 'Purlie Victorious' ['Purlie'].  'Purlie Victorious' was a Broadway show.  It was a musical--it wasn't a musical--when it was done, it wasn't a musical, but it turned out to be one.  Ossie, Ruby [HistoryMaker Ruby Dee], Godfrey--we were all very close.  I met Malcolm through them.  I was very impressed to the point that I did a film on his life called 'Rise: Love Song for Love People' [sic. 'Rise--A Love Poem for A Love People'].  That film has won a lot of little awards up here.  That film is available to see.  It's fabulous.  We did it in a park.  And in the theatre space. We reenacted his life with poetry.  And we went through the assassination, and we had him, as I always do, rise up from the dead, and go into another plane.  That seems to be my trademark.  I did do, I did Tupac [Tupac Shakur] that way.  And I, I'm doing Dorothy Dandridge that way.  It makes a lot of people very nervous, but there's a life after this life.
Speaker 1: When you say you did Tupac that way, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: We produced 'Tupac.'
'Tupac: Resurrection'?
Speaker 2: 'Resurrection.'  Well, actually, the movie was based on what we did.  And I had Tupak born in Africa, the whole nine yards.  At a very young age, his mother sent him over here and she came.  And then, I had his whole hip-hop life here and his death.  And then his resurrection.
Story_ID: 315759
Speaker 1: Did you have any contact ever with Melvin Van Peebles [HistoryMaker Melvin Van Peebles]?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you--?
Speaker 2: There's nobody--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --in show business that has not met me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because Godfrey [Godfrey Cambridge] was in 'Watermelon Man.'  Was that a Melvin Van Peebles--?
Speaker 2: You know, Godfrey did those things.  I divorced Godfrey, or Godfrey and I got divorced--let's put it like that.  Don't say--but I did--in 1964, when I came up here [Harlem, New York, New York], 'cause at first, he wasn't in favor of me doing all this.  But I know Melvin.  I know--I mean, Cosby [Bill Cosby] and all of them used to sit in my house, and I know them, yeah, I know them.
Story_ID: 315760
Speaker 1: Well, who did you align yourself with?  Who did you think like these guys are on my team?  These are the people I can work with.  These are the people who get what I'm doing.
Speaker 2: My mother [Lila Benjamin Teer], my father [Fred Teer] and my sister [Frederica Lila Teer], and the people that I taught.  If I didn't teach you, you wouldn't be on my team.  It was too, it was too far outside the box what I was doing.
Speaker 1: What do you think was so intimidating about it, that it--about, or describe what you were, what you were doing exactly to me again, and, and give me--.
Speaker 2: People make lots of money from being victims.  There's poverty programs, there's seed [ph.] program--.  All those programs back then that day, they made their money from us being victims.  So, if you come along and you say, uh-uh, that's their bread and butter.  You're not to going to stop that.  That's number one.  Number two, this society is steeped in a story that is divided into two kind of people--black people, white people, good people, bad people, right people, wrong people.  So, if you don't fit into any one of those categories, what are you going to do?  And then, there's a whole series of descriptions of what a good person is.  And so, you got to do that and get approval.  And who's going to approve you--ohh?  The Almighty One without a second, so you walk around scared.  You're born in sin, oh, my God.  If I don't do it right, I'm going to be ostracized.  And if I don't get a degree, if I don't get a title, if I don't get a good job, if I don't see--ahh, ahh, ahh.  So, when you come along and you say, "Hey, hey, guys, wrong-headed.  There's nobody out there.  Anything you, you experience, you created it.  You want to talk about slavery, you created it."  "Ohh, I did not create slavery.  Why, maybe it was a (unclear), you know."  No, no, no, no, no.  You empower people when you talk about them like that--stop talking about them.  Talk about yourself.  What about your own value?  Who are you?  Uhh, uhh--like that.  That's very--especially in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  I mean, the, the problems I had with just telling people that our ancestors put us on the boat.  That was horrifying to people.  What does that do to history books?  Those stories are--how are you going to have any dignity in those stories?  And every year, once a year, you get a week, then it turns to be a month [Black History Month] to, to, to immerse yourself in stories that only keep you down.  There's nothing wrong with stories.  They're stories, but you have to reshape those stories, so that you come out feeling like, wow!  Against all odds, I did that?  Underground Railroad--do you realize what that must have been like?  Ohh--and on and on.  But we don't, we don't tell those stories because we don't have that mindset.  We're still responding, interacting--no, reacting to the programming of being second-class citizens.  Property, sold on a, on a, on a, on a slave block.  Well, that's true, factually.  But what did it produce?  Whew!  We need to observe more, and not read so much.  If you observe life--just, just observe the earth, the mother, and see what happens.  You plant a mustard seed and it grows into a huge tree, on and on and on.  A drop of water, keep on a mountain, you can, you can bring the mountain down.  You have to, we have to study nature to see who we are, because we certainly ain't going to find out in those books.  I don't like walking down the street here and how people speak to each other.  Little children--slapping them upside their head, screaming at them.  Well, well, how we going to turn out like this if our conditioning is that way?  There is, there is no school that teaches you how to love yourself.  There's no school that teaches you economics--really.  We're scared of math--how, we are mathematicians, walking, but, I don't know how, how.  It's wrong-headed, wrong-headed, wrong-headed.  So, I say that thinking the way I think makes it difficult for me to be who I am.  But I have to be who I am 'cause what else am I going to be (laughter)?  Anyway, yeah.  People should come to the National Black Theatre [New York, New York], and study in our alternative learning environment because it is that environment that empowers people to be who they were born to be.
Story_ID: 315761
Speaker 1: Why do you think theatre is the vehicle that you use to get this across?
Speaker 2: Because theatre--theatre art by its nature is a healing art.  Every tool of theatre is a vibration that, when put together, will transform the consciousness of the people--lights, sound, all energetics, color, performance, spoken word, dance, music, the language of God, song, preacher rhythms.  Why do you go to a Baptist church, holy water church [Pentecostal church], and the preacher just say the same thing over and over and over and over, and half the time, they don't know what he's saying, but they get caught up in the rhythm.  Boxing, you study the, the feet of, of Muhammad Ali--all of that-iambic pentameter--that's supposed to be Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  You study these rhythms--you'll see the same rhythmic patterns.  Just put on top of them a different story.  If you put on top of them a different story, you could change the world.  There should be a theatre on every corner, not a liquor store, and it's okay, not a church, and it's okay.  There are eight churches in one block in this community--one block.  Why are people going to church all the time?  Those are the kinds of things books can be written on.  How do we survive this--books, theatre. Paul Robeson, he's a great one.  [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, great one.  Study their lives.  Look what he went through--Paul Robeson.  Why did he have to go through that--'cause he was attacking, you know, he wasn't even attacking.  He was reacting to the culture of someone else.  And people take it seriously.  They think you're attacking them.  I'm attacking the programming that lives inside this house that God built.  And if they don't get it, it's because they're still ignorant and blind.  So, you keep studying, you keep learning until you can address the very essence of who we are.  So, if it were not for a soul journey to truth--that's what I call it--soul journey.  If it wasn't for Mary McLeod Bethune; if it wasn't for Harriett Tubman, if it wasn't for--you know it must be a million of them.  But we only hear about those that are selected.  The Paul Robesons; we only hear about those that were selected.  And every one of them died in prison, or being a victim, being a Jesus Christ.  So, who wants to be like that?  Young people don't want to be like that.  So, I decided to do historical icons that were contemporary, so that young people wouldn't have to say, "Uhh, I'm not from Africa.  Oh, I don't know nothing about slavery.  Uhh, we--."  Please.  So, if you just take Dorothy Dandridge, or you take Billie Holiday, and you study those lives.  These are awesome women, awesome women.  Billie Holiday, when you say Billie Holiday, those people who remember her, say, "Oh, she was a drug addict."  That's what they remember.  They don't know about what she did to the music industry.   They don't know the impact that she did to, to transform the whole musical world of this kind.  They don't know that.  Nobody writes about that.  [HistoryMaker] Donald Bogle wrote a five hundred some odd page book about Dorothy Dandridge.  It's very beautiful, very detailed.  And you study it.  I have people in the audience that cry at the end when I elevate her--Dorothy Dandridge said it--because it's their life.  They tell you the stories that said, "I did this for my daughter, and I--," 'cause Ruby Dandridge was more powerful than Dorothy Dandridge.  You just don't remember 'cause Ruby Dandridge did maids, so but when you really see the relationship between the mother and the daughter, that relationship is universal out of love.  But we don't have plays about that.  We just talk about--you know.  So, I'm saying that we need theatres to heal our consciousness.  We need theatres to transform our culture.  We need theatres that will show the difference between art that flows from the heart, which I call action art, and when you leave you're proactive, you're ready to do something.  You don't just go and get drunk or sit at the restaurant and talk about--you're energized.  And that's what I emit in my little theatres.  I have two--that's what I do.

Speaker 1: You said you'd like to talk more about the history of theatre possibly.  Is there something you wanted to say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know what.  I think that what is amazing to me is I don't know how it happened, but from the time you walk into this space downstairs [at the National Black Theatre, New York, New York], you have all the young people who were born here in the '70s [1970s] now working here.  I don't know how it happened 'cause they went through whatever they went through.  And that's a very interesting feeling.  And they were all born in this theatre.  They were trained in this theatre.  They travelled all over the place with us in this theatre.  They were not put in regular schools until third grade.  And the only reason they were put in regular schools was because of the fire.  And then, they just went their own way.  But they're all coming back now, so that the sustainability of this institution is already in place.  That I didn't do anything.  I mean, I didn't know I was doing that.  When we turn inward, and not outward, we will see that our ancestors are very much present.  And if we honor them, kneel to them for what they went through, glorify their names, our lives would be much different.  We have so many challenges with economics and politics and money, which is a social symbol of relationships, as far as I'm concerned.  Our minds are full of clutter with debt all over the world.  And we don't see how it connects to our discourse.  Once we get who we really are, our inner fullness of the possibility of who we can be, will change the world.  And that's what I want to be remembered by.  And I will only be remembered if people come like you and let me talk (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --because I don't have time to write a book.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, you're welcome.

Speaker 1: This picture was taken at FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] which we talked about in 1977.  Stevie Wonder is a very famous musician/singer, and he was there as a part of FESTAC.  [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan, who was the head of the Nation of Islam, was there as a part of FESTAC.  However, it was right after Malcolm X was assassinated.  And Minister Farrakhan was not considered who he is now because everybody thought that he had something to do with Malcolm's assassination.  So, he was in Nigeria in a very humble position, and because I knew who he was, and I was up in a booth with the president and all of those guys, I came down and I got him and said, "If you can't sit up there with the hierarchies, then I'll stay down here with you."  And that picture was taken because Stevie came to shake his hand and so, I did, too.  That's FESTAC.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  So, but roughly, it would have been 2000?

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next photo, please.
Speaker 1: That's FESTAC, 1977, in Nigeria in the stadium, with hundreds and thousands of African people.  It was sort of like the Olympics.

And all the countries had to go around in a circle in the stadium, and greet the crowds of people, and we were the lead company.
