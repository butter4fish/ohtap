Story_ID: 532957
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're gonna start with your, your childhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And basically your mother, your mother's side of the family.  Your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Wilhelmine, W-I-L-H-E-L-M-I-N-E, Mohr, M-O-H-R, Bradford, B-R-A-D-F-O-R-D [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford].
Speaker 1: And she was b- her date of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born May 30th, 1926.
Speaker 1: Her place of birth?
Speaker 2: Springfield, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell me about your mother's childhood?  Stories she relayed to you about her childhood.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather [Dean Mohr] was a graduate of Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and was a traveler in many ways.  My mother's mother [Jessica Burgette Mohr] died when she was very early.  So there were five girls and, and two boys, and they moved around a lot.  My grandfather at one point was president of Paul Quinn College [Waco, Texas].  He was also, he also ran the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] f- in the State of Georgia for colored, so they lived in Texas, they lived in Georgia.  Also, my grandfather relocated to Florida t- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What part of Florida?
Speaker 2: St. Petersburg, Florida.  So my mother moved around a lot as a child, and in some ways other members of the family, the extended family, were surprised that my grandfather was able to keep the family together after my mother's mother died.  My grandfather later remarried, and so she had a stepmother during that time, as well.
Speaker 1: When did she have a stepmother, at what age?
Speaker 2: I want to say at ten to about six- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So she was still a little girl?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did your grandfather have the opportunity to go to school?  What did his parents do?  Your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about my great-grandfather, but my great-grandmother was the first, as I understand, regis- black registered nurse in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Well, do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she was the first registered, black registered nurse in--
Speaker 2: Chicago.
Speaker 1: --Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which allowed, I mean, they were educated then?
Speaker 2: Yes, and he was born in Chicago.  So, I don't know what the confluence of events were that allowed him to go to Ohio State at the time.
Speaker 1: And why Ohio State?  Do you know that at all?
Speaker 2: I don't.  It may have been because that was a place that blacks could, in fact, get a college education.  He had a degree in pharmacology.  He ended up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he--go ahead.
Speaker 2: --being, he ended up being a basketball coach at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in the early stages (background nosie).
Story_ID: 532958
Speaker 1: Okay.  Continuing with your grandfather.  You were going to give me his full name.
Speaker 2: His full name was Charles Dean Mohr [Dean Mohr].  Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Dean, D-E-A-N, Mohr, M-O-H-R.
Speaker 1: And his place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Chicago [Illinois], he was born in Chicago, September 13th, 1894.
Speaker 1: So, his mother that you're talking about that was the registered nurse?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She must have been born right after slavery--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had ended.  And somehow the fa- she managed to go off to school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And to study nursing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But that's all you know about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any story, any other stories about her?
Speaker 2: I don't have any others, and it's unfortunate because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your mother's [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford]--because?  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I just think my fa- my grandfather did not talk of much, talk much about his family, and so there wasn't really much, there was no, very little documentation.
Speaker 1: So your m- the registered nurse.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did--and, and she--all you know about her is that small amount, that she was a registered nurse?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But we can assume that she was born right after--
Speaker 2: I think, yes.  I think you would have to assume that she was born right after the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Civil War, and it was s-
Speaker 2: After slavery.
Speaker 1: After slavery.  So did anyone talk about legends, or s- or slaves, any slaves in the family, or were they f- were they born free?  What stories have you heard about that--
Speaker 2: On that side of the family, very little.  On my mother's s- on my grandmother's [Jessica Burgette Mohr] side of the family, there's a lot more history.  At least, more stories about what, what took place.
Speaker 1: So how did--any pictures of your grandfather and great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: I do have pictures of my grandfather, I couldn't find them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What does, what did he look like?
Speaker 2: He was about 5'2", he was called Juggy [ph.] Mohr.  He had a large head, and apparently was a pretty good athlete.
Speaker 1: Was he dark skinned, light skinned?
Speaker 2: He was brown skinned.
Speaker 1: Brown skinned.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So his father was not white?
Speaker 2: His father was not white, no.
Speaker 1: No.  But somebody's father was white at some point?
Speaker 2: No, my great-gran- my great-grandmother was Irish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the story goes that she had come across from Ireland for an arranged marriage, and her be- intended spouse didn't show up on the docks of New York [New York].  And that she was then befriended by Black Sam [ph.], who was my great-grandfather, and, and he found her work.  And he was apparently a servant, and they ultimately ended up getting married, moving to Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and had three daughters, of which my grandmother was one.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Why Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  That one was strange to me.  I would have thought New York would have been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a more logical place, but I don't know why Milwaukee.
Story_ID: 532959
Speaker 1: Now that I have it straight in my head.  We're still talking about your mother's [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So your great-grandmother--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from Ireland--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --what's her name?
Speaker 2: You would ask that question.  I don't remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  We'll return to--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Mary Cartey.
Speaker 1: Mary Cartey.
Speaker 2: From County Cork, Ireland.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Continuing, your great-grandmother's name was Mary.
Speaker 1: Was named, I'm sorry, it was Alice Cartey [ph.].
Speaker 2: Alice Cartey, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she's from Ireland?
Speaker 1: She was from Ireland.
Speaker 2: So she met Black Sam [ph.]--
Speaker 1: She met Black Sam--
Speaker 2: --on the docks of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: --on the docks of New York.
Speaker 2: They moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How many children did they have?
Speaker 1: They had three girls.
Speaker 2: And name the three girls?
Speaker 1: Jessica Burgette [Jessica Burgette Mohr], Marie Burgette, and Wilhelmine Burgette.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother is named after Wilhelmine.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then, and Wilhelmine--okay.
Speaker 1: But my grandmother was Jessica.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So moving forward then to, let's--any other stories about that side of the family you can think of?
Speaker 1: Nothing really.  I mean, the fact that my grandfather [Dean Mohr]--my grand- my grandmother died early, my grandfather moved the family around as his jobs took him, which had to be unusual during those times.  That he went to school in Ohio [at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], ended up being a coach at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  At some point, becoming the president of Paul Quinn College [Waco, Texas] and then becoming head of the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] at some point in Georgia, and then ultimately moving to Florida.
Speaker 2: Wow, that's impressive for those times.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You also said that your mother never got to meet, or only met Alice once.
Speaker 1: My understanding is she had, she had met her very early in her life, but she doesn't have much of a remembrance (unclear).
Speaker 2: So do you know what happened to Alice and Sam after they moved to Milwaukee?
Speaker 1: I don't.  I assume that they lived a normal life and passed on at some point.  'Cause obviously my mother who is born in '26 [1926], her mother was born in 1894, as well, so they would have been very elderly at the time.  She was a little older.
Speaker 2: So, your mother being born in '26 [1926], does she ever talk about them suffering any during the Depression [Great Depression]?  Or she was too young to remember?
Speaker 1: She never talked about them suffering during the Depression.  That is sort of interesting.  I didn't--
Speaker 2: So they moved around a lot?
Speaker 1: For, for those times, yes.
Speaker 2: And it was because of his employment?  Because of his jobs, the jobs he was taking (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because of his jobs.  I mean if you think about what he did, certainly being a basketball coach in those days was--you were a jack of all trades, I'm sure he probably taught some classes as well.  But running the WPA in, for the State of Georgia would have been an interesting kind of position.  I'm not sure how you, how you interview or recruit for those kind of positions, or how you get those positions, and then ultimately becoming president of a college and then moving, moving to St. Petersburg [Florida].
Speaker 2: Well, he--what year do you know, did he become president of the college?
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't know.
Speaker 2: But he was, yeah, it was early on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My assumption is, you know, you were talking about the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s], my mother--my f- my grandfather, one thing I forgot to mention, he was over the USO [United Service Organizations] club in Pensacola, Florida at one point because that's where my father [Earle Bradford, Sr.] met my mother, she was working in, at the, the naval base in Pensacola [Naval Air Station Pensacola].
Story_ID: 532960
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother's [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] life then.  She's one of how many?  Seven, you said?
Speaker 2: She's one of seven, yes.
Speaker 1: And can you give me just a brief description and the order of her other siblings?
Speaker 2: Her oldest brother is Dean Mohr.
Speaker 1: And what happened to Dean?
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: He became what?
Speaker 2: He became, he was one of the Tuskegee Airmen, retired as a full colonel from the [U.S.] Air Force, and then worked a bit after that.  And recen- passed in the last five years, I guess.
Speaker 1: So he was the oldest.
Speaker 2: He was the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then Jessica--I'm sorry, Jane was the, the oldest daughter.  She was the principal of a school in Pembroke, Georgia, and she's--
Speaker 1: Pembroke, is that outside of Atlanta [Georgia]?  Pretty close--
Speaker 2: No, it's outside of Savannah [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Savannah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she's since passed.  Jessica [Jessica Mohr (ph.)]--
Speaker 1: What was her name?  Full name?
Speaker 2: Jane Mohr Dingle--
Speaker 1: Dingle, okay.
Speaker 2: --was her married name.  And Jessica, who is still, still alive, is formerly the superintendent of schools in suburban Chicago [Illinois].  I think it's the, I want to call it the Thornhill [ph.] school district.  And she ended up, she was superintendent of schools, she's now president of the school board in that same area.
Speaker 1: How old is she?
Speaker 2: She has to be eighty- I want to say eighty-four.  But she's eighty-two to eighty-four.  My mother's eighty.  So I think she's, she may be eighty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, then the next one was my mother who is eighty and basically was a housewife all her life.  Then my Aunt Pauline [ph.] who is a nurse in Augusta, Georgia, and she was Pauline Mohr--I can't remember her married name.  And then my Aunt Charlotte, who was Charlotte Mohr McCoy [Alice Mohr McCoy] who was a pharmacist, owned a pharmacy in St. Petersburg, Florida, and then later on served as a pharmacist for Walgreens [Walgreens Company].  And then--
Speaker 1: What year did she serve as a pharmacist with Walgreens?
Speaker 2: This is recent.  I mean, she--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She probably re- was forced to retire about five years ago--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Walgreens.  But she had owned her own pharmacy, 22nd Street pharmacy [Doctors Pharmacy] in St. Petersburg for a number of years.  Then my Uncle Paul [Paul Mohr], who's the youngest, formerly dean of education at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and president of Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama], now works for the State of Alabama department of education [Alabama Commission on Higher Education].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were, basically, they were all educators, or--and educated themselves.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 532961
Speaker 1: Now, why did your mother [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] choose to stay home when all of her siblings were doing--
Speaker 2: Well, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean why did she choose to be a stay at home mom?
Speaker 2: Well I think my mother got married before she finished college, and, and I think that the--
Speaker 1: There's no need to work, so she didn't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean she had a challenge enough raising two kids, you know so that's what she did, basically.
Speaker 1: And it's you and--?
Speaker 2: My sister, Earlette Breck- Bradford Breckenridge [Earlette Bradford Breckenridge].  She's--
Speaker 1: Younger or older?
Speaker 2: She's younger, she's three years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what else did your mother say about her childhood that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the fact that she lost her mother [Jessica Burgette Mohr] early in life, the family was very close.  The siblings were very close.  And she talked about when her oldest brother [Dean Mohr] went off to college [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and, and the challenges that he had.  And, and then the rest of them, and how they decided to pursue their education and the like.  But they were very close and still are very close.
Speaker 1: Where did they end up settling, spending most of say her teen years and early adult years?  Was that in St. Petersburg [Florida]?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually Waco, Texas; Albany, Georgia; and obviously the latter part in Pensacola, Florida.  'Cause I think when my grandfather [Dean Mohr] was at Paul Quinn College [Waco, Texas] that was in the middle, probably in her early teens, and then Albany, Georgia before moving to Pensacola.
Story_ID: 532962
Speaker 1: When did she [Bradford's mother, Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] meet your father?  She was working at the USO [United Service Organizations], you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the, in the mid- I would assume 1945.
Speaker 1: What's your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Earle Lacour Bradford, Sr. [Earle Bradford, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And his date of birth?
Speaker 2: March 11th, 1922.  I'm sorry, 1924.
Speaker 1: And his place of birth?
Speaker 2: St. Joseph, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Is that close to New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: It's probably a couple hundred miles from New Orleans in the Mississippi Delta.  North, if you think about New Orleans is a--Louisiana is a sort of horseshoe, it would be up where the--
Speaker 1: Mississippi Delta is on that--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, kind of, the middle of the state--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the northern (unclear) of the state.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did your father, what does your father say, what did he say about his childhood?
Speaker 2: My father was the child of an illicit relationship.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means that he, his father was white, his mother [Mary Brown Bradford] was black, and to his knowledge that relationship was consensual.  But he was an outcast in many ways because of that relationship, and he was not well received by his mother.  And, and there was an attempt at some point in his life for him to be killed as a result of his dad, and he was protected by an elderly aunt, Aunt Sylvia [ph.], who made sure that nothing happened to him.  So as a kid, he ran away from home a lot.  Every--after school, he really loved school, but when school was over he would run away.  He probably ran away three times and came to New Orleans.  And St. Joseph is about two hundred miles from New Orleans, so he would hitchhike and come to New Orleans and work.
Speaker 1: What section of New Orleans did he go to live?  I mean, you hear about the Storyville section of New Orleans during that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, during those time, that was really all there was, I mean, there were, there were, you know, there was not the suburban, there was not the urban sprawl that exists today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you lived in basically the immediate center city, what we then called Uptown [New Orleans, Louisiana].  So--but I don't know very much about where he lived, I know more about where he worked.
Speaker 1: Where did he work?
Speaker 2: He talked about a place called Glux [ph.], which--basically as a dishwasher.  So he'd earn enough money, and then he'd come back to St. Joseph when it was time to go back to school.  And then he'd run away again.
Speaker 1: Did he know who his father was, did he know the man?  Like had he seen him?
Speaker 2: He knew, he knew the name.
Speaker 1: And the name was?
Speaker 2: Name was Willie Peete.  But he knew the, his--Willie Peete's mother was Ms. Lacour.  So my dad really named himself.  So he'd been called Earle, but he, he added the E to Earle, and he added Lacour as a middle name, and he took on the last name of his stepfather, who was Leon Bradford, who really adopted him.  And if you looked at his birth certificate, it would show Leon Bradford as his dad.  But that was not the case.
Speaker 1: So Ms. Lacour, you know, the woman, the, you know--
Speaker 2: The grandmother.
Speaker 1: The grandmother.  Did he have any contact with her?  Did she know about the relationship her son had had with his mother?
Speaker 2: I don't know, he never discussed it.  And I often wanted to know what--you know, how did he know who his dad was, and, and one of, I assume one of his cousins, older cousins, or even his older aunt, told him about it.  And he often wondered whether or not he wanted to meet his dad.  And--but then he found out that he had died in a fire or something, a crash in Mississippi.  So he never did.  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So just having that history, what did that force him to do?  Did he eventually leave rural Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and move to New Orleans to live?
Speaker 2: He moved after the, after World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: Did he go to the war?  Did he--
Speaker 2: Well, he served in the [U.S.] Navy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he did not go overseas.  He ended up moving back initially to Opelousas, Louisiana where my grandmother had then moved.  And--
Speaker 1: Which, your, his, which, his mother?
Speaker 2: His mother.  His mother and stepfather had moved to Opelousas, so he moved to Opelousas initially, then realized that he was--it was too small a town for him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was a city boy by then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he ended up then moving his family, or his wife who was expecting, to New Orleans, and I was born in New Orleans at the--not long af- after that, I guess.
Story_ID: 532963
Speaker 1: So he [Bradford's father, Earle Bradford, Sr.] met your mother [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] when he was in the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: On--at the, in, at the f-
Speaker 2: At the Pensacola naval base USO [United Service Organizations].
Speaker 1: Pensacola base [Naval Air Station Pensacola, Pensacola, Florida] where she was working with her father [Dean Mohr], with her dad.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So he knew your, his, your, his, her father before they probably started to see each other, or at least knew who he was because they were at the same base?
Speaker 2: At least, he knew who she was.
Speaker 1: Because they were on the same base?
Speaker 2: Right, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what year did they marry?
Speaker 2: They married in June of 1945.  June 1st, 1945.
Speaker 1: And then moved to New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I think there was a place he was comfortable with, I mean he had been there, he knew, he knew the city sort of because of the times he'd come to New Orleans after running away from St. Joseph's [St. Joseph, Louisiana].  And he decided to make that home.
Speaker 1: Now, were they Creole, like the--or were they French at all, with the Lacour?  The name?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: They were just white people who had a French sounding name?
Speaker 2: Well, I think you know New Orl- Louisiana rather, they may have, their origins may have been French, but North Louisiana is not as French as South Louisiana.  So there may be, there may have been some French in their background, but it's--North Louisiana's very different from South Louisiana.
Story_ID: 532964
Speaker 1: So you were born there in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: I thought I had a, I lived a good life.  I got all the things I wanted to get, and did the things I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: What section of New Orleans did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the 9th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].  I--early on in the Desire area--
Speaker 1: 'Streetcar Named Desire' area (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's 'A Streetcar Named Desire,' but this was, this was an area that after the war [World War II, WWII] there was construction for veterans, basically, housing so you could get a VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] loan.  My dad bought a home and in that neighborhood, it was--you know it was a large, it was all black.  It was a segregated community, and that's where I initially grew up.  When I was probably, seven or eight years old, my family bought a house in a new black subdivision called Pontchartrain Park [New Orleans, Louisiana], which--
Speaker 1: And that's where the Morials lived, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, in fact, when Marc [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial] was born, they lived immediately behind us.  And my parents [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford and Earle Bradford, Sr.] lived in that house for more than fifty years.
Story_ID: 532965
Speaker 1: Actually after my dad [Earle Bradford, Sr.] died, I convinced my mother [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] that she needed to move, and they needed to sell the house.  And we did that the November before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] hit.  So I moved her to Virginia Beach [Virginia] to live with my sister [Earlette Bradford Breckenridge].  So, and when I go back to New Orleans [Louisiana], I've been back a couple of times since Katrina, and I've gone out to the neighborhood [Pontchartrain Park, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Initially, I went right after Thanksgiving, that, the year that Katrina hit, and I couldn't find a water line in the house.  And I just said, well, it didn't look quite that bad.  And the houses were abandoned you could see, but I couldn't see the water line, so it was sort of confused.  I later realized that the water was about fourteen feet high, so that there really wasn't a water line, it was on the roof.
Speaker 2: What did the house look like on the inside?
Speaker 1: Well, on the inside, the whole area looked abandoned, the grass rather than green was brown, there were no birds, no dogs, no animals around, and it looked like a neutron bomb had hit; that all the structures were in place, but there were no people there.  There was nothing living that you could see.  And, and you could look in the houses, and you could see the mold, and you could see the disarray of stuff.
Speaker 2: But, and we're going to go back in time, but just since we're talking about Katrina, what do you think will become of that area?  What do you think's going to happen to it?  Can they rebuild New Orleans?
Speaker 1: Oh, I think New Orleans can be rebuilt.  I just don't think it will take place quickly.  Nothing gets--
Speaker 2: Twenty years?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're talking a fifteen to twenty year cycle.  There--I was disappointed the last time I was there, which was in mid-September, at the few number of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] trailers.  Which was to me an indication of people returning and working on their homes, having some place at least to live temporarily while their homes are guttered--gutted and cleaned up.  And I was just disappointed, there just wasn't enough density.  So that one of the real issues that they have is they have to be able to create the infrastructure to replace the sewage and water lines, the electrical lines, and the like.  And unless there's sufficient density, it's hard to argue that that should be done.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, I think it's a catch-22.  If you don't have those things--
Speaker 2: People aren't gonna come back.
Speaker 1: They aren't gonna come back (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People--yeah.
Speaker 1: If they don't come back, you're not gonna have these things.
Speaker 2: You're not gonna have 'em, yeah.

Speaker 1: Did you ever sport, or play any sports--I'm back to seven years old now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when the Morial, like I know Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial] said he played on a baseball team.  Did you ever play baseball or football when you were young?
Speaker 2: When I was young I played baseball, football, basketball year round.  I was, if--Pontchartrain Park [New Orleans, Louisiana] is one of the few areas that there was a nice park, playground, so there was a basketball court that was cement.  There were a baseball diamond, and there was plenty of places that you could play ball if you wanted to.
Speaker 1: And it was all black.
Speaker 2: It was all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now New Orleans [Louisiana] was divided along racial lines, correct?
Speaker 2: I guess I never thought about it as, until I left New Orleans that it was divided along racial lines among blacks.  But yeah, New Orleans is, was a segregated city.  There was a black culture, there were black debutantes and black social and pleasure clubs, carnival clubs, so, yeah.
Story_ID: 532967
Speaker 1: You says New Orleans [Louisiana] has an interesting cultural well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: pick--
Speaker 2: Well I think New Orleans has an interesting culture, and I think of it in a context of there's a black society and there's a white society.  And, and blacks have cultural institutions that have evolved over the years that provide for all of the pomp and ceremony that the whites do.  So there are black social and pleasure clubs that have huge carnival balls, the Original Illinois [Original Illinois Club], being one of them, Young Men Illinois [Young Men Illinois Club] being another.  Even the Zulus [Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club] have become in many ways, very legitimate in these days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because they have the oldest float or something, right, during Mardi Gras time?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And they've gone through a renaissance of sorts because at one point, you know, their, their schedule was not predictable, so if you hit, if you were able to find Zulu, great, but you did not plan on seeing them on carnival day.  So New Orleans had its own rather interesting culture, and, and there was a separation between the educated class and the, even among blacks, and the sort of working class, and that was different.
Speaker 1: Now, you say there was a separation, but you were within the same community?  Or you even lived in separate neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Within the same community, I mean it was a--among blacks--
Speaker 1: But they--how did you divide yourselves if you're in the same community?
Speaker 2: Well, it's just the, the, the social clubs and organizations that you participate in.  So that if you're a member of the Young Illinois, Young Men Illinois, that was an upper crust group, and, you know, or versus being a member of the Choctaw nation, you know, a group of Indians [Native American] who celebrated on, on carnival day.  And, and, but, but people would spend a lot of money, and in some cases, it, it was not a function of what the earning capacity would normally be, just their priorities.
Speaker 1: So how, where would you say your family fell in that description?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to think of us as a upper lower class kind of family.  My dad [Earle Bradford, Sr.] worked, worked hard.  Every day he was in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], worked for thirty-five years in the post office.
Speaker 1: But that was a middle class job during that time.  No?  Well, in Mississippi it was (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I think of it as there were a lot of two income families where the male worked in the post office, and the la- and the wife of the family may have been a teacher.  And that would, that would then have been a middle class kind of position.  My dad, though, felt it was important for my mother [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] to take care of the family, so he thought, you know, he would make that sacrifice, and, and he would be the breadwinner of the family.  So, and he was.
Story_ID: 532968
Speaker 1: Who did you look up to at that time?  Who were your, not idols, I gue- like mentors?  Who do you, who had the most influence on you?
Speaker 2: I think that--I went to the local church, United Methodist church that had a very active youth program, so local minister was always influential in my life.  Coaches were always influential in my life.
Speaker 1: And who were some of the coaches?
Speaker 2: Well, Vern Augustine [ph.] was my football coach, and the number, or assistant football coach was a guy named John Powell Smith, Jr. who was probably every bit of five feet tall.  And, but he coached using the, the, I guess the lessons of Bear Bryant.  And he brought a book from Bear Bryant, I remember my junior year in c- in high school [McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], and, "We're gonna do it the way the Bear does it."  And so, he would challenge us to be good, he also happened to be science teacher.  And so he was also my biology teacher, and my, and my chemistry teacher, I think.
Speaker 1: Well, he was a smart coach, because usually the coach teaches something like social studies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he was, he was good.  He was, he was an important figure in terms of helping, helping me in my life to just work hard, learn how to work hard.
Story_ID: 532969
Speaker 1: Now, did you always know that you'd go to college, given that your parents had not gone?
Speaker 2: I always knew that the expectation was that I would go to college.
Speaker 1: And the expectation was put up on you by whom?
Speaker 2: By my mother [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] and father [Earle Bradford, Sr.].
Speaker 1: So they knew, they knew that they wanted you to go further--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --than they had gone?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, what type of a student were you in school?  Grades?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I mean, I was, I finished in the top ten of my high school class.  I finished in the top ten in my c- in my college class [at Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And I went to grad school [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers?  You talked about the coaches, but were there teachers who were influential?
Speaker 2: I think my seventh grade homeroom teacher who also was a science teacher, Ms. McKee [ph.] who ended up being a, getting her Ph.D. in biology, and was then married, and named Dr. Verrett.  And I think her son is Stanley Verrett [Stan Verrett] who was on one of the sports programs on TV.  So she was--you know I always, I always studied hard, I always did a lot of reading.  And I was always academically toward the top of my class.
Speaker 1: So I want you to list the schools for me that you attended.  So the first elementary school you went to?
Speaker 2: Johnson Lockett [Johnson C. Lockett Elementary School], which was in the Desire area [New Orleans, Louisiana].  When we moved from--we lived in, on Clouet Street.  2908 Clouet Street, which was in the Desire area.  When we moved to Pontchartrain Park [New Orleans, Louisiana] lived at 6314 Pauline Drive.  When we moved I changed schools and went to Medard H. Nelson [Medard H. Nelson Elementary School; Medard H. Nelson Charter School, New Orleans, Louisiana] to elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you move, change schools?  Is that because of Brown versus Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?
Speaker 2: No, that was because that was the nearest black school that serviced my, where I lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happened when--because you were ten, or even, you were eight when the decision came down to integrate schools--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: --in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Well, the decision came down, it was a while yet before it was implemented.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Before it got to Louisiana.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't really implemented in Louisiana until I think I was in probably tenth grade.  And then it started at the elementary schools.  So when I, I moved to Medard H. Nelson to complete my elementary school education, I moved from that to Carver Junior High School [George Washington Carver Junior High School], which was in the Desire area actually.  And then completed middle school, then went to McDonogh 35 [McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], which was a top academic high school, public high school, in the city.
Speaker 1: Now when you were at Carver, did you know that your, you had an uncle [Dean Mohr] that had actually been a Tuskegee Airman?  And that the connection to Carver [George Washington Carver] and Tuskegee and--
Speaker 2: No, I really didn't make that connection, I knew that I had an uncle who, who was an [U.S.] Air Force officer.  I didn't know much about the Tuskegee Airmen 'til much, much later.  I knew he had gone to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], but I didn't know much about the Tuskegee Airmen at the time.
Story_ID: 532970
Speaker 1: So during those high school years [at McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], do you think that you were going to get to college on a football scholarship or a baseball scholarship?  Or you gonna go on an academic scholarship?  Are your parents [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford and Earle Bradford, Sr.] prepared to pay for you, your full ride?
Speaker 2: Well, I always assumed I would go to college based on an academic scholarship.  I mean I was decent football player, and I was an all, all, all-district tight end, but I as- you know I assumed the only way I was going to go to college was I was going to get, get a scholarship.  But it never, it never occurred to me that I wouldn't.
Speaker 1: That you would not get a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, you know, I went to summer science institutes after my sophomore year at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia], I went to one after my junior year at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And so I was considered a top academic student.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when it comes time to apply for colleges, universities, which ones do you apply to?
Speaker 2: Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Howard, and I got scholarships to those.
Speaker 1: And why did you choose Dillard of the three?
Speaker 2: It was local.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's closest to home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you only apply to black schools [HBCUs]?
Speaker 2: I applied to some integrated schools.
Speaker 1: Which ones?
Speaker 2: There's one in Appleton, Wisconsin [Lawrence College; Lawrence University]--
Speaker 1: The University of Oshkosh, or--
Speaker 2: No, no.  It was a, it was a small private school.  I can't remember the name of it.
Speaker 1: I know they have that good music conservatory there in Appleton (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I applied to a number of different schools--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and some of which I got into, and others I didn't.
Story_ID: 532971
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So once you get into Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] do you, once you start, do you play sport- do you continue--
Speaker 2: They actually stopped football the year I got there, and so we had a flag football team that we played against Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] once a year, but that was about it.
Speaker 1: So now you're just focusing on your studies?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And any idea of what you want to do afterwards?  Are you thinking about what you want to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I always thought I wanted to be in business, and so I studied accounting and business administration and economics.
Speaker 1: And who had you seen, though, in business to model yourself after?
Speaker 2: There were no models.  The only issue was I thought that I wanted to be in business, or I could have gone to law school.  But ultimately I thought I wanted to be in business, and there really weren't any models of African Americans in business at that time.  Nobody was really recruiting, so they didn't start really recruiting for Corporate America--
Speaker 1: 'Til the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Ah, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Late, mid-'70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: I think they began to do it in the late '60s [1960s].  For example, when--the top accounting student at Dillard went to work for Shell [Shell Oil Company] in '67 [1967], and '68 [1968], they would take the top accounting--
Speaker 1: They took the--and they took you as well then.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but I also applied to grad school, and I ended up working for Shell.  I went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] the summer after my sophomore year, I started working at Shell the summer after my junior year, and then I worked there before going to grad school [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York] the summer after my g- after graduation.
Story_ID: 532972
Speaker 1: So we're gonna just step back a little bit.  I want to ask you a few more things about your childhood before we move forward to the career years and college.  So you said you were in the tenth grade [at McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] by the time they started to integrate schools in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have any feelings about it one way or the other?
Speaker 2: I had more interest in the voting efforts to register black voters.
Speaker 1: Were you able to register and vote?
Speaker 2: I was not, I was not of age at the time.
Speaker 1: But when you turned eighteen, don't you register when you draft?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, yes, when you, when you turned eighteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you register for the draft.
Speaker 2: --you register for the draft.  And, and when I finished, I was very fortunate to get, to be able to finish because all the student deferments basically had been eliminated, and fortunately, when I ended up going to grad school [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York] I was the first lottery.  And I basically had been able to delay getting my physical examination until December 7th, and whe- at the time I was in Ithaca [New York], and I just said I was going to go ahead and try to go to, go to school as long as I could until I got drafted.  And fortunately there was a lottery and I pulled a good number.
Speaker 1: What was your number?
Speaker 2: 352.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So that's pretty high.
Speaker 2: It was pretty high, but the expectation was that they were going to go through everybody.  I don't remember what the, how high they went up, but I was fortunate I did not have to go.
Story_ID: 532973
Speaker 1: So at the time you start Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] a- you, are you working?  After school?  I mean 'cause you're still at home (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked in the, I worked at the university.  I actually stayed on campus, I worked in the financial aid's office, and--as a work study student.
Speaker 1: Who were the other students in the, in your, in the, in your class that were bus- you know, bus- in the business school, or in the business--
Speaker 2: Probably, guys I can think of, Pervis Thomas, who I think Pervis is, has worked for Shell Oil Company for essentially all of his career.  I think he heads their, their philanthropic efforts in the Houston [Texas] area.  Paul Valteau [HistoryMaker Paul R. Valteau, Jr.] I mentioned who's the civil sheriff in New Orleans [Louisiana] and also is an entrepreneur who owns, or did own Grove Food Products [ph.], which are sold in airports.  Eric Waters was one of the guys, I don't know what Eric's doing now.
Speaker 1: So are they all men?  There are no women?
Speaker 2: There were some women.
Speaker 1: But very few at the time?
Speaker 2: Very few at the time.  I shouldn't say that.  Dillard was overlel- overwhelmingly woman.  I mean, there were probably two women for every, or, or three women for every guy.  But not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had it been a university for women only at some point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That was just the makeup of it?
Speaker 2: That was just the makeup of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's probably even worse now.  There's probably a greater number--
Speaker 1: Five to one?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But there, you know, there probably--30 percent of the class was, was women in the business sc- curriculum.  About 30 percent of the kids.
Speaker 1: So with the odds so low that you'd get a job, as a, you know, in business, because you said Shell was taking one person a year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you didn't name any other companies that were (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I just thought what they did, they had an interesting strategy.  They would take the top student and that would sort of satisfy their requirements.  It never occurred to me I wouldn't have a, wouldn't be able to get a job.  I just assumed--I'd been very fortunate, I'd gotten good grades, I, I could--I thought if I got into the interview I could sell myself.
Story_ID: 532974
Speaker 1: Had you ever felt discriminated against up to this point, between early childhood and the time you were at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think there were always reminders in New Orleans [Louisiana] that you were black.  If you rode a bus there was a sign that had to be put in front of you if you were black, or you had to sit behind the sign.  So you knew that, and that didn't change until, what?  The public accommodations act in 1964 [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II]?  So yeah, there, there were always reminders that you were black.
Speaker 1: How, what impact does that have on your life when you, you know, okay, so that's that aspect.  Okay.  So I have to sit at the back of the bus.  You know, them keeping me in my, in my place.  Does that, does that translate into other areas to where you think, you know, you think that's--
Speaker 2: Oh, you--
Speaker 1: --that's their business--problem, and not mine?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I think you, you--in your classrooms, teachers were savvy enough to say, you know, "In the history book, there's only one black mentioned, and that is Toussaint L'Ouverture.  But there were other blacks who were important in, in historical context."  And they would supplement, you know, the text by sharing with you more about black history than, than was the prescribed curriculum, if you will.  I remember an incident, though.  My dad [Earle Bradford, Sr.] was a, I don't want to say a volatile person, but I remember one time we walked into a hardware store, and a guy, young guy, white guy, said to him, "Boy, what do you want?"  And my dad reacted, "Do I look like a boy?  He looks like a boy, but, you know, you don't address me that way."  And, and, you know, and we got up and left.  So it was very clear that you had to demand respect if you were going to be respected.  It was not something that, that came natural for a lot of folks.
Speaker 1: So did, did you think you were going to have to do that in the business world also?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I always assumed that there was a presumption of a level of incompetence.  And that, you know, just like your mother said to you, you had to be twice as good.  You knew you had to be twice as prepared.  And, and as long as you were on your toes, you'd do okay.
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Wilhelmine Mohr Bradford] say that to you?  That you have to be twice as good?  Can you really remember?  I mean you hear--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of people saying that.  But did you get that speech?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't recall my mother say- ever saying or my father ever saying that.  What I do recall is the need, you know, if you can read, you can learn.  That you have to prepare yourself, you have to work hard, you have to do your homework (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they have any conversations with you about race?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any specific conversations about race.  I've had more conversations with my sons [Blake Bradford, Kipp Bradford and Corey Bradford] about race.
Speaker 1: You have.  I was going to ask that.  Do you talk to your kids about it?
Speaker 2: I, I think you have to, and if you live in a suburban area, I live in Villanova, Pennsylvania, which is a predominantly white suburb.
Speaker 1: I've heard even the maids are white out there (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I wouldn't know.  But you know, you, you have to remind kids about, what do you do if you're stopped by the police?  Since you know you will be stopped.  And, and you want to make sure that they're sensitive to, how do you respond to this?  How do you make sure that you don't have unintended consequences?  You know, keep your mouth shut, say yes sir, no sir; be respectful.  If you've got a problem, we'll deal with it afterwards, you know.
Speaker 1: But you didn't have those conversations and you grew up in a tougher time than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But a different time.
Speaker 2: A different time, and I think there may have been a presumption that where you know that you're black and in an environment where all the police are white for the most part.  Even the black policemen are not your friends, they're not, they're not there to protect and serve.  You know so that you just need to understand that.
Story_ID: 532975
Speaker 1: What year did you pledge at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I didn't pledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sigma Pi Phi [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], the fraternity I belonged to, is a graduate level fraternity.  And when I was at Dillard, I toyed with the idea of pledging, but I felt it was not something that I needed to do.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Because I had good grades, I was from the city, I didn't need to create a friendship group, an affinity group 'cause I knew everybody and people knew me.  And so I, I could date girls from either f- either of the sororities, and I just didn't need it.  And I remember going to a smoker for the, for Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], and, and the guy said to me, "Tell me why you're worthy."  And I said, "No, you don't understand.  I'm here to find out why this was an organization I would want to be associated with."  And he didn't like that.  And we agreed to disagree, and I walked out.  So it was not something--I didn't feel I needed to have that.
Speaker 1: Who had--who, who were the, the, the university professors at Dillard that were influential?
Speaker 2: Probably the most influential was a guy named Thomas Crittenden [Thomas E. Crittenden, Jr.], and he was my accounting and business professor.  He taught all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he black?
Speaker 2: He was black.  He taught me all of my accounting courses.  There was another guy who was white who was an economics professor, a guy name Edward Coker [ph.] who is still calling my name probably because I kept his book, (Unclear).   And I was just proud of learning, and I, and I said, you know, "Let me use, let me read the books."  And so he gave me several books, and a couple of them I forgot to give them back to him.  So, but, people who sort of challenged you to think, and I think, creatively and, and strategically in some ways.
Speaker 1: Why economics?  Why were you--well you majored in accounting, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I took as many economics courses as they had, as the university offered.
Speaker 1: Well now, and where did that come from?  Who did you see doing that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I--there was no model.  It was, what do the, what's, what do you need to have in your skill sets and understanding if you're gonna be in business.  You needed to understand microeconomics, and you needed to understand accounting.  I also took philosophy courses, some of my--I enjoyed philosophy more than anything else.
Story_ID: 532976
Speaker 1: Now when, you know, Black Entertainment magazine [sic. Black Enterprise], you know, appeared in the '70s [1970s], did you subscribe?  Were you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean I went to, I left Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], I went to graduate school.  I--
Speaker 1: And you went to graduate school at?
Speaker 2: Cornell [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: Cornell.  So you travelled all the way north then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and now, this is your first, Cornell was your first, your introduction to, into a broader society because--
Speaker 2: Well, I'd gone to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] one summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What was that introduction like?  Where now you're in a broader society, now predominantly black?
Speaker 2: I was nonplussed about it, it didn't really affect me.  I mean, I think that my best friend in graduate school was black.  There were only seven black students in my class at the Cornell B-school.  And one of whom ended up going back and getting his Ph.D. from Cornell and I ended up being his best man in his second marriage and wedding.  And I went back to Cornell two years ago.  Well, I shouldn't say two years ago.  Yeah, I guess it was two years ago, to receive an award, the Parker award for distinguished black alumni [Wilbur Parker Distinguished Alumni Award].  But, and I periodically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well there still aren't that many black students at Cornell.
Speaker 2: No, but I was amazed that there was in the B-school a much larger class than what I experienced when I was there.  So they had a reception, they had program that--it was interesting.  I mean, it said they had made some progress.  There were kids there who were taking advantage of the education.  I looked at business school as a finishing school, and it helped legitimatize your, your background and experience.  And M.B.A.'s when I was, when I went there were in demand.  There were only about seven thousand M.B.A. graduates the year I, I finished.  There are probably five hundred thousand a year that get M.B.A.'s today.
Speaker 1: So when you left Dillard, why did you travel, I mean, what provoked you to come that far north to Cornell (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I figured I had to be--I applied to, I think I applied to Columbia [Columbia Business School, New York, New York], University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois], Cornell, and University of Wisconsin [Wisconsin School of Business, Madison, Wisconsin], maybe Washington U [Washington University in St. Louis; Olin Business School, St. Louis, Missouri].  I thought it was close enough to New York [New York], 'cause you had to be in New York, or, and it was, but it was a smaller program than what was at Columbia.  And so I had the benefits of being, of having access to New York City, without the negatives of living in New York City.  And so my wife [Yvette Savwoir Bradford] and I went, decided to go there.
Story_ID: 532977
Speaker 1: Now, by this time you were married?
Speaker 2: I was married.  I was married my junior year in college.
Speaker 1: Why did you get married so young?
Speaker 2: I was twenty-one, or, and I, I don't know.  My wife had already finished from college.
Speaker 1: So she's older?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a year older than I am, and she had finished from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and she thought she could support me and we'd finish, I'd go ahead and finish school.  And I went ahead and finished school, and we, and she worked and then we went to, we went to Ithaca [New York].
Speaker 1: What's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Yvette Savwoir Bradford.
Speaker 1: And she majored in what at Spelman?
Speaker 2: Economics.
Speaker 1: Economics also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how did the two of you meet if she was at Spelman and you were at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: We actually went to high school together [at McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  She was a year ahead of me in high school, and, but her sister was in school with me and her brother played football with me.
Speaker 1: So she's from, she's like almost a high school sweetheart?
Speaker 2: Well, we never dated in high school, and we just started dating after, after she had left actually.
Speaker 1: So the both of you moved to Ithaca?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did she, was she able to work there?
Speaker 2: She worked for the university [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], actually worked for Lisle Carter [Lisle C. Carter] who was then I think she--he was the vice president of the university, and on the business school faculty [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York].

Speaker 1: Who was your mentor at Cornell [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York]?  By now I'm sure you have one, right?
Speaker 2: I don't think I really had a mentor.  I mean I had some professors that I liked their classes, there were people that I knew, but I don't think I ever had a mentor in--
Speaker 1: Ever?
Speaker 2: Not in school.
Speaker 1: Oh, not in school.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And if I had mentors even in the business profession they were more behind the scenes, and in some cases I would not have known that they were mentors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean they were, they--it was a little more awkward being in business in those days because there were no, no natural mentors.  They were people that you may have worked for that were supportive, but they weren't people that you could go to and say, "Look, you know, I need some advice."
Speaker 1: Well had you seen any other black students?  Because did you know the guy that Shell [Shell Oil Company] had taken the year before they had taken you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you knew you could at the very minimum, follow him in his footsteps (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I didn't, I didn't know, I did not know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What I knew was that Shell had a pattern of hiring one guy out of each class.  And it typically was the top, it may have been the second, it may not have been the top.  Because typically the top guy in, in, in accounting ended up going to B-school.  So it may have been the second highest guy.  In some cases, it may have been the best accounting student, whereas the other person went to business school.

Speaker 1: But we're just going to go back to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], when you were at Harvard, and, and you said you were in a program for minority students.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And just tell me briefly what that program was designed to do.
Speaker 2: I think it was designed to improve your writing skills, help you to become more strategic in your thinking, and that's really all I can remember about it.  It was a--
Speaker 1: But it was for black students.
Speaker 2: It's black students, it was a limited number of kids, I it's--I think it's called an Intensive Summer Studies Program.  And I went to that, I think, my, at the end of my sophomore year.  I could have gone to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] the sum- the following summer, but I ended up working for Shell [Shell Oil Company] that following summer.  But it was a good experience for me, just another opportunity for broadening, being in Cambridge [Massachusetts] over the summer.
Speaker 1: Were you honing in on what you possibly could do with a business degree then?
Speaker 2: I think I was honing in on the fact that I could go to law school or business school.  And the real question was how well I was going to do on the GMATs [Graduate Management Admission Test] or the LSATs.
Speaker 1: And how well did you do?
Speaker 2: I did well enough that I could have gone to either law school or business school.  I, I focused on business school, and when I went to Cornell [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York], I worked for the university as a financial aids officer.  And it worked out a deal that I could have gone to law school, and, but it would have taken me an additional year, I would have had to spend five years in Ithaca [New York], so I chose not to do that.
Story_ID: 532980
Speaker 1: Now and you and your wife [Yvette Savwoir Bradford] had made plans after Ithaca [New York] that you were going to move to one particular place or another?  Or the job would dictate where you'd go?
Speaker 2: Well I think the job largely dictated it.  We were biased towards New Orleans [Louisiana] or Houston [Texas], and Shell, even though I went to graduate school on a Mobil Oil [Mobil Oil Corporation; Exxon Mobil Corporation] fellowship, Shell Oil Company offered me a job in New Orleans, and so I decided to go back to New Orleans.
Speaker 1: So you said that you knew that they offered the top student--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a job each year.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who else was doing something similar to that?
Speaker 2: There was more recruiting taking place.  (Background noise) General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] was, a number of divisions in General Motors, sent recruiters down.  And it was interesting because some of those recruiters would give, force you to take a test, and--
Speaker 1: What kind of test?
Speaker 2: I assume it was a w- a Wonderlic or something, and I refused to do that.  I said, you know, "Here I am, my grades are X, you know, I have these kinds of experiences, I refuse to take a test.  If you, you know, if you don't want me, that's fine."  And, and I s- and, but they, it was an interesting time because there was, there was again, this presumption that your, that quality of your education wasn't quite up to snuff.  And therefore we wanted to make sure we only got the best and brightest, so I just refused to do that.
Story_ID: 532981
Speaker 1: During the time, was it at--during the time you were at Ithaca [New York] that the Vietnam War was, like, peaking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: In Ithaca?
Speaker 2: Well, the first lottery was January of, January 1st of nineteen sixty ni- of 1970.  And that was the lottery where I did not have to go.  So that's probably around the peak of the Vietnam conflict.
Speaker 1: Did you have friends that had to go?
Speaker 2: I had friends who went.  We used to kid about my local draft board.  To this day, I remember the lady who was the clerk of that draft board, her name was Violetta Cicoco [ph.], and she took all of my friends, anybody who wasn't in school, or as fortunate as I was to be able to delay it long enough.  'Cause I--by all rights, I should have been drafted before then.
Speaker 1: How could you delay it?
Speaker 2: Well, as it turned out, when I got my notice to report to the customhouse in New Orleans [Louisiana] to take my physical, I, I sent a letter back saying I can't report to the customhouse, I'm in Ithaca, New York, I can't afford to come back.  They sent me a letter back that said, "Dummy, if you had read the letter--," equivalent to that, "If you had read the letter," it said, "report to your local draft board wherever you are."  The result was about a four to six week time lag.
Speaker 1: Delay (laughter).
Speaker 2: So as it turned out, I went to get my physical on Ja- on December 7th, and on January 1st was the lottery, and if, if I had gotten my physical let's say November 7th it, it was quite possible I could have been gone by January 1st.  I could have been already indoctrinated into the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Did you lose people?  Did friends die, or they all came home?
Speaker 2: I didn't lose anybody that I knew, but the people who went didn't all come back with their full faculties.  I'm--one of my closest friends that I grew up with, who actually has the same birthday but one year younger than I am, went over, served, went over to Vietnam. He served as a clerk and, and spent a lot of time in Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam].  Came back, had a tough time readjusting.  Another guy who was a friend of the family came back with a drug problem.  And, and it, you know, he never fully recovered.  And there were just folks who just refused to talk about it, so it was a very difficult time for a lot of folks.
Story_ID: 532982
Speaker 1: What was your attitude towards what was happening, let's say, like Freedom Summer in Mississippi in '68 [sic.]?  Or, you know, when Chaney [James Chaney], when those three civil rights workers were killed?  You were in school at the same time.
Speaker 2: I was in school at the same time.  One of my best friends was one of the early CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] members, a guy named Dave Dennis.  We, I mean, on that campus [of Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], we were very aware of what was going on, and we had a very activist campus.  H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] spoke periodically, but we, we also understood, you know, we had some other requirements that we wanted to get, get through.
Speaker 1: So were there any sit-ins at the university?  Did you take over any buildings?
Speaker 2: We did not.
Speaker 1: Did they have a black studies department at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh, at Cornell?  I went to Cornell the year after the Straight take over.  I don't know if you recall.  In 1969, Willard Straight Hall, which was a student union, black students took over the university--took over the student union.  They were pictured on the front of Time magazine as, because they had guns.  And one of the kids was a guy named Keith Ferdinand [Keith C. Ferdinand] who was from New Orleans [Louisiana] whose brother I knew and had gone to school with.  We came there the year after that.  So, the year afterwards, there were student protests.  I think that cut short the second semester.  And--
Speaker 1: They cut your second semester short?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because of the student protest, I think we ended up, it was, like, one week earlier.  Things--so we, I don't think we had final exams.  There was something that took place at that time.  And, I was, I was also challenged because I was in the business school [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York], and they had a very active Africana studies center [Africana Studies and Research Center], and Cornell was one of the first schools to have a black studies program.  And so on occasion I'd be challenged, "Well, why don't you take courses at the Africana studies center?"  And I remember, and because I was working at the university at the time, as a, in the financial aids office.  And my reaction was, I want to know everything my competitor's gonna know.  So while, you know, I'm not--I don't mean to denigrate what you do, but the reality is if I'm gonna be competitive in the business market, I've gotta learn as much as every one of my white colleagues is gonna learn.  So, I appreciate your interest in my education, but, but I'll focus on the business school.
Speaker 1: So what was the result of them having that sit-in the year before?  How did it end?  Did they get what they wanted?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they want and what did they get in the end?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they wanted more support for African American students.  I think that there, there was a specific program at the time called COSEP, C-O-S-E-P [Committee on Special Education Projects].  And part of my job at the time working for the university was to manage the distribution of financial aid.  And a big portion of that was related to the COSEP program.  And it was a tremendous effort on the part of the university to ensure diversity on campus, and they provided a lot of support mechanisms.  And, and I think, I think it was a very successful program in that regard.  So I don't remember exactly what the requirement was.  The re- the, I think there was just a lot of, of energy on campuses at that time, both in terms of affirmative action as well as the war [Vietnam War].
Story_ID: 532983
Speaker 1: What did you think about affirmative action?
Speaker 2: To me, there wasn't any question.  Why would there, why wouldn't there be?  There's always been affirmative action, there's just the question that black folks haven't participated.  So if you were, if you were a legacy candidate, for example, at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] or Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or wherever--
Speaker 1: Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], you just go through the list (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you know you got, you got in if you were an athlete, you got in.  I mean you know preferences have always existed.  The problem has been that black folks have not been able to participate in that.  So the fact that all of a sudden you say, diversity has value on a college campus, or in the, or in the, in the business world.  And in some cases I refused to participate on--I remember in one case at Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.], I was asked to participate in the plant-wide affirmative action committee.  And they said, "We'd like you to do this."  And I said, "I don't want to do that."  And my boss came to me and said to me, "Well, why don't you want to do this?"  I said, "Well first thing you're gonna talk about is attitudes.  I could care less about people's attitudes.  What I want is their behaviors to change.  And if you're willing to deal with that, that's fine."  And this is like any other priority.  If you said that you want to reduce expenses by 5 percent, everybody will, you know, stand up and say, "Yes boss, I will reduce expenses by 5 percent."  Now if you're not willing to say that, that this is a business imperative, that we have diversity in, in our workforce, then I really don't wanna be engaged in it.
Speaker 1: Did you think you were, in those early years after you graduated from Cornell [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York], did you think you were facing a glass ceiling?  Or did you think, okay, sky's the limit in Corporate America for me?  Because you said you didn't have any role models, there were no--you didn't have anyone to look up to, to say, "Oh, this guy's done it, I can do it."  How did you know you could, you could do it?
Speaker 2: I had an assumption that I would not get to where I would want to be necessarily by staying at a company for thirty years.
Speaker 1: You had that assumption early on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so what I looked at was, and, and maybe part of it is having an M.B.A., and M.B.A.'s were looked upon as people who were very mobile, and my assumption was that in order, I could arise only to a certain level within an organization, then I would have to move to another organization to rise to the next level.  Because there were just the natural, sort of lack of appreciation for internal talent.  Whereas other people would place a higher premium and a higher value on it.  So you know--
Speaker 1: Who taught you that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I mean, that, that was, just something I guess, I discerned from the environment, that there was no way I could ever expect to work some place for thirty years, because I would not look like the people that were selecting me who--or were selecting the folks.  And, and so I didn't think that would be.  I never expected to be president of any major corporation.  And all I wanted to do was make a good career for myself, take advantage of the opportunities as they came, and I recognized that that meant I was gonna have to move.  And, and that was a challenge family-wise, but I knew that that was the way, from my perspective that was gonna, that was gonna evolve.
Story_ID: 532984
Speaker 1: So in 1971 when you accepted the job at Shell [Shell Oil Company], what was the interview process like?  Or did they just come to you and say, "Okay.  You're that one guy.  Here's the job."
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: "Would you like it?"
Speaker 2: Well, in Shell's case it was different because the people that they had normally hired they hired as accountants.  As an M.B.A. from a quality program [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York] I was the first black that they hired as a senior accountant.  And in fact, they didn't announce that I was a senior accountant.  It only came out because when I came back, they, you know, they'd offered me the job.  I didn't really have to interview for the job.  They offered me a job based on what they knew about me, and when I came back they put me on a special project, and that special project was being run by a senior accountant.  And at one point he offered me an opportunity to make me some overtime, and I said--and his name was Bernie Penchanette [ph.].  I said, "Bernie, I don't get paid for overtime.  If you need help, I'll help you, but I don't get paid for overtime.  You're not doing me any favors."  And he said, "No, no, you get paid."  I said, "Look, I'm senior accountant.  Senior accountants are exempt employees.  They don't get paid for overtime."  And he said, "No, that's not true."  I said, "Well, go to HR [human resources], find out."  So he went to HR and found out that I was, I was equivalent to his level and that sort of changed our relationship.  And then, and then not long after that, they moved me out of the, out of the group.
Speaker 1: How did that change your relationship?
Speaker 2: Well, he just, you know, first of all, nobody knew.  They didn't announce, "We've hired Earle Bradford [HistoryMaker Earle Bradford, Jr.] as a senior accountant."  They just said, "You know, we'd hired Earle Bradford, welcome him back."  And I think they, all of a sudden, you know, we're peers.  And he was an ex-[U.S.] military guy, and, you know and it sort of worked this way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he your same age?
Speaker 2: He was probably a little older than I was.  And--
Speaker 1: Same credentials?  Where had he gone to school?
Speaker 2: No, he, he had an undergraduate degree.  He was not an M.B.A., not, you know, an Ivy League M.B.A., as he would say it.  And--
Speaker 1: He was not an Ivy League M.B.A.?
Speaker 2: He was not an Ivy League.  He was LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] or some place, but didn't have an M.B.A. at all.  So it, it, it created an interesting dynamic.  We became good friends, but it was a different dynamic.  But, you know, I was just, I think, at the time, Shell was looking to sort of establish its own process, and I was sort of a known commodity to them, I'd worked for them for two summers.  I had their, had satisfied their credential requirements as an undergrad, and then I had a little more icing on the cake with the graduate degree.
Speaker 1: But I think Shell has always had good attitude towards like minority people.  I remember the first, like, franchise that was owned by a black person in my town, gas station.  It was a Shell, you know, so I think they've always been pretty liberal so to speak.
Speaker 2: Well I think, I think Shell, and I think the oil companies, the larger com- oil companies in general, had a better perception of their need to be socially conscious.  Because if you think about the oil companies, they are taking their cues from the government because they know that in many ways decisions on allotment of properties in the Gulf, depreciation schedules, amortization schedules, all of these things that impact on their ability to recover drilling cost, and to mitigate their risk are all government decisions.  And so I think they'd been, they'd been typically more responsive.  And that, when I look at Mobil [Mobil Oil Corporation], Exxon [Standard Oil Company of New Jersey], or Exxon Mobil [Exxon Mobil Corporation] now, but in those days, and the fact that I got a Mobil Oil fellowship to graduate school, was because Mobil Oil was reaching out to the minority community.  And they had one guy who was a white recruiter who went around and recruited aggressively at historically black colleges [HBCUs].  And, you know, I just, I think the large corporations, and General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] was certainly one, Ford [Ford Motor Company] was another, Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC] to a lesser degree were companies that were the vanguard in terms of affirmative action.
Story_ID: 532985
Speaker 1: So what happens in your career after Shell [Shell Oil Company]?  Because you don't stay there that long.  I mean you really--short (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I stayed there about two years.
Speaker 1: --which is a short amount of time.
Speaker 2: Well, it was, but what happened was, my wife [Yvette Savwoir Bradford] was, had gone to a job fair in New Orleans [Louisiana], and she was looking for work, and the guy, some interviewing process, mentioned, she mentioned me, and explained, you know, what I had done and all.  So the guy said, "I want him to come up and see me."  So, and I don't remember the guy's name.  He was a, he was a black recruiter at the time, and that night before the Ebony Fashion Fair was in New Orleans, and he had a party or whatever, so he, he just asked me to come up on Sunday morning to meet with him.  And he said--you know, you know I gave him a copy of my resume.  We talked and he said, you know, "Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] is looking for people like you, and I'd like to set up an interview for you in, in New Brunswick [New Jersey].  You know, it's, it's in a different kind of job than what you've done."  'Cause we talked about it, and one of the things I said at the time, I was an accountant.  But I, you know, I grew weary of, of generating numbers.  What I prefer to do is generate outcomes in effect.  And that, you know, anybody can record the number, but being able, being the guy who was responsible for generating numbers becomes a lot more important.  So, I ended up interviewing with Johnson and Johnson.  They offered me a job as a planning manager for their sales and distribution services organization.  I came in, did that job, then moved into manufacturing.  And, you know, I didn't have any, I didn't have an engineering background or the like, but, but I had good knowledge of financial processes and, and reasonably good people skills.
Speaker 1: And at that time, what, what all, what else was Johnson and Johnson doing?  Were they doing all the stuff that they do now?  I mean, they were they doing products?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were doing broad range of products, I mean, you know, the Band-Ai- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Publications?
Speaker 2: No, no publications.  This is Johnson, Johnson--
Speaker 1: Oh then I'm getting them confused.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Johnson and Johnson's just--
Speaker 2: Johnson and Johnson is health and beauty aids, basically.
Speaker 1: Right, just the products then like--
Speaker 2: Just the products, yeah.  But they, they had an aggressive affirmative action program what they--at the time they called leadership program beyond compliance.  And they hired a large number of junior [U.S.] military officers, guys who had just gotten out of Vietnam as production supervisors and production managers.  And I came in, I was probably only one who had not been a junior military officer, and, you know, and I had a good experience.  They'd give you, they gave you at the time, real opportunities to manage people very early in your career.  And so I, I don't think I was ever in a job for more than about nine to twelve months.
Speaker 1: Did you use the products (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, I used them because I got them free for the most part (laughter).  I mean, Band-Aid brand bandages, you know, shampoo--.  But I had a lot of respect for them because they made sure that the products were of good quality and, and that there was a lot of respect for the people that worked there.
Story_ID: 532986
Speaker 1: Now were you the only African American?
Speaker 2: No.  There were a number of African American junior [U.S.] military officers who were spread out in this facility [in New Brunswick, New Jersey].  I was at their largest manufacturing plant at that time.
Speaker 1: Why do you think they were making such an effort to have a diverse working environment?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but they, they--I don't know what drove them initially.  I think they were smart enough to recognize as many consumer product companies did, Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company] being one that they were going to be marketing to a more diverse population.  They needed to have people who represented that diversity in their businesses.  And I think that was what they tried to do.  And they actually hired the guy who replaced Whitney Young after he died, from the Urban League [National Urban League], whose name escapes me now, to be their chief diversity person.  There was another guy who worked for him, his name was Frank Steele [ph.] who was an ex-military guy I think who had come in.  But they had a very active program to hire--recruit and hire African Americans.  And we used to kid about it, you had to be six feet tall and have a military bearing about you in order to be successful.  And they had an image issue, I mean they--you had to meet a certain profile.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're serious?
Speaker 2: I'm serious because we, one of the big challenges was whether or not you could wear a sport coat even with, with tie, wasn't even a question of being without tie, on the weekends.  Now, you, you know, you work, you know, fifty hours a week, but if you came in on the weekend, you needed to have the same executive presence that you did during the week.  And one of the funniest parts of it was I wore a bow tie at that time, and so that was sort of different there.  And I remember a guy who subsequently became chairman of the board, Ralph Larsen [Ralph S. Larsen], who was the director of the distribution division came to see me because he wanted to see my tie.  You know, he had heard about the tie, so he wanted to see the tie.
Speaker 1: Did they care how you wore your hair?  Because at that time, you (unclear) an Afro, a natural, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  They was not, as long as it was on your, on your head, and not on our face.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Oh, okay.  So no facial hair.
Speaker 2: No facial hair.  One of the big challenges we had one time, we were interviewing a candidate for production supervisor's position, and he was a former pro football player.  And he was a big guy, but he had a goatee.  And there was much consternation as to whether or not we could hire this guy because he swore this was part of his heritage, and he didn't want to shave it off.  As it turned out, we did not hire him.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But that, that was, you know, J&J [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.], Procter and Gamble--
Speaker 1: Doesn't that violate your constitutional rights to not hire someone because they have facial hair?
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: Or can you not hire people based on whatever you don't, reasons you don't want to hire them.
Speaker 2: Well, as long as it's not racial in nature, and one might argue that blacks may have more facial hair than others.
Speaker 1: Right.  But were there white guys showing up with goatees?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They were all clean shaven?
Speaker 2: All clean shaven.  They understood the rules.  I don't think, I don't think they ever lost a suit because of somebody being not hired because of facial hair.  But, you know, they had, they had a set of r- expectations as to what their, their folks were gonna look like.
Speaker 1: Did you understand those expectations?
Speaker 2: Not before I got there, but I wouldn't have a problem with them.  My notion was when I went to work I was dressed appropriately for work.  If they said you can't have an Afro then I would have had a problem.  My hair was long, but as long as it was neat, there was no issue.
Story_ID: 532987
Speaker 1: Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I reached sort of a, a pinnacle.  That I thought that I needed to move out and I got a job offer from a company in Niagara Falls [New York].  And it was, you know--
Speaker 1: Was that an energy company?
Speaker 2: No, it was actually an abrasives company.  Carborundum [Carborundum Company] made abrasives.
Speaker 1: What are abrasives?
Speaker 2: Sandpaper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Stuff you clean?
Speaker 2: You know, different--
Speaker 1: Okay, cleaning, and--
Speaker 2: And stones and stuff.  I mean, it was really an archaic process, but they were at the time one of the high flyers in terms of leverage buyouts in, in the early period.  And they offered me 25 percent more than I was making.  Why wouldn't I go?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, as I looked at it, it would advance my career two or three years.
Speaker 1: And an opportunity to live in Niagara.
Speaker 2: Oh, and that was a wonderful opportunity.  And I was so glad to get out of there when I le- ultimately left.  Somebody told me at the time, that there must be a reason that they want to pay you this much money, one of my HR [human resources] friends.  And I said, "Well, you know, they think I'm good, I have potential."  And all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Were the children, had the children been born at this time?
Speaker 2: My--actually, yes.  At that time, I had three kids, and when I moved, the youngest [Corey Bradford] was still in diapers, was only a few years old actually.
Speaker 1: Well, when did the children came (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A few months old.
Speaker 1: When you were at Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: My oldest son [Blake Bradford] was born when I was in Ithaca [New York], he was born in 1970.
Speaker 1: So when you were still in col- in school then?
Speaker 2: Still in grad school [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York], yes.  And my middle son [Kipp Bradford] was born in Freehold, New York--Freehold, New Jersey, rather.  And then my youngest was born in Trenton [New Jersey].  Be- and I lived in Trenton before, right before moving to Niagara Falls.
Speaker 1: So you had a family to support at this time?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was your wife [Yvette Savwoir Bradford] still working at the time?
Speaker 2: She was working up until the time that the youngest was born, which was right before we moved to Niagara Falls.
Speaker 1: And then did she become a stay at home mom?
Speaker 2: She did for the ti- for that time she did.
Speaker 1: Where did you send the children to school?
Speaker 2: They went to public schools.
Speaker 1: So they went to public schools--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any reservations about sending them to public schools?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I thought, you know we selected, well later, at that time, we were only talking about elementary school.  And when we lived in Trenton, my son went to the local school, which also was probably the best elementary school in the city at that time, and we knew the principal through my wife's contacts, so I had no reservations about public schools at the time.

Speaker 1: So once you arrive in, at Nia- in Niagara Falls [New York], you only stay there for a very short amount of time.
Speaker 2: About a year.  A guy I'd formerly worked with at Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] had taken a job with a company in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Howard Neff [ph.].  And Howard had become the director of distribution for Consolidated Aluminum Company [Consolidated Aluminum Corporation], which was based in St. Louis.  And he had gotten to me and suggested, I may have even sent some letters out to friends and colleagues.  And I was ready to move.  I made a mistake moving to Niagara Falls, and--but he had contacted me about a potential job.  And I swore that if I could move closer to New Orleans [Louisiana] I would, and Ni- St. Louis actually was about midway between Niagara Falls and New Orleans.  So, I--they--Consolidated Aluminum was a joint venture between Phelps Dodge [Phelps Dodge Corporation] and Alusuisse [Schweizerische Aluminium AG], the Swiss aluminum company.  And they were looking to build up a cadre of, of talented people, they weren't quite sure how they were going to use them.  So, I came down and interviewed with this guy I worked with before who was looking for a certain kind of person, and I didn't really fit that need.  But they had another position that they were looking for, someone with a generalist background, and I became part of a marketing, marketing organization.  I didn't know anything about marketing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About marketing at the time.
Speaker 2: No--
Story_ID: 532989
Speaker 1: But I'm interested in, okay, I'm interested in cre- you know, for you creat- creating the world that exists at this point, when you leave Niagara [Niagara Falls, New York] that may not have existed prior to, to your starting.  You were telling me about an Urban League [National Urban League]--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the things that the Urban League had was a black executive exchange program.  They would recruit black executives to go to historically black colleges [HBCUs] and sort of share their experiences with undergrads.  And I did that a number of times, and one of the times, I went down to Southern University New Orleans [Southern University at New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana], I'd gone to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] another time, I went to Alcorn State [Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] another time.
Speaker 1: That's in my neck of the woods, I grew up in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was an opportunity, you know, to spend time and share experiences with undergrads, but also to meet other folks who were at their similar stages in their careers in other organizations.
Speaker 1: What experiences were you sharing though?  What would, what did you have to share at that time?
Speaker 2: Well I think what you had to share was, what was it like?  How, how well did your schooling prepare you for that environment?  What were the, what were the challenges, if you had to go back to school, given what you know now, what would you want to know?
Speaker 1: And what, and what were the challenges?  What would you have wanted to know?
Speaker 2: I'd want to know more about people processes.  How to present, how to communicate, how to analyze problems and issues.  You know, you, if you're an accounting student, you know how to do practice sets.  But being able to take the knowledge and be able to synthesize the data and make a presentation to say why you should invest in this option versus an alternative.  And being able to sell your concepts.  You don't get, you get that in business school.  But you don't get it as an undergrad that you really have to, have to make a presentation to a skeptical audience, and sell them on your concept.
Speaker 1: So what experiences did you share with them that were race specific?  Were there any?
Speaker 2: Well, I think you asked the question earlier about mentors.  You know, modeling your behavior after the people you want to be like.  You know, for example, the question of how do you dress.  Looking, if, if you want to be your boss' boss, you know, talk about dress for success.  Look f- look for those cues from the people who are in those positions.  How do you create a comfort level, you know, working with your boss?  You know, inviting your boss out to dinner (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well how do you create a comfort level?  Do you go play golf with them?  Do you join the country club?  Do you--
Speaker 2: Well, the reality is you couldn't join the country club, and you probably couldn't play golf.  But what you can do, though, is try to understand what you can about the people you work with.  And, you know, when you're invited to go have a drink after dinner, after work one day or something take advantage of that.  Don't view that as something that somehow is foreign to you, even though you haven't done it.  You have to try some things and take some risks.
Speaker 1: So these are the same sorts of things that you would later tell your children [Blake Bradford, Kipp Bradford and Corey Bradford] about.  Not that, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --kind of how you tell your children, okay, if the police stop you, you do this, this, and this.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, in this business environment, in order to get ahead, or to, to, to assimilate.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, what's the right word?  You tell me?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if it's assimilate, it really is in order to be successful in managing your environment then you need to understand what the cues are, and you need to try to identify people who have been through that ex- that process.  And as an undergrad, for us coming back to the college campus, there then is a network that exists.  There are people in those organizations who have been in those organizations that you need to get to know and meet to better understand the dynamics or what takes place (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you--
Story_ID: 532990
Speaker 1: --takes place (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you member of the b- the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] during this time?
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The Boule for the most part, average age is in the mid-sixties.  I was not.  But what I was--there--what was emerging, and even when I worked for Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] and others, there were black employee groups.  So the- you could identify folks who were at higher levels in the organization, maybe than you were.  You were not the first necessarily, you may have been the first at a later level, when I got to be a vice president at Consolidated Aluminum [Consolidated Aluminum Corporation] I was the only black, but in those other earlier years there were people you could talk to.  And they may have been a director of manufacturing, director of engineering that you could talk to and just try to understand the environment and how, how to be, what you needed to do to be successful in that.
Speaker 2: And let's, when did you become vice president for Aluminum--how did you rise up to that position?  What--
Speaker 1: Well, when I joined Consolidated Aluminum, which I guess was in the mid to late '70s [1970s], I joined it as an analyst and working for what, the guy who's the number two guy in that organization.  And his title wasn't that, but he was the sort of most powerful guy there and I worked hard for him.  And, and at one point he fired the division head of a division that was floundering.  And so he gave me the opportunity to run that business, and I turned the business around.  And--
Speaker 2: From what to what?
Speaker 1: Well it was a small business, probably $8 to 10 million, losing money.  I made it the most profitable on a per capita basis, on a, as a, on a margin percent basis I guess that you'd say, within that firm.
Speaker 2: How do you do that?  Do you look at--analytically, do you look at where we are and what needs to be done with skills you learned in business school, or how, how do you do it?
Speaker 1: Well pretty much you look at what are the issues that affect this business?  You meet with the staff, you go through, you know, I understand thi- I understand where you are; I don't understand why you're there.  And tell me what the issues are, and how we can collectively work to make this a more successful venture.  And so you just sort of work through, you identify all the issues.  In this case, this was a new product being brought to the U.S. that was manufactured in Europe.  We had manufacturing problems, we had started a plant in the U.S. and we had manufacturing problems there.  It was a product that for which there was really no marketing, effective marketing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the product?
Speaker 1: It was called alucobond.  It was, if you look at the geodesic dome at Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orland, Florida], the golf ball [Spaceship Earth]?  The exterior cladding on that product, on that golf ball is alucobond.  It's a low den- it's a product with a low density polyethylene core bonded to two twenty gauge aluminum sheets that can be molded, shaped with normal kind of wood work tools.  But it was a product that was very successful in Europe for interior applications, and ping pong tables.  In Europe, people played ping pong outdoors, and this product was lightweight, extremely flat, is--married two technologies, Alusuisse [Schweizerische Aluminium AG] was both an aluminum company and a chemical company, it had, it made polyethylene and other plastics.  So this reflected a unique technology.
Speaker 2: Sounds like a DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] product.
Speaker 1: Yeah, DuPont didn't develop one like this, but it's the kind of product that would have integrated several divisions, or a couple of divisions of DuPont, as it did for Alusuisse.  But what I looked at was, you needed to build a distribution network, you needed to have manufacturing liability, which we didn't have, we needed to be able to market it.  And marketing meant advertising, and this company had never done any serious advertising, so I proposed a million dollar ad, ad budget.  And the guy who was then vice chairman said, "Okay.  We'll try that."  And it was successful, and we created a distribution network where we could have manuf- where we could have local fabricators to do the work that was necessary, and we pulled through, through our advertising to identify projects and opportunities, and we managed those.  So I was very successful.  So when I got the opportunity to run, to become planning manager for a large division of sh- that made manufactured sheet and plate products, which was mainline business for aluminum company.  And then that created a division that I ended up heading that had the high growth, high growth and high margin businesses.
Story_ID: 532991
Speaker 1: So with that in your back pocket, I mean once you've achieved that sort of success--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean, you, you, you can go on to the next place?  Or you, you stay there for a while?
Speaker 2: Well, you go on to the next place.  You build on that success. I got re- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you can only do that at the next place?
Speaker 2: Right.  You can really only do it at the next place.  I was not an aluminum person, so I was never going to ascend to the throne of being the top aluminum guy.  I was a generalist who had good, reasonably good management skills, and could apply those to a number of situations.  But, and some jobs, unless you had worked in a foundry, unless you had worked in a sheeting plate, plate plant, you wouldn't have the credentials, you wouldn't be accepted.  So I ended up taking a job actually working for ARCO Metals [ARCO Metals Company].  And the only reason I took the job at ARCO Metals was because they indicated to me, this is really not a metals company, this is really a division, a metal division of a large petroleum company, so you have the opportunity to move into some other things.  So I, I took that job, I went to ARCO Metals in Chicago [Illinois], basically des- in a position as a marketing VP.  And I had my marketing, my marketing books so I could read the book and understand what I was supposed to do.  But it was a program designed to acquire a number of businesses and to build a business around advanced materials.
Speaker 1: So you had to acquire other businesses--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to build a larger business?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I made the pitch along with the president of ARCO Metals, a guy name Bill Chamberlain [Willard Thomas "Bill" Chamberlain], to the executive committee of Atlantic Richfield [Atlantic Richfield Company], and we talked about a billion dollar investment.  'Cause you had to be at least a billion dollars for it to be meaningful to an oil co- oil company.  And we did that in December, and I think by the end of March, ARCO had decide the price of crude oil, rather than going from twenty-nine to thirty dollars a barrel, was actually going to decline to as low as eighteen dollars a barrel.  So they divested, or made the decision to divest any of the businesses that weren't cash positive.  And so I'm, very quickly moved from a guy who was about to buy businesses to one who was now going to sell businesses.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Liquidate 'em, yeah.
Speaker 2: Liquidating and actually ultimately shutting down ARCO Metals.  So I ended up being responsible for the sale of American Brass [American Brass Company], which was the largest brass company in the country at the time, about 560 (unclear) $5 million in sales.  And Wisconsin Centrifugal [Waukesha, Wisconsin], which I was the chairman of the board of that before selling it, and that was about a $65 million business.  So I did that, then basically ARCO Metals was shut down, I moved to ARCO Chemical [ARCO Chemical Company] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the mid-'80s [1980s], and then did a number of things at ARCO Chemical.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the highlights at ARCO Chemical?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I was the first African American officer, I became--I ran a--I was responsible for Europe and Asia for a plastics business, then moved to public affairs.  Became the VP of public affairs, did that for a while.  It was a newly public company, so I had a more, much more, much more public stance.  I ended up becoming vice president of national accounts, responsible for about 40 percent of the company's sales, did that for a while.  Became vice president of purchasing and supply, as well as had responsibility for transportation services and customer service.  I did that for a while, and then I became, then I had worldwide continuous improvement.
Story_ID: 532992
Speaker 1: Now, all, all, during this whole time, just stopping at world- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the worldwide improvement.  Who had served as mentors?  Had you at this point acquired one?
Speaker 2: N-
Speaker 1: Or at least behind the scenes?
Speaker 2: Well, I may have had a mentor in the chairman of the board, who was happened, who happened to be a white guy from Louisiana.  A guy named Lod Cook [Lodwrick Cook].  And he was chairman of the board of, of ARCO Chemical [ARCO Chemical Company], and also CEO and chairman of the board of Atlantic Richfield [Atlantic Richfield Company] in Los Angeles [California].  And, and was supportive.  When I retired, he was also an executive VP responsible for the metals company.  So he knew me from the day of hire.  And so he monitored my progress, I think, and periodically he would give me feedback.  The former president of ARCO Metals [ARCO Metals Company] was a guy named Bill Chamberlain [Willard Thomas "Bill" Chamberlain].  And at one point, I just sent a note to him and said, "I'm not sure if there's a place for me here.  It doesn't look like there's an opportunity for me to do anything to grow."  And, and so he asked me to come out to Los Angeles and, talked, talked to me about, you know, that there--he thought that there was a real opportunity.  At one point while we were going through the divestitures, and the shutdown of Americ- ARCO Metals, I just made the point that it looked like the guys who were leaving were getting all the goodies.  The guys who were staying did not, and I ended up getting a special bonus.
Speaker 1: To stay?
Speaker 2: To stay.  So that part was interesting.  So I think there may have been people who were certainly supportive of my candidacy for positions.
Story_ID: 532993
Speaker 1: And ultimately the CEO of ARCO Chemical [ARCO Chemical Company] was a guy I worked very closely with when I was working on a joint venture in Italy, Hal Sorgenti [Harold A. Sorgenti], and I think Hal was a, mentor and a guy, a confidant that I could talk to.  I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, let me ask you this--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --now that we have someone that you can talk to, did you ever talk to him about racial issues?  Did you ever feel the need to say, okay, as a, as an African American male, I feel this within this company.
Speaker 1: I could do that with him, and did do that on occasion because I felt that there were some things that were happening that shouldn't have been happening.
Speaker 2: For example?
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't feel that the environment was conducive for blacks to advance in the company.  And I just said that to him.  And I--at the time--
Speaker 2: How did he take it?
Speaker 1: Well, he said, "Well, you don't quite understand."  And I said, "Well, I may not, but all I can do is tell you what the outcomes are and what the results are."
Speaker 2: And what were the results?
Speaker 1: That, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What could you rattle off to him?
Speaker 1: Well I, you know, we were not--there were no blacks in what I called critical positions.  There were some positions that you knew in planning, for example, were precursors to growth opportunities.  And so when you looked at the system, they sort of gravitated to the people who had those certain kinds of experiences.  And folks weren't getting those experiences.  And he was a guy that I felt comfortable enough I could say it to.  And then--
Speaker 2: Did it offend him?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  I think he appreciated it in some ways.  He sort of viewed himself as an underdog.  He was Italian from New York [New York], and I remember one time a country club near our offices--.  Our offices were near Newtown Square [Pennsylvania], which is suburban Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And there was a country club called Aronimink [Aronimink Golf Club, Newtown Square, Pennsylvania] that was about to be the host for the U.S. Open [United States Open Championship], and they wanted to use our parking lot.  And, and Hal asked me, "Well, what do you think?"  And I said, "Well, I can't become a member there, so why would I be supportive of them using our parking lot?"  And he said, "Yeah, I hadn't thought about that."  So, we said no.  But he used the same line on them.  And said, "Well you know I can't even be a member here."  I mean it's a very, you know, ritzy club I guess is a way to describe it, selective. And they said, "Do you want to be a member?  We can make you a member quickly.  We can make that happen."  He did not join.  He did not join.  So I--and he was a guy that quite honestly was in, ahead of his time in many ways.  When we built a new office building, he populated the building with art f- of black artists.  And it wasn't truly altruistic, he looked at it in terms of undervalued art.  And so he took great pride in showing that, that we spent a couple million dollars in art, it was worth twice that you know four, four years later.  And when ARCO Chemical ultimately was sold to Lyondell Petrochemical [Lyondell Petrochemical Company; LyondellBasell] out of Houston [Texas], they put those pieces of art up for sale, Hal bought the whole collection.  I wanted to buy some selected pieces, he bought the whole collection and donated it to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts [Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which then had an exhibit, and basically, that exhibit, at the end of that, there was a dinner with all the living artists who were reflected in the collection were invited and participated.  So, and I participated in the selection of the art, and--
Speaker 2: Can you remember some of the artists?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam, Charles Brantley [ph.], (pause) there are about twelve artists.  Betye Saar--
Speaker 2: Was that your foundation in the arts for--?  Did he, at least, I know he didn't cultivate, but did he even plant the seed--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --for becoming interested in art for you?
Speaker 1: Well, what I did was when I, when we bought one for ARCO, we bought one for Earle Bradford [HistoryMaker Earle Bradford, Jr.].  I used the ARCO discount to buy it for me.
Speaker 2: Nice.
Speaker 1: And so I have a nice collection of, of Moe Brooker is another one of the artists who was a local artist, and these were largely local artists.  And some, in some cases, Faith Ringgold, they were not local, but national, but we worked through a, a gallery downtown, and I would get the ARCO discount, and I would get, I'd get to meet the artist in some cases and I would go to their studios so that I wouldn't have to pay gallery prices.  And--
Speaker 2: Awesome, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we, you know we would negotiate the difference.
Story_ID: 532994
Speaker 1: So you were talking about from, you moved into international.
Speaker 2: Yes, my first job with ARCO Chemical [ARCO Chemical Company] actually was responsible for in Europe and Asia, for this, this alucobond product.  I'm sorry, not alucobond, that was at, that was at, Consolidated [Consolidated Aluminum Corporation].  I had responsibility for a product called (unclear), which was a plastic material largely used in instrument panels in the automobile industry.  So I had Europe and Asia, we had major presence in the U.S. at Ford [Ford Motor Company] particularly.  Then I moved from that into several other positions, but one of 'em which was, I had responsibility for a joint venture with EniChem, the state-owned chemical company of Italy, and the plan was we would build a plant in Ravenna, Italy that would use our technology for (unclear), and then in, in the U.S. we would build a plant that used their technology for a iso- isothermic styrene monomer.  And we worked on it, I probably worked on it for eighteen months, I went to Europe probably every other month, and to Italy probably the bulk of the time.  We also had meetings in, in Maidenhead in Great Britain, where we had a regional office.  And so, he [Harold A. Sorgenti] and I spent a lot of time negotiating the deal, putting the deal together, and then I presented it to the ARCO board, it was a hundred million dollar investment on our part, and got the commitment, and then subsequently the Italians didn't want to do it, so, it, it fell apart.  But then I moved into public affairs and corporate communications and the other things I ended up doing.
Speaker 1: How did you mo- you became the vice president of national account management of, of--that was a different position?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean, I, I had gone into--I had been the VP of public affairs and we morphed that into corporate communications.  Then I became the national accounts VP, and then the supply VP, and then I had the worldwide responsibility for our continuous improvement activities.
Story_ID: 532995
Speaker 1: Well, when did you work for the arts council, or the arts club that we talked about?
Speaker 2: Freedom Theatre [New Freedom Theatre, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?  Or, or, or The Barnes Foundation [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That was after I retired.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I retired in 1999, I believe, and--
Speaker 1: You retired in '99 [1999]?
Speaker 2: Well, I assume that the way our oil companies and petrochemical companies do, is that periodically we have a, an opportunity to get benefits, an additional three to five years on your age, three to five years on your length of service, and you get essentially bought out.  And I swore that if my kids were out of college that would make a lot of sense and you could start another career.  So I chose to leave ARCO [ARCO Chemical Company] at that point and, as it was, even before I actually fully retired I was named the interim executive director of The Barnes Foundation.  And it was because of my involvement at, on the Lincoln board [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], Lincoln had the responsibility for The Barnes Foundation through the naming, or the nomination of four of the five directors on The Barnes Foundation board.  And I had encouraged, the then chairman of the Lincoln board, Kenneth Sadler, to stand for nomination to that board, and when he did, he got on it, then the guy who had been the president of the board was changed, voted out of office, basically.  And he had been sort of operating as a quasi-director of the foundation.  And so they then needed someone to run the foundation until they were able to hire someone.  And he knew I would, had recently retired, so he asked me if I'd be willing to do that.  And I said if the price is right, I'd be willing to do it, so I ended up, it was only intended to be about three months, and after about eight months, I said, "Guys, I gotta go.  This is not--."  Because I was, the board was fractured because of the conflict between the former president of the board who was now just a member of the board, and the rest of the members of the board (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he stayed on as a member?
Speaker 2: No, I did not stay on as a member.
Speaker 1: No, I said, he stayed, the president--
Speaker 2: The former, yes.
Speaker 1: The former president stayed on as a member.
Speaker 2: Stayed on as a member.  And so there was conflict there, and The Barnes Foundation is a tremendous collection of impressionist and post-impressionist works, and one of the world's finest, but it's in a community that did not appreciate the presence of many of the visitors, and the fact that the control had changed to an African American institution.
Speaker 1: Who were the visitors?
Speaker 2: The visitors actually were not African American.  They were, they were European; they were people who were visiting the city that became aware of this gem in a suburban community.  And so there were limitations on the number of people who could visit.  At one point, only five hundred people could visit per week.  And that was two hundred on Thursday, two hundred on Friday, and one hundred on Saturday, or something like that.  So, and, and the foundation had been set up by an eccentric millionaire [Albert C. Barnes] many years before, and he created an indenture that was very restrictive.  And including, to give you an example, no one would ever make more than two thousand dollars, you know, a year in this indenture.  No--they would never invest in anything other than railroad stocks and U.S. securities, U.S. backed securities.  So, you know, would have been a foundation that probably, had it caught the, the growth cycle in the market would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, when I took over the foundation, was about $10 million worth.  And there had been substantial problems with the neighbors and the township over parking in the area and access to the foundation.  So it's not a foundation that gives away money, but it is a foundation that manages this tremendous collection, which is valued I've seen numbers as high as $10 billion.
Speaker 1: Oof (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it's a--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It's a tremendous collection.  So, I did that for about eight, eight and a-half months.
Story_ID: 532996
Speaker 1: Now New Freedom Theatre [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was simply volun- volunteer work?
Speaker 2: Right.  In the case of Freedom Theatre, I had served, when I first moved to the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area, the contributions person for the company I talked to about volunteer opportunities.  ARCO [ARCO Chemical Company] I guess created a culture that the expectation was that executives would be engaged in the community through volunteerism, and so I looked for, what are the things that might be of interest?  And for me, black theater was a personal interest.  And, and there was a theater company in North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] that I could be a part of.  And at one point I was chairman of the board, I served on that board for about twelve or fourteen years, and I was chairman of the board for a while, and then I was no longer chairman, but later, the chairman of that board had decided to, or had taken a job that would take him out of the city.  We were going through a leadership change at the executive director level and we were in the process of trying to find someone who could be executive director.  We knew we had cash problems and were in the midst of a renovation project of, of a theater that had been a vision of one of the founders who--
Speaker 1: Who was that founder?
Speaker 2: John Allen.  John Allen [John E. Allen, Jr.] and Bob Leslie [Robert E. Leslie, Sr.] were co-founders.  And they had finally gotten some money from the state, about $4 million.  That was about ten years later than they expected, so the cost that they had estimated at $4 million was probably now $8 to 9 million.  So I agreed to take over as board chair for the unexpired term of this individual, and then, and we hired a consultant to manage the theater.  And it was obvious after about nine months that the consultant was losing interest, and there was concern about whether or not we were financially viable, and the efforts in terms of getting the theater, the auditorium complete were, you know, really in question.  So, I, I finally let the consultant go, and I ran the theater.  And I didn't take a salary partly because I didn't want somebody else to tell me how to do it.  And so, I did it for about, about nine months.  I hired a--got them back on a stable footing financially, hired a executive director and then later just got off the board.

Speaker 1: You were basically out of retirement and working at the Freedom Theatre [New Freedom Theatre, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Yes.
Speaker 1: On your own, not taking a salary because you wanted to call the shots.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did you get we'll just say pulled back in?
Speaker 2: Well, after I left Freedom Theatre I did some consulting.  I did some work for some for-profit enterprises and it set up a consulting practice.  But it was good business during the winter, and I like to play golf during the spring and summer.  And basically, one of my golf partners happened to be a member of Community Council's board [Community Council for Mental Health and Mental Retardation; Community Council Health Systems, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And they had run into a significant financial problem, and he asked me if I'd be willing to come in on a Saturday morning, not--about two years ago this time.  I think it was like December 7th.  And to listen to presentations by the exec- current executive director, and his two top people and then give him my impressions.  He, he thought that they would probably fire the executive director and just, but wanted my input.  So I came in and listened to what they had to say, and understood what their problems were, and they talked about their problems being not paying payroll taxes to the city, state and federal government.  And I looked at the problem differently.  That was the result of not having sufficient cash.  And so that meant that their expenses were much higher than their revenues.  So, I gave them my feedback, and one of the questions they asked me whether I thought that the two, any, either of the two direct reports to the CEO would be appropriate as an interim CEO, and my impression at the time was no, they would not be, and that they needed to hire a new CEO.  And they said, "You know, we're going to initiate a search for that.  Would you be willing to serve as an interim CEO?"  And I said, you know, for three months I'd be willing to do that full-time, and then maybe for half time for another three months if that, if that helped them.  So they went through a search process, and then at some point during the process, they got the candidates, looked at them, interviewed them.  Then they said, "Would you be willing to consider working as a CEO?"  And they had, several of the people that reported to me had gone down to talk to the board chair, and suggested they'd really like to see me stay.  Because when I came in, I said to them, I only expected to be there three months, but I was going to act like I was going to be there forever.  So, you know, "Don't play me as a short timer.  We're going to deal with the long term issues."  So they came back to me, and I said, "I'd be willing to consider it, you understand, I'm more expensive than your typical hire."  They, I think they were looking to pay $125,000 for somebody.  So, I said, "You know, if you're will- if you can meet my financial requirements, I would do it."  And I committed to a two- to three year commitment, I guess, to do it.  And the business lost a little less than $4 million in fiscal year '04 [2004].  In fiscal year '05 [2005] we turned it around and we made about $2 million on about $22 million in revenue.  And this past fiscal year, we made about $2 million on $23 million in revenue.
Speaker 1: So you've turned it around?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we turned it around, and we've implemented new, put in place new accounting software, enterprise wide systems, HR [human resources], project accounting, payroll, automated the purchasing process, and a number of things.  A very positive experience and I think we've created a bit of a reputation as a well managed organization.  There's a lot more that needs to be done, but I think for a non-profit, community mental health agency I think we understand what needs to be done and we manage it rather aggressively.
Story_ID: 532998
Speaker 1: So what's next for you?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's a good question.   I would, there's still some work that I'd like to see get done here [Community Council for Mental Health and Mental Retardation; Community Council Health Systems, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  In fact, this morning I reaffirmed the commitment from the city for a $2 million investment to renovate this building and the building in the back.
Speaker 1: What was this building before?  It looks like a--it's beautiful structure.
Speaker 2: It's, it was an orphanage, and it was built in the 1850s.  And it, you know, it, it's a magnificent building, you know, if you just look at it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it's not been well maintained.  And the, similarly, the building in the back, which is a adolescent services building was built in the early 1900s, but again, not well maintained.  And my commitment is that we will provide quality services to all the people we serve, we will do it efficiently, 'cause the reimbursement rates for the most part are based around inefficient providers.  So to the degree we can be more efficient we will in fact be profitable.  And we have to manage programs, so once a month we have a program review, we have eighteen different programs for serving kids and adults, and we are in about sixty-five different schools as a result of those school based programs.  But once a month I meet with each one of the program directors, we go through their monthly performance, we review not only their financial performance but their outcomes, their quality audits, the results of quality audits, results of compliance audits, reviewing your staffing, make sure that they're adequate, and that they know what they're doing.  And we make changes when people don't.  And we make, we get out of programs that don't, that don't fit our pistol so to speak, that don't work for us, that we can't be successful in.
Story_ID: 532999
Speaker 1: So what are your hopes for the African American community in the future?
Speaker 2: Ooh.  That's a, that's a huge question.  I guess my hope is that African Americans would have the same opportunities that all Americans have.  And that means that we have the opportunity for growth, success, we can build on our history for a successful future.

Speaker 1: Where did your children go to school?  And what are they doing now?
Speaker 2: One of my kids [Blake Bradford] went to Williams College [Williamstown, Massachusetts], got a master's in art history from University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: And what is he doing?
Speaker 2: He's at the Hyde Park Art Center as education director in Chicago [Illinois].  My middle son [Kipp Bradford] is an engineer.  Got his undergraduate and graduate degrees at Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], and is a budding entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: What's his, what's he going to do?  What does he want to do?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I was reviewing a proposal from--that he had today about a special hearing aid device that has unique technology that would be more cost effective than existing devices, and more user friendly in many ways.  So, he's got a proposal, he's looking for some venture capital funding.  And my youngest son [Corey Bradford] is a personal trainer, and trying to figure out how to get out of personal training and into something--
Speaker 1: And into?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure.  He's not sure what he wants to do, but he knows what he doesn't want to do.  And so he's--
Speaker 1: At least he's in shape (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's in wonderful shape.  I mean, I, the good news is that's the way I once looked I think.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But the weight is redistributed, you know gravity does have its impact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 533001
Speaker 1: So when you look back over--I mean, your life isn't, hasn't been that long, it's not like, you know, a lot of the HistoryMakers are eighties, nineties, but when you look back over at what you've been able to do thus far, what really stands out?  What are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: I think the balance.  I've always, I've worked hard at what I do, be it at work, or in volunteer activities.  I always felt the need to be engaged in the community, so that, be it my work--.  I think when I was in Chicago [Illinois], I, I was on the board of rehabilitative services, which is in the western part of the city.  In St. Louis [Missouri] I was on the board of Camp Kiwanis [sic. Kiwanis International].  And those were all great experiences for me, both to contribute, or my experience at Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] as a member of the board.  But I could contribute what skills I had and my commitment to excellence.  So as an opportunity to have an impact on a broader range of people then I do my day to day work environment.
Speaker 1: What is it you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: That I was a good person, I tried hard.  I would, didn't, I didn't always do what, what I, let's say what I could, but I tried.
Story_ID: 533002
Speaker 1: And you know what?  I didn't--and this is from the beginning, but I just want you to add something about him because I didn't ask, and you didn't talk much about your stepfather.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have a stepfather.  That was my, my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my--I have a step-grandfather [Leon Bradford].
Speaker 1: A step-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, my father [Earle Bradford, Sr.], my father was certainly a significant influence in my life, and, and imbued a certain value in hard work, and, and that it wasn't going to be given to you.  And, but he also had a certain arrogance about him.
Speaker 1: What did he teach you that you taught your sons?
Speaker 2: That they could be whatever they wanted to be.  I mean that, and that they didn't have to take any gruff about it.  That they were--at the end of the day, they're gonna be judged, I thought, by the character of themselves as opposed to the color of their skins.  And that they were going to have to work to do that.  Their environment was going to be more difficult than mine because I, I grew up at a time when there were emerging opportunities and, and there were chances for people to be successful.  And it may not have been for the right reasons, and I don't judge the reasons, but the outcomes were that there were opportunities that then existed for African Americans coming out of school that don't exist today.
Story_ID: 533003
Speaker 1: When did you decide to take advantage of becoming a member of that country club?
Speaker 2: Well, that was interesting.  I had joined a country club, as an executive I had had the option of joining a country club--
Speaker 1: That same one?  The one in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that they wanted to--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --use the parking lot?
Speaker 2: Actually, not that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the one that I'm a member of, the Philadelphia Country Club [Gladwyne, Pennsylvania] is a venerable club in the Philadelphia area, and one of the guys who worked for me was a member.  And at one point I asked him were they ready for a black member because it was the closest club to my home; it's five minutes from where I live.  And his comment was, "Let me check.  Let me check because I know somebody on the admissions committee."
Speaker 1: Let me check?  And this is 1993?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, this, this, that was probably 1990.  And so he checked, and they said, "No, they're not ready."  Now, this is serious business.  And then I ended up joining another club, Commonwealth country club [Commonwealth National Golf Club] in Horsham, Pennsylvania, which had corporate memberships, and I could get that, it wasn't, wasn't an issue.  But these are, these are, these are mainline clubs.  So, a few years later, another friend and business associate said, "Earle [HistoryMaker Earle Bradford, Jr.], would you be willing, or would you be interested in becoming a member of Philadelphia Country Club?"  And I said I would.  And he said, "Well, I think that we could marshal a vote on the admissions committee.  And if you're interested, we'll do it."  Well the company [ARCO Chemical Company] had been paying for the memberships, and then when all of the furor came about because of the restricted memberships and the like, the company decided we're not gonna, we're not gonna pay for anybody to be members.  So at the process that started, I just continued it and paid for it myself.  But, you know, this is, you know, Shoal Creek [Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club, Shoal Creek, Alabama], which is something that brought to the surface the whole question of membership in, in country clubs.  And really the PGA [Professional Golfers' Association] requiring that there be diversity in country clubs.  That--a lot of these opportunities would not have existed.  At Philadelphia Country Club, there are a thousand members, there are two black members.  And I was the first there.
Story_ID: 533004
Speaker 1: The first day you go, do you feel comfortable, uncomfortable?  I mean you--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they said three years earlier, "We're not ready."
Speaker 2: Well I didn't, you know there, there--it's interesting.  I mean, I look at it differently than, than most because a lot of folks when they join country clubs their kids are younger, they're younger.  I joined it because I play golf, and it's in good proximity, I can go over there, I'm five minutes from home and the like.  I'm using the facilities more for dinner, you know, once a month or so.  Or just we're, you know, it's too late to fix dinner, my wife [Yvette Savwoir Bradford] and I will go over there for dinner.  But they're not, it's not a place that you go where there's great food.  And there are a lot of other alternatives, restaurants that you would go to.  But I do it, I have breakfasts over there, I have, I brought probably the first black organization to have an event there.  The Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], which we haven't mentioned, but my fraternity, I had a responsibility for a meeting, and, and so we had a joint meeting with a ladies--there probably ten years ago.  And that was the first time, I'm absolutely sure that there was a black organization to have dinner there.  Last year, this agency [Community Council for Mental Health and Mental Retardation; Community Council Health Systems, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] had a fundraiser there, and we had music, and I was told by some of the staff it was the best party that's ever been at Philadelphia Country Club [Gladwyne, Pennsylvania].  So, it's an exposure thing, but my former boss now is a member, and some other folks that I know, so it's, it's much more comfortable for me today.  But I've had situations where I've gotten very dirty looks, and I've gotten--my wife and I were over there one time and you heard somebody said, grumbling, "Every- everybody could come here now," kind of thing, you know.  It's a, it's a club that would cost you to get golf membership fifty thousand dollars, you know, and you'd have to wait for it.  Yeah, so it's not, you know, and, and I've paid my dues just like everybody else.  So I, I ignore the assholes, and I just move on.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So what do the boys think about it?
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: Have no interest--
Speaker 2: Have no interest whatsoever.  Well, first of all, the notion of putting a tie on or jacket on for dinner is not one of the things that turns them on.  And if you're going to go for a casual dinner, I'd much rather go someplace nicer, I mean, with nicer food.  But, you know, we, so we don't use it as a family very much, but my wife and I go over often.  Often enough to make sure that they know who I am.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you get your money's worth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, I mean, that's a hefty membership.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then everything's a la carte, I'm sure you're paying for dinner, you're paying to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --play golf, you're paying every--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that's just--
Speaker 2: Well, we're paying a six thousand dollar annual fee that covers most of your golfing, it doesn't cover cart fees, but, you know, and you have a meal requirement.  You have a, I think it's three hundred dollars annually, or six hundred dollars annually for, for food.
Story_ID: 533005
Speaker 1: So you've received a lot of awards.  Of the ones you've received, which, I would say which two have meant something to you?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well probably I was a bit surprised by the Cornell black alumni award [Wilbur Parker Distinguished Alumni Award].
Speaker 1: That they recognized you, or that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, you never think about what you're doing as having significance to anybody but you.  And, so that was nice recognition.
Speaker 1: Who else have they recognized?
Speaker 2: Well, the originator [Wilbur Parker], which was the first black to graduate from the B-school [Graduate School of Business and Public Administration, Cornell University; Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Ithaca, New York], who was a former accountant.  And his name escapes me right now.  And a guy who was in a class behind me who was a, I think he's just a high level government official from the government, just retired.  So there, there are a couple of, couple of folks.  This is only the third time the award's been given.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that one?  The Cornell award?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably.
Speaker 1: And another one?  Just another that has meant something to you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I've gotten awards from Freedom Theatre [New Freedom Theatre, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I thought, I felt very good about what I was able to do there.  At least to put them on, on a quasi-solid footing.  They--black theater art is a tough sell because the truly creative folks are competing with the more commercial stuff.  And going to North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] is more of a challenge.  People are less willing to do that.  But you know I enjoyed the recognition.  I've--somehow feeling that I've made a difference there.
Speaker 1: Well, you've made a difference in lots of places.  And we thank you for your time today.
Speaker 2: I appreciate it.  Good.
