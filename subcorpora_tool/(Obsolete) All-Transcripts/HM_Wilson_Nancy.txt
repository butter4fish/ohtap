Speaker 1: Hi, I'm [HistoryMaker] Merri Dee.  I am privileged to be doing a HistoryMaker [The HistoryMakers] interview of nationally acclaimed song stylist, [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson.
Speaker 2: I'm Nancy Wilson.  That's N-A-N-C-Y, W-I-L-S-O-N.  And if you were to look me up on the Internet, you'd probably find Ms. Nancy Wilson.

Speaker 1: Early, early, early years.  Go back for us.  How early can you remember?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of six children, born into a family that really cared about each other.  Much love, lots of grandparents.  The first memory of performing and being a brat and a ham, was about three years old.  It occurred to my grandparents and my mom, my mother especially, and my father that she thinks she can sing.  And I had 'My Little Margie' ['Margie'] down pat.  I did a soft shoe, and then the family seemed to think that it was quite cute, and then they would ask me to do my little routine.  Then it reached a point within six months or so that if I have to do my routine, then my audience must be still and quiet, and watch me as I perform what I do.  So that was the first, I think, actual experience of thinking I was on stage.  I don't recall ever wanting and desiring to be in show business.  I always knew that God had given me a gift, and I used it.  My initial church experiences were from the age one to like eight, in a small, very tiny church in a place called Whiskey Run, Ohio [Whiskey Run Road], which was outside Richmond Dale [Ohio], near Chillicothe [Ohio].  I was born across the street from Zion Baptist Church [Chillicothe, Ohio].  My mother was Lillian Evelyn Ryan [Lillian Ryan Manis], married Olden Dever Wilson [Olden Wilson].  When I was born they were eighteen and nineteen.  My grandmother on my mother's side was living.  Her mother and father were living, so those are Chris [Chris Johnson (ph.)] and Anna Johnson [ph.].  On my father's side there was Anna [Anna Jackson Wilson] and Albert Wilson.  Ms. Ann's grandpar- their--her mother and father were Reverend John [John Jackson] and Carrie Jackson.  I was blessed.  Baptist church, I was able to sing in the choir, at maybe eight.  I recall being on a bill at a church.  On the program was Clara Ward, but I was out front, in front of my mom and her sisters, and I was the lead singer for this group.  And I sang songs like, 'I Am Bound for Canaan Land.'  I was still at that point even singing songs that were more ballad-y as opposed to trying to be Clara Ward or Shirley Caesar.  I really loved the wonderful songs like 'Just a Closer Walk with Thee,' but I was also singing secular music.
Story_ID: 465208
Speaker 1: My father [Olden Wilson] and my mother [Lillian Ryan Manis] were divorced when I was five.  There were two children, Michael [Michael Wilson] and Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson].  We lived with my father and his mom and dad, and my mother was there all the time.  My father re-married, I was eight, and my mom, Bertha Beatrice Trout [Bertha Trout Wilson], was nineteen, and my father was twenty-eight.  And consequently, it was a bunch of young people growing up in the same household.  We were fortunate to have Grandma [Anna Jackson Wilson] and Grandpa Wilson [Albert Wilson].  And Grandma, Ms. Ivy [ph.], and Ms. Ivy was special--that was my mother's mother.  So I was blessed in having all these wonderful grandparents and these loving people around me.  My mom, and you'll find as the interview goes on, if I say my mom, I'm speaking of my stepmother, which is not a word I normally use.  If I say Mommy, that's my mother.  And Pop is Pop.  But we were blessed in that there was no friction, there was no divi- division.  I mean, it was just kind of a great conglomerate of people who were there to support this young kid who was the oldest, and appeared to have this little talent, and she loved secular music.  And, I was singing songs like 'Street of Dreams' and not allowed to sing in my mom's church, so I went to the Methodist church and sang in their choir because I did not believe that the God that had wrapped his arms around me as a baby did not give me the gift that I had.  And when my mother, my mom, would be putting (unclear) about she is, she shouldn't be singing in these dens of iniquity, she should be singing for the glory of the Lord.  And my answer to my mom, for her mother was, what makes you assume I'm not?  Consequently, as I say, I was blessed to know that I was given a gift, and also asked him to give me a little wisdom to go along with it because I didn't find show business that intriguing, but I loved the gift.  The voice was something that I re- I respected it, I appreciated it, and I knew that it had to be used wisely.

Speaker 1: Tell me more about your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Oh dear.  The first serious gown that I remember, it was a grey, a gun metal grey with little pink floral prints just below the knee, with a bolero jacket, and it was so adorable.  And I wore it on my first television show ['Skyline Melodies'].  It was given to me by Ms. Ann [Anna Jackson Wilson].  Now, Ms. Ann was my dad's mother, and she was so special, very quiet, but as I grew older, everybody thought that she was mean.  But she was never mean to me.  She was always the brightest light in my life.  She saw to it that I had the things I needed to be the person that I wanted to be, and always encouraged me to be the best I could be.  Albert [Albert Wilson], Grandpa Wilson, oh, he was my heart.  He was just funny, smart, and gave the best he could give to his family, and raised some really great kids.  My father, very special man.  Everybody loved Butch, Olden Wilson.  My father, when I was born, was a chef at Dawson's Restaurant [ph.] in Columbus, Ohio.  Went on become the--I don't know how, what you would call it, the worker, he was a supervisor at the iron foundry, Jeffrey Manufacturing Company [The Jeffrey Manufacturing Company; The Jeffrey Company, Columbus, Ohio], and also did their picnics and whatnot.  He was the one who did all of the food for that, which was a lot of fun because on late Saturday night the entire Wilson clan had great meals.  We had porterhouse steaks and all those things that came from the leftovers at the picnic.  My dad was special, and he got a lot of his humor and his attitude, and they were from Grandpa.  Grandpa Wilson was tall and so fine.  I was fortunate enough to know his mother, Josephine [Josephine Wilson], with this long braid that would hang way down her back.  And I'm still trying to find the tribe that Josephine was from, but she was pure blooded Indian [Native American].  And I have pictures of my great-grandmother, my grandmother, grandfather, Carrie [Carrie Jackson], John [John Jackson], all of them in one picture, and the aunts and uncles.  I was about six at that time, and that's one of my most treasured possessions is the one picture where we're all together.  And I have a picture of my mom, my mother, her mother, grandmother and grandfather, and all of--my grandmother had twelve children, and all the children were out in front of this house, which is where my grandmother lived.  And I--this is another valued possession.  I have been able to have my family with me, both in my heart, and fortunate enough to find some of these photos that show who we were and who we are.  I have always known in my heart who they were because they lived with me.  I carry all of that with me, and they make me who I am.  And they were humble people.
Story_ID: 465210
Speaker 1: I come--where I spent my summers--barefoot, because it was fun.  I loved to see the peddler coming around on Saturday morning, that was a great times.  Picked tomatoes--ate more in the field than I ever brought in the house.  But it was great growing up in the summertime in the country.  And then I thought when I went back to the city, which was also not the city because there were no sidewalks--it was a great way to be raised, to be reared.  I've always felt that one of the better parts of my life was being brought up, going to school in the Midwest, in Chillicothe [Ohio] and Columbus, Ohio.  I had the good fortune to know most of my family.  I didn't go south often because most of my family was in the Midwest.  Great-great-grandparents [sic. Wilson's paternal great-grandparents, Carrie Jackson and John Jackson], the Jackson, were in St. Petersburg, Florida.  And I was able to make that trip when I had my first child [Kenneth Dennis, Jr.].  I took him there to see his great-great-grandparents.  But I have tried to instill that in my children also, that everything you are comes through me, your father, his father, his father--and you know, the Samuel Burtons [ph.] and the homesteads.  Young people today don't have a clue about all of that.  And I am not that old, when you stop and think about it.  To know that and to experience that, and still only be seventy, imagine what my father [Olden Wilson], who was only nineteen years older, might have gone through, and what Grandpa Wilson [Albert Wilson] went through, who was not that much older than him.
Story_ID: 465211
Speaker 1: I just think it was a great way to be brought up.  I am so grateful that I lived where I lived, was brought up the way I was brought up, went to the schools I went to--I went to a one-room school from first to eighth grade, one teacher.  I remember her very well.  Her name was Vera Clark [ph.], there are some things I could laugh about today about her, but the important thing was I got an education, and there weren't more than twenty chil- children in the school.  So, we had individual attention.  Consequently when I went to the ninth grade at a massive--at that point and time I guess you would say--high school, which was on the west side, Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio], called West High School.  It was predominantly white, I would say 90 percent white and 10 percent black.  But I had been brought up interracially, I had been brought up with black and white, in and out of the house constantly, either house--any house that I was in, any grandparents' house--the friends were of every race.  There were Indians [Native American], they were--I mean, we just were raised that way.  That's the era I came up in, and I'm grateful for that.  High school--it never occurred to me I could not do and be whatever.  You know, I had made up my mind, really.  The voice was a constant, and it was always there.  If I'd had my way, I would rather have gone to Carnegie Tech [Carnegie Institute of Technology; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and studied anything in medicine.  I had a scholarship, however, to Central State University [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And at seventeen, had already had my own television show, had worked in clubs at fifteen.  I was with a band called Sir Raleigh Randolph and his Sultans of Swing.  I was working at the Club Regal [Columbus, Ohio] at fifteen.  I had a TV show called 'Skyline Melody' [sic. 'Skyline Melodies'] at fifteen.  Did not have show business parents or grandparents; no one in my family was in show business.  That's why I say the gift is just that, it's a gift.  I didn't ask for it, it was given, and it came, it just--doors opened.  It wasn't anything I sought.  At my high school we had band variety clubs and different things.  We had great, we put on great performances and good shows and I, from the day I stepped on campus, was in every show that was done at West High School until I graduated.  I was an officer, financial officer of the choir.  I was a vice president of the French club. I won letters in sports, and was a 3.8 student.  The only C I ever got was in algebra.  I never thought I'd ever have the need for it, (laughter) so I just didn't see any reason--no, that wasn't it.  Algebra was an A, geometry was a C.  Geometry to this day, if one of my grandsons ever asks me about geometry, they'd better seek out someone else to help them.
Story_ID: 465212
Speaker 1: When you smile, you mention Grandpa Wilson [Albert Wilson].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: I'd like to know a little bit of his background.  What was he doing when he was growing up?  How was it, do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, Grandpa--my father [Olden Wilson] was born in Hephzibah, Georgia, so that meant that Grandpa Wilson was from, from the South, he was Georgia.  But he was just so handsome, he was fine, he was mellow.  He did construction work, I always remember he had a truck.  He always had every tool he ever needed; he could fix anything.  Now, if you ask me what he did, I don't have a clue.  My grandfather was so busy.  He was helping the neighbors, he was fixing people's doors, and he could fix anything in any house.  He was always there, though.  He could fix a tricycle, and he could help you build, 'cause you couldn't afford it, a go-cart.  So Grandpa was the one who had the sense of humor and would always make you feel that you were the most beautiful, talented kid ever born.  He was just wonderful, just a great guy, and treated everyone he ever met with such respect, and made everybody laugh.  He could look at you with a smile that would melt your heart.  He just was that kind of gentle human being.
Speaker 1: Did you know his parents?
Speaker 2: Yes, his, his mother I knew.  That was Josephine [Josephine Wilson].  She was the matriarch, the one with the braids that she could sit on.  And I can't remember her voice, I don't remember her speaking a great deal.  She was very quiet, most like a classic, you know, stoic kind of person.  I remember Ms. Ann [Anna Jackson Wilson] was like that.  Every time I remember, thinking of Grandpa's mother, I would see her with her arms crossed across the chest and not speaking very many words.  But when Ms. Ann spoke, however, oh Lord, you listened.  She wasted very few words, and anything she said was of vital importance and you should really pay attention.  Because if she had to repeat it twice, you were in trouble.
Story_ID: 465213
Speaker 1: Those long ago years--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --always had sights, sounds, and smells from a kitchen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.  Well, before my father [Olden Wilson] re-married, I remember standing on an orange crate and learning how to fix breakfast.  And I must have been about five, and I could fix bacon, which was salt pork really, and you could smell all that.  I knew how to fix grits, I knew how to scramble eggs--I didn't know how to do over easy at that point.  But I would stand--and at this point my dad hadn't re-married, so it was me and Grandma [Anna Jackson Wilson] and Grandpa [Albert Wilson] and Daddy--and I would do the breakfasts, which is probably why, in my estimation, I don't know who else thinks so, but I think I'm one of the best cooks to walk this earth today.  And I love to cook.  My natural mother [Lillian Ryan Manis] was a gourmet cook.  My mom, southern all the way.  So, I remember the smell of greens--I was not a big eater, I'm to this day not.  But there was very special about sitting in the kitchen.  And we ate in the kitchen.  There was always something great going on.  To this day, I love pickled beets because my mom would make them, and she and I were the only ones who ate them.  Black-eyed peas were part of the staple diet at that point and time.  I had pneumonia as a youngster and I was going to a school in, down in the country in Richmond Dale [Ohio] at the time, and I remember they served beans at the cafeteria that day, and they were hard, and I thought that was one of the worse things I've ever eaten in my entire life.  I was eight.  I was, got sick, literally that night, and it was months before I was able to get out of bed and walk because it all turned into a severe case of pneumonia, and I blamed it on the beans.  It had to be twenty-five years before I ever ate another bean because I always blamed it on--the fact that I was so ill--I--and I had to learn to walk all over again and do a lot of things.  But I don't remember that as a sad time, I just remember disliking beans for years.  But I never was cared for so well in my life as I was when I was down in the country at my grandmother's house.  Grandma Ivy [ph.], my mother was there, my mom would come down.  My mom came along a little after that.  This was just before my dad re-married.  My mom--mother had, as I say, twelve brothers and sisters.  While I was ill, there was a baby being born in the back room, and his name is Anthony [Anthony Wilson], Tony.  I remember Uncle Bud [ph.] and Aunt Ruth [Ruth Cousins]--Aunt Ruth, she performed.  Lord, she carried on so bad (laughter).  But the baby came, and Uncle Bud, I remember him standing in the door.  At that point in time there must have been four of us ill with pneumonia.  We had to make like a kind of clinic kind of thing.  But here was this beautiful baby that they brought in.  And from that day on, everyone started to feel a lot better, and within a few days and weeks, we were all up and making the effort to, to get our strength back and walk around and be there.
Story_ID: 465214
Speaker 1: But I grew up with my mom's [Lillian Ryan Manis], my mother's sisters and brothers.  My Aunt Ruth [Ruth Cousins], Uncle Bob [ph.]--Mother had umpteen brothers, I had uncles younger than I.  My mother and my mom--and my grandmother were carrying babies at the same time.  So, that's me, Patty [ph.], who's sixteen months older, Gordon [Gordon Austin], who was six months younger, and there's Larry [Larry Austin], who is the only one of the family remaining.  And he is one of the nicest men ever, and I speak with his wife just the other day.  And all the men in the family have all had kidney problems and difficulties.  The women have lived to be in their eighties.  All of my uncles passed early, but I still have one left, and he's very much in my thoughts and prayers at this moment.  It was great growing up with all of these kids around.  We were always together because we lived fifty miles apart, and I could drive from the time I was maybe thirteen.  I had my license at fifteen, and I could drive those back roads on the 104, Route 104 [Ohio State Route 104].  And it--my--the car knew its way home, to either home, it did not matter.  But I could drive that in my sleep today.  I spent so much time, weekends, going back and forth.  The entire families would, would all be together. Someplace on the weekend, we'd all be together.
Story_ID: 465215
Speaker 1: What about your siblings?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  Being the oldest of six, in a way I wish I could have been the second born, because I think my brother's life would have been easier.  It was difficult to live up to being fifteen months younger than Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson].  'Cause he was this little show off, and this child who was a good student without effort, and did so many things.  And my brother Mickey, Michael Myers [Michael Wilson], I miss him so much.  He--if I thought my grandfather [Albert Wilson] and my dad [Olden Wilson] had humor, there's no one I've ever known in my life who had the kind of humor that my brother Mickey had.  Mike was so special and he and I were very close until his death.  He went in the [U.S. military] service as a youngster because of a D (laughter) because of a bad grade.  And it created quite an argument in the house, and Mike had decided what he wanted to do.  Our father had decided differently.  But at that point in time, as the oldest, and one who had worked and had been working for some years, didn't like the way I saw things going.   And I informed my parents and grandparents, "You should not treat us differently.  You sh- he--we are different people, but don't expect Mickey to be me; allow him to grow on his own and be his own person."  And they actually did listen.  Mike ended up coming out of the service and marrying a young woman named Baby Darling, Margaret [ph.], my sister-in-law, who was just as funny as Mickey--as a couple, they kept my life and a lot of people in our family, they kept us in stitches, they kept us going.  Both of them have passed.  I am very tight and close to Michael's kids--Mickey's kids, Melody [ph.] and Michael [ph.] and her children, and her grandchild.  It's hard for me to look at this year that we were all together, and to look at this beautiful little child and have to say great something.  It was like, oh, no I can't possibly have a great anything.  But they are so beautiful.  The kids--and Michael has a little girl named Myca [ph.] who is like a chip off the old block.  She's kind of, got a lot of Aunt Nancy in her, and it's just great to see that what I have been able to accomplish has meant a lot to them, in that they see that all things are possible, that you can do, you can be.  They know that I not only had a television show ['Skyline Melodies'], but that I went to college [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], that I have honorary doctorates.  And that I not only sing, but I do for the community, I work for the community.  They, they associate me with MLK Day [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day].  They associate me with the parades in Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] name.  They associate me with the Civil Rights Movement.  They know these things.  It's not something that's talked about often, but it has given them something that has kept their chin up, and keeps them lifted.
Story_ID: 465216
Speaker 1: And of course when my father [Olden Wilson] re-married, then I'm--have these other four.  I have three sisters, Rita Jean [Rita Wilson Crawford] whom--she was the sweetest person I've ever known, besides Bea [Wilson's stepmother, Bertha Trout Wilson], her mom.  My mom was the salt of the earth and very loving and very, very pro-Jesus, as was Rita Jean.  Rita had multiple sclerosis and passed a few years ago at the age of fifty-six.  Now, Brenda [Brenda Wilson Vann]--she was also married to, she was married to, and is, the Reverend Crawford.  And then Brenda is just (unclear), she runs Head Start in Cleveland, Ohio, and she's married to the Reverend Benjamin Vann.  And then the baby girl, Karen [Karen Wilson Davis], runs a, an events planning kind of thing.  She is married to the Reverend Todd Davis [ph.].  Of course, I'm married to the Reverend Wiley Burton.  Those are four of Olden's daughters, who (laughter) brought him over and made him see the light of day.  Because of--one of the funniest things that ever happened--I remember my mom and dad were in an automobile accident, and the first words out of mom's mouth were "Jesus."  And my father said, "I'm the one in this car, and I'm the one who's going to get you out of this car."  (Laughter) That to me was hilarious.  But prior to all of this--and then for Daddy to find out that all of his daughters ended up marrying--it was like, oh wait a minute, what, but he got the message.  He knew why.  He has always known that all of his children were surrounded and cared about the scripture, and not necessarily the King James Version of the scripture.  We were all about God and you can find him in many places and in many ways.  And then we lost our baby brother, Anthony [Anthony Wilson], at twenty-one.  I still see him high jumping, I still see him going over that. He was one of the best high jumpers in the country.  He was the Southeastern [Southeastern Conference] high jump champion, and if you know anything about high jumping, you know that Dwight Stones was absolutely phenomenal.  Well, my brother out-jumped Dwight Stones three out of four times.  So his name is Anthony Wilson.  To this day, there is a scholarship [Tony Wilson Award] at the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] in his name.  I still get the names of the people, the young men who are--they have to be scholars and athletes to get the scholarship, the money that is still there and still making money.  And I went and raised the first money to fund it, and it has continued to grow.  So, to the University of Tennessee, I have to applaud them for keeping that alive, and keeping his name and keeping what he was.  He was a fine, fine young man.  Who was very upset one day coming in from school and I couldn't figure out--I said, "Tony, what's wrong?"  He said, "It's not even Thanksgiving yet, and they're talking about Christmas." (Laughter) He was that kind of kid.  He was also the kind of kid who put on the black glove and knew so much about sports and understood about black power, but not in a negative kind of way.  He stood with his brothers as they stood on the Olympic stand, and knew that he was one of them.  So I've come from--I'm happy that I come--I'm the oldest of six great young people.

Speaker 1: This slate is [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson interview.  Today is November 15th, 2007.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Location is The HistoryMakers--
Speaker 1: We are at The HistoryMakers offices, 1900 South Michigan Avenue, in the great City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 465218
Speaker 1: I want to take you back a little bit because there were some very significant times, like you said, first grade to the eighth grade, you had one teacher in a one room school house.  Was the schoolhouse red (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was actually white (laughter), a white school house.  Actually our community was really, literally three blocks, a black community a mile outside the city limits of Columbus, Ohio, called Burnside Heights [Columbus, Ohio].  And we had to walk a mile to the bus stop, the bus stop at Hay Avenue [ph.], yeah.  But we lived at Dexter, on Dexter Avenue.  It was Dexter Avenue, Demorest Road, and Athens [Street].  My [paternal] grandmother [Anna Jackson Wilson] and grandfather [Albert Wilson] were on Athens, and then my dad [Olden Wilson] and mom [Wilson's stepmother, Bertha Trout Wilson], and we all grew up on Dexter Avenue, 683 Dexter Avenue, yeah.  And I remember I took the school bus to West High School [Columbus, Ohio], so that was--we didn't have to walk that far.  But I do remember if I wanted to go across town to the East Side [Columbus, Ohio], I'd have to walk a mile to the bus stop.  I was very fortunate.  My dad and my grandfather--with being kind outside the city, it was kind of necessary that you learned how to drive, and I remember driving very young and shifting gears at like twelve and thirteen, so I was able to get my driver's license early because I had a job I needed to get to it.  So I was able to--and my dad always saw to it that I had transportation.  And when I was younger, my father would be the one to take me to these dates because I would work with Riley Randolph's [ph.] band and Daddy would take me.  And as I got older and was fifteen and had my license, I would drive, and my baby brother [Anthony Wilson] was my, was my chaperone.  I have to tell you that I had the greatest chaperones in the world.  All the musicians that came out of Columbus, Ohio were absolutely phenomenal.  They protected me; they looked out for me; they made sure that no one bothered the kid.  They were very proud of this young lady, and they saw to it that she came to no harm.  You could not serve me a drink; you could not give me a drink; you could not offer me anything.  If you tried to talk to me, any member of the band, any musician, would walk over and say, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson], you have this to do.  Nancy, you need to do that."  This went on for years.  I mean, they treated me like I was six until I was twenty-four.  They really, really looked out for me.  They protected me, there was nothing in the world like those musicians.  They cared, they--I think they probably censored the things that they did and said around me.  The important thing was that they made me feel loved, they made me feel talented, they made me feel that I was worthy, and one of the guys, you know.  But they weren't going to let any other guys get near me.  I mean, they were there.
Speaker 1: What age were you?
Speaker 2: Fifteen, sixteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So at that point--
Speaker 2: Working in clubs, the Club Regal [Columbus, Ohio].  Worked the Hotel Litchford [Columbus, Ohio].  Worked in a lot of little clubs all through--all the while that I was at West High School.  Then when I went to college [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I wasn't sure that I really wanted to do that, you know because as I said, the work was there.  I did take a day job, I worked at Motors Mutual Insurance Company [Columbus, Ohio] for a minute, for that summer.  I always did community service work.  I worked at the hospital as a nurse's junior--whatever, junior aide, wore my little pink thing.  And Joan Thornton [ph.], who is still one of my best friends, was my supervisor in the mailroom at Motors Mutual Insurance Company, then she became like the chaperone.  She would not allow anybody near me.  We're still to this day (gesture)--she's just one of the most wonderful people in the world.  I was seventeen and she was twenty-one, and we were working at Motors Mutual, and she was at every place I played, and made certain that I was behaving myself.
Story_ID: 465219
Speaker 1: I am curious to know about this automobile you were driving on the back roads.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of car was it, what color was it?
Speaker 2: Well I saw one near where I live now, and it sat out there for sale this past year for months.  And every time I'd go by it, it was like, oh, I really, really need to buy this car.  And I talked to my husband [Wiley Burton] about it, and he said, "Are you sure you want the car?"  And I said, "No, I'm not sure, but I learned to drive on a '47 [1947] Packard, and I want that car so bad."  I learned how to drive on that, and I also knew how to drive a tractor, but in 1954, we--my dad [Olden Wilson] bought a Ford.  It had a two-toned light and green top and medium colored green bottom, so that was the only new car we had.  We had a 19--I think it was '52 [1952], '52 [1952] Ford.  Yeah, that was, that was mine, and--although it wasn't, because I drove as much as anybody and I had to go to work, so he allowed me to drive a brand new car to work.
Speaker 1: And the color?
Speaker 2: Green, yeah that light two-toned green.  I always considered that my car.  There were always--as I said, I learned to drive on a '47 [1947] Packard, that's the first car I remember that was ours.  But my dad always had a car.  My m- my mother [Wilson's stepmother, Bertha Trout Wilson] always had a car.  My mother is one of the best drivers I've ever known in my life.  My mother will drive across country at the drop of a hat.  I've also had my mother drive up on the back of a motorcycle in front of my house.  And just, she was just fun loving, she was so much fun.  It was great, it was great.  And I think one of the reasons I loved to drive--and someone asked me, "You don't have a driver, you drive back and forth to the airport?"  Anywhere I go where I live, I live up in the country on a ranch, and it's seven miles to the supermarket.  It is, to Palm Springs [California], forty-five miles.  To--anywhere I go, is, is a great distance.  And I would rather have a book to listen to in the car than have company talking to me.

Speaker 1: And this has been--oh I read, great reader; I love books.  I love lyrics, I love grammar, I love all of that.  I love the great writers, not necessarily--I don't want to read Aristotle, but I want escape.   That's why I love to read all of Stephen King.  I've read all of John Saul, I've read all of Robin Cook, and I love to listen to books also.  And that has been a great--as I've gotten older, listening, the audio books have really been helpful.  They've really been great.  I have a couple on my iPod that I listen to on a plane.  One is Robin Cook and one is Catherine Coulter.  I can even remember the names of books.  But, somebody said, "How can you read this many books at one time, or be listening to this many books?"  So, I have a car--one in the car, you know--but you can--you know we're very bright, (laughter) we can multitask.  How can you--what are you doing with a computer, and you have a book in your ear?  I'm not missing anything.  I don't plan to miss anything.

Speaker 1: Somebody told me you won a contest (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I keep reading this in my bio.  And I keep trying to--we have changed it, and I've sent out, we've sent out different a bio, but every time I see it, it keeps saying that I won this contest.  I represented my high school.  Columbus, Ohio was having auditions, and each high school sent a representative to be in this contest.  And there were--it was East [East High School, Columbus, Ohio], West [West High School, Columbus, Ohio], South [South High School, Columbus, Ohio], North [North High School; Columbus North International High School, Columbus, Ohio], Central [Central High School, Columbus, Ohio], Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio], maybe nine high schools.  And I was sent to represent West High School.  So I went to do my audition, and it's the last time I recall playing the piano for myself.  And it was a song that I had written, which I do not remember the name of it, and I am not a writer of material.  However, it must have been quite good because I was asked not to participate in the contest.  Now, that sounds really arrogant, but it's the truth.  "Would you mind not participating in this contest?  Why don't we just give you a TV show?"  Hey, fine, what do I need to do on this television show?  So I was on twice a week on a show called 'Skyline Melody' [sic. 'Skyline Melodies'] and the audience would call in or write in requests for their birthdays, specific songs they wanted to hear.  And all I had was this little backdrop, and Hugh Thompson [ph.] was the keyboard player.  He was the pianist and he was not--oh, I'm a talker.  I would sing whatever the song was, and "This song goes out to such--. And Hugh, what about So and So, and what do you think?"  And he'd say, "Uh-huh.  Yeah."  Okay, here we go.  So I was carrying fifteen minutes alone, especially verbally, but he was a brilliant pianist.  And he had at one time been with Dinah Washington, and when I went to Cleveland [Ohio] and was working alone--this was after the Rusty Bryant stint--he was at the Key Club [Golden Key Club, Cleveland, Ohio] with me.  He was my accompanist there, playing beautifully, but not a talker, however.
Story_ID: 465222
Speaker 1: What was your first recording?
Speaker 2: I was in the studio with the Rusty Bryant band.  I don't remember the name of--I think it was 'Caravan' because Nat Cole [Nat King Cole] told me that he heard me on the radio.  And I said, "But I'm not with a record company."  And he said, "I know, but--I know you're with Capitol [Capitol Records] now, but I heard you."  And if I recall, it was at Dot Record [Dot Records] that--Rusty Bryant was on Dot, and I was the girl singer with the band, and you can hear me.  I think the song was 'Caravan,' yeah.  Almost certain it was.
Speaker 1: So now did they let you in the clubs to sing under age?
Speaker 2: Yeah, nobody ever asked me how old I was.  Everybody knew I was fifteen, seventeen.  There was no--as long as I didn't drink, I was fine.  I mean there was no question--I was the entertainment.  It wasn't as though I was sitting there as a customer.  So, either my dad [Olden Wilson] would bring me to work and drop me off, or I would drive myself to work.  And there was a cousin and there were several--they would make sure that I got home, I was fine.  Nobody ever had to worry about anybody serving alcohol to an underage child at that point in time.  But, I was singing there at the club.  On my prom night--and I had been singing for the two years between the TV show ['Skyline Melodies'] and prom night.  There was this club called the Club Carolyn [Columbus, Ohio], which was pretty much a national--it made the national news because there was this great band there called Rusty Bryant who recorded live there was a song called 'All Night Long' I think.  So, this was a big name, kind of national name, and they were playing at the Club Carolyn, and that's where we went after the prom.  And, of course, Rusty called the girl singer up and would I sit in with the band, and I did.  And he was at my house the next morning, talking to my father, asking him if I could join the band and go on the road.  And my father said, "It is up to her."  And I said, "No, I am not ready.  I have a scholarship to Central State University [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  After I find out what that's like, then I'll, if you still want me to join the band, I'll--we'll have discussions about it."  But I didn't just jump and decide I wanted to go on the road with the band.  I still continued to sing locally.  Went to college and continued to carry a grade point average, but the work was calling.  And when you're on a scholarship and you do have some sense of caring for other people, and I was always humble.  Someone needs this scholarship, I have work that is calling to me, and I'm not really going to use this.  And I wasn't allowed as a freshman to go work off campus.  I wasn't even supposed to go home, but I did every Sunday because if I didn't I wouldn't eat.  I had to go home and eat because cafeteria food, oh.  Anyway, I finally decided that I would (sighs) join this thing called show business and join the band.  And I have to tell you that it was one of the greatest bands.  Rusty Bryant was one of the greatest tenor players.  Hank Marr, who, when he passed last year, was a professor at Ohio State University [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in the music department.  Was our B Hammond [Hammond B-3] organ player, he was one of the greatest to ever play the instrument.  And Mitchell Robinson [ph.] was the drummer.  It was one of the greatest small bands you'd ever want to hear.  So, I was fortunate to be surrounded with this, and to walk up and know that they could play anything, and I could sing anything.  I sang the American songbook.  I sang all of the great Gershwin [George Gershwin] tunes, and all of Cole Porter--as a kid, those were the songs I loved to sing.
Story_ID: 465223
Speaker 1: And these were musicians who did the honky tonk kind of thing, Bill Doggett and what not.  But bottom line is--we did 'If It's the Last Thing I Do' by Dinah Washington.  We did 'Where or When,' we did Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], and I was able to learn and hone my craft in those clubs, in those years.  During that time we went to cities like Chicago [Illinois] at the Crown Propeller [Crown Propeller Lounge]; Fort Wayne, Indiana, we played Cleveland, Ohio.  That's when Rusty [Rusty Bryant] went to The Tijuana [Cleveland, Ohio] and I went to the Key Club [Golden Key Club, Cleveland, Ohio] alone.  But for, I don't know, maybe--we played the Hurricane Bar in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and all over the Midwest.  We had a great band.  And from there, once I decided that okay, I think I've--I'm ready.  I always knew that I didn't want to.  Now there'd been contracts put in my--. "I want your signature for your agency, we want to manage you, we want to do this."  And I did not sign any of those things.  I did not see a great deal of happiness in the field that was at that point and time called the girl singer field.  But I knew that there was some man, there was management that would care about the fact that I wanted a life, that I did not want show business to run my life, that I wanted to really have--to be able to be me, I wanted to remember Whiskey Run [Whiskey Run Road].  I wanted to remember that swing on that porch.  I wanted to be able to be so secure within myself that nothing was going to sway me or change me, that I would always be Lil Olden [Olden Wilson] and Bea's [Wilson's stepmother, Bertha Trout Wilson] daughter, and I'd be my grandparents' grandchild.  And I didn't want show business to change that.  That meant that I needed to kind of research and find out who--if you're going to do it on a national scale, that's entirely different.  So, I--my name was known in New York City [New York, New York], and had been put--the one manager that I'd always thought about and wanted was a man named [HistoryMaker] John Levy, who handled many great jazz performers.  But I was not singing jazz, I was a supper club artist, as opposed to jazz.  But John did not want to handle any girl singers because he'd had a bad experience with another girl singer.  Consequently, girl singers are out.  Well, his assistant was from Cleveland, Ohio, Chuck Taylor.  Knew me very well.  John Levy had tapes of [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson in his office everywhere.  Musicians were coming out of Ohio who were in his stable, like Cannonball Adderley and Nat Adderley.  They were telling John Levy, "I'm sorry, John.  I know what you think, but there's this girl."  And John kept saying "No."  "Well, when she comes to New York, you will hear her."
Speaker 2: How old are you?
Speaker 1: Twenty-two.  I waited, I worked professionally for seven years before I decided, okay, I'm either going to do it now, or--because I'm already a success.  You can't fail because you're a big fish in a small pond.  So if you go to New York and you get what you--John Levy, Capitol Records, that's a singer's label, and David Cavanaugh as your producer.  And you know enough people to probably put you in touch with John.  But you need someplace to be working, so he can hear you.  So, I've discussed all this with Cannonball and his family, so they knew.  Everybody was--.  "I'm going to New York for six months, that's it, Mom, Daddy.  Six months, and if I don't have John Levy at Capitol Records and David Cavanaugh, I'll be back home."  Everybody was happy; it worked for everybody.

Speaker 1: Went to New York [New York].  My roommate was Sandra Lefort [ph.] who sang with Johnny "Hammond" Smith's trio.  I lived with her and her mom for a minute.  And ran into The Delta Rhythm Boys, and there was a place called the Blue Morocco [Sylvia's Blue Morocco, Bronx, New York].  At that time I don't think I'd been to Minton's [Minton's Playhouse, New York, New York] or the jazz rooms.  This was a place on Boston Post Road, not too far out of the Bronx [New York].  It was in the Bronx, but not too far from Midtown [Midtown Manhattan, New York, New York]. So, Irene Reid was the girl singer, house singer there.  It was a great band, and Artie Jenkins [Arthur Jenkins] was on piano, and I'm trying to remember the drummer's name.  Bill Salter was the bass player because I just saw him at IJE this year, the International Association of Jazz Educators [sic. International Association for Jazz Education].  Well that was the band that was there.  And on Johnny-- [HistoryMaker] John Levy's ninety-fifth birthday this year, he asked [HistoryMaker] Johnny Pate and I a question: "If you had to look back on your life, and there's one thing that you could say that made the difference in your life, what would you say?"  Well, my immediate response was, "The day Irene Reid broke her leg."  Because the Blue Morocco called me to take her place.  Within two weeks I was working at the Blue Morocco, and John Levy was there on a Friday night to hear me sing.  Saturday morning he called me, and the following Saturday I was in the studio recording with the Ray Bryant [sic. Rusty Bryant] trio.  We did four demos.  They were sent to Capitol Records and David Cavanaugh.  David heard them, called John Levy back and said, "Do not let anyone else hear them."  This was, I went to New York in October, 1959.  I had finished my first album on Capitol with Dave Cavanaugh as a producer before Christmas of Dec- the same year.  So, everything I went there to accomplish, I was able to do in five weeks, as opposed to six months.  I also had a job, a daytime job.  I worked at the New York Institute of Technology [New York, New York].  I went there as a, I learned to work the PBX [private branch exchange] just so that I would not be at anybody's mercy in the City of New York.
Speaker 2: PBX?
Speaker 1: (Nods head) I'd gotten me an apartment, learned how to work the PBX and was at NYIT, and within two days after I started to work, they gave me hours that made me available to work at night.  I worked from twelve to eight, I was able to do gigs in the evening.  They gave me the freedom to have my photo shoots done.  So I owe a great deal to New York Institute of Technology for being understanding.  And the librarian was Richard Griffin.  And they were just kind, and I still get emails every now and then from them.  I was blessed.  I mean, things just happened and John was so great.  This, as I say, is in 1959.  He is still my manager.  To this day, we do not have a contract.  And he allowed me--he understood that I needed a life.  He knew that I wanted to be my parents' and my grandparents' daughter.  He understood that, and consequently I became his daughter.  And this is why my life has been, to me, cloaked in this cocoon that I call God, a supreme being.  He has guided me in the right direction.  I've asked him, and talked with him many times about this.  Now, you know I don't love show business, God, so (laughter), if you want me to do this, you have to open the doors and let me know how you want me to handle it.  And he's done just that.  Most of the things that I have accomplished were handed and given. Would you like to do this, we need you to do--

Speaker 1: The acting came about from that three-year-old kid singing and dancing to 'My Little Margie' ['Margie']. If I'd had my way, I would have been laying on a piano.  You would have thought I was the drama queen of all times.  I wanted to be Hal Morgan [ph.], I wanted to--.  You know I loved all of the drama of it.  That's why when the acting parts came along, I did a feel a little insecure and I did talk to a man named Frank Silvera, who was one of our great actors.  And I said, "You know I'm a little concerned, this is a heavy dramatic role.  This is not singing, this is--."  Actually, I did 'I Spy' first, and that was fun because that was Bill Cosby and Greg Morris, and that was just so much fun.  But then there was this script that required some depth and Frank Silvera told me, he said, "You do it every night when you sing. You look at the lyric, close your eyes, and go there."  And that was all the advice I ever had about acting.  And I have to say that I got an Emmy [Emmy Award] nomination out of that performance, and many other offers, and it became a part of the career.  But, I didn't seek the movies out because I always felt that we had such marvelous actresses; that was their craft.  Diana Sands and Cicely [Cicely Tyson] and Dorothy Dandridge, so many and so little work for them.  So why would I, because I managed to get a good record contract [with Capitol Records] and some--get some good air play and become--to get this kind of, I don't know whether you call it fame or what, but the bottom line is people knew who [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson was.  They were beginning to know, especially after it became national news, and then Time magazine and Newsweek, live at the Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California] when I opened there.  If that night was successful, the career was going to be a long one. It was longevity.  It was the one that solidified the career of Nancy Wilson, if that was a great night.  And it was packed and it was at Cocoanut Grove, and it was recorded live.  And it's being re-released as we speak, on CD.  As I said, things have always really happened on time, on time.

Speaker 1: About the time that this was going on, of course, Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was going on, Martin Luther King.  Selma [Alabama] was happening, Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 2: What year are you talking about?
Speaker 1: Selma.  I have no idea of the year.
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: I was married and had a child, so I was about twenty- (unclear) about twenty-eight, twenty-nine.  And I had talked with Martin, and things started to get kind of hectic, and a little different, and Montgomery kind of changed everything.  Rosa Parks changed everything.  Now I could stay in Los Angeles [California] and be my husband's [Kenneth Dennis] wife and my son's [Kenneth Dennis, Jr.] mother.  But, I also had to be my brother's sister, because I have always known that doors were opened to me that were not opened to my brother.  I never worked in the South.  I remember working a club in the North Side of Columbus [Ohio].  It never occurred to me that nobody black ever went to this club because I'd made reservations for friends of mine for opening night.  They didn't--they weren't there, and I called them to ask them what happened to you last night?  "We were told we needed reservations."  Well, I did not speak to Rusty Bryant about it because I did not have a contract with Rusty Bryant.  Nor did I have a contract with the owners of the club.  So I asked the owner of the club, "Do you have a reservation policy?"  "Well--."  "Do you have a reservation policy?  Because if you do, I am making reservations for four for the early show tonight, and the name is--."  Well, they were there that night and that was the end of that.  But it dawned on me--, "You did what?"  I said, "Why not, I mean, why shouldn't I?"  "This is--." I said, "Well it is now.  Are you trying to tell me that in my hometown there is a club where black people don't go?"  Oh, that's not the case anymore.  And it never occurred to me that that was a problem.  Just never occurred to me that I could not say that or do that.  Consequently, I was well aware of what was happening in Montgomery.
Story_ID: 465227
Speaker 1: Where I felt [HistoryMaker] John Levy was so special, is that he was a musician, and that he was coming to the business from the, from the artist's point of view as opposed to money and management and all those other things.  He was the bass player for George Shearing.  And George Shearing blew up so big and John was so busy handling George's business that he had to tell George that "I cannot do all of this for you and still be your manager."  You know so George was the one who really convinced and talked with John, and said, "You should open your own office."  Next thing John Levy knew, he was managing Cannonball Adderley, he was managing Dakota Staton.  He had, I don't know if he had Jonah Jones for a while--he had huge people.  He was managing, when I got to New York [New York], The Three Sounds.  He was managing [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis when I got to New York.  And the girl singer part was over.  Now we talked with David Cavanaugh, and David was one of the sweetest men in the world.  He was my producer at Capitol [Capitol Records], and he and John Levy had this great rapport.  And I think they were the first pers- people to kind of mention to me that there were four sexes, and I always--they were male, female, homosexuals and girl singers.  Now, I'm offended.  "Wait a minute, how do we get to be in a whole separate other class than--what makes us so different?"  He said, "Maybe we're not including you there yet, but the bottom line is people look at girl singers--."  And girl singers are having a rough time of it.  Girl singers could be in the old tradition of the world, word diva.  We didn't call them divas, it was the B word as opposed to diva.  When you talked about divas, you were be talking about Maria Callas, or during my time coming up, you were talking about Dinah [Dinah Washington].  You were talking sometimes about Ella [Ella Fitzgerald].  Ella would be sweet and nice as she could be on stage, but she would tear into those musicians after actually a perfect show.  There had to be something wrong it.  Now, Sarah [Sarah Vaughan] was one of the guys.  Sarah used to enjoy the musicians, and she played and sang, and hung.  Sarah--girl singers were a whole other breed, and they also drew attention from some of the wrong men, and that also was a part of it.  A lot of management, a lot of record companies, did not want to deal with the men that kind of came along with the girl singer.  And there were a lot that added nothing to the girl singer.  They were actually detrimental to their well-being.  There was a lot of abuse.  I did not like what I saw, and consequently, I really talked with David and John Levy a lot about that, and was fortunate enough to be surrounded by musicians who I've never seen abuse anybody.  I knew that any number of the singers--I mean you don't marry five times if you're happy.  You know, you just don't.

Speaker 1: I remember having a, right here at the Tivoli [Tivoli Theater, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter)--was it Tivoli?  No, it was--Club Regal--Theater, Regal Theater in Chicago [Illinois]--Dinah Washington.  At that point in time she was--what marriage was this?  Raoul [ph.] was the husband--one, two, that's like four (laughter).  This was after Jimmy Cobb, okay, and before Night Train Lane [Richard Lane] (laughter) so it had to be--.  Now I met him when I first got to New York [New York] with The Delta Rhythm Boys, you know like Herbie [ph.]--I can't remember his last name, and Sandra [Sandra Lefort (ph.)], who was my roommate.  Sandra, we all sang.  It was like the pop music of the day as opposed to jazz.  But it, it--the stuff was really funny, I have to be honest with you.  You'd hang out with, I'd be with Sandra or I'd be with Herbie, and then when Cannon [Cannonball Adderley] and Nat [Nat Adderley] started to come into town, then I was able to go to Birdland [New York, New York] and I saw, oh God, I saw Lee Morgan, and I saw Art Blakey, and I saw Miles [Miles Davis].  And when Cannonball first came to New York, he was with John [HistoryMaker John Levy] and they disbanded their band and Nat Adderley went with Lionel Hampton, and Cannonball Adderley went with Miles Davis.  Well, they would come through Columbus [Ohio], and at that point in time Rusty Bryant and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson had established this club and put it on the national map, called Marty's 502 [Marty Mellman's 502 Club, Columbus, Ohio].  We had made it so big that it was booking Miles Davis and different people into that club, because we had built that club up so that it was one of the places that would be--an agent would want a great jazz musician to play.  So that's how I really got to know Arthur Prysock.  I remember Al Hibbler scaring me one night and told me how much I weighed, how tall I was, and it was like, oh my goodness.  It scared me.  A wonderful man, though, so sweet.  Arthur Prysock, I loved.  Red Prysock, uh, a little bit of a dog in Red, just a tad (laughter).
Speaker 2: You met a guy named Kenny [Kenneth Dennis] somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: I met Kenneth just before, let's see.  I was still in Columbus when I met Kenneth.  He was with St- Sonny Stitt's band.  They came through Columbus playing and I thought Sonny Stitt was the finest man.  He was Mr. Continental.  He was so sophisticated, he was so gorgeous.  And at that point in time, we're talking the late '50s [1950s], the musicians were dressing, I mean the guys, they were fine.  They were wearing, s- I mean, the suits and ties.  I mean they looked exquisite.  So, I went to see Sonny Stitt, and the band was great.  Kenneth had started talking with me.  We exchanged address- addresses.  He's the only guy I can remember, the only man I remember who ever just wrote me letters.  They weren't necessarily love letters, but he wrote me all the time, and we would write back and forth.  And when I first recorded, we were writing while I was in New York.  My first album came out though, and within months, I left the country and went to Australia for three months so that when 'Guess Who I Saw Today' came out, I was not available, and j- that was on purpose.  John did that on purpose.  He wanted to create a demand for someone who was already working out of the country.  "She's in Europe, she's in Australia," and, which I was.  I was there for three months, I'll never forget it.  And I got a letter from Kenny Dennis, literally every other day.
Story_ID: 465229
Speaker 1: --It was very sweet.  At that point in time he was working at the Rubaiyat [Rubaiyat Room] at the Watkins Hotel [Hotel Watkins] in Los Angeles [California].  So, when you're coming in from Australia--and my mother, Diamond Lil [Lillian Ryan Manis] was living in Los Angeles.  I get off the plane--also Dinah Washington is working in Los Angeles.  Wow.  Okay.  Anyway, my mother and I were hanging out, and she meets Kenny, and Kenneth [Kenneth Dennis] is there at my mom's house, my mother's house every day, and we're going out to dinner.  So, one night my mother and I went to hang out with Dinah Washington, and Kenneth had asked me to marry him, and I said, next year, whatever.  My mother and Dinah decided, "Why next year?  I mean, you're here, why are you going to wait until next year.  You should get married now."  Well, before I could get on the plane, I was standing in front of my uncle, the bishop (laughter) with my mother.  Now the bishop is my mom's brother, but I'm standing in the church with my mother and Jimmy Bond [ph.] and Jean Bond [ph.]--and I'm the godmother of their daughter--and I got married by my uncle at a Lutheran church in Compton, California.  And Kenneth and I had a great seven years, we had a great run, we have a great son.  He was my drummer for many years, and I think the biggest problem was that he had a tendency to bring the work home, and I didn't.  So I don't recall ever having an argument with Kenneth.  There was no big blow-up or anything, I just don't think that--it's that girl singer syndrome again.  I felt that the public did my husband a disservice.  I didn't think they treated him fairly.  I didn't think that they gave him--.  No, I, I really, I really feel that way.  I figure if I'm not angry with this man, how dare you be?  If I have nothing negative to say about his man, how can you assume anything?  Kenneth and I are still good friends, we are.
Speaker 2: Was that a jealousy?
Speaker 1: They just didn't want to see girl singers happy.  They just would like to see me with no one, or with someone else who would have more influence over me, or could make me do such and such, or whatever.  But Kenneth and I really, we were on the same page.  Kind of, but it was a very difficult life and time for him.  I didn't--he didn't get the respect he deserved, you know, I just didn't see it.  And I just did not want to see him hurt anymore by it.
Speaker 2: Out of that union came this wonderful, handsome young man (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I've got--my oldest, his name is Kenneth Carl Dennis, Jr., [Kenneth Dennis, Jr.] and he's been Kacy ever since he was born.  I spell it out, however, K-A-C-Y, Kacy Dennis.  He has really been very helpful to me.  He's a CPA [certified public accountant], he's very bright.  The only thing that I see that I would like to change, I would like very much for him to find the woman of his dreams who can accept and appreciate a kind man, a good man, who is not going to be one of those that used to hang around the girl singers all the time.  He's very bright.  He's a college graduate, and works with computers and numbers, and you know.  So she's out there somewhere.  That's the only child I have who is not married, and who doesn't have a child.  I only have three children, so.  I adore Kacy, Kacy's been so good and very helpful to me.  He's very much in his mother's corner, yeah.

Speaker 1: Do you like being considered a jazz singer?
Speaker 2: Initially.  I did not consider myself a jazz singer.  I remember Down Beat magazine coming out, and when they first reviewed me, and it was like, I don't know, I don't think she's going to last out here, because she's singing this, and she's too cute and you know she's not the typical jazz singer.  She's--.  Well, that wasn't where I was going anyway, I wanted the supper club.
Speaker 1: Who was considered the typical jazz singer?
Speaker 2: Sarah [Sarah Vaughan], Ella [Ella Fitzgerald].  I'm looking at Lena Horne and Joyce Bryant (laughter) okay.  I'm looking at Dorothy Dandridge.  I'm looking at the great gowns.  I'm looking at the Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California].  I'm looking at the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York], I am not looking at sawdust.  I'm not looking at the jazz whatever--I am young.  Now, I can always grow into that, but I still sing the same songs today that would be considered jazz today, but they were the pop music of the day at that time.  But I remember specifically when, when I first hit New York City [New York, New York], after the Blue Morocco [Sylvia's Blue Morocco, Bronx, New York] the next place I played was the Elegante in Brooklyn [New York], and from there to Basin Street East [New York, New York], and from there to the Waldorf Astoria.  Los Angeles [California], I played one small club with Richard [Richard Holmes]--ah, organist, I can't think of his name, and went straight from that club to the Crescendo [Los Angeles, California], and from the Crescendo to the Cocoanut Grove.  This was all within three years.  So, that was just a decision that [HistoryMaker] John Levy and I made together.  John wanted that crossover for John because he was a jazz manager.  But he had a young girl here who could cross that barrier and play these rooms, if we played it right, and we did.  And that was the--this was unanimous, this was ca- the record company, this was Capitol [Capitol Records].  It was John Levy, me, this was the way we wanted to go.
Story_ID: 465231
Speaker 1: So, we broke the--we had Marty Charnin [Martin Charnin] and Luther Henderson and we had this wonderful show written and broke it in at the--(laughter) you break in a show at the Fairmont [Fairmont Hotel; Fairmont San Francisco], the Venetian Room in San Francisco [California] (laughter), and you're breaking it in in nine-six- '64 [1964] at the Flamingo [The Fabulous Flamingo; Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino] in Las Vegas [Nevada], and then you bring it to the Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California].  Because you've started enough talk between San Francisco and Las Vegas, and by the time we hit Los Angeles [California] at the Cocoanut Grove, with a live album, it got national coverage.  That's why I say, that was the--if that was successful--I remember walking down the hall, I remember the gown.  And somebody asked me about being nervous, and I said, "Excuse me?"
Speaker 2: What color was that gown?
Speaker 1: It was gold.  It was gold lame.
Speaker 2: Describe it.
Speaker 1: You can see it, well, it was, the sleeve was just to the elbow, and it was not bugle beaded, it had spangles and stuff, but, and it didn't do a lot of--it was form fitting, it was done on knit, the color of the skin.  So, it kind of made a very different kind of statement.  It was very sexy, it was very exotic, but it was fun.  It was a lot of fun, and I knew that once we hit that stage--we had a great band, the Freddy Martin orchestra was phen- phenomenal.  I believe that Ronnell Bright was the conductor then, Kenny [Kenneth Dennis] was playing drums.  We hit it.  We hit that floor and nobody ever had any qualms about it, there was never any, oh, God this is going to be a problem, what if we flop.  No, we never had any of that.
Speaker 2: Who else was playing in the band?
Speaker 1: I just had Ronnell Bright at that point in time, Kenny Dennis, and I can't remember who the bass- I had a trio, but I don't remember the bassist.  But it was the Freddy Martin big band, an eighteen piece orchestra; a great band, a great band.
Speaker 2: You were stepping high.
Speaker 1: I was most certainly stepping high.  That was, it was really, really quite a night.  And it wasn't, it was a night that all of this had led up to.  You mess this night up, you forget it.
Speaker 2: Cocoanut Grove.
Speaker 1: Cocoanut Grove, live, 1964.  There were--very few live albums that had been done at that time.  There was no pickups done, there was no sweeping; it was perfectly done on stage.  I can hear Mildred Cavanaugh [ph.], David's [David Cavanaugh] wife, laughter.  You know, it was such a fun night.  There was no nervousness involved.   I just knew that this is, here it is, okay, me and you.  I said, this is where you've led me, and you're not going to let me down here.  This is the most important night that's going to make the rest of it easy.
Speaker 2: So, so far, this is the pinnacle?
Speaker 1: That was, that was the biggest night of my life, yeah, big time.
Story_ID: 465232
Speaker 1: Where did Frank Silverman come from?
Speaker 2: Frank Silverman?  Or Frank Silvera?
Speaker 1: Silvera.
Speaker 2: Frank Silvera, you saw him all the time, but you never knew his name.  He was part Indian and black, and always wore a mustache.  You couldn't tell if he was Hispanic, you couldn't tell if he was black, but he was always in the cowboy and Indian [Native American] movies and stuff.  He was in so many movies.  He also was an acting coach, and I don't remember who introduced me to him, or told me about him, but I just knew that he was one of the finer actors, always working, but never a star.  But he was the one that I wanted his advice.  He would have been to me, like the Brock Peters.  You know, he could do the great roles, but his look, you couldn't categorize it.  You knew who Brock Peters was, but I would see Frank Silvera playing Italian, Indian, black, whatever.  But he could act, and he was just this marvelous man who gave me the kind of insight I needed to be, to bring forth what I was doing on stage with just the lyric, with just the spoken word.  And he was able to make me understand that you don't need acting lessons, you act on stage every night, that's what you do.  He just put it all together for me.
Story_ID: 465233
Speaker 1: So the first movie?
Speaker 2: Well the first acting part was 'I Spy,' which was just totally hilarious.  You'll never find a better place to work than with Bill Cosby and Bob Culp [Robert Culp] and, of course Greg Morris.  He played my brother [Jim Rogers].  And from that came other dramatic roles, but I did so much variety TV which I really miss.  I did at least six, eight Carol Burnett shows ['The Carol Burnett Show'], 'Andy Williams' ['The Andy Williams Show'], Flip Wil- ['The Flip Wilson Show'], everything that was on, I did.
Speaker 1: What age are you about now?
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven, twenty-nine, somewhere in there.  I'm still not thirty.  All this was going on when I was just about thirty, yeah.  It had been a quick eight years, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're a real family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cause '64 [1964] was the Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California], so this was, yeah, you know, I was still in my twenties yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this family girl--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from Chillicothe [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --out there on the road, missing family?
Speaker 2: No I saw my family all the time (laughter).  I might have well have been on the road.  My husband was with me, and until Kacy [Kenneth Dennis, Jr.] had to go to school every day, Kacy was with me.  I did not leave them home.  And I went to Ohio a lot, you know, even in later days.  Anytime a plane flew anywhere near Columbus [Ohio]--I took a plane to Columbus, got off the plane, rented a car and I was either in Chillicothe or I'd stopover in Columbus, so I never felt out of the loop.  I saw my folks all the time.
Speaker 1: How difficult was it to divorce?
Speaker 2: It just took so long, was really--.  Ken [Kenneth Dennis] and I were fine.  We weren't having that big a problem, it was just his attorney looking for more than was there.  I had a very good attorney who told me, "If you feel you d- owe him a dollar, be fair."  I offered him half of everything we had. That's California.  Well, his attorney just kept dragging it out and made a big issue of it, and I told my husband, "Your attorney is not serving you well.  Please check it out, listen to what's going on here."  So I do feel that his attorney did him a massive--just instead of half of everything, it was not nearly what he should have had.  I blame the attorney.  Kenneth did not have a problem with it because he knew that I tried to tell him, you know.  There were certain things like, we had a production company [Wil-Den Productions, Inc.] and we were producing people like Sue Raney, and Phil Woods.  The production company obviously owed [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson money, but I am not a part of the production company.  I am not, I don't belong to community property.  Consequently, certain other things--.  That was kind of underhanded what I did, but they owed me money.  So (laughter) I just sold a piece of property and paid myself.  But it was perfectly the thing to do, you know.
Speaker 1: Who kept the baby?
Speaker 2: I kept the baby.  Of course I kept the baby.
Speaker 1: On the road?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point in time, Kacy was in private school, he was at Le Lycee [Le Lycee Francais de Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  I have never been away from any of my children for longer than two or three weeks at a time.  I didn't go on tours, I didn't go and stay away any length of time.  One year, the year that I did work the most, Kacy was pretty much with me that whole year because I remember working forty-eight weeks a year once.  I said I would never do it again.  This is not living, I have no desire to do this, this is not what I want.  And, it never happened again.  So, you can't do that.  I heard that from attorneys and agents, but not [HistoryMaker] John Levy.  I said, yes, I can.  I have a son and I want a life, and I want him to have a life.  So, I didn't ever, ever really seek out that constant touring, constant go out there and be on the road.  And I was, I was living the life that I wanted.  I had a home, a child and was really quite content.  There were years though, I remember one New Year's Eve, and if I mention the names, I mean these were these beautiful women: Lola Falana, and Myra Waters, and I think, Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick], all of us single, not one man, no date, on New Year's Eve.  We were in our thirties.  I mean, that's a girl singer thing, you know.  Guys have a problem with girl singers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is earl- ear- early thirties?
Speaker 2: We were in our thirties, yeah, early thirties.
Story_ID: 465234
Speaker 1: In New York City [New York, New York] is this girl singer--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --(laughter) that you have so wonderfully described, but there was a man who played wonderful music that everybody, when they say [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, on those early albums, they say Cannonball Adderley.
Speaker 2: Well, you know what is so strange is people aren't aware of the fact that the Cannonball Adderley album ['Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley'] was the fourth album I recorded.  I recorded with George Shearing before I recorded with Cannonball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Take us to the first ['Like in Love'], second, third album (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.  The first [sic. second] album I recorded was called 'Something Wonderful' arranged by a man named Billy May, who later on arranged my favorite album, out of seventy-whatever called 'Lush Life.'   And I received a letter from him, being grateful to God that it seemed fit to put him on earth at the same time I was here so we could do that album.  But the very first album, 'Something Wonderful,' [HistoryMaker] John Levy had a man pick me up at the airport named Ernie Andrews, who was one of the greatest blues singers ever.  So, my introduction to California was like, yeah, you know.  It never occurred to me that I should have any kind of qualms or concerns.  I'm recording with David Cavanaugh, Billy May.  John Levy has had this wonderful gentleman named Ernie Andrews pick me up at the airport and see to it that I was in the hotel, come to the studio with me, and just take care of Nancy.  Everything was wonderful, it really was.  Back in those days, if you were successful, if you were on a label that was as musically involved as Capitol [Capitol Records] about their performers--we recorded every six months, so after 'Something Wonderful' came out, and we saw what was happening, and we knew that we were going to do "Guess Who I Saw Today," which John Levy already--was the song that he wanted me--that was the song that got John Levy, but that was in the second album.  And he did not want me in the United States when that came out, so therefore we left and came back.  I got married, and went to do the third album, which was called 'The Swingin's Mutual' with George Shearing.  Now, John Levy had been George Shearing's bass player.  He's now George's manager, my manager and he's also managing the brothers Adderley.  The Adderleys are the one who actually insisted that John Levy manage Nancy Wilson.  We still haven't gotten in the studio yet with Cannonball.  But I'm eating dinner every Sunday at their house, because I am a good cook.  Cannonball fixed up the greatest gumbo ever.  We had become truly family--Nat Adderley, Cannonball Adderley, John Levy, John Levy's--Gladys [Gladys Levy], his first wife, his kids, his daughter Pamela [Pamela Levy McRae] had already picked me out to be her brother Michael's [Michael Levy] girlfriend, although I was six years older than him.  What can I tell you?  As I said, John had become like my dad, he and my father [Olden Wilson] were close.  Cannonball and Nat [Nat Adderley] were like my brothers.  They were tight.  They were so tight that we went on to do this marvelous album.
Story_ID: 465235
Speaker 1: John [HistoryMaker John Levy], Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley], Nat [Nat Adderley] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) John who?
Speaker 1: John Levy, of course, being Cannonball's manager, mine, we decided now is the time for us to--.  First of all Cannonball Adderley was on the Riverside label [Riverside Records], which was a jazz label.  I am on Capitol Records, which is a pop label.  Cannon was accused of selling out, and all that stuff, for recording on Capitol with me.  To this day, people don't really, you know, they just have a hard time dealing with that.  I didn't understand anything about crossing over--what was that?  I think that Cannonball became bigger than ever recording with [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson on Capitol than he ever was on Riverside.  I was able to reach Cannonball's audience by recording with Cannonball, because they couldn't ignore him, because at that point in time, Julian Adderley, the brothers Adderley were, I mean they were huge.  John Levy had done such a good job packaging Nancy Wilson, Cannonball Adderley, George Shearing, Nancy Wilson.  You want George Shearing, you need Nancy Wilson.  You want Nancy Wilson, you need Cannonball Adderley.  You need Nancy Wilson, if that's who you want, you got to take [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis.  John Levy had it all, he had the best of everything and he was the mellowest, the kindest, gentlest man, and he cared about the music.  Cared about the people he managed.  He cared deeply about Cannonball and Nat Adderley and Nancy, and, and especially those--he developed an affinity for, those of us who were like minded, those of us who looked at the business as just that, and who were more involved in--like Julian, Cannonball was a great teacher from the stage.  We also were the kind of people who had lives, we actually were happy.  I mean we really had good times.  We were not--nobody was falling down, nobody was out drinking and carousing and carrying on.  We were just average everyday people who happened to play music at night.  Cannon always had a great band.  When I think, when I first came to New York [New York], Yusef Lateef was with Cannonball.  You know, Cannon was still out with Miles [Miles Davis] then.  So Cannonball put his group back together and we decided that this is time.  So when the--Nancy Wilson on one side in that little yellow Jacks [ph.] dress and Cannonball on this side--'Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley'--and I do believe its forty-eight minutes and fifty-four seconds of jazz in smaller print--which is the actual name of the album.
Story_ID: 465236
Speaker 1: But [HistoryMaker] John Levy is known for--first of all, let's deal with the man.  Here's a man who today is ninety-five years old, who has--who was born in New Orleans [Louisiana], knew Chicago [Illinois] like the back of his hand, he was here in Chicago.  He played with Stuff Smith.  Now we're talking--oh, he played for and with Billie Holiday.  He was not the John Levy who managed her, however.  That was a different John Levy.  Please, everybody, know this, it's not the same John Levy.  But he played with everyone, he knew the music.  And he understood that you need to be a real person.  He liked happy people.  He liked people who could be talked to, as opposed to act.  He was a willing listener.  He was also one of those people who when he heard a lot of nonsense, would say, "You know I really like you, you're such a sweetheart, but I think you'd you know you'd be better off someplace else."  He was never mean, never.  I think of all the years we've been together, he--I came off a show one time, and he said, "Well, you could have done that song better."  That's the only time I've ever heard him say anything.  He rarely ever says, "You were wonderful."  Never hear that from him; don't expect it from him.  But I could see a smile on his face that tells me, hey, yeah.  My daughter was great tonight, she was good.  So, that is why John Levy and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson are together because he knows me, respects me, respects my life, respects my husband, respects my children, respects the fact that I put my grandchildren and my kids and family before I put anything else.  And he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you did, even then.  Early years?
Speaker 1: Early years, and he, he knew that was how I went to him.  I want this, John, but not at the expense of my life, and I know that you're the only man who can make that happen.  Any other manager that I want, that I get is going to be more involved and concerned about his thing and about this other big kind of thing that I'm not interested in.
Speaker 2: Did anybody else come after you, to manage you?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Well, Dinah Washington wanted to make sure I had good management.  Once I told her I was with John Levy, she was fine.  But, no, there was too much respect for John Levy.  Nobody ever would have thought about trying to--unh-uh, no.
Speaker 2: John has had such staying power.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And his age today at ninety-five says that when he first came through, he was colored?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was--well, yeah, he was colored then.  But he's been black, he's been Afro-American, he's been every name that they have put on black people.  John Levy has lived through most of it.  He's lived through--if you live through New Orleans back in those days, ninety years ago, you know what he obviously went through.  And the Jelly Roll Morton, and he lived through some of the greatest beginnings of this great music that is American, and that finally, at last, the country is acknowledging.  The National Endowment of the Arts [sic. National Endowment for the Arts] are finally realizing how wonderful Bix Beiderbecke and Jelly Roll Morton were, and we are dealing with our legends who are musical legends.  It was no finer musician, no greater writer--I mean, how can you not consider Duke Ellington along with any classical musician or any classical composer.  America is getting on the ball about that.  We are finally acknowledging our people while they are alive, and we are rewarding them.  We're letting them know that we appreciate them, yeah.  So, jazz masters, all of you, I, I admire, I'm glad to be and proud to be one of you.  We have done some great work in the last ten years.
Story_ID: 465237
Speaker 1: Any favorite clubs that you played, like the Blue Note [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Any favorite club?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My favorite place to work, club-wise, was always the Cocoanut Grove [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because it was the greatest room in the country.  Just big enough, great sound, red velvet--I mean it was just posh.  Now, I could have said the Palmer House [Palmer House Hotel; Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois].  But the Palmer House sound wasn't that great, okay.  Cocoanut Grove was the room in the country.  Now if I'm talking just hanging and just having fun, you can give me the Sutherland [Sutherland Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] any day, and Mister Kelly's [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Chicago.  I would play the Sutherland two weeks.  Redd Foxx would open, maybe.  Or Cannonball [Cannonball Adderley] and I would be there.  I had Flip Wilson in there with me, and I would go immediately we'd close on Saturday there, and on Monday, we would open at Mister Kelly's, and we would be either with--the first person I worked with there, I do believe was Woody Allen.  I worked there with Jackie La- Jack E. Leonard, Jackie Mason.  I tell you, Chicago was the city.  And radio in Chicago made [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, okay.  I mean, Sweet Nancy.  I was so embarrassed one night.  I came out of a club in Detroit [Michigan], and I could hear this magnificent voice talking about this woman, this sweet Nancy, the b--.  Oh, god.  Sid McCoy--I'm sitting in my car in Detroit and saying, "Oh my god, oh my god."  He made me feel all of that.  He's in Chicago.  I could hear him on WCFL [WCFL Radio, Chicago, Illinois], everywhere.  He made Nancy Wilson in the Midwest.  I remember BEE--WBEE [WBEE Radio, Harvey, Illinois], [HistoryMaker] Merri Dee.  I remember Yvonne Daniels, but Sid McCoy was the first person on the bandwagon.  I remember when Rodney [E. Rodney Jones] came in.  Rodney played Nancy.  Those were the days when disc jockeys were disc jockeys.  Like the Johnny Magnuses at KGFJ [KGFJ Radio; KYPA Radio] in, at Los Angeles [California].  What Sid was doing here, he was doing on the West Coast with the Fancy Miss Nancy.  So, I mean, thank you.  I had it so good.  You know, you will not hear from Nancy Wilson any of those horror stories, any of those back of the bus stories, any of those oh, it was so hard.  Unh-uh, no.  They made it easy for me.  The Lena Hornes and the Billie Holidays and the Nat Coles [Nat King Cole], they walked in the back doors in Las Vegas [Nevada].  Because of them, I walked in the front door, headlining.
Story_ID: 465238
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You worked with Billy Eckstine.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Mr. B.  My first husband, Kenny Dennis [Kenneth Dennis], was Billy Eckstine's band boy (laughter).  Billy told him, "If you ever hurt her, I'm coming after you."  But B was so precious.  He was just a sweet--but, now that's a ladies man.  He never hit on me, but he sure told my husband, "You better behave yourself."  Billy Eckstine's voice was so marvelous, so wonderful.  I still remember 'Cottage for Sale' ['A Cottage for Sale'] and to watch him work.  My father [Olden Wilson] admired Billy Eckstine immensely.  Those were the voices I heard as a kid, were Billy Eckstine, Louis Jordan, the Tympany Five.  Friday night fish fry, or Saturday night fish fry, oh, my.  And Bull Moose Jackson, please--all these.  By osmosis I became [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson after listening to all these men influences, including Little Jimmy Scott with Lionel Hampton's band.  And then I went down to Uncle Dosier's [ph.], which was kind of like a soda fountain that had a jukebox, and I heard Big Maybelle and Big Mama Thornton, LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown--oh I love me some Ruth Brown, Little Esther [Esther Phillips] was maybe--her first big record with Johnny Otis.  About the time I was able to go down to Uncle Dosier's and buy a soda and play--all those women, they were women mostly on the jukeboxes.  My father had all the male records at the house.
Speaker 1: What age were you?
Speaker 2: Twelve, about twelve.  I was ten when I heard Little Jimmy Scott.  I heard Dinah [Dinah Washington] much later than I heard Ella [Ella Fitzgerald] and Billie [Billie Holiday].  But I heard Dinah, and all the blues singers were on the jukeboxes.  And I didn't even realize it was a juke joint until I saw 'The Color Purple' talking about juke joints.  And when I recorded it with Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones], 'Jook Joint' ['Q's Jook Joint'], I said, oh, that was a juke joint (laughter).  How naive can I be?  I was going to a juke joint, but it was for teenagers, it was kids, it was not older people.  It was only for the children, and they had the rhythm and blues records on there.  And we had a great radio station there.  Eddie [ph.]--I can't think of his name, but he was on Nancy Wilson's bandwagon.  Columbus, Ohio did--and Chillicothe, Ohio have done a native daughter proud.  They have been there for me all my life.  All--there are many accolades and many things that have come through my life, but when they paid homage to me, bicen- for the two hundredth year of the State of Ohio, and Chillicothe, which was the first state capital--it was Nancy Wilson weekend.  I mean, we had a costume ball, we had, I was driven with my husband [Wiley Burton] in a white carriage with white horses, and oh, child, listen.  Central State University choir [Central State University Chorus] came and sang.  The tears rolled down my face.  Ohio State University Symphony Orchestra came and played.  It was one of the most wonderful weekends any person could hope to have.  Both my husband and I say, aside from getting married and birthing--
Story_ID: 465239
Speaker 1: When did you meet Wiley [Wiley Burton]?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh wow.
Speaker 1: The Reverend Wiley Burton.
Speaker 2: Very, very--I met Wiley on a night I was working outside Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  It was a very heavy night emotionally.  My brother Tony [Anthony Wilson] had died.  That particular night and weekend, his girlfriend Elaine Greer was there, but she was not living after his death.  She was--my mother--my mom [Wilson's stepmother, Bertha Trout Wilson] and dad [Olden Wilson] were at odds.  There was a veteran in the audience who was dying and he came to tell me that he'd endorsed his insurance policy over to my brother's foundation.  I had an interview with a young man from Bidwell Cultural and Training Center [Bidwell Training Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to do a PSA [public service announcement] about a dinner, a big dinner, gala that was being held for Ray Kemp, who was one of the finest track trainers and coaches ever in this country.  I was--I'd already said that I would do the interview--and the interview, the person who was there to do the interview, was Wiley Burton.  Well, before I went on stage, and knowing and finding out literally minutes before going on stage what all these emotions that were going on within my family--and just heavy on my heart--and to have to hit the floor.  I asked him if he would wait 'til after the show was over to do the interview.  Well, I actually went out that night and did my show.  When my show was finished, my mother and father were fine.  Elaine was going to live, and she was going on with her life.  She now is married and has two children.  The young man who had signed his insurance policy over, he and I spent a great deal of time talking, and of course, he did pass, but he knew that he had my family's support and thanks.  It crossed my mind as I sang 'Folks Who Live on the Hill' ['The Folks Who Live on the Hill'] and did my work, did God's work, that I had never of my own volition been baptized.  I had not made a conscious decision.  I'd been baptized, but never said, I want to be baptized.  And in the dressing room as everyone was crying and everything was being put back together, it dawned on me, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson], you're doing an awful lot of good work.  You're up here doing--.  You know I talk about God all the time, that's my thing.  Truly, God has been here with you this evening.  What if something happens to you and you have not consciously been baptized?  All of this good work you've been doing all these years will be for nil.  Pastor walked in.  I didn't have a clue what the man's name was.  He had a collar on, "Do you baptize in the Trinity?"  "Yes, I do."  "Can you do it before 9:00 in the morning?"  And he said, "Yes."  And then I asked the man I was to do the interview with if he could wait and I would stay over and catch a later plane and do the interview the next day.  I ended up getting baptized about 5:00, 5:30 in the morning and came back to the hotel, and called him.  And when I got back there was a letter from him.  It was very interesting.  It talked about the queens to pawns or pawns to queens.  So, I asked him if he would--since I hadn't been able to come out, and we would have coffee and I would do the interview.
Story_ID: 465240
Speaker 1: And since I'd moved my flight, so we--I had the day, and we walked over to this mall, and there was some very strange things going on.  There was an earthquake, which you don't have, really, in Pennsylvania.  But I turned one way to help people, and Wiley [Wiley Burton] turned the other way to help people, and nobody needed help (laughter).  So, we said, all righty, okay.  So, we digested that.  And we'd already done the interview, so okay.  All right, now, I'm doing a television show in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] every Sunday, 'The Nancy Wilson Show.'  We had this conversation and we had lunch.  I leave and go to New York [New York].  He calls me in New York and we talk.  I said, "Well, I'll stop back through."  And I met his mother and his sister, and then I go on to California.  And I walk in my door, and my mother says, "Why is there a wedding dress here?"  I said, "I--excuse me?"  "There is a dress that was sent here by the people who send you your clothes for your television show, and it's a dress that you would never wear.  Why is it here?"  "I don't know."  I looked at it, I said, "I'll never wear this, this--no.  Why would they send this dress?"  Well, within the week, Wiley Burton had come to California and he sat down with my son and my mother and he says, "I, I'm going to ask--."  You know, he wanted to ask me to marry him.  I said, "Oh," but this I found out was a little later.  So, we said "All right, later."  And Kacy [Kenneth Dennis, Jr.] was the one who said, "Why wait?"  Okay, the wedding dress was there, the shoes had never been on, whatever.  Okay, all right, okay.  So, we got married, and we got married in Las Vegas [Nevada] by a pastor, not in a chapel.  We got married at Church of Christ [Las Vegas, Nevada], not one of the wedding chapels.  My sisters were my bridesmaids.  Everybody was there, everybody got there, all had on different dresses, everybody was there.  And we met on April 22nd, and we were married May 22nd.  So, and we'd been married, it'll be thirty-five years.

Speaker 1: Children?
Speaker 2: We [Wilson and Wiley Burton] have two girls, Samantha [Samantha Burton Majied] and Sheryl [Sheryl Burton Wells] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you had two kids, back to back?
Speaker 2: You had to say that, right.  They--for a minute, they are both the same age (laughter).  One is thirty-two now and one is thirty-one, so when their birthdays roll around, they're both the same age for about, for about a month.  But they are, I am so proud of them.  We've gone through a little family crisis, and they have been right there with Mom.  They've been so helpful and I don't know what I would do.  My greatest gift, as much as I love the voice, is my children.  And then I've been really blessed that my daughters had carried their babies at the same time, their first babies.  So, I have grandsons who are two weeks apart.  I have Shane [Shane Wells], he's so fine, oh, and Sol [Sol Majied], who is just what his name says, the sun, and then there's four-year-old Chase [ph.], who is what is name says.  You will chase him.  They are so gorgeous, so fine, just beginning, beginning to understand who the grandmother is.  The most important thing to them is that I'm their grandmother.  And then they figured, "You sing?" "Well yeah."  "Well what do you sing?"  "Well, have you listened to anything?"  "Well I saw you on television."  "Well did you pay attention to that?"  "Not really."  The Naked Brothers Band came along, and there's a song called 'Crazy Car.'  I was in the studio with The Naked Brothers Band, because Michael Wolff is their father.  He was my conductor for five years, and I sang 'Crazy Car' with The Naked Brothers Band.  I get a call from my niece, nephew, grandsons, "Grandma, do you know The Naked Brothers Band?"  "Yeah."  "Are you singing a song called 'Crazy Car' with them?"  "Yeah."  "Wow, you're a star."  It was like, okay.  After that, I became who I became in '64 [1964].  I finally--my grandsons had been to see me sing.  It did not register, it's like, okay, but it's The Naked Brothers Band.  Then, since then, however, they have walked through the rooms where they see awards, where they see commendations from presidents, where they see the Uncommon Height Award, where they see the first Paul Robeson Humanitarian Award, where they see that doctorate from Berklee College of Music [Boston, Massachusetts], where they see that doctorate from Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio], where they see--"Grandma, did you speak at the 120th year of Central State's--?"  "I was the keynote speaker.  Yeah, baby, I really was."  So, they're finally putting it together, that there's more to it than just the singing part, your grandmother is many parts.  You have the biggest and the best part, but I've given--I have given because I was given.  I'm trying to make them understand that if you're gifted and God is kind and good to you, and he will be, you must find a way to share that, you must give it back.  You can't keep it all, don't be selfish.  Don't be selfish.
Speaker 1: Do you see your brothers in these little boys?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I see Mickey [Michael Wilson] in Sol.  Sol's funny.
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: That's Sam's boy.  My brother Mickey could sing really well, and he was funny.  That's the one I told you, he would make you laugh at anything.  Sol is very much the same way.  Sol can be in my car watching the movie, 'Dreamgirls,' and know the whole score.  But he will also put the original soundtrack from the play, from the Broadway show on, which is on the iPod, and he will do the show.  He is funny, he tells jokes, he dances; he is Mickey personified.  If Mike hadn't been so nervous, he would--Mickey sang as well.  Mike sang on 'The Mike Douglas Show' one day, and I thought he would never get through it.  I thought his hands would fall off before he--but he sang 'Imagination' and he loved Jesse Belvin.  And I'm looking at Sol, and I'm seeing a young Mike who is not nervous, 'cause Sol doesn't have a nervous bone in his body.  He's a ham just like his grandmother, very much ours.  He's Sam's and mine and Mickey's, yeah.  I see--Tony [Anthony Wilson], I see in Shane--I see in my s- nephew, the athlete, I see Tony.  My brothers and my sisters that I've lost, my uncles, they are there in my children.
Story_ID: 465242
Speaker 1: You were talking about awards.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Emmys [Emmy Award], Grammys [Grammy Award], your 'Nancy Wilson Show' ['The Nancy Wilson Show'].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nominated?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, won.
Speaker 1: For?
Speaker 2: 'The Nancy Wilson Show,' best entertainment show.
Speaker 1: Emmy or Grammy?
Speaker 2: Emmy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Grammys for "How Glad I Am" ["(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am"] in the R and B section, which was strange; 'R.S.V.P.' ['R.S.V.P. (Rare Songs, Very Personal)'], jazz; 'Turned to Blue,' jazz, back to back, yeah.
Speaker 1: Those early years were wonderful music years, not that they're not now.  Those were musicians that wrote.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  When--I loved it when writers wrote, singers sang, and arrangers arranged.  There was a book called 'The Day the Music Died' [ph.] and that was the day that twenty-four track came along.  With any of number of albums today, before you see the artist name, you really should see, engineered by, and none of my albums have ever been engineered by.  The engineer is a part of the process, but what you hear is me.  That does not necessarily happen today all the time.  There are some wonderful artists that need an opportunity.  They need to hone their craft at places like the Crown Propeller [Crown Propeller Lounge, Chicago, Illinois] and little clubs like the Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] and different places I worked in Columbus [Ohio], the Key Club [Golden Key Club, Cleveland, Ohio].  We need places for our young people to hone their craft.  We need something other than 'American Idol.'  I hate seeing young people being demeaned.  I hate seeing them standing in line in the rain for a chance.  What happened to the club around the corner where you could go, get your chance?  We need more--newer is not necessarily better.  I am just grateful that, that you--I can still record the old way, and they can change it to digital if they like.  I still record all my songs live.
Story_ID: 465243
Speaker 1: In the early '80s [1980s] there were so many people that you appeared with.  Any favorites?
Speaker 2: Oh, dear.  Always musicians, you know.  I've always had been really blessed.  I had John B. Williams with me for many, many years.  In fact, my trio [Nancy Wilson Trio] was so good, when I discovered Arsenio [Arsenio Hall], and he stole my trio.  I allowed him to have John B. and Michael Wolff.  But Roy McCurdy has been my music drummer twenty-eight years.  Llew Matthews, twenty years, is my conductor.  I have a thing with my musicians that we've been able to have this kinship, and it lasts, it's--if they're good, because I'm an easy boss.  It's not like I'm going to crack the whip or anything.  So, it's about the music, it's really about not having to work at it.  If you have the proper surrounding, it's a piece of cake.  You just get off the plane, do what you have to do.  You know that the music is right, the music's there.
Speaker 1: So how did Japan come about?
Speaker 2: Capitol Records.  I was with them forty-some albums and twenty- more than twenty years.  The record industry was changing.  Like I said, when twenty-four track came along, and The Beatles and the Rolling S- not--Mick Jagger--Rolling--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Stones.
Speaker 2: Stones.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Rolling Stones, okay.  Now I love Sting and The Police.  Don't get me started with them, I love that group.  But I remember going to Japan and being asked a question at a press conference once about Cream.  I didn't have a clue who Cream was.  And I said, "Well can you elaborate a little more?"  You know.  "Well, it's a rock group."  I said, "Well, okay.  Now why would you ask me about a rock group?  Would you just assume that I would know?   Because, if you're just finding out, I never had heard them."  It just so happens that Eric Clapton came out of that.  So, I've made it my business to find out who Eric Clapton was.  Very fond of Eric Clapton.  And I've watched some of the rock musicians change over the years and I've watched how rock in particular changed the record industry.  Where, it--I find it very strange that one of the major labels in this country, Columbia [Columbia Records] does not have a jazz division, the home of Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis and Duke Ellington.  How can you not have a jazz division?  Well at that point, nothing was happening.  The record industry was, was in--just--I don't know what they were doing.
Story_ID: 465244
Speaker 1: But the Japanese market had always been, Asian market had always been so good for me.  So I was presented with this offer, would I record for Sony Japan [Sony Corporation], and they would import it into the states.  I was with Sony Japan at Denon, and then Sony for many, many years, and then it came about that they had decided that they would, saw this eighty-page contract, so that they could, I could record in the states and they didn't have to be imports.  I was probably better off when it was Sony Japan because they don't really have anything to do with one another.  That's when I really found out about the recording industry.  I knew a lot, I mean, but that was not my job, to know that much about the recording industry.  But I do know that Cannonball Adderley and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson went out of their way to make certain there was a vice president or an A and R [artists and repertoire] people who were black at Capitol Records.  We did that in the '60s [1960s].  So, there was an awful lot of things that we did as musicians with the record companies to make certain that black people got put in the right place and got in positions of power at radio stations.  And then the radio stations and the record companies divided the companies into black and white, which is, hadn't been done since I was five.  I mean there hadn't been charts where there was race charts on one side of the page, and what was pop over here.  That hadn't been done during my knowledge.  I mean, when I was growing up, that did not, you know, that was over.  And to come back now and realize that a black artist has to sell a certain amount of records in order to cross over to white audiences, when Nancy Wilson has been more than 60 percent white audience all her career.  When Columbia [Columbia Records] will send you out, take you out on a record promotion tour, and take you to seven cities and not one white radio station.  What happened to white?  Of course, I'm on the phone with Japan, and that's when I found out that they had no control over that.  So, you know, that's when I really realized how sad the situation was, when the division is greater now than it was back in the day.  I mean, I don't know which was worse, Pat Boone stealing Chuck Berry's [sic. Little Richard] song ['Tutti Frutti'] and making it a hit in white America, or, you know I mean it's--you're playing us and killing us different ways, same way.
Story_ID: 465245
Speaker 1: Who were the musicians that went to Japan with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, my trio.  John B. Williams--
Speaker 1: Played bass?
Speaker 2: --played bass; Roy McCurdy, drums; Llew Matthews on keyboard for twenty years.  And before Lou was Michael Wolff, yeah.  But the problem is there hadn't been that many.  And Don Turner [ph.] was before that and Ron Albright [ph.] before that.  So, I've only had maybe five or six conductors and--throughout a fifty-year span.
Speaker 1: So after Japan's [Sony Corporation] earlier recordings, you switched to CBS Records?
Speaker 2: Columbia [Columbia Records], yeah, which was Sony [Sony Music Entertainment], yeah it was Sony.  And we did at least four or five nominated for Grammy [Grammy Award]--
Speaker 1: Albums (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Albums, yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: It was fun.  We had some really good people.  I worked with Randy Jackson, Andre Fischer.  With Roy McCurdy, Llew Matthews, John B. Williams, my people.
Speaker 1: The guys.
Speaker 2: My peeps (laughter).
Speaker 1: The Grammys--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tell me about those.  Awards are very important.
Speaker 2: I have a much better rapport and relationship with the Grammys today.  I've watched the Grammys try to grow into who they thought they were.  It amazed me that over thirty, thirty-five nominations in the pop field, I won one in the R and B field. It amazed me one year that I was in a category which was a great category.  They had--I can't remember how they listed it.  It was me, Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney--I can't remember the other two, but the bottom line was we're talking some serious people here, and between the five of us, there were not five Grammys.  Now, we're talking top of the line supper club--attractions across this country and they were not dealing with us.  I came along at a time where generally if it was--all my things were nominated in the pop field, also Barbra Streisand.
Speaker 1: What year are you talking about now?
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s].  I won in '64 [1964] because I insisted on a song called 'How Glad I Am' ['(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am'] against everybody else, but I won in R and B, not pop.  I could on and on about that, but it's obvious, and I'm not going to expound on it because I must say they have made an attempt to change things.  I started recording pretty much the year the Grammys were founded.  I am very much involved with the Grammy Foundation and the work they do with young people.  The tributes they're paying to people like [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder.  They really are actually making a great effort to do their due diligence and make--you can't make amends, but let people know that this did go on.  Jazz was never, ever given the props it deserved, but this past year, you actually saw a person who played jazz.  Their face was on national television, and that's the first time, first time.  All of the awards of jazz, and--. If you realize that the Grammys are actually two hours long and they only give out either seven or eleven awards--there were 118 awards given by the Grammys this year.  Very deserving, I mean, that Randy Jackson won an award that nobody ever heard anything about, but the song was great and they did win a Grammy for it.  But you don't hear about everything else they do that is so good, and like Jimmy Jam is on the board, and they are making an effort.  They are reaching out to the jazz audience and to blacks.  I remember the difficult time that rappers had trying to be acknowledged by the Grammys.  I have been to the Grammys the last few years.  I've watched the performances improve.  I've watched the, I watched Chris Brown, this past--wild boy just blew me away, he was just so good.  Some of the young people say I am not so old that I cannot appreciate a Ludacris.  Who am I?  Fine, really fine.  I love John Legend, I love Ne-Yo.  I don't want to hear my people, my sister, my mother, my daughters [Samantha Burton Majied and Sheryl Burton Wells], denigrated by hip hop or rap.  It is totally unfair.  I am tired of hearing about, "Well, the man, somebody upstairs, this is what they want us to do."  You, young man, stand up and be a man.  I don't want to be called anything out of my name.  I am Ms. Nancy Wilson [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson].  You may call me Nancy if you're nice, but do not call me any of those ugly words that you wouldn't want your mother called.
Story_ID: 465246
Speaker 1: So what year was it that you were able to get the Hollywood Walk of Fame's--to recognize Ms. Nancy Wilson [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson]?
Speaker 2: You probably have in your paperwork there the year that I got my star on the Walk of Fame.  I could not begin to tell you.  I will tell you this, that I was at Hollywood Bowl [Los Angeles, California] this year and some of my family did go and see the star again.  I have only seen it once, the day that it was given to me, but I must tell you that my people, my manager [HistoryMaker] John Levy, my husband [Wiley Burton], my sisters, my friends threw a weekend of--there was a black tie dinner the night before.   At the unveiling, everyone was there.  There was this huge, beautiful--Tramaine Hawkins, Daryl Coley, people from across the country who came to the reception afterward.  There was a party.  In fact, you wouldn't believe--and three days of celebration when I got the star.  And I finally began to appreciate it when my children--. First of all, no one realized at the time I got my star what they put the committee that wanted me to have the star through.  It had reached a point where I did not like what they were doing to my--to the committee that was trying to do this for me.  And I finally let it in, and I said, oh, wow, okay.  When my daughter, and an adopted daughter--three women sang to me that day, and it hit me, wow, you have a star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  And at that time, one of the few blacks ever to have one.
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991].  Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Out of all of those.  So, I, I--the pride came.  It took a while, because they had really hurt my people, so--but I want to thank Senator Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson].  Diane worked so hard for that--and my husband, and Betty Turney.  They formed this committee, and it took them two and a half years, I think, to get it, but they got it.  So, I'm thankful for it, I'm grateful to them for having the patience, because I lost patience about nine months or a year before they did.  But they were perseverant, they hung in there and I'm very proud, I'm so happy that they did.
Story_ID: 465247
Speaker 1: There are two songs that come to mind that are requested seemingly all the time.  The one you'll know automatically--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --your first big song.
Speaker 2: 'Guess Who I Saw Today,' which I have sung literally every night that I have performed for fifty years (laughter).  I heard it by Carmen McRae.  Carmen McRae was very ill, and I went to see her many times during that last year.  And we had this conversation, because folks would come to me and say, you know "Carmen's mad at you for recording her song."  Back--I didn't know that people had--that it was their song or anything, because Eydie Gorme had recorded it.  It's from 'New Faces of '52' ['New Faces of 1952'] and I did hear it by Carmen.  I was fifteen, fourteen, fifteen.  Because it is the song that has done everything for me.  I heard something different in it than they did, maybe because I was fifteen and had never been hurt, that I could put all kinds of hurt in that song that nobody else could.  I could reach my mind out and find all kinds of ways to make this song different, and I was able to do that.  But Carmen let me know, "I know whose song you heard, I know whose version you listened to."  So I was glad and so pleased to talk with her about that.  And I have to say, 'You Can Have Him.'  As much as I love 'How Glad I Am' ['(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am'] the pop tune--but 'You Can Have Him,' the Irving Berlin song.  I had heard it by Nina Simone, and she hummed through it, and I knew there had to be something really special there.  I knew the words, so I got them from Irving Berlin and I sang it.  And that's another letter that I treasure from it, saying thank you for recording my song as written, saying the things that he meant.  Now, there are other songs that I truly love, like 'Old Folks'.  There is Etta Jones singing 'My Mother's Eyes.'  There is Carl Anderson and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson singing 'Ferris Wheel' ['First Time on a Ferris Wheel'].  Oh, I mean I could on and on about the music, but there is so much of it.  I mean, this is all I ask--some of the songs that Peggy Lee sang.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite Peggy Lee song?
Speaker 2: 'Fever' (laughter).  Peggy Lee--listen, the woman, Peggy Lee used to tickle me.  Peggy Lee needed oxygen early on.  Peggy really was asthma prone and had difficulty getting on stage and whatever.  Once she hit that floor--first of all, the look.  I mean, please, and that little sexy voice.  And she would start talking about 'Fever' and wouldn't move hardly anything, but the part that she moved, oh.  Peggy Lee was marvelous.  I loved that song by her, and what people do not know is she is a wonderful writer, and has written many, many songs that [HistoryMaker] Johnny Pate out of Chicago [Illinois] would do, and I have heard them at his home.  She has written many, many things, and she was a wonderful, wonderful person who would read into the--very much like Blossom Dearie.
Story_ID: 465248
Speaker 1: And then singers.  The pipes of the world, I mean the greatest voice I ever heard was Sarah Vaughan.  The interpretation, the humor--Ella Fitzgerald, I mean, scatting.  Phyllis Hyman, singing "Sophisticated Lady" and Duke Ellington.  No one could touch Phyllis Hyman's voice.  Phyllis was absolutely brilliant.  I love Etta Jones, really loved Etta Jones.  And of course, Jimmy Scott, early Jimmy Scott, when Jimmy Scott sang "Everybody is Somebody's Fool" ["Everybody's Somebody's Fool"] and "The Show Goes On."  And of course Dinah Washington singing--and it's on my first album ['Like in Love'], "If It's the Last Thing I Do"; and "This Bitter Earth."  We were fortunate people to have writers, which we touched on earlier, write songs because they weren't writing about themselves personally.  They were writing about us, they were writing about my audience, my group.  It disturbs me a little bit today that songs have become so very personal.  I do not really need to know--there's more information than I need about your divorce, or your whatever.  I would like to hear about things in general, and I'd love to have singers bring that to life.  I think India Arie did some very personal work that worked.  Everybody can't.  Her things were universal, are universal.  And Alicia, as much as it's kind of today, there is some [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson in Alicia Keys.  There's some lyric, there's some content.  And that's what I'm happy about is that's coming back.  We're reaching a point where--I've always said that everybody may be thirteen once, and one year.  But eventually they will, God willing, be thirty.  And then they want to have some mature lyric to listen to, they want some content.  Hopefully the writer is out there who's going to write that for them.
Story_ID: 465249
Speaker 1: --There have been a lot of things written about you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You've been called Sweet Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson]--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --Nancy the Baby, great things written about you.  Any one in particular stand out in your mind that just made your heart swell up?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  When I read--I've read some articles that have, and I've really been blessed that those articles have been about me, and they have been honest, they've been--the reviews, the critics, the people have been kind.  They understand that I am Nancy, I can't stop being dramatic just because it suits a critic.  Whatever is happening in my life, this night, that's what's going to be on the floor.  You can't--I don't make it personal, but 'Rainy Day' [sic. 'Here's That Rainy Day'] is a far better song on a day when it's raining, you know.  There's, there's--life is what I do.  On stage I'm trying to bring something that touches me to your heart.  I want you to go home talking about, did you hear what she said about--?  And I want you to remember that.  I believe that one of the nicest things that is said is that I am a song stylist and that she delivers a lyric better than anyone else.  She makes you understand the story.  And one of the songs that I have sung, kind of sums me up.  It's called 'A Lady with a Song.'
Speaker 1: Can you do a few bars?
Speaker 2: Which one are we going to do, the Drake [ph.] or (laughter)--?
Speaker 1: There it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can I please get to be seventy (laughter)? Whoo.
Story_ID: 465250
Speaker 1: There was a gentleman from Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --named Whitney Young.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: And you received the Whitney Young Award from the Chicago Urban League.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That had to be a very special time.
Speaker 2: It was extremely special for me.  Whitney Young was taken from us at such a tragic and early time and I had such faith and believed what the Urban League [National Urban League]--and still do--I am still very much involved with the Urban League.  I spoke with Marc [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial], the current president not too long ago, who was surprised that I called him instead of John Mack [HistoryMaker John W. Mack], who is one of my favorite people.  But the Urban League, Whitney Young kind of let me know what they were trying to do when they were first forming, and how the job market--and it really kind of opened my heart and my eyes and my head about some of the things that were going on in this country with my people and the job situation and employment, and--because my life had basically been about music and about just waking up and living what we call the life of Riley, because life was sweet and God is good.  But he was the one who brought, who made me understand there's so much more that I could do than what I'd been doing.  Not that he asked me to do anything, but he made me see that things had to be done and should be done and gave me the courage to take a step and do what I could, try anyway.
Speaker 1: The thirtieth anniversary of the United Negro College Fund [UNCF] annual Evening of Stars [An Evening of Stars] is coming up.
Speaker 2: Yep (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were there in the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yeah, UNCF.  I hosted the very first 'Parade of the Stars' ['Lou Rawls Parade of Stars'] along with Clifton Davis, and had pretty much been on every one in some capacity.  I remember we would go to other cities and throw UNCF parties during the telethon.  I've done that in Atlanta [Georgia], Chicago, St. Louis [Missouri].  I have been wherever they have filmed the 'Parade of Stars' so many times.  UNCF, I've been on most of the campuses.  I have spoken, I've sung at most of the campuses.  I've tried to raise funds for most of the campuses.  I have a great feeling in my heart for Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  To go to--well, Atlanta Clark [sic. Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and I don't even have to tell anybody about Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Just think of the minds and that which came out of, I mean Dr. Bennie Mays [Benjamin Mays], one of the most brilliant men ever.  And I think about Mary McLeod Bethune, and I think about how UNCF was founded and started and why.  Because our young people, back in that day, we were not allowed to learn to read and write, but they stood up and made it happen.  To be a part of that--and as I've grown older I respect and appreciate that more.
Story_ID: 465251
Speaker 1: Are you surprised about UNCF [United Negro College Fund] being thirty years old, that show ['Lou Rawls Parade of Stars'] that you started with Clifton Davis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I'm not surprised.  I'm pleased that we have been able to keep that.  I mean, it's absolutely wonderful, the very fact that we honored you this year in Chicago [Illinois], that we do things other than An Evening with the Stars [sic. An Evening of Stars], and that there's more to it than just the one thing.  We're getting a good staff back again.  We're getting people who really care.  I'm going to thank Anheuser-Busch [Anheuser-Busch Companies] for having been there all those years, because none of this could have happened without them.  There are people who cared a great deal and were there--not just what they're talking about, good old UNCF, they were there with their money, they were there.  There are many sponsors that, there are just too many to mention, in Chicago in particular.  As much money as you, as we raise here in Chicago, it's phenomenal what we do.  I love the Black and White Ball better than I do all that other stuff.  The balls are marvelous.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lou Rawls?
Speaker 2: I miss him.  I do, I miss him.  I'm glad that I do hear him played.  I can walk in a mall sometimes, and--or walk into Barnes and Noble bookstore [Barnes and Noble Booksellers, Inc.], and they'll play--sometimes they're playing me, it's like oh, okay, I like that.  But Lou, we go back to the Capitol [Capitol Records] days--so, Lou Rawls' first family, all the children, all that stuff, you know.  So, he was one o- he hung out with me and Cannon [Cannonball Adderley] and Nat [Nat Adderley] a lot.  So, we had some great times, and I spent many years--we were together, we did, we played Las Vegas [Nevada] a lot, we played the casinos a lot.  It was Lou Rawls and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, we did that for years, and it was fun.  So, I do miss him, I miss that warmth.  I miss that sound, I miss that mm, you know that depth, that voice.  I mean, he was just charming.  I do have a hard time with that sometimes.  They're a couple of--Carl Anderson--I have a hard time with him too.  But, I'm, I think of them frequently, and they're always with me, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you have a favorite Lou Rawls story?
Speaker 2: You don't want to hear that one (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What about the second one?
Speaker 2: There is so much.  I mean, I think him lending his house for Angela Bassett and Courtney Vance's [Courtney B. Vance] wedding was, was one of my favorite things to see him do.  And him in general, I used to laugh at the, at the suits.  That's not positive, but hey, it was funny, what can I say.  That always makes me laugh when I think about that.   But to have, to hear him sing and to watch him, I mean, Lou was one of the easiest--I mean he--his show was just so smooth, and he always had a great band.  And he loved good dinners, but the suits used to tickle me, though.

Speaker 1: There are so many people that you can call names of that were associated with UNCF [United Negro College Fund] throughout these years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And I think back about you possibly having an opinion about the doctor.  You were on 'I Spy' and the doctor was the star of the show, Bill Cosby.
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.
Speaker 1: Any good stories about Mr. Bill?
Speaker 2: I've got some great stories about Mr. Bill.  I'm working--Bill and I are doing a concert the day after tomorrow, again.  First date Bill Cosby had with his wife was to come to see me.  One of the first comic to open my show was Bill Cosby.  My dog, Jake [ph.], who's a Border Terrier, is a gift from Bill Cosby.  Bill, I adore him, I love Camille [Camille Cosby].  The work that they do--and speaking of UNCF and how much they give--and I don't have a problem with him speaking out on the black family.  And it hurts, a lot of people get offended.  But if you look at it, and look at what the man is saying, we have to go home, and we have to raise our children.  And I do know the difficult thing.  I know how hard it is.  I remember people telling me--because I was very upset when DJ Quik came out, and all that stuff, and Public Enemy, and it was like, oh come on, wait a minute.  Well, you don't have to have it in your house.  I have teenagers.  It doesn't have to be in my house.  They can't stay under my roof in my eyesight twenty-four hours a day.  I could turn the radio on in my house, and it's there.  So, how am I--?  And to hear people tell me as a parent, that I'm supposed to keep them away from--no.  You owe res- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From hip hop?
Speaker 2: You owe responsibility to do hip hop in a way that is positive.  I can't object to--I remember when they talked about rap music, and I just said, now wait a minute, let's back up. Now, we're talking rap here and we're talking music over here, please do not put those two things together.  Now, I hear the story and I know that hip hop is supposed to be an outgrowth or whatever of bebop.  I don't hear it because bebop had musical notes; it went somewhere.  But I do, I understand what they're experiencing.  I want them to experience more.  They're not getting half of what they need, and that bothers me.  I do know some of the young men and women.  I've watched growth in Mary J. Blige in particular.  I listened to 'Listen' and saw Beyonce sing 'Listen,' not in the movie ['Dreamgirls'], I watched her sing it live, and she put her foot in it.  That's the Beyonce I know, and have always known was there.  That one you'll hear more from.  The guys--come on (unclear) John Legend, Ne-Yo is kind of in the background, but is one of the nicest young men, and does not write the negative things.
Speaker 1: Kanye [Kanye West] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Usher is as sweet as he can be.  I have nothing but--right now I just don't know what to say about Kanye.  Kanye is, I'll say glamorous.  See, I got the songs on my iPod, because I have grandsons.  Kanye West is on my iPod.  He was at the tribute to [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones (unclear) with the Grammys [Grammy Awards], and he really performed well.  And it was, it was a different kind of hip hop having to do with and bringing--it was not negative, it was about, it was more real because I do know that a lot of these people are talking about, this is our reality.  I'm not buying that.  That is not your reality.  I didn't sing about not having sidewalks and having outdoor toilets because that was my reality.  Be- I mean, that is not entertaining.  That is not what it's about.
Story_ID: 465253
Speaker 1: I think they're growing up; they're getting, getting to understand a little better.  I do know that a lot of the young hip hoppers are very close to their moms, and I know in particular that Sean Combs [P. Diddy], his mother [Janice Smalls Combs] is tight, she's--. So, I, I can't just put hip hop and rap all in a group because I know too many of them individually and I know their hearts are good and I know the negatives ones are going to always be negative, they're not going to change.  Because they really--the gangster stuff (sighs) now that would take me to HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], it would take me to NMAC [National Minority AIDS Council], all of that stuff is all a part of this culture.  It came out of prisons, the whole hip hop culture, with the pants--they don't really understand the significance of that.  To them, it's just--but, unh-uh no.  Somebody needs to tell them that that's a very negative thing, that they don't really want to be doing that.
Speaker 2: Do you speak with them about things of that nature (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I speak--yes.  Well, I've been opening my mouth quite a bit about HIV/AIDS and the prisons, about the country as a whole having so many young blacks and black men in the prisons, and they come out of prison and now we have this crisis of black women with HIV/AIDS, and you cannot tell me there is no connection.  So, I'm using my voice as the news spokesman for the National Minority AIDS Council to try to reach the hip hop world and to bring our young people together to understand that there are responsibilities that go along with these words that you're using.  I would like to see the word condom back in the English language.  I would like for honesty to be back in a relationship.  I would like for you not to be offended if I ask you to take an HIV/AIDS test.  I would like for us to be real.  I would like for our pastors to understand that your flock is everybody--male, female, homosexual, and girl singers.  Ministers need to minister to their flock, and I do believe that, that I'm watching this coming together of our people and speaking as one voice in dealing with--and it is truly a crisis, it is urgent, and we have to deal with it.  We've got to start being honest with one another.  We've got to discuss it in our families, we've got to discuss in the pulpit, we've got to discuss it so those who don't have computers--. You know I'm--I hear all these wonderful websites--the people we're trying to reach don't have computers.  So we do have a thing where one of the companies is giving, we're trying to get computers everywhere, especially in the rural areas and whatnot because a lot of the knowledge that is needed is there.  I cannot abide MySpace.  I'm very--oh no, MySpace is very dangerous; I don't care for that at all.  I do have opinions about things and I could go on about, you know, our society in general.  I would like to say one thing to our black men: be honest.  Come to me f- real or don't come.
Story_ID: 465254
Speaker 1: The best of times and the worst of times, what's the best time been?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, the best time.  Any time spent with my grandsons is the best of times, especially if their moms [Samantha Burton Majied and Sheryl Burton Wells] are around, and their grandpa's [Wiley Burton] around.  If we're speaking about life in general, it would be the weekend that they unveiled the Nancy Wilson street [Nancy Wilson Way] in Chillicothe, Ohio.  That weekend was the best of times.  The worst of times, I have a feeling I'm entering them, the worst is yet to come,   not the best.  And I'll handle it, we'll deal with it, because God is and will be, and I'm going--it's going to be whatever it's going to be.  But, you know, I've lost my parents and that's bad, but I have to be honest and say I lost my mother [Lillian Ryan Manis] on a Thursday before Thanksgiving, and the Friday after the following Thanksgiving my father [Olden Wilson] didn't wake up.  And I lost my mom [Bertha Trout Wilson] a couple of years later.  Those are bad times, but the night after my father died, I sang one of the greatest shows I've ever sung in my life.  The night after I buried my [paternal] grandfather [Albert Wilson], I got back on a plane and flew back to the Latin Casino [Cherry Hill, New Jersey] and performed that night, some of the best shows I've ever done.  Because of my faith, I have no fear of death, but I know it's coming, not necessarily to me.  All of us are going to die.  I'm just praying, and I ask anyone in my sight, pray not for specific things.  Pray for guidance and understanding.  Pray for strength to deal with the worst times when they come, because they will come.  But just pray for strength and understanding to deal with them.

Speaker 1: You have been helping a group.  I don't remember the city.  MCG [Manchester Craftsmen's Guild]?
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] (laughter).  An outgrowth of the Bidwell Cultural and Training Center [Bidwell Training Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which thirty-five years ago was run by my husband, Wiley Burton.  It is run by Bill Strickland, who is a phenomenal man.  It is the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild.  We teach.  We also win a lot of Grammys [Grammy Award] (laughter).  But really it is a teaching facility for the community.  Pittsburgh has come so far with the steel mills and things going down in the iron foundries, because that's the era that I came up in.  Pittsburgh's a different town, a bit different city--and it is a city, and it's huge and doing great things.  We have, I have, Manchester to thank for a lot, or they have me to thank because I am very much a part of Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, having married Pittsburgh.  I'm so proud of us.  We have our own horticultural department.  We grow and win prizes for the finest orchards anywhere.   When you go to the International Association of Jazz Educators [sic. International Association for Jazz Education], the orchards that are on your table are grown by us.  The pots that they sit in are made by the children who go to school there, who we teach.  We teach ophthalmology, we teach photography, we teach everything.  It is for the community.  Manchester Craftsmen's Guild needs to be in every major city in this country.  They do great work and they also have this division that's about music, run by musicians and it's all about the music.  We have a theater, we have a summer series, we have the symphony, and we have the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Star Band [Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Star Big Band].  We also have James Moody and Jimmy Heath and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson.  And we--I mean I looked at the--they've only been in business doing recordings maybe what, ten years.  We have at least ten Grammys, you know.  I have back to back Grammys for an unknown company that nobody knows about, MCG, MCG Jazz [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  We are blessed.  There are some people there with vision and they see the future, and I'm loving what they're doing.  We are--we will be in New Orleans [Louisiana].  We, we're, we're--that's almost a done deal, we've got that going.  Hopefully, we'll be in four cities soon.  But Manchester Craftsmen's Guild has done phenomenal work and is continuing to do so, and I'm going to be, the first of the year, back in the studio doing my fourth album for them.  I gave them the first one, which was my only Christmas album ever recorded, but I gave that to MCG.  That's how I feel about community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's 'Nancy Wilson Christmas' ['A Nancy Wilson Christmas']?
Speaker 2: 'Nancy Wilson Christmas.'
Speaker 1: And the proceeds from that album?
Speaker 2: Go to Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, yeah, every dime.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Why not?  I mean, I've always said, if you have a gift--I mean, God has blessed me.  That was--that's my way of contributing to the community, and because I believe so strongly in Manchester.  I want to see it in New Orleans, I want to see it in San Francisco [California], I want to see it in Oakland [California], as opposed to San- I want it to be in other cities.  I want what we've done there to grow.  And by giving them all the proceeds from that, that helps, every little bit helps.  It keeps that studio--we have, we record there, recording studio. They have a kitchen with the seats, auditorium seats.  Oh, and I wanted to do a food show from there so bad.  But it is a marvelous facility, absolutely wonderful, and we have, here again, talking about UNCF [United Negro College Fund], we have people who know that these things need funding, that we need sponsorship, and we've been blessed to have it, to get it--
Story_ID: 465256
Speaker 1: Any things in particular you'd like to add to all of these wonderful words of wisdom that maybe I did not ask?
Speaker 2: Well, we've touched on the things that are vital at this point in my life--HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], UNCF [United Negro College Fund] forever.  One of the proudest moments of my life was to receive the very first Founder's Award ever given by UNCF.  MCG [Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]--there's no way to thank my husband [Wiley Burton] and my daughters [Samantha Burton Majied and Sheryl Burton Wells] and my son [Kenneth Dennis, Jr.] for allowing me the privilege of entertaining and performing for my audience, and I do this with their blessing.  And of course, the boys, I've got some fine boys.  I'll be looking for those seven and eight year old girls pretty soon, so you all watch out, I'm coming.
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Ah, I believed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think really my finest achievement is my family--my honesty, my loyalty to my friends, and knowing the meaning of that word, friendship--and maintaining friendships.
Speaker 1: What does friendship mean?
Speaker 2: It's not about talking to everybody every day.  Friendship is being in the heart.  It means that you are on my thoughts, in my thoughts.  If you have a concern, I have a concern.  If you're worried--ah, I'm not going to be worried, I'm going to give it to God (laughter).  I'm going to tell you, don't do that.  But, when I look back and count who my friends are, they have been my friends for thirty years or more.  It's about loyalty.  It's about being there when you're needed.
Story_ID: 465257
Speaker 1: Your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't think anybody interprets a lyric any better than I do.  They may do as well, but I'm about interpretation, and I think I do it better than anybody.
Speaker 1: You like you, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I come from--you know I figure, let me put it this way.  If I don't like me, who would?  Or why should you?  I have really some marvelous qualities that I would like to see in other people and if I don't show them to people, then--no, I think in order to accomplish and achieve, you need to like yourself.  You need to find out who you are before you start trying to impress people.  Know who you are.  And that's why I've been--I think the longevity and all that comes from knowing at fifteen, unh-uh, I'm not ready, I don't quite know who I am yet.  I need to have this center and know where to go for the good feelings that I need.  I need to go here, I need the cerebral part.  And then I've always accepted that there is a supreme being.  There is this God that has wrapped himself around me, and I don't think he's going to guide me too far astray.
Story_ID: 465258
Speaker 1: Of all of the songs that you have recorded--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is there one that you hum in the shower?
Speaker 2: I don't hum in the shower (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sing?
Speaker 2: I don't sing in the shower (laughter).  Actually, there is not one that I could choose over another.  I have been blessed to live in a time when our American songbook has been just thriving with marvelous material.  Like over the weekend--Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn.  How can you pick a song?  You can pick a group, a like kind of song, but there's no way to pick a favorite song, if you love music.
Speaker 1: 'How Glad I Am' ['(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am'].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's one I forced on everybody.  (Unclear) the young man's name was Jimmy Williams, and I remember [HistoryMaker] John Levy and David Cavanaugh, "This is not you; this is not a [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson song."  And I said, "It's going to be one."  And I had to sing it the other night.  And it's not one that I keep in the show, but it's one that nobody forgets, everybody loves.  I love the song, and don't let it be one of those kind of shows, because 'How Glad I Am' will raise the roof.  It's a wonderful song and it was perfect for the time.  And it was after the transition, I was still doing supper clubs, but I also had the jazz connotation.  But here came this great little song.  See, I think 'Knitting Class' is--and half the people don't, they didn't get it.  I said, "I'm not talking about knitting." (Laughter) So, if you're going to be literal, you're in trouble.  But 'How Glad I Am' is one that I insisted.  I was recording, and once it was recorded, it was the very first song out of twelve that was--oh my god, that's a single.  It was one of the few songs I've ever gone in and when the song was finished it was thought of as a single, because I never go in to record singles.  Never have recorded singles; I record songs, I record albums.  I like the con- I like entire thing, I don't want to record albums where there's only one song that you like.  So, 'How Glad I Am' was one that stood out and you knew, this is a single record.
Story_ID: 465259
Speaker 1: You are now on what album--
Speaker 2: I thi- (makes sound)--
Speaker 1: --what number?
Speaker 2: I think it's around seventy-five, about seventy-five, yeah.  It's a little older than I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's coming for [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson?
Speaker 2: I'm recording a new album of basically original new songs.  They pretty much haven't been done, or there is one that has been done, but not overly so.  And I'm going to record for Joe Williams and [HistoryMaker] Johnny Pate and [HistoryMaker] John Levy, 'Here's to Life'--and Shirley Horn, of course.  I have a great arrangement on it.  It will be one of the only songs that someone has heard before.
Story_ID: 465260
Speaker 1: There are a couple of names that people seem to put with [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: One you just mentioned, Joe Williams.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were together a long time--
Speaker 2: We were.
Speaker 1: --under the same management.
Speaker 2: Under the same management.  [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, back in the day, we were under the same management.  We recorded together.  Back in the day, Gene Harris, The Three Sounds, and of course Cannonball Adderley.  I remember George Shearing's eightieth birthday at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].  George played every song that we recorded in 1960, 1960, or '61 [1961], exactly the way it was recorded.  I could never do that.  I admire him so very much.  I have been really, as I say, blessed with musicianship.  And when I think, I mean, I was singing with [HistoryMaker] James Ingram just a couple of months ago, and the song was "Wish You Were Here" and my grandchildren were in the audience, and their grandfather [Wiley Burton] was in the audience, and James is singing, and I'm singing this love song, and the boys said, "What is she doing?  He better stop singing that--." (Laughter) Kenny Lattimore was [HistoryMaker] John Levy's suggestion, which was surprising to me, because that's a very young sound and a very young man.  Kenny Latimore can sing, and his wife [Chante Moore] is so charming.  I have some really fine young people.
Speaker 1: What did you do with Kenny Latimore?
Speaker 2: The song we sang was "Why Did I Choose You."  And he sang--oh, he sang it so beautifully.  That's in 'R.S.V.P.' ['R.S.V.P. (Rare Songs, Very Personal)'], and we'd done it in person once.  I sang with James Ingram twice the ballad that we recorded.  I haven't done too many duets.  I'm always looking for material for a duet.  I'll find some.
Speaker 1: So you don't know, you don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There are some guys out there that--Al Jarreau still wants to do a duet.  It was a bit, it would depend on the song, how far you'd stretch.
