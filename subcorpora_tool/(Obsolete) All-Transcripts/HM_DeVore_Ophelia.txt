Speaker 2: That's, those are kind of like my favorite expressions because I, in my history, there's a lot of French. And also, since I've been in and out of France so much, and for business, of course, that I like to throw a few French phrases in there now and then.
Story_ID: 106640
Speaker 1: So Ophelia, the name Ophelia--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --your, where did your mother get the name from?
Speaker 2: I'm sure she got it from history, you know, from Shakespeare, yeah, because she was a schoolteacher and an organist for the church, of course.  And so she was very much involved in education.  And Ophelia was, I'm sure, a name from education because it wasn't a family name at all.
Speaker 1: What was your mother's name and your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Mary Emma--Pixley [ph.] is her maiden name, Strother-DeVore.  She's got a lot of names there.  Her birthdate, she's a Sagittarian now.  That was November 24th.  Now, what year it was, I don't remember, so I don't remember what it is.
Speaker 1: And you're one of how many children?
Speaker 2: Well, there were ten of us, but one died when he was young.  So there were, that nine reached maturity.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother's--let's talk about your mother's background, her history.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Your mother was part African American, part--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, she was, my mother was part Native American, part African American and then part European American.  Now, her father was, his, his mother was a Cherokee princess.  His father was a German merchant.  Now,--and her, on her mother's side, there was French, was Senegalese and Native American and also some European stuck in there some place.  I don't know how much.
Speaker 1: But your mother, would you say that your mother was raised--how do you, how do you assume your mother was raised, as a little black girl or a little biracial girl or a little white girl?  I mean, could she pass for white?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no.  She, she really focused more on the Native American culture, but she was an American girl.  In other words, she was an American.  Let me just tell you what an American is.  This land was kind of settled.  The Native Americans were here first.  Then Europeans came on and brought the Africans on.  So the main population, the American development was European, African, African--not African American, European, African and Native American.  So she was an American because she was a combination of all of those.  Consequently, this is the way my, all of my siblings are.  Some of us went to the white part, some went to the Native American part and some went to the black part.  So we, we followed that, and so, but she took a lot of the culture, Europ--the Native American culture. 01:05:28:14
Speaker 1: Now, what, what are some of the aspects of the Native American, of Native American culture that she took on?  Can you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, she was very stoic.  And I remember this very much when we used to go to church in, you know, we went to churches that were segregated, like in the South.  It was in South Carolina when I was a little girl.  And we could not pat our hands.  We could not pat our feet.  And we would sit very stoic.  And anybody next to us would dare shout or anything and hit us, mother would say, "Hit 'em back".  So nobody would sit next to those DeVore, kids if they had any intentions of shouting.  So we had to be very stoic in our presentation.  And also, your word was your bond.  If we said we could do, we're willing to do something, we would do it.  You know, that was, that was your bond.  Now, am I able to do everything now that I say I'm gonna do?  No (laughter).  But that was very much, that was very important as far as her culture was concerned.  And another thing is that we were very close as a family.  We socialized primarily with the family, but the family was very, very large.  So we socialized with very few people except the family.  So those are some of the unique things I think that I kind of like had to live by and that my brother--my mother brought into our relationships.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that your mother was a school teacher.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Now, did she teach in a segregated school?
Speaker 2: Yes, correct.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the school she taught at?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't because when my mother was--after she started having children, she didn't continue teaching that much.  And I was way down the line.  I was about, I was about the sixth child.  So she had stopped teaching at that time.  So I don't remember school.  And another thing.  My father [John DeVore], because of his work, traveled a lot, so we relocated a great deal.
Story_ID: 106641
Speaker 1: Well, what was your father's name and what was his date of birth and his place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father's name is John Walter DeVore.  His date of birth is March 3rd.  Now, I don't know the year, but that was that.
Speaker 1: But your father, his background.  Your father was white.  He was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and your--and growing up in the South and being just a drop of black blood in you, you were considered to be black.  So I'm assuming your mother and father were a biracial couple, and they probably, people probably looked at them as such.
Speaker 2: Well, you know my, you know, during the time I came up, if you said somebody was black, you'd get slapped in the face, you understand.  You were either Negro or people of color.  And we were never called Negro or we, we were called people of color.  We were always people of color and were never called Negro.  I mean that, that's the way I was taught, and that's, that's the way I--we presented ourselves.  We didn't present ourselves as black or white.  We were people of color.  And we were Americans.  I was going to do a book and say "I am America" because these are the three groups that settled in American primarily.  Yeah, the question you asked me, I've forgotten because I was going around the road and back again.
Speaker 1: No, but that your mother and father were different races--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, okay.
Speaker 1: --so that they brought two different perspectives to the household or--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --two different cultures.
Speaker 2: Yes, but, you know, when you live in a small town, a small area, okay, my father's people were very powerful, very powerful.  My mother's people were very powerful.  So you, you lived the way basically, you wanted to live.  Now, in reference to the children, how we related, the whites called us niggers.  The blacks called us string-haired whites.  And we were in the middle.  We used to fight all the time, and we were known to be fighters, fighters, fighters.  And our reputation is don't mess with them because they will fight you, see, because we were in the middle.  And that's why I said, I am America.  I'm not white, I'm not black, I'm not Native American.  I'm a mixture of all of this, and that's the way I grew up.  And I had to fight to be an individual that I am.  But I was--I don't know what happened.  My mother was smart enough for us to find our own identity.  And that's why some of the family, some of the siblings went with the white part of our family, some with the Native American, and others went with the black part of the family.
Speaker 1: And when you say that they went with those particular sides of the family, what does that mean?  I mean what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they--
Speaker 1: --does it mean to live with the whites--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They married into that and lived basically as, as white.  Now, we all remained very close.
Speaker 1: How would they live as white though?
Speaker 2: Well, they lived in the white area, primarily, and traveled as white and I'm sure on their, and on their identification, they have them as white.  And not only that, most of my identification, if I don't tell them what I am, they'll think I'm white anyway.  I remember when I was appointed by President [Ronald] Reagan in Washington, D.C. at the John F. Kennedy Center, and we were in a board meeting.  And they were saying, oh, gosh, we don't have anybody who's black on the board and so forth and what not.  So I raised my hand.  And they said, what?  I said, "I'm black."  You understand.  So when I travel, I'm like a chameleon anyway.  I, if I travel in Spain, I'm Spanish.  If I travel in Mexico, I'm Mexican.  If I travel in Africa--and I've been all over Africa, all over Europe, all--I haven't been all over Asia.  But I've been in Asia and out a lot.  But wherever I go, I identify with people.  And whatever it is, I'm like a chameleon.  I identify with people all over.  And maybe because it is my background.  And we never felt that we had to be a one group.  We were, we were people.  We were--and we were Americans and anybody say we weren't Americans, we are more Americans than anybody else.
Story_ID: 106642
Speaker 1: So your father [John DeVore] was a German, you said German, part German--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 1: --French and German?
Speaker 2: --half German and half French.
Speaker 1: And what was his business.  You, I--
Speaker 2: My father was a roadway contractor.  What he used--I guess he, he built, maybe built about half of the highways (laughter) in South Carolina.  So he used to negotiate the--well, he owned the business.  So he (unclear) negotiate, making the deals.  And that I used to go with my dad sometimes, sit on his knee and listen to him sell.  So I think that's where I got my background from, how to communicate effectively and get the deal because I did that.  And he could really, he could really sell.  I mean when he finished, you had to give him the deal.
Story_ID: 106643
Speaker 1: So what do you remember about your mother [Mary Strother-DeVore] and father [John DeVore] growing up?  What type of relationship did they have?  Did they ever speak to you about how they met and what their love story was?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My mother was a very quiet kind of a person.  She was very quiet which she said, it was giving you directions and she wasn't much of a talker.  And we weren't a very social, she wasn't very social at all.  My father, he loved people.  He was just the opposite.  They were--I don't know how they got together really because she was very quiet, and he was very flamboyant and a tremendous communicator.  And he loved to play the guitar and sing and just have fun.  I don't know how they got--they were two different people.  But I loved them both dearly, and they both contributed a great deal to my development.
Story_ID: 106644
Speaker 1: And, but I--
Speaker 2: What are some of your earliest memories of growing up?  Was it Edgefield?
Speaker 1: Edgefield.
Speaker 2: Edgefield, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Your earliest memories of growing up in Edgefield?
Speaker 1: Well, one of the things, a lot of times we, in Edgefield--as I said, it's a very small community and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How many people?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't really know.  But, and there's a lot of--you're really, like out in the country a lot of the time.  So I remember being in the country, having lots of land and running and going up and down the mountains and playing with rocks and swimming, swimming in the, the branches, not rivers, you know, the little waterholes or whatever it was.  And interesting thing about it, is because I was, I guess the sixth in the family--there were three boys after--there were two boys after me.  So I hung out with my brothers, two brothers.  And we used to always swim together, not, didn't have a stitch on.  And we would just--we were young.  And nobody thought anything of it.  You know, I thought it was the most interesting thing when I look back now.  You know, we would go swimming and then we would go up and climb up in the tree and then dive down, which was very dangerous now, you--but we didn't tell mom [Mary Strother-DeVore] and dad ]John DeVore] about it.  See, they didn't know about that.  Those were our big secrets.  But I think it, living in a very open area and just being free to do basically what you needed to do.  But I was, I meditated a great deal.
Story_ID: 106645
Speaker 1: I used to go in the--I remember just sit on a, some kind of a rock or something and just sit and just meditate and meditate, even as a child.  Now, I don't know why I did it.  But that was just something I did.
Speaker 2: Well, what were you meditating on?  What were you--as a child, what were you thinking about?  You were trying to do what for yourself?
Speaker 1: I, I think I, I was basically thinking about what was gonna happen to me, you know, as I got older and, and I went out in the world.  I think that's basically what I was meditating about.  Now, I had no idea what I was going to be as a person.  I had no idea.  I thought I would, one, be a dancer because my dad [John DeVore], when family, when members would come or family came to the house, they'd ask--he'd ask me to dance.  I was double jointed, so I could do all kinds of crazy things.  And he would ask me to dance.  So I thought maybe I'd be a dancer and what not.  But that was just, you know, childhood thinking.  I guess I, I guess I ended up a communicator, and maybe that's what I was thinking about, what can I do in the world?  And one of the things that annoyed me a lot, even as a child when I would hear people talking about people of color in a negative way, this bothered me more than anything I can think of because the difference as far as I was concerned, it was just a matter of color in reference to people, the red man or the black man or the white man or brown man, it was just a matter of color.  Character was not exclusive to any one particular group.  And that used to annoy me a lot, and I think that's why I went into the business that I'm in, is because I was, it was my mission to change the image of people of color, my people.  And that was very, very important to me, more than anything else because I don't care how much money you have, you can't sleep at night if you don't have peace of mind.  And to me, I always wanted to have a peace of mind, no matter, no matter what.  So I made sure that my mission and followed the, I guess the dictates of what my mother [Mary Strother-DeVore] taught us, to be a decent person, you know, tell the truth and follow--and be responsible.  I think I tried to follow those as much as I possibly could.
Story_ID: 106646
Speaker 1: So thinking back over your childhood, what were holidays like?  What was Christmas like?  What was Easter like?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, Christmas is when, Christmas was so interesting to me because they used to talk about Santa Claus, and I wanted to know, I wanted to see Santa Claus so bad, so bad.  And when they would all go to bed or go some place to put the toys and whatever we were going to have away, or put 'em out under the tree, I would get up and try and look, as a child.  I'm talking about a four or five year old child and find out who Santa Claus was and what he was.  They'd have to find me and make me go back to bed.  But it was always a very, very wonderful time for gifts.  And to me, I remember the food more than anything else because that's the time you'd have all kinds of goodies.  And some of the Southern foods that you would have, like sweet potato pies and, oh, you get the best sweet potato pies in the South, you know.  I don't know whether you know about it.  But sweet potato pies and peach cobbler and turkey and all the good things and all the fruits and, and candies.  Oh, so, we looked forward to Christmas.  And then Easter was interesting, but, you know, that was like a one-day thing.  You know, you have eggs and you paint them and what not, but it wasn't--the holidays, the main holiday was really Christmas.
Story_ID: 106647
Speaker 1: So when you were a child, and when you were young, before you came to New York, did you--I mean what did you think about the way your mother [Mary Strother-DeVore] carried herself?  I mean a lot of what you've done with your life is image, and the way people present themselves.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did your mother present herself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was well groomed, very quiet and had excellent manners and wasn't, as I say, wasn't much of a talker.  I, I followed, I basically followed her character as a, as a person, I think.  I tried to emulate her as much as possible.  Now, in reference to the way she dressed, perhaps not so much because she was a little more, I guess--not so sophisticated, you know.  She wasn't, you know, as stylish.  She was more, what would you call it, conservative, in her approach to, to dress.  And also in her presentation, she was a little more conservative.  And being an organist for the church, you know, you gotta be rather conservative, and then as a teacher, you were conservative anyway.  But I'm not conservative.  I'm quite flamboyant, and really rambunctious if you get, you know, get on the wrong side of me because I learned that early on.  But another thing is that I might tell you this, and this is probably what a lot of children didn't have exposure to.  We were away most of the time when I was very young.  I went to, started going to boarding school when I was about five years old.  And, and I was in boarding school a lot of the time.  And I wasn't home all the time with my mother.  So I would, I had to communicate with people when I was away from home.  Now, the reason why I was in boarding school a lot was because every time my father got a job or every time he got a contract, he had to relocate to another part of the state.  And every time we went from one school to the other school, then you would get left back or something would happen.  So not to interfere with our education, I was in boarding school a great deal.
Story_ID: 106648
Speaker 1: Do you remember the year you moved to New York?  You were eleven years old.
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I was--
Speaker 1: You were in, you were born--what year were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in 1921.
Speaker 1: So, and in '32 [1932], you moved to New York City [New York]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, probably.
Speaker 1: --to live with your uncle or your great aunt?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my aunt, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like?  What was New York City like for you as a child, coming from a rural--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now do you, do you want to say what happened to me before I came to New York?
Speaker 1: Sure--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --if something big happened before you came to New York.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I think this is important.  Before I came to New York, my uncle, he didn't have any children and mother had nine.  So he convinced my mother to let me stay with him a year, you know, or let me stay with him as long as I could.
Speaker 1: Now, where was this uncle located?
Speaker 2: That was in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Now, he was one of the owners of the only bus company in America, I guess.  It's the Safeway Bus Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  And they had the Arrow Taxi Company also, he and I forget the name of the brothers that they had a business together.  And so I went to stay in Winston--Winston-Salem for a year before I left for New York.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you go to Winston-Salem?
Speaker 2: Because my uncle wanted--he, he didn't have any children.  So he loved me, and he wanted me to, you know, he wanted to kind of take care of me, raise me as, you know, as, as his child.  But his wife got a little jealous.
Speaker 1: Was that the only reason?  I mean did he think that Winston-Salem was more of a city.  You were in Edgewood or Edgefield--
Speaker 2: Edgefield [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: --which was the country.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not at all--
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: --not at all because even though we were in the country, we were not country, like country people, you know.  We kind of (laughter) were a little more than country people, like you see country bumpkins on TV.
Speaker 1: You were a bit more sophisticated.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), we were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, we were a little more sophisticated than that.  No, it's just because he wanted to--he didn't have any children, and his wife wasn't having any children.  So he wanted me to be their child.  But in the meantime, she, you know, she felt a little insecure, and then I came to New York.
Speaker 1: So he owned Safeway Bus Company which was a black-owned bus company.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: At the time, interstate bus travel was, I mean, the bus systems were segregated so black people would have to sit on the back of the bus.  Were you aware of that at the time?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't because I was only about ten or eleven years old.  I was just a child, you know.  And, you know, I never rode the bus, I don't think.  I don't remember riding the bus 'cause he had Arrow Taxi Company too, so I'd ride in the taxis.  And I don't, I, I imagine in the bus, in the segre--in his bus company, they would sit anyplace.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because his was black-owned, right?
Speaker 2: Correct, black-owned.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, black-owned.  I think that was the only one in the United States, was owned by black, is the Safeway Bus Company in Winston-Salem.
Speaker 1: And what was your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: God, now, you've made me forget his name.  Well, let's see, I've been in the hospital seven months.  So a lot of things I forget.  I've been on so much medication, it's a wonder I can remember my own--John, John Strother.
Speaker 1: John Strother.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: No, I have it written down here too.  John Strother is your uncle that owned the Safeway Bus Company.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 106649
Speaker 1: So after you spent the year with him [Uncle John Strother] in Winston-Salem [North Carolina],--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I came to New York--
Speaker 1: --what happened?
Speaker 2: --to Aunt Stella [Carter].  Yeah, that's my aunt, and I lived on Edgefield--in Manhattan, what was called Sugar Hill in those days, and that's where the elite, you know, blacks lived.  That's where the big-time musicians and Walter White used to live door.  His, matter--his daughter was my classmate, you know, Walter [Francis] White of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], yeah.  And so, but, you know, in those days too, it was segregated here in New York because when I--the school, the school I was going to was Stitt Junior High School.  That was in my district, Stitt Junior High School.  So when my aunt took me there to school, I don't know how it came up, so it must have come up that I was people of color, black or whatever it was we were using in those days.  And they said, oh, no, you can't go here.  This is all, this is all for white.  That was Edgecombe Avenue, Stitt Junior High School.  Now, that was during that time.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know how to spell that, that school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, S-T-I-T-T, Stitt.
Speaker 1: Stitt, okay.  But now, was your aunt, was she extremely light-skinned?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now, was she part of the family that was pass--was living within a white world or was she living as a Negro or person of color?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she married somebody who was Native American.  So she was living in between worlds.  Well, let me finish telling you about that Stitt thing.  So they said, well, you can't, you can't go to school here because, you're not white or whatever it was.  And my aunt said, well, this is her district so if you say no, we'll go down to the Board of Education and find out where she's going to go to the school.  And they put me in the school right away.  Now, what they tried to do--what they did, and they put me in a class that had two years of French, you know.  In those days, you started French when you were, early, early--they started, you know, some kind of two-by-four French.  And I didn't have any French, background French.  I had just some Latin, but not French.  And so they put me in a French class those two years, hoping that I would, you know, fail so they would get rid of me.  Well, anyway, when I graduated from Stitt Junior High School, of all the people in that school that took a test to go into a gifted high school, I was the only one that passed, the only one, and went to Hunt, Hunter [College] High School [New York City, New York].  Now, all the whites and all the others that they didn't want, didn't want me to be a part of, they--well, they didn't make the grade.  So it shows you just how, you know, if you have a image of yourself, and you know who you are, you define yourself as achieving, nothing can hold you back, you know, that is, if you're, of course, if you're old enough to do the kind of things and you have the foundation.
Story_ID: 106650
Speaker 1: But I did have the foundation to know that I could do what was--I could do what I think I can do, and I made it my business to do, to do that.  And I ended up having seven years of French.  And then when I went to France, when I went to the film festival [Cannes Film Festival], the first time and I--and I'll tell you this because otherwise, I'll forget it.  And I think this is pretty unique.  And I, I was very naive in reference to international business.  So I didn't have an appointment with the director of the film festival.  Anyone who would give you the okay to, you know, to get involved.  So I was in a French hotel, so I said to them, I said, what, now who--I said, how can I get in touch with the director so I can get credentials?  They said, you don't have your credentials yet?  I said, no.  They said, no, you'll never get in.  Well, I got on the phone.  In one, in one hour, I was in his office.  Now, that wasn't the end of it.  He only, "parle en Francais".  He couldn't speak in English.  So, I had to parle en Francais.  I got everything that I wanted.  I, I got anything.  And that's when my little girl [Cecelia Cooper] came in and was Queen of the International Film Festival, where all the starlets throughout the world, all the starlets.  Miss France almost had a heart attack because she thought she'd win--Miss Paris, rather.  She thought she'd win.  So that's, that came in very handy, knowing, knowing French.
Speaker 2: And you'd learned that French in, in junior high school, you started.
Speaker 1: I started in junior high school, but I continued French in the, you know, and went to high school and what not.  But what happened is that in, in the, at Hunter [College High School, New York City, New York], where I went to high school, you know, when you went to a French class, they spoke nothing but French.  They didn't speak English.  So you either would, you know (laughter), you would fail or you would, you just wouldn't last unless you learned the language.  But I had a little bit of it anyway because my mother [Mary Strother-DeVore]'s background of being from Senegal in the African part of her background, they speak French.  So we, you know, she, she used to teach us some words of French.
Speaker 2: So your mother spoke French, some--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and just--yeah, not fluently, but she spoke some French, yes.
Story_ID: 106651
Speaker 1: So do you remember getting--so you're, after stick junior high and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Stitt [Junior High School, New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: --Stitt, and then going to Hunter [College High School, New York City, New York], well at--roughly around age sixteen, you got your first modeling job.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, it's, you know, as you develop as a child, well, anyway in our family, everybody had had the arts.  So you had a certain amount of dance, ballet and, and so I, I looked a certain way and people recommended me to do some modeling.  Well, of course, in those days, I didn't know what modeling was.  See, modeling was the in--it was the infant stage in those days.  The only person that was in the business was John Robert Powers, nobody else.  There weren't Ford [Ford Modeling Agency] or Wilhelmina [Models]--Wilhelmina and all these others.  They didn't exist.  And so I, I was recommended by some of the friends.  And then around that time, 1946, also Johnny Johnson [HM John H. Johnson] started Ebony and JET and what not.  So they had a opening for people of color or people who were not blonde and blue eyed.  You know what people don't understand in those, I'd say, well, around that time in the 1940s, they had in the image of America, I mean the image of America, blonde and blue eyes.  If you didn't have blonde and blue eyes, I don't care how white you were, they did not put you in the image of America.  Now, I--people left out the image of America were the Mediterranean Europeans.  They were not in the image.  They didn't have--they weren't blonde and blue eyes as a race, the Alpine Europeans, the Asians, the Hispa--the Latins, they all were left out the America--the image America was totally blonde and blue eyes, Anglo.
Story_ID: 106923
Speaker 1: Okay, continuing on tape two, you were talking about the image of America being blonde hair, blue eyes.
Speaker 2: Blue eyes, exactly.  And, and I was saying in those days, they only had the blonde and blue eyes because that was the image of America.  And when you traveled and went out of the country, if you had dark hair and dark eyes, they didn't think you belonged to America.  So we had to make a change.  And then my mission was to make a change.  And we went into the business in 1946.
Speaker 1: But before we jump to you going into the business, you're sixteen when you started the--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --when you got the first job and that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so that's the late '30s [1930s] and that's in New York City [New York].  What was that job--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was your role?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  It was hair, I did something with the hair, also with the thread companies, J. & P. Coats, I think it was, with the thread companies.  They have, they do a lot of publicity shots and you, you know, you'd do hats, and I don't know if you looked in my, some of the pictures I showed.  I have lots of hat pictures that I did and fur coats, furs, I did.  And I did testimonials also.  Basically, the thing that you would see in Ebony, but most of the things that I did were, were shown in Ebony magazine or in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper.  Now the Courier--and the Afro-American also at the time.  Now, what happened with Ebony, they basically used them in the ads.  Now, with the Pittsburgh Courier, they used them in publicity shots, in other words, fashion publicity.  They'd show fashions in publicity shots.  And a lot of time I would model for the house, the wholesale house.  And then they would give the pictures to the newspaper, and the newspaper would run them.  But in the meantime, there was no one to write about the, the pictures that they had.  So I had to learn, I had to write about the picture.  First, I had to do casting for them when they decide to use people of color.  I had to do the casting for them, make sure they had the right model for the right fashions.  Then I had to write about it.  So I became a columnist for the newspapers. And, and then a showcase for the clients.  It was, it became a showcase for the clients and development for people who wanted to be in the modeling business or who wanted to have confidence, that they represented something that people admired, and they would be included in, you know, in the elite.  So I had to learn how to do just about everything.  And so I, I remember one of the times that this was when I was putting on a fashion show, and I wanted to use people of color in the fashion show.  And I went to one of the fashion houses.  I don't want to call the name of the fashion--it was a suit and coat house
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you should call their names.  This is for the purpose of history--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at this point, call their names.
Speaker 2: Adler and Addley [ph.] it was.
Speaker 1: What was the name?
Speaker 2: Adler and Addley.  It was a suit and coat house, and I told 'em I was, wanted--putting on a fashion show.  I was going to use models of color for people.  The man got so nervous, he, he--and this was the owner.  He got so nervous.  He had never heard of people of color in the modeling business.  He ran back in the office.  I never saw him since.  He was scared to even talk to me.  I mean that's how bad it was.  Now, in the beginning, we didn't use just people of--African, blacks or African American, you know.  That's a political gimmick.  You know, I hate to even use it, but it's political.  It's, it doesn't mean anything because, let me just say, you're right about (finding?) out about my family.  Half the time they'd say, we're white.  In another place, they said that we're black.  And who, you know, it's a political thing they use anyway.  Sometime it makes you angry.  But we used to have, we used have in our, in our modeling business, we used to have Asians.  We used to have Jewish people who were the Mediterranean Europeans, those people who were not accepted in the, with the John Robert Powers or the Anglo look.  So as I say, it's, it's a political thing, and it was kind of sad.  But I was determined that I would make this change.  That's how I became a marketing consultant, you know, I became a marketing consultant because they needed, needed what, my background.  And, you know, as we moved forward, I became one, you know, one of the top marketing people to get these companies to take a larger share of the black consumer marketplace where they wanted to expand and get a larger share of the marketplace, whatever it was.  They would use me because I was the only one that knew how to integrate without the other, the majority market being offended.
Story_ID: 106924
Speaker 1: Well, what year did you or what provoked you to attend the New York Vogue School of Modeling?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, what happened, we opened--I, I was convinced to start the business by five, four of my friends.  So there were four or five of us that started the business in 1946.
Speaker 1: Can you name the five people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's start with Marie Mell [ph.] was one--and I'm starting with her because I'll tell you why again.  Albert--what was Al's--Murphy was the other one, Al Murphy, M-A-R-C--Charlie Mell [ph.], Rupert Calendar [ph.] and Ophelia DeVore.  Okay, that was the five of us.  And the reason why I put them in that order because in order to get the name of an agency, we had "Grace" by these five people.  "M", was Marie's first name, "A" is Albert's first, you know, letter, first letter in his name, and so it goes down.  That's how we got the name.  Often people say, who is "Grace"?  There's no such person as Grace, Grace Del Marco.  It's "Grace" by these five people.  But we were in the business only about a couple of years.  But there was no money.  There was no market for it.  We weren't making any money.  But before that happened, before they left, now, we started an agency, and then, in our naive minds, to think that they had people ready to go into the modeling business, knew the modeling--and who had the knowledge and be experienced, even if they didn't have experience, they have the knowledge.  They didn't have the knowledge.  They didn't have the experience.  They didn't have the awareness most of the time, of a, of a modeling business.  So if you're going to have it and make sure the business is successful, you've got to have people who are totally prepared.  So to do that, then I went to the modeling school to get a complete background, to get a finished background.  In other words, when I was modeling before I was using my ballet background because, actually, the modeling profession is based on ballet, the poses and the movement and what not.  And so I had to go and get a background.  And I went to Vogue School of Modeling.  And that was on 57th Street and 5th Avenue.  Now, I went through the whole class and, and had a great time, wonderful.  They just loved me.  They, you know, thought I was just something.  I guess they thought I had a suntan.  I don't know what it was, but anyway, I, I--and I say that because, yes, at the end of my class program, a young lady came in who wanted to join the school.  And she was cafe au lait, and my goodness, you'd think we were, the whole place was on fire.  Everybody was going crazy in the school.  And I was wondering, and I was, you know, I was young.  I didn't know what was happening, what was going on.  So finally, someone said, oh, we have someone who is not white out here, and, you know, and they want to join the school.  So I was so naive, I didn't know they didn't know I was African--or black or whatever, African American or people of color.  I--in my mind, this is the way I thought.  I was a teenager.  I said, if they didn't know what I was, they were pretty dumb because they were adults.  See, that's the way (laughter) I figured it out.  And, but that's how bad it was.  That's why I went to the Vogue School of Modeling, to get that thorough background 'cause I don't like to do something and get up there and guess because, as it was, you know, people get up there, and they'll take a pose and the pose might look good to someone who doesn't know, but it looks ridiculous to someone who is professional.  And then, if you're going to tell your clients to use certain type models and what not, you want to make sure they are showing the clothes in the acceptable fashion.
Story_ID: 106925
Speaker 1: So you went to the Vogue School of Modeling--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --to educate yourself on what you should teach--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Thoroughly, correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay, with that, armed with that education, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then, then we were able to promote and start a school [Ophelia DeVore School].  We had to start a school to train the people that we wanted to go with the agency because, as I say, they weren't trained.  So we had to do two--then we had two businesses, the school and the agency.  Now, neither one was making any money, see, except the school, you know, you got a few coins here and there.  But we, you know, this was all a new business.  This is all new.  And what happened, the other four could not, they could not remain because there's no business coming in.  They couldn't live.  Well, luckily, I was, I took the business over by myself and they got--we had five people that couldn't make it go, but one could.  But I'm a workaholic, and I worked night and day, and I have a goal, and I'm very focused, and I go for my goal.  And if I work with someone who does not see the goal that I see, and don't want to work with that goal and be accountable, I don't want them around me.  So I was very focused and had people around me who wanted to do something more than what they were doing.  And that's why I had so many wonderful models that break through, broke through in fashion.  We made the breakthrough in fashion.  We made the breakthrough in television.  And so many of these areas that were, were not acceptable as far as the non-white group was concerned.  I, I did it as a consultant or either my model or as their consultant and that's how that happened.
Story_ID: 106926
Speaker 1: So when you were starting out, how did you recruit the, the young women to come to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, then--
Speaker 1: --the school?
Speaker 2: --Marie Mell [ph.] was the one.  She was the one that was--she was a, she was a, oh, gosh, a druggist.  She had, she, she came out of the--
Speaker 1: The pharmacist?
Speaker 2: Pharmacist.  She was a pharmacist.  Thank you.  She was a pharmacist.  So her identification with the group was unique, but what she did, she did the recruiting for us.  And she would go to the, people who wanted--Sweet Sixteen and the, and the sororities, different areas where they had a group of people who wanted to do more than what they were doing, you see, be, a little--better than what they were.  And in those days, men were not in the modeling business, you know.  So men came in later on in the modeling business.  So we didn't recruit with the fraternities.  We only went to the sororities and, and the Sweet Sixteen.  And that's how she did the recruiting.  Albert [Murphy (ph.)] was a photographer.  Rupert [Calendar (ph.)] was a photographer.  Now, Charles [Mell (ph.)] was in the advertising business.  He worked with an advertising agency, and I was the model.  So those were, that's how we made the, made the group.
Speaker 1: And the company's name was Grace Del Marco Agency.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: What was the first location?
Speaker 2: It was located in, in Corona, Queens [New York City, New York] on Northern Boulevard at 103rd Street, 103rd Street--103rd or 102nd Street in Corona Queens.  And think--we were there for about, oh, a few years.  And after we dissolved with the partners, then I moved to 125th Street and 8th Avenue in that building, it's--the very nice building there on the corner.  I forget the name.  The bank was in the same building, one of the banks.  And we were there for a few years, and then we moved downtown to Broadway.
Story_ID: 106927
Speaker 1: So, just to jump back to 1941, you, your first husband, you married, his name was Harold Carter?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he--can you talk to me a little about him, just because he was one of the first black firemen?
Speaker 2: Sure, yes.  He was, yeah, he was one of the first people of color to get in the New York City, fireman in New York.  See how prejudiced it was.  People think that they're only prejudiced down South.  A lot of things they were doing down South, they aren't--they weren't doing in New York, and he was one of the first, he and his brother.  So I got married when I was seventeen years old.  And, and in the meantime, I continued in school.  And I went to New York University [New York City, New York].  But in the meantime, also, since I was married, I started having children when I was about twenty-one, I think, something like that.  So I had five children, you know, along the way 'cause I wanted five children.  And I wanted these--as I went along, I wanted to do all of these things.  And so I had the children, and I had the business.  And we used to have the best time--on the weekends we would go, go to the mountains and go fishing and having picnics or we'd go to the, the beach to go swimming.  And so the children were very involved with what we were doing, and also in the business.  The children were a part of the business.  When we had activities, the children became a part of the business.  It wasn't fashionable to take your children with you in those days.  But I did.  I took 'em with me anyway.  And they knew the business.  And later on, it was very, it was very good that we did it because when I couldn't make an appointment--I used to lecture a great deal on a national basis.  And when I couldn't make an appointment to do something, then one of the children would go.  So it worked out very well, and it still works out well.  You know, my son [James Carter] is here.  He, he runs the business here in New York.  My daughter [Carol Carter Gertjegerdes] runs a newspaper [Columbus Times] in Columbus, Georgia, and, you know, it worked out real good.  My other daughter [Marie Moore] who is, she's a doctor out in California.  So they've used the communication business.  They--all of the children went in the communication business, some form of it.  So it worked out very well, me taking them in the business with me.  And now it's very popular to take your children in the business.  You'd think it was something new (laughter).  But they became, actually, they became my staff (laughter), my children did.  I had my own staff.
Story_ID: 106928
Speaker 1: So to get a good chronological order, you started writing for the columns then after you, after you were married in 1941.  You said you became a columnist also.  About what year--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and it was the Pittsburgh Courier?
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh Courier, I wrote for the Courier, and also I wrote for other publications too.
Speaker 1: Now, what year did you start writing?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, it was in the 1940s, the late 1940s and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: And what sorts of things are you writing about?
Speaker 2: I wrote primarily about fashion.
Speaker 1: And what did you write about fashion?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, no, let's see now.
Speaker 1: Was it like a "Dear Ann Landers" or "Dear Ophelia DeVore"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no.  It was like you'd have a photograph of a model in a fash--in a fashion outfit.  And I would describe the outfits and say why it was popular and what it, you know, the fabric and the style and who designed it and what fashion house made it, you know, or developed it and so forth.  So that's what I would really talk about.  I would very seldom write an article.  I was not a, what do you call--I was a columnist only for fashion.  I was a fashion columnist, and that's basically what I wrote about.  Now, any of the other writings that you'd read about--and I have zillions of writings, and they'd be writing about me, what I was doing, and, but everything that, basically, I was very fortunate.  We've, we've been in the business, in May, we would have been in the business sixty years.  And that we've been around the world and back again and the alumni, and that's why I was saying Ms. [Camille] Petty who has been with us since she was a child, and she's--when I wasn't there, she was taking the group all over the world we would travel--we have never had an incident like you heard about what's going on in Aruba and all these other places that's happening.  We've never had an incident.  And sixty years I've been in business, in what they call the meat business--they call the modeling business, you know, the, what they call the leisure arts, they're the meat business, you know, the modeling business, (unclear) business.  We've never had a scandal.  We've never had anything because we focused on our mission, and that is to create a better image.  And it, it worked, and I had five children.  And we are very close.  And when I say that, is that, I was a pioneer.  And I did work around the clock.
Story_ID: 106929
Speaker 1: I had a heart attack when I was in my early twenties.  And, well, you know, as they say--
Speaker 2: Well, let's just go back and talk about that because you, you had worked on a fashion--you were putting a fashion show together.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And, just tell me the story for Delta [Delta Sigma Theta], for the sorority.  You'd been up for three days.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they--that wasn't the Delta's show that, when I had the heart attack.  But this particular show--I forget who we had.  We, we used to raise funds for everybody, as I say, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], United Negro College Fund.  We raised funds for everybody.  And I was up three days with this, two or three days.  I forget what it was, and I had a very bad cold and, and it went into something else.  So they gave me penicillin and--because I would work around the clock.
Speaker 2: But tell me, how did you have the heart attack?  I mean did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, what happened--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --you were at home?
Speaker 1: I swole [sic, swelled] up, as big as three people.  And I guess I was just so damaged that I had a heart attack, and I was in bed for three months.  And it, my basic--not from heart attack I had.  It wasn't clogged veins or arteries or anything, is that I did not--I was so worn out and so run down, that my heart was not getting the proper nourishment so my heart just gave out.  And they just had to build me up.  And the second heart attack I had, I had the same thing.  They had to rebuild me so they'd make sure I have certain foods and certain things so my heart would get the right nourishment.
Speaker 2: So being in bed for three months, what sorts of things did you think about or dream up in your mind that you were gonna work on for the business?
Speaker 1: I still worked even though I was in bed for three months.  I still worked because most of my own work was intellectual creativity.  And I had other people doing the physical work, but I was still doing the work, and, you know, with the children and my first husband [Harold Carter].  He was very cooperative.  He was a fireman, but he was right in there.  He helped direct the fashion shows.  He was a good writer, and just--so he was part of everything too because firemen, you know, with, would work in their eight hours, and they'd come and you do other things.
Story_ID: 106930
Speaker 1: So, when you look at the fashion shows, what do you think their purpose, the purpose of the shows were?  Was it to raise money or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Give them confidence.
Speaker 1: --or to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Raise money for companies or for organizations, but also to give confidence.  The main thing was that we had fashion is to have, give people confidence.  Once they get on that stage, you know, they'd have to entertain, look at people, and entertain 'em.  They'd have to develop confidence because you do or die once you get on that stage.  And if you know the right thing to do--automatic--if you practice, automatically you do it.  It's like eating, for instance.  No matter how nervous you get, you never forget to it.  Take it, dip it in, open your mouth and eat it, right?  So if you rehearse and what not, you get on the stage, you might be nervous, but you still do the right thing.  And then, and your friends will say, "You were wonderful," you know.  And, and you've invited friends to be there to see you because you're going to be part of it, but you never know how nervous you're gonna get on stage.  But we rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.  And even though, as I say, they get nervous, they still do the right thing, primarily, because-- (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, was that having an impact--I'm sorry.  Was that having an impact on the, on the fashion world, itself, to, for you to put--because I'm sure at the time, there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --were no black models on the runway.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, what effect did that have on, on the--
Speaker 2: The modeling, fashion industry?
Speaker 1: --broader fashion, yes.
Speaker 2: When they needed models, they would call us.
Story_ID: 106931
Speaker 1: That's why we made the breakthroughs, through--in the wholesale house, the breakthrough was Beverly Valdes and Pauline Trigere and the--
Speaker 2: So talk to me a little about each of those, Beverly--starting with Beverly Valdes?
Speaker 1: Oh, with Beverly, when they wanted to integrate also--see, they don't integrate because they like anybody.  They integrate because they wanted a larger market share, you understand?  So what they do, they want somebody who, at least understand the profession.  So, you not only know how to move and how to sit and how to stand, how to walk and talk to people, you have to know how to communicate effectively with people.  See--
Speaker 2: And how did Beverly come to you, Beverly Valdes?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, you know, I, you know, I can't remember.  I, I guess it's because of publicity.  We used to get a lot of publicity.  And they see the publicity.  And then they would come to us, and then we would interview them.  So when Pauline Trigere wanted a model, then naturally, it was only, you know, to come to us.  And that's the same thing with Christian Dior.  When he came to America for his collection, that was Mary Farrington, and she was the first one, person of color, to go out with his collection all over the United States.  And Oleg Cassini wouldn't put on a show unless he had a black, a black model, you know.  And it was very popular because they found out, expanding their communication into the black market, they got, they got more business.  And, you know, and you know how businesses like business, especially white people.  They like to make a lot of money.  And they were getting a larger share of the marketplace.  So everybody started integrating.  And Jackie Gleason Show, for the television, Lulu Guerrero, she was, she was from the Dominican Republic.  So they called her in to be on the Jackie Gleason Show.  That was, you know, a daytime sitcom.  And she had a hard time with the people on the show because they didn't want somebody in there.  Now, she's, she's Hispanic, but, you know, you still was not white, and that's what--see, a lot of people got white on their, oh, what they call it, when you--
Speaker 2: Passport?
Speaker 1: Passport, but you're not white (laughter), you understand.  A lot of people got white on their passport, and if you don't look and see--I remember my, my baby sister--and this is off the subject, and I'll get back--you put me back me back on the subject 'cause this is a good, an example.  My baby, my, my baby sister was married to someone who was from Dutch Guiana.  Now, his mother was Jewish, and his father was Dutch.  Now, but he didn't look as American white, per se.  Now, when they went some place, he had to show his passport, and my sister got in because they thought she was white.  And that happened all the time.  It shows you how political that white, black situation is.  It's a lot of political nonsense, see.  And, anyway, I got off that I, I had to talk about that because, now I got off the subject matter.  Where were we?
Story_ID: 106932
Speaker 1: Well, let's just also go back when you were in your early twenties or shortly after you--or around the time you had the heart attack, you also had the car accident.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.  That was in 1954, '54 [1954], yeah, the car accident.  Before I had the heart attack, let me just tell you this too--I mean not heart attack, before I had the accident.  This is one thing I think is important, because I had to learn everything that I was going to teach somebody, I had to learn it.  So Ralph Cooper--you might not know him, but he was called the, the black Clark Gable.  He was a handsome actor, and he'd be, you know, he was--
Speaker 1: I know what Ralph--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, you do?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Well, we started 'Spotlight in Harlem.'  He was the producer, and I, I had the beauty part, I had the beauty part and the models.  And he had--and beauty and fashion, and he had the entertainment.  So he and I started 'Spotlight in Harlem.'  That was on ABC.  We were on that for about a couple of years.  So I had all my models on there so they could learn the business.  They could learn how to be in television and what not.  And that's why when Jackie Gleason needed a model for his show ['The Jackie Gleason Show'], you know, we had models that were trained already.  So they were--and the interesting thing about it, so many of those models that were on that show became people, very important people in the TV community, like the newscasters, Melba Tolliver, one of the first on ABC as a newscaster, and so it goes on.  But that's where I got my experience in the television, although I had a few, I had some experiences in doing television shows, a few here and there.  But I mean, in-depth television experience, by Ralph Cooper and I starting that.  Now, and then what was the next one (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, talk to me about the 'Spotlight on Harlem.'  What was the nature of the show?  What was the show about? You--it was, it came on once a week?
Speaker 2: The show, it was an entertainment show.  It was a variety show, that you had entertainers come on, and then you had the models to come on, and they would show the fashion.  And that's basically what it was about.  And as I say, Ralph was--but he was a movie star.  And he was, he was one of the movie stars in those days.  And then I was the person in the talent and the fashion field.  So we got together, and so we entertained.  And it was, as I said--and what happened, oh, I know, what happened the day I was going, into the accident.  What happened, I was, had the accident.  So I had to, I had to get off the show.
Story_ID: 106933
Speaker 1: But, and the interesting thing that, the show that we did as out in Detroit, Michigan.  And it was at Lou Walters' cocktail lounge.  Lou Walters was the father of--what's his daughter's name?  Oh, gosh.
Speaker 2: Barbara.
Speaker 1: Barbara Walters, Barbara Walters' father.  And that's how, the same time also, the interesting thing about Lou Walters, [HM] Diahann Carroll too, and we--that's another thing.  But with, okay, before I had the accident, and I, we went to do a casting for Ebony magazine for a cover and whatnot.  And it was in Lou Walters' place.  He had a cocktail lounge here too.  He had several of 'em throughout the United States.  And, and then what happened, they were casting for models, but at the same time, they were doing a casting for 'Jazz Train,' which was going to Europe.  And Diahann Carroll, she was always very ambitious and whatnot.  And, you know, once we trained her, she wanted to work in the business 'cause she wanted to be where the action was.  When the jobs came in, she'd be the first one to get them.  She was always very aggressive.  And so, so she, well, she, so she said, "Oh, well, they're casting.  So I'm gonna cast for 'Jazz Train'."  But she was only about sixteen.  So they said, well Diahann, you know you're too young.  So what she did, she went back, and she put makeup on.  She did all kinds of things to make herself look old, and she went back in there.  And I forget the casting director--Diahann, we know who you are, no matter how old you look.  But Lou Walters said, he said, if you want show business as much as that, I'll take you--I'll be your manager until I can get a good manager for you.  And that's how Diahann Carroll got started. Isn't that interesting?  And then they put her on the, one of the, one of the shows where you, one of the contest shows where you, you sing or dance and whistle and what not.
Speaker 2: 'Chance of a Lifetime.'
Speaker 1: I think it was 'Chance of a Lifetime,' yeah.  And what happened, what we did, you know, we wanted to make sure that she won, and that's where the alumni comes in, Camille and, and all of 'em.  We got as--oh, we got so many tickets.  We got as many tickets as we could possibly get. We had that, that TV, studio jammed.  It was on, it was at a theater.  And when Diahann came, whether she sang good or bad, whether she off key or on key, but we, but when we applauded, the whole thing jumped, and wonder it didn't jump off, you see.  And Diahann won (laughter).  And Lou Walters and they, then she put in 'No Chances'--I think it was a Broadway play, was the next one.  But that's how Diahann got started.  But she was a sweetheart.  And I've been very, very lucky.  All of these breakthroughs that I'm talking to you about, these were the nicest people in the world.  The bad people that are nuisances and complainers and what, now they don't make it anyway, 'cause no one wants, you know, the negativism around you because if, when you're in a positive area, you don't want the negativism.  The negativism, it handicaps progress, and you don't want them around you.  But as I said, I just had wonderful people.  Matter of fact, talking to our, our president who was president emeritus now, who's been with us for years, you know, all of the years that she was, been with us, traveling with all these, with all of our alumni members and what not--and we have thousands, not only here in the United States, all over, I have never had her com--I never heard her complain, never heard her complain.  Now, you know, that's interesting, isn't it?  All of these years.
Story_ID: 106663
Speaker 1: Okay, continuing to roll, tape three, testimonials about the agency [Grace Del Marco Agency] and about Ms. DeVore.  So if you can just state your name and briefly tell me your occupation and how you came to the school [Ophelia DeVore School] and what it's meant to you and what she means to you?
Speaker 2: Certainly.  My name is Olivette Taylor.  And I happened to come in the year 2001.  It was a very significant year as you remember, with 9/11 [September 11, 2001] and what have you.  My daughter that previous May underwent the child program here.  And then, hence, I followed in her footsteps after meeting the illustrious one.  I call her the facilitator of aspirations, Dr. Ophelia DeVore.  I came because my daughter was doing so many wonderful things.  I've been truly blessed.  She is a third child.  I have two sons, graduates from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and George Washington University [Washington, D.C.].  So to have that daughter, finally, and to have someone who loved to be lady-like and loves to do all the feminine things as well as use her brain, being a substantive young lady, we found, there were people like ourselves right here.  It was fun for us.  It wasn't a question of us feeling that we had to gain confidence.  I had wonderful parents, and I feel that Dr. Ophelia DeVore was like a soulmate for me.  She is a Leo, like I am.  We're multi-faceted, multi-talented.  I am a legal assistant.  I'm also an entrepreneur.  I have two companies.
Speaker 1: What are the two companies?
Speaker 2: The two companies is Vette Communications and what I do is multimedia presentations.  In 1997, I took a documentary which I wrote and produced to the Cannes Film Festival.  And I did that solely out of my own budget because it was for my church who now has international, sacred status as a museum for our Slave Galleries.  And this is what developed from that because I was founding member of the Slave Gallery Committee.  And we did that under the auspices of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, which I'm sure you heard of, as well as we are formally a parish, Trinity Church on Wall Street.  So there's a lot of history there, including Boris Tweed hiding up in our Slave Galleries.
Speaker 1: Well, we interviewed, last (unclear), we interviewed [HM] Dr. Suzan Cook for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, well, she is from Mariner's Temple, and I'm from St. Augustine's Episcopal Church of Lower Manhattan.  In fact, I believe, we're a little older than they are.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the very last question for you is just give me one thing that this experience has meant to you, the experience of the school and Ms. DeVore?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a wonderful, joint effort, a collective effort I could share with my daughter.  And as Dr. DeVore said, she was like me in so many ways.  When I speak to her, and it is a soulmate, how she trained and raised her children, my children the same thing.  I've always had them helping and assisting and being apprentices, if you will.  And I feel that once they're acclimated, whether it's business, corporate or just socializing, it comes easy and it's a common thing when you're sharing it together, and you're getting out there, putting your best foot forward because I believe that I did not raise them for my household.  I raised them for a world, and I want the world to accept them just as they are.  And Dr. DeVore, I love the fact that she is so dynamic.  She's a very astute woman, very intelligent woman, and I like to be glamorous yet smart.  So that's how I came on board because I was gonna help with the tickets selling.  I've always been a good sales person.  I've always, was able to produce, and I can do a lot of things simultaneously.  In fact, I have a major boxer in my office now waiting for me, and I came because I wanted to honor Dr. DeVore at this historically, significant moment and just tell her how much she means to me.  And she means a whole lot because even though my parents created the diamond, she has refined the diamond.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 106664
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead and introduce yourself.
Speaker 2: Hello, I'm DeVette Taylor, and I became, I actually came here--
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, you're Devette Taylor.  Spell that, spell it out for me so we get the spelling correct.
Speaker 2: D-E-capital V-E-T-T-E, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.
Speaker 1: And how old are you?
Speaker 2: I'm eighteen years old.
Speaker 1: And when did you come to the school [Ophelia DeVore School]?
Speaker 2: I came to the school in 2001 where I won Miss Teen Showcase, and it was just a wonderful experience, not only getting to know Ms., Mrs. DeVore, but also Mr. and Mrs. Carter, and getting to know all the other ladies that actually participated with me.
Speaker 1: So, are those photographs from the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: These are photographs from my recent endeavor, Miss, Miss New York where I competed for obviously, the title of Miss New York, towards Miss USA.
Speaker 1: Just hold it flat for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just like that, yeah.  So you were competing for Miss New York?
Speaker 2: Right, and that was actually last November.  So that was also a great experience where I completed--competed against, excuse me, with about, maybe a hundred and--150 other girls from New York.  And so that was just a wonderful experience, and that was in Albany, New York.  And it was just a really great experience, not only meeting the girls, but also it made me ready to actually do things that I'd never actually done before, so.
Speaker 1: So, why did you come to the school?  What did you, what were you hoping to get out of it?
Speaker 2: I was, guess I was hoping to get out of it, maybe--I've always been like that sort of like bright person, really cheery, optimistic.  But I just love modeling.  I love meeting new people, like I said before.  So it was just a great, new experience that I could also experience with my mother [Olivette Taylor] and other, and other people.
Speaker 1: What has it taught you about yourself and then outside of yourself?
Speaker 2: It's taught me to be strong, to be very, to be definitely innovative, to know where I'm going and how I'm gonna get there and to just set goals for myself.
Speaker 1: What are you most proud of so far, thus far, of the things you've accomplished?
Speaker 2: Definitely, graduated from high school.  That was just a wonderful achievement and moving on to college was just also--it was also a great achievement, especially since my, my two older brothers, they just graduated from college recently.  So it's just like I'm following in their footsteps, same thing with my mother.  She is, she is a college graduate as well, so.
Speaker 1: So, after college, where do you see yourself?
Speaker 2: Preferably, in, doing interior design or classical voice 'cause I love singing.
Speaker 1: Where are you in school because you didn't mention it on camera?
Speaker 2: I attend FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York City, New York] for interior design and architecture as well as Mannes College of Music [New York City, New York], where I study classical voice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're gonna close out.  We have thirty seconds.  We want to hear your voice.  We want you to sing something for us.
Speaker 2: [Operatic Singing].
Speaker 1: Beautiful, thank you very much [applause].
Story_ID: 106665
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm Patricia Myers.  That's P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A, M-Y-E-R-S.
Speaker 2: Now, let's--go ahead, let's talk a little bit about your--you are an alumni of the school [Ophelia DeVore School].  Tell me, when did you attend school and what was the experience?
Speaker 1: I attended back in 2004.  My daughter attended here.  Prior to coming to Ophelia DeVore, I did attend Fashion Industries, F-I-T [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York].  I always was interested in modeling, but, of course, I changed and went into a different career, which was, now, funeral directing, which I do love.  After bringing my daughter here, if I open up my love within, and I decided to take some classes here.  Meeting with Mrs. [Ophelia] DeVore, she felt that I should probably do something in writing 'cause I told her one day I wanted to write a book.  So she said, you know what?  Let me work with you as far as writing columns for the newspaper.  So I'm presently working closely with her to get some of her experience that I can go ahead and do things like that.
Speaker 2: So how has it, this experience in this school enhanced your life?
Speaker 1: It really woke up my dream within.  She gave me more confidence, like you can do this.  If you can see it, you can feel it, you can bring it to life.  So with her guidance, that's really helped me in like, let's get the pen in hand and the pad and start doing some writing.
Speaker 2: So what are your hopes for the school?  What are your hopes for yourself and what are your hopes for Ms. DeVore?
Speaker 1: Well, my hopes for the school, I hope that it will continue.  I think it's a great school.  We have a strong, strong legacy here.  For Mrs. DeVore, I, I pray that her legacy continue, that we as alumni can reach out to other girls and guys to continue her legacy.  And I hope to continue with the (unclear) Ophelia DeVore, to keep me abreast in the things that I wanna do with more confidence.
Speaker 2: So when you talk about her legacy, what is it you hope that continues of her legacy?
Speaker 1: Listening to her story earlier today, she went through a lot as black woman.  And it goes to show that no matter--it's not the color of your skin.  If you have it within you, just push hard, you can do it, maintain it and stay focused with it.
Speaker 2: How do you take that and apply it to your own life?
Speaker 1: Oh, staying focused.  That's one thing I've learned from her.  No matter what, if you have the vision, stick with it and just learn, learn, learn and keep moving forward.
Speaker 2: And the very last question is, you talked about vision--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --what visions do you have for yourself and what of those visions do you--will come to life because of the school?
Speaker 1: The vision that I have for myself is one day to have my own talk show and to educate people a lot more about death and dying.  I have been doing quite a few radio shows.  So I'm hoping that I can expand it into television one day.
Speaker 2: How will the school help facilitate that dream?
Speaker 1: Oh, gee (laughter).  Teaching, you know, continue to teach me the confidence, basically what they're doing a lot here, you know, that you can get out into the public and do a lot of other good things.
Speaker 2: So, very last thing, just to have you say something about what she means to you?
Speaker 1: Ms., Ms. DeVore a great deal to me.  Like I said, she has awakened some of my dreams with that.  And she's a great mentor, and I just, I just love her, you know, and I just want her legacy to continue to help others.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 106666
Speaker 1: All right, continuing. Hi, my name is Eleanor Williams.  Everyone calls me Ellie.  I prefer to be called Ellie.  Hi, I came to Ms. [Ophelia] DeVore's classes back in 2000.  I was Miss 2000, and so I had--I came to the class at the time in my life when I had, I was going through personal problems, you know, divorce.  And so at that time, I really needed Ms. DeVore's class.  I got a phone call.  I don't know where they got my name from, but I got this card in the mail.  And, again, it came at a time in my life when I needed that uplift.  I came and we went through, I think it was about eight weeks of training.  It was really good because I needed it.  They teach you how be yourself, how to walk with poise, how to have, you know, how to be flamboyant, how to be poised, how to be, just have that faith, energy, everything about yourself, how to uplift yourself.  And I, myself, was always very, an uplifting person.  I just needed that extra boost, and it, and it worked for me.  Well, anyway, we had this graduation night.  I was, I won, and it was a wonderful experience.  It's, it opened a lot of doors for me.  I, I had a lot of different shows and, and whatnot, and, you know, it had taught me, behind the scenes of the camera, this magnifying world that we're looking at, you know.  It's--
Speaker 2: It sounds like though that she, after the relationship, has given you a lot of your self-esteem?
Speaker 1: She has done that.  She has done that, and it's, it's a powerful thing to have that self-esteem, again, especially at a time when you need it.  Most of us do need that.  She has also been a motivational person for me.  She has been that person to--she's like a mom.  She's like, you can do that.  She give you that push when you need it.  Ellie, get out there, you do, you work your stuff, you know.  She, she does, she does that.
Speaker 2: Well, seeing how that we're recording this for her, and this will be a lasting piece, a document, what is it in these last thirty seconds that you'd like to say to her in accordance to what she's been able to give you through the school?
Speaker 1: Okay, Ms. DeVore, I just wanna say thank you so very much for being the person that you are, that you have been to me and to a lot of women in this industry.  I, for one, have always admired [HM] Diahann Carroll.  She, to me, was my motivation person.  I have never met her, but she gave me that aura, that, that personality that I find in myself, and I love it.  And I just wanna say thank you for, for having this class, and I hope that as this, this--we have this opportunity to continue this, you know, for younger people or for anyone that would like to do this, that it's a good thing, you know.  And I just wanna say, thank you so very much.  Bless you.

Speaker 1: Hello, I'm Barbara Adamoli, and I come from Italy.  I've been in this country fifteen years now, and I'm an actress, a singer.  This is a picture that I've done for my cabaret, the cabaret I'm preparing now.  And I've been through different schools, acting schools and when I was, in '94 [1994], I was just looking through the yellow pages, and I was thinking what I really need now is a modeling school to teach me how to apply makeup, how to stand, how to be graceful, how to sit correctly on stage.  And so I look at Ophelia DeVore, and I say, well, let me try there.  How nice.  It's inside the Empire State Building, how exciting.  So I just call.  Mrs. Carter was just Ophelia DeVore's grand--Ophelia DeVore's niece--no, what is it?
Speaker 2: She is daughter-in-law (laughter).  I can never get (laughter), yes.  And I was so excited to meet those people and they said, this is exactly what I need.  And I took the course, and I became one of the teachers.  I was hired as one of the teachers.  And I've been teaching since then then, since '94 [1994], so now it's twelve years.  I participated in a lot of different programs with Mrs. DeVore.  She has her own TV studio, and also we went to the Hotel Hilton where I performed for the former Mayor [Rudy] Giuliani--
Speaker 1: What does she mean to the industry, Ms. DeVore, what does (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, she's--
Speaker 1: --what she means to the entire charm school?
Speaker 2: She's everything because you can see from her story before how did a black mother made it from fifty years and until now, and have so much success and so many followers.  She's a pioneer.  She's my hero.  She's wonderful.  She gives so much inspiration and she's just pushed me there and just looking at her makes me feel, I will make it, too.  I'm going to make it.  I'm one of the Ophelia DeVore girls so I will make it.  And after I met her, I went--I had work in fashion for Ralph Lauren, Isaac Mizrahi.  I directed a choreography, a dancing choreography in Italy and Rome in 2001.  And I keep working and I work also in the hotel business.  My husband is a chef, and now I work with celebrity as Robert DeNiro, Oleg Cassini, that's as we mentioned before, he came also.  And then the hotel.  It's just wonderful to see her back, to have her back with us and I just want to, to continue her legacy 'cause she's just a wonderful mom.  She's full of warmth, and it's a joy to be with her.  She really lifts up everybody.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 106668
Speaker 1: Okay, your name, please?
Speaker 2: I am Pamela Pryor.  I'm a real estate investor.  And I took classes at Ophelia DeVore [School] in 2001, right after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  And it was a marvelous experience, even got my daughter, which at that time was thirteen, to also take classes.  And she became, Ms. Ophelia DeVore's project, because she was very shy and intimidated with coming into the classroom.  So Ms. DeVore really took a lot of her personal time out with her, mentoring and really giving her the confidence and the self-esteem, to come into the class and just present herself as a young lady and redesigning herself, so to speak, from sneakers and jeans to wearing lady-like clothing, and carrying herself as a respectable young lady.  I really admire Ms. DeVore because her goal with all the students is to make them model citizens, opposed to models, per se, for television and acting and entertainment.  So my experience with the program is not really for television.  It was just for, to enhance confidence, poise, etiquette, reshaping a young person's outlook on life and transforming herself.  I also transformed myself as well with being more, I'm gonna say, energetic, opposed to just sitting on the sidelines.  Currently, I'm the co-president of the alumni association, in which we have different programs that we help other young people, male and female alike, come into the program and just find what they need, to tap into their inner selves to develop themselves to become more outstanding individuals.  So Ms. DeVore, she's a very spectacular person.  She's marvelous.  And even though she's in her eighties, when you talk to her, she has a wealth of knowledge, and that knowledge, she shares with people unselfishly.  And that gives individuals the insight and the know-how to know that despite whatever is taking place or going on, you can still become whatever it is that you want to become, whether it's on TV, an astronaut, a pilot, a seamstress, whatever it, just stick with it, have that confidence, do it, and just do it and be happy with it.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Story_ID: 106669
Speaker 1: My name is Catherine Peppers, C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, P-E-P-P-E-R-S.  I'm an actress.  I teach here at the school, business and social etiquette.  I'm retired from New York City, Department of Social Services.  I worked there for about twenty-seven years.  I attended Ophelia DeVore School in, I think it was 1975.  And the reason that I came was because I, as an actress, I wanted to be totally poised when I accepted my Oscar as a movie star.  I had a friend who was a very lovely, charming person, Shirley Williams [ph.].  And I was--she said that she had attended Ophelia DeVore.  So I wanted to be like her and I, I came to the school.  I said, okay, I gotta go to Ophelia DeVore.  Ms. DeVore asked me to write a play about her, and I've written a play called 'Star Maker in the City of Dreams.'  And the reason for that is because there're so many stars, so many people in so many different industries that are at the top of their game because they came through this school.  One day I met a lady who--she claimed she was seventy-two.  She looked like she was maybe fifty.  And she said, "I went to Ophelia DeVore School," and she said that every time she tells someone that she was seventy-two, they would say, "Aw, get outta here," (laughter) you know, that's not true.  When I first came to the school, I was told that when we come through the school, we're going to get older.  But we would learn how to retard the aging process.  So that's what I have done (laughter) through the years, but Ms. DeVore means to me, she has blazed so many trails.  Ms. DeVore came into being a model during the time when black women weren't accepted, black people were not seen on--in the movies or we were not seen on television.  That was before television though.  We were not seen in magazines, but she came along, and she decided that that had to change.  And because of all the things that she did, it did change.  She's a pioneer.  Because of her, I'm sitting here now.  Because of her, I've been in magazines.  Because of her, I've been on television.  Because of her, I've been in movies.  All of this I have to say because of Ms. DeVore.  In writing the play about her life, Steve Carter from the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC], he was my playwriting teacher, he told me to start in the 19--in 1959 when Cecelia Cooper became Miss Cannes Film Festival [Cannes, France].  This was the first time a black woman had ever won a title over white women.  That's what it--that's how it was put.  And this opened the door for all of the other people because at that time, we were not allowed to compete in Miss America.  So Ms. DeVore, in her wisdom, decided to go to Europe.  We can't compete here.  That's the way she thinks.  She will find a way, Ms. DeVore will find a way to do whatever she does.  So, therefore, the play opens with that scene, with Cecelia Cooper becoming Miss Cannes Film Festival, and that was earthshaking at that time.
Speaker 2: So we have about ten seconds left, and I want you to just give me one phrase that stands out for you that Ms. DeVore says to you that means something?
Speaker 1: "Keep on keeping on."  You never stop and you never give up, and that's what I learned from her and her daughter [Carol Carter Gertjegerdes], her daughter who is in charge of Columbus Times newspaper which Ms. DeVore owns, I learned from them, just keep on keeping on.
Story_ID: 106670
Speaker 1: Okay, I am Camille Petty.  That's C-A-M-I-L-L-E, capital P-E-T-T-Y.  I am a nurse.  I work for the Health and Hospital Corporation.  I'm one of the city nurses.  And I've worked at Bellevue Hospital for fifty years.  I came to the Ophelia DeVore School right after I graduated from nursing school.  One of my classmates and I, her mother was a hairdresser, and she said if we wanted to be cute, we should go to the cute school.  So that's why we came.  We, we went to 125th Street 'cause that's where the school was.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: This was 1959.  Prior to that, when I would go up to 125th Street with my mother 'cause we lived in Harlem [New York City, New York], I could look up in a window and see the ladies walking back and forth.  And I was always fascinated by that.  But I was always fascinated by fashion also.  My mother taught me how to sew, and I was designing and making my own clothes when I was eight years old.  So combining the fashion and the modeling--never wanted to be a model, always wanted to be a nurse.  Ms. DeVore says that she's always trained people, either to be a professional model or a model person.  And that's where it was with me and my, my classmate.
Speaker 2: Well, when she--when I spoke with her off-camera, she spoke that you were launching a new program at the school.  If you can briefly tell me about the new program,--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --we'll end up with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ms. DeVore's having experience now in hospitals.  For a long time, she, she was ill.  And so she, she's had an opportunity to see nurses and doctors and nursing staff and to see what's really going on in the hospitals.  And because I've worked so closely with her all these years, she asks me a lot of questions about all of these professionals.  And I let her know that there's a big nursing shortage.  It's going to get bigger.  Our population is getting older.  They're getting more infirm because they're getting older.  And there's gonna have to be more nurses because hospitals are set up for nursing care, not to see the doctor 'cause you can see the doctor in an office.  It's the nurses who are there around the clock.  So being the visionary she is, and she's futuristic in her thinking, she said, well, somehow or the other, we have to work on the image of nurses, and let people know how important it is to be a nurse because right now, most of the nurses, their median age is forty-seven.  They'll be retiring soon.  And the teachers who teach nurses, their median age is forty-five, and they won't be there to teach new nurses.
Speaker 2: So what will the role of the school be?
Speaker 1: So Ms. DeVore felt that we could begin to learn more about nurses and feature nurses so that the image rises to where it really should be.  Most people who come to a hospital, when they leave, they thank the doctor, but they don't usually thank the nurse.  So nurses are kind of invisible.  And I--part of that is something I think that we've done for ourselves.  We've kind of been invisible, but we're the first line of defense between the hospital and the patient.
Speaker 2: So in closing, what would you like to say Ms. DeVore?
Speaker 1: Well, Ms. DeVore, I've been working with you for so many years, and there isn't anything or anytime that something doesn't come up that I learn something new from you.  You're futuristic in your thinking.  You're a visionary, and I say that over and over again, and thank you so much for having this school for all of us.  The world sorely needs it.
Story_ID: 106671
Speaker 1: Thank you for coming today.  If you will just introduce yourself, and we will have the same conversation we've been having.
Speaker 2: Okay, my name is Dell Pinckney, D-E-L-L, capital P-I-N-C-K-N-E-Y.  And I was one of Ms. [Ophelia] DeVore's first students and when she first started, and she got the idea to have a charm school.  And it was fun because then we used to like go to school, day--for five days a week, and then on Saturday mornings, it was great fun to meet different people.  We had all-day classes so not like now.  We went from eight o'clock in the morning to three in the afternoon with a lunch break, quite naturally.  And it was fun because you met people that was different from the ones in school.  We did all kinds of shows which was something that you could show off yourself.  And (laughter) they thought I did very well in walking, so I was always asked to do some walking.  And Ms. DeVore had these different organizations to, we was like showcase which mean we was a hostess.  And we all, we dressed in the same color outfits.  And we would host, we hosted the people, seating them down at different places and getting to meet them.  And that was fun because you got to meet quite a few celebrities doing that.  We graduated, and I did a dance at graduation class because I was taking dancing at the time.
Speaker 1: What year did this take place?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six [1946].  And it was really an opening up because we were curious about what to do and what not to do and how to act and all that, and you got all that in your classes, as I said we went everyday, from eight o'clock in the morning until three in the afternoon.  So we really got a chance to really put forth what was taught.  And it was done, we did it for, from September on to August, believe it or not (laughter).  But as I said, it gave us something to do on Saturdays.  So we did that.
Speaker 1: And then you came back and taught at the school for how long?
Speaker 2: Oh, how long?  Well, I went to Europe, and I came back from Europe and my instructor, which was one of Ms. [Katherine] Dunham's teachers, and so it was about, I just finished really about, in 2000, up until 2000 I was teaching.  I came back in say about '57 [1957], and then I taught.  I taught fencing and I taught exercises.  So that's what I taught.  And--
Speaker 1: And in closing, what would you like to say about the school and about Ms. DeVore?
Speaker 2: Well, Ms. DeVore has been an inspiration for lots of people.  And the students, I've seen a lot of improvement, I've seen a lot of improvement as far as, black women being able to carry themselves and to be able to express themselves without feeling that they weren't insecure.  And I think it's a good thing because we need that, especially now with the races coming on now.  The young ladies now don't know anything but just to wear pants.  And actually, I--they should get into the habit of being able to wear other outfits that would enhance their beauty and make them just as good and as elegant.  We, (unclear) unfortunate--we had the movie actresses to copy after.  I don't think the actresses of today really carry themselves in a way wherein I think the young ladies should imitate them.  But wherein we did.  We thought that was elegant and classy (laughter).  So I think after being here all this time teaching and seeing the young people and how they develop, how they were developed, I should say, now, we should, Ms. DeVore should continue her school so that she'll be able to instruct and enhance the young ladies that's coming along.  Okay.
Story_ID: 106672
Speaker 1: Okay, we're rolling.  We're talking about the 1950s and roughly, late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you go to France with the Cannes Film Festival.
Speaker 2: All right, how she [Cecelia Cooper] got--how she got there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, how did you get there, how did you get to Paris and to this festival?  Well, how did you get to Cannes to this festival?
Speaker 2: Okay, what happened is that we always put on affairs to raise funds.  We're raising funds for everybody.  You know, when I say everybody, like NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Urban League, United Negro College Fund and so forth.  And, and one of the programs we sponsored would be the Miss Empire State contest.  And the one that won the, wins the contest, goes to Paris [Frances] and goes to Cannes, France.  Now, at Cannes, at that time, that was the largest--what they call it, festival--
Speaker 1: Film festival.
Speaker 2: --in the--film festival in the country, you know.  Not black, white, the largest one.  And America had never won anything at all.  So her gift was, Cecelia Cooper won the Miss Empire State.  Adam Clayton Powell, Reverend Adam Clayton Powell crowned her.  So we were off to Paris.  And, and then we were in Paris for a few days, and then we went on to Cannes, where, where, you know, you're in Paris, you know, while they're in Paris, do a few things, you know, just look around and know you were there and say you were there, go to the Lido or some of the places.  And then you went off to Cannes.  Now, I think I told you early on I didn't have an appointment with the director, but, you know, I got nerve, you know.  You know, I have to achieve goals, you know.  I had my plan.  I had to achieve goals, but to be creative, like you have to be creative, you know, how it is, don't you?  Yes.  So then I said, well, I've got to get exposure while we're over here so, Camille--so Cecelia can get the exposure she deserves.  And so I went to the director guy, called him on the phone, got in, and an hour I was in his, in his office.  And he gave me carte blanche.  I could just do just about anything we wanted to do at the festival.  When I say that, we could go to all the showings.  They had all the, you know, all the movies and what not.
Speaker 1: But her winning the festival, she was the first person of color to win this, to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She was the first--
Speaker 1: --to be the queen of this, of the--
Speaker 2: The first--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --international festival.
Speaker 2: That's exactly, first person of color to become the Queen of the International Film Festival in Cannes, France and the first person, the first anything won by America, anything won by America.
Speaker 1: Now, all the starlets, all the stars were over there.  All the stars were over there.  And a matter of fact, Sophia Loren was over there, Carlo Ponti had her over there.  He was just beginning her.  So he asked her, can she take a picture with your, with your winner?  So Cecelia had a picture taken with Sophia Loren 'cause he, Carlo Ponti, you know, was a, was her manager.  And so she went--we made history all over the world.  Now, let me tell you something about Cecelia.  Cecelia didn't--she was a dancer.  She danced and modeled, you know, but locally.  And she didn't have a whole lot of talent as a dancer, but, you know, she was adequate.  Now, what happened, the child's greatest talent was taking direction, and you know how it is when you're producing or directing something, you give directions and they forget it and don't do it.  You'd give that young lady direction, and she'd take it and run with it.  So the day of the festival, all the starlets throughout the world, including Miss Paris, was in the, you know, in the contest.   So poor Cecelia, she was so nervous.  Now, I bought her a bikini and she'd never worn a bikini.  Bikini was just getting popular in those days, you know.  Only bad girls wore bikinis.  So I bought her a little bikini, but she had a great shape.  So it was not, it was not a problem.  So I dressed her.  And I put a rose in her hair.  She was too nervous to even dress herself.  I had to physically dress this child, then took her to the, to the contest.  And I--oh, I taught her a few phrases in French too, a few things to say.  You know she got up there and she remembered those things, and she repeated those, and when you're in France, if you can speak French and most of the world will speak--business people there either speak English and French.  Most of the time, they speak English and French.  Cecelia was so popular.  And she did smile and she had personality, and like you wouldn't believe, she walked away with the contest, walked away with the contest.  They had one, only one judge from America, and he said he couldn't believe that an American black contest winner could win the famed Cannes Film Festival, amazing.  In all the world, we made history all over the world.  Now, once the history was made all over the world, and they accepted Cecelia [Cooper] as the image for all the world, when we came back to America, all the clients wanted her because she was, she had already broken that negative image, you see.  And that's when the image, positive image of people of color became international.  See, before that, we were working on the national basis.  And, of course, we were working in the Caribbean Islands, and, you know, and the more local areas.  And so she made history all over the world.
Story_ID: 106673
Speaker 1: And then I did it the second time, won.  But the second time I went, I not only--I, you know, I can't do things over and over again because once you've achieved something, you put somebody else to follow through on it, you know.  So, and, so this time I said, well, let me see what I can do.  So Johnson & Johnson, they had just come out with, I think it was Tampax [sic, Modess].  I forget the name of the product, but, you know, before that time, it was Modess, but then you had the Tampax.  It was a new approach.  And they wanted a larger share of the marketplace, and they didn't know what to do.  And so they had, we had to come up with an idea of making, and making the menstrual period so wonderful that everybody would buy into it, see.  So what we did, we got, got one of my top models.  And those days, they were saying, oh, now, if you're not cafe au lait or light, you're not, 'cause they--you won't get the job.  You know what color she [Helen Williams] was?  Your color, was great.  She was beautiful.  I mean she was, your color was beautiful and she was tall, and she was stately and she was just fantastic, took her over.  Now, in Paris, while we--you know, when I'm in Paris [France], I give them a few little things.  But I only took her over to do a film for Johnson & Johnson, and I suggested they do a film called 'Helen in Paris' and which they did.  And we had to film in the fashion houses.  So we filmed in Christian Dior.  It was the first time he ever let anybody film in his showroom, you see.  Now, when Helen walked in, he embraced her.  He embraced her.  She said she felt like a million dollars.  And you know how those French couturiers are, you know, they're very stand-offish, you know.  They're nice, but they're very stand-offish.  He embraced her, and we photographed, we did the film for 'Helen in Paris.'  And, of course, when we came back, the campaign that Johnson & Johnson had set, made history.  You know, she went all over the country.  And I was in it as a consultant and director and whatnot, and then so what happened, they were able to garner a great deal of the marketplace for that new product and also change the image of the menstrual period as being something negative.  It became acceptable across the board.  And they made a lot of money.
Story_ID: 106674
Speaker 1: So after that, the 1960s, you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, LeJeune [Hundley] won the contest [Miss Cannes Festival 1960] too, by the way.
Speaker 1: The third time?
Speaker 2: The second time.
Speaker 1: The second time, okay.
Speaker 2: She won the contest.  The third time when the girl went back, I didn't go because I was some other place.  See, we, you know, I did a lot of things, you know, in different times.  And someone else went, but they said they wouldn't, they--she, she won the gifts, but they wouldn't let us bring the title back.  So I said, if I'm not gon'--we get the title, I'm not taking anybody else.  So that was the, that was the end of my stay.  But I had to change my goal.
Speaker 1: And your goal had been to?
Speaker 2: Change, to make the image of American people, black Americans, accepted all over the world in a positive way.  And industry bought into it.
Story_ID: 106675
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], you married Vernon Mitchell.
Speaker 2: Well, you want to talk about something before 1968?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, you know, it's 1961, 'cause I went to Nigeria.
Speaker 1: That was--I have that as in '69 [1969], but--
Speaker 2: Oh, I did.  It was in '69 [1969].  Okay, well, maybe (unclear).  Well, okay, 1968, now how did I meet him?  All right, I met him because he was the newspaper publisher [of Columbus Times].  But before that, he was professor at Talladega College in [Talladega] Alabama.  And, but then what happened is that he used to teach at one of the high schools.  And he was trying to get the teachers together to get, oh, gosh, I forget what it was, but anyway, the teachers didn't cooperate.  And they was giving the money that was allocated for the school system, they were giving it to the white schools and not giving it to the black schools.  So, he made a big, you know, he, he had a news--he set up a newspaper and made an issue out of it, took an issue of that.  So what they do, they, they fired him in the school system in Columbus [Georgia], which was the high school.  Then he went and, and got, became a professor at Talladega.  And then he had the newspapers, and he really laid into the--he laid into the politicians down there.  He called 'em all kinds of names, had all kinds of illustrations, you know, funnies and what not, you know, like the comedians, how they take you on.  Well, he had (unclear) illustrated and, oh, had the, had all the judges and all the big-time politicians in very, I wanna say, unattractive ways.  So they wanted to get rid of him.  So, anyway, as I said, it's (unclear).  So we had, I met him because I was the marketing consultant for the, for my, for the companies, for--well, Johnson & Johnson, their subsidiaries and also the Schering[-Plough] Corporation.  The Schering Corporation have lots of subsidiaries.
Story_ID: 106676
Speaker 1: Matter of fact, at one time, three of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, three of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, two of them were my clients, you know.  And well, Schering had, Schering was the other, one of my other pharmaceutical firms.  And they wanted a larger share, and they had products too.  They felt that they could, we could have people of color to carry--as the, as the message carriers.  And so I told 'em, so we--that's when, I said, okay, well, we'll do that.  So I showed them how to do television, how to bring blacks into television in a modeling way and as a communicator.  Now, you remember I told you I had to get experience with Ralph Cooper a long time ago?  You know, see, all that stuff you learn and get experience, comes in handy.  So when I was their marketing consultant, I told, okay, let's go on TV.  Bring the models in TV, the people of color.  And they did, and they made a fortune.  They made a fortune, and they loved me, and, and that's how we got in TV.  They made TV commercials, and some of the commercials were across the board.  They didn't just go into white--black publications.  They went into white publication and other publications too.  But if you made it in a way that it was acceptable by the majority population, they weren't offended.  They weren't offended.  So you had to present your company's message so it doesn't offend anybody, you know.  And you communicate with them, and they wanted to, you know, buy into it.  And that's what I did.
Story_ID: 106677
Speaker 1: But as long as we're talking about TV, before we talk about after that, this is a good time to talk about [HM] Diahann Carroll because she made the move into television--
Speaker 2: Early on.
Speaker 1: --early on and became one of the first African Americans to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Well, she was on TV in a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: 'Julia.'
Speaker 2: --from a acting standpoint of view.  Now, the ones that I did with the other companies were commercials.  See, that's, so that's when that commercial opened up.  Diahann was the first one in TV with--what was the name of that?  I forget the name--
Speaker 1: It's called 'Julia.'
Speaker 2: 'Julia,' yes, in 'Julia.'  But Diahann was one that anything you taught her, she would develop it, she would learn it well, develop it and move forward in it.  So anything that came up, Diahann would say--they'd say, "Can you do this?"  She'd, "Oh, sure."  They might--they never asked her whether she'd done it before, you know.  And, and then Lou, she had Lou Walters behind her and he got her a good manager and all these things count, you know, 'cause he saw in her something that was very special.  So, and then he got her a good manager.  So that's how they, you know, got into 'Julia,' and they convinced, at that time, they convinced the advertisers, "Hey, this market for models of color to carry your message is opened.  You don't have to be afraid of them throwing the product out in the street."  You see, before that time, they used entertainers.  They already had a, their image was already presold 'cause they would use entertainers.  And what happened is they're--a lot of the cigarette companies used them.  They put them on the, the containers, put them in the, in the vending machines, and the people would throw the machines, the vending machines out in the street because they didn't want to see blacks in the cigarettes.  That was preceding what I had done.  Now, you'd have a name person who is, don't have--who doesn't have a presold image or presold name.  And they weren't throwing them out because I showed them how to do it so no one would be offended.  But we could also buy into it, you see.  I made it so blacks didn't feel alienated.  They felt a part of it.  Whites could feel a part of it, and that's how, that's how we presented our message.  And everybody felt, let's buy the product.  It feels good.  And they made money, and that, that's really what it amounts to.
Story_ID: 106678
Speaker 1: Now, as a marketing consultant, going to the advertising conventions, that's where I met my second husband [Vernon Mitchell], you know, 'cause he had the newspaper [The Columbus Times], and he was there.  And I didn't like him in the beginning 'cause he was very aggressive, and, you know, and he would challenge me.  I said to myself, he has some kind of nerve.  And he, he didn't give up.  He didn't give up.  So he finally, we finally got together, and I guess we knew each other for a long time because he was coming to the conventions.  But, and then--
Speaker 2: Did he go to Africa with you?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, before he died, then--then that's right, I went to Africa--
Story_ID: 106679
Speaker 1: Then I went to Africa, Nigeria.
Speaker 2: Nigeria, when there was a war going on at the time.
Speaker 1: Biafran War [Nigerian Civil War], that's right, during the Biafran War one of the most, I'd say one of the worst wars in the world, in that they, you know, it has a terrible history.  That was when the--what was happening in Africa that, the Yorubas and the Igbos.  The Igbos were the people that were--the tribe that was trained by the French in the commerce, and they had the business jobs and so forth, and, and the leadership in the business field.  But the Yorubas were the, were the warriors.  They could fight, see.  Now, what was happening in order to start this war is that--and they had me come over, by the way, as an investigative reporter to get the story right because they said the press was misrepresenting them, the Western press was.  So France was influencing the Igbos who were trained by the French.  That was a, you know, the other tribe, in the Northern part of Nigeria, to take over the oil industry, which was--it's called the oil industry--oh, gosh.  What's the name of it--and they're supposed to have the sweetest oil in the world.  Oh, I--it'll come to me as I go along.  So that's why the war started, the Igbos were trying to take over the oil part of Nigeria for France.  And, and since the Yorubas were the warriors, but they didn't have the education or the training, but they were the fighters.  So they won the war.  And that's, that's why it happened, and, and so much other stuff that was being printed in the Western press was not true.
Story_ID: 106680
Speaker 1: And what was your job then?
Speaker 2: I was to do the investigation and to, we wanna know what it's about and, and write stories, if I could.  But in the meantime, I took one of my proteges with me.  Everywhere I go, I take someone with me to travel.  And they treated us like a queen.  They, they flew me all over Nigeria, all over Nigeria and Jos and all over the place.  And, and I, I had, you know, it was a wonderful experience, went to Ibadan, the education center of Nigeria, you know, and wonderful experience.  Now, I don't say anybody should go there, but, you know, when I went there, I went there as a special person.  I was financed by Nigeria, but also when I got there, the first--when I got off the plane, the American Embassy was waiting for me.  So they gave me a party right away, you know, a press conference right away so they'll know, you know, that, you know, take care of this lady.  But, you know, it, it--that wasn't the only thing.  Nigeria had me over there for a special reason.  When they showed us--they rolled out the red carpet for us.
Story_ID: 106681
Speaker 1: So, in the early '70s [1970s], like in 1974, you took on the advertising industry for not having enough blacks in the industry itself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a, yeah, that was the thing, that the Advertising Club of New York.  I was a part of that and we did picket them, but that wasn't the one that I was a part--that's the Advertising Club of New York.  We worked together.  I was the--NAMD, was the National Association of Market Developers.  I was the president of that for a period of time.  You know, we, you know, you change presidents and what not.  And I was the first woman president because I, I was the first woman in that kind of business, I think, for the first time, doing the things I was doing.  And, but we did, we did picket the advertising business.  We would picket anything.
Speaker 1: But you sat outside with a--you stood out front with a sign that read, "Inked Out By Racism"
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  Okay, well, that was another, that was another occasion.  What happened is that when the advertise--when they found out that buying into the Negro market or the African American market, you could make a lot of money, industry then had demands for black models, see.  And that's when the men became very important in the modeling business.  And right now, the modeling business for men is about 40 percent, 40 to 60.  At that time, it was nothing.  All right, so what happened, Life [Magazine] decided to do a story.  And they did a story, and they, and I'll get--I'll just give you a little history there.  When I started out, there were three of us, was directing our efforts towards the black model.  And there was Branford [Models], Sepia [Arts Modeling Agency] and myself.  There were three of us.  Now, each one had a different direction.  Each one focused in a different direction.  We were competitors, but we were not really competitors 'cause each was doing it a different way.  But they didn't sustain because the money wasn't there, and lucky for me, I didn't, you know, I guess I sustained.  And, but what happened, they interviewed--I bring that up because they interviewed me and Branford, all the people who had developed the marketplace for models like that, black models.  And then what did they do?  They gave this white business, that just started a month or two ago, all the credit, all the credit.  And they had me in there, one quote, and the quote was, I told 'em about the time I went to see this fashion house on Broadway, when I told him I was using black models, I said, "He went in the, went back in his office like a doodle."  A doodle is a bug that goes, you know--I don't know whether you're familiar with that or not, a bug goes in the hole or--so, and that's what they put in there to make me look ridiculous.  So I said, so I had to make a statement.  I had to let 'em know.  You might have more money, and, you know, you have the money and the market, but you don't, but you can't step on me 'cause I'll, I'll take you on.  So I sued them.  Boy, they were saying they're gonna put you out of business.  I said, okay, I picketed them, and not only that, I called the, I called a press conference in their building.  They said, you can't do this.  I said, watch me.  And I called a press conference in their building.  I sued them to make a statement because at that time, they were not paying anybody for misrepresenting news.  I forget the name of the, the man that, a big-time writer.  I forget his name, was the first one about a few years after that had ever won anything for, you know, for suing for that, for that purpose.  But I did to make a statement.  And I made the statement.  And I made the statement, and I let them know.  And, and consequently, you know what, Shawn?  People don't mess with me.  I don't mess with them, and they don't mess with me. I treat people very well, and they treat me very well (laughter), you know.  And, and that's why I have, I've done the things that I've done.  I've been as successful as I have because people have been very good to me.  I love people, and people, basically love me.  And we get along very well.  And, and because people have supported me, I was able to do these things.
Story_ID: 106682
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like, and I'm jumping ahead a little bit, just out of curiosity though, but what was your relationship like with Eileen Ford?  Or did you have one?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't, and no--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Like, did you even know her?  Did she know you?  Did your paths cross?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't even remember whether I met her or not, but I knew, I knew her, I think I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You knew of her?
Speaker 2: I knew, I think I talked to her a couple of times on the phone.  But she had a different agenda.  At that time, they didn't use black models.
Speaker 1: Right, at all.
Speaker 2: No, no.  [Cough, excuse me].  Because I remember [HM] Audrey Smaltz went in different agencies just to test it.  They [Ford Modeling Agency] said, we don't use black models, and it was years later.  When I opened up the market and clients would use them, then the ad, then the model agency took them on.  But, see, a lot of the models were just as prejudiced as some of these people out here.  They didn't want them.  Just like when Lulu was on 'The Jackie Gleason Show,' the, the staff, I mean the actors in there, they were real nasty to her because, you don't want blacks with them.  This was years ago.  And so the models would be, you know, and not, you know, there were ex--I mean some of them, I mean as the majority, they didn't want blacks in there either as if something was wrong.
Story_ID: 106683
Speaker 1: Well, 1974, the first black model appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I don't know--when was that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 2: Oh, 1974, who was that, Smith [sic, Beverly Johnson]?
Speaker 1: And I couldn't find her name.  I just found that it was the first black model appearing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I have it, and a matter of fact, I have the whole story.  It's written up in Life magazine.  And that's the one we sued about.  That's the occasion where we sued, okay.  I have the whole story in the Life magazine.  What was her name?  Oh, I forget what it is, but if you call me, I'll give it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Give you (unclear).  But she was, she wasn't the first [sic, Donyale Luna], but see, what industry does or what, what our country will do in (unclear) in industry, if a white person has, is competition to you, they'll give the job to a white person first, you understand?  And if they can't get a white person, they'll give it to you, if you're black, see.  It's that, that brotherhood kind of thing.  And it's changed a little bit, but it still plays that same way.  It still plays that same way.  So what happened, they got a hold of one black person and Life magazine did that story, see.  And they were all working together.  They probably had never gotten anybody else a job or anything, but they got it together, particularly for that story because that company called Black Beauty, that was the agency, they were just starting.  So they needed a big story, so they got together on the story, you help me, and I'll help you, and this is the way we go.  And that's how that came about.  Now, if somebody wants to sue me, fine, you know, because I'm telling the story the way it is.  And matter of fact, I, I should have sued the writer, but I didn't.  I sued Life magazine because I made the statement and that's what I want (unclear)--
Story_ID: 106684
Speaker 1: We, you were finishing up on the lawsuit--whom you should have sued.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: But we, we'll move forward 'cause you covered that pretty good--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we just about, yeah, exhausted that.
Speaker 1: And I wanted you to speak some of the students that have come through the [Ophelia DeVore School]--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --what they were like, what affect they had on you, what affect the school had on them, and what affect they had on the school?  Cicely Tyson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cicely, Cicely basically was an actress.  So she, when she came to us, she came basically to help, as well as to gain, get from us what we knew and she can give what she knew.  So she also came as a teacher and as a model, see.  So that's what she did.  And she, she worked with a lot of the students as Bea Richards did, who is also, is an actress.  And Cicely was, she was very young when she came to us and was a top actress and a very good teacher and a very good model. So, and there (unclear).
Speaker 1: Susan Taylor?
Speaker 2: Ah, (laughter) [HM] Susan Taylor, the old story.  She said, when I was out of a job I came by Grace Del Marco, Ophelia DeVore, and they gave me a job (laughter).  Susan is a sweetheart.  Susan, oh, gosh, Susan worked with us.  She was also a model, primarily.  Now, she wasn't an actress primarily, the way Cicely was.  She was primarily a model, and she also taught for us too.  See, what happened, when somebody came in very good and after they were groomed and had a certain amount of exposure, then we would ask them to be teachers.  And they would start with the new class or start with the little, little people's classes, you see.  And this way, they'd get the experience. But that's where--but all of the people that you, like Cicely, [HM] Diahann [Carroll], Cicely, Susan, beautiful people, wonderful people.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of the men.  Gil Noble.
Speaker 2: Oh, Gil, yeah.  Gil was always the nice kind of a guy, always nice.  You could sit down and talk to Gil and feel like you're talking to your best friend, you know.  That's the kind of guy he was.
Speaker 1: Richard Roundtree?
Speaker 2: Richard, Richard was a go-getter.  Richard was a go-getter, you know.  Nothing stopped Richard, you know.  He was always there for a challenge.  And you, when you got a challenge, talk, talk to Richard about it.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They were all models.
Speaker 1: They were all--so Richard was a model as well?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Richard was a model too.  They all started out as models, even though they had a background of acting.  They started as models because there were not enough jobs for actors.  There were only very few actors were getting jobs at that time, so they modeled in the beginning, and--
Speaker 1: So during the '70s [1970s] when--and I don't know any other way to say it, but Blaxploitation films, when that era came about and Richard [Roundtree], you know, 'Shaft' and 'Dolemite'  and all those films, did you, how did you feel about that being the image portrayed of black people like 'Super Fly' and 'Dolemite' and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, it, it didn't affect the advertisers or us as models very much.  It only, it affected the industry of, the entertainment industry.  And when, when the people started rapping and everything, that influenced the industry, but it, somehow it never influenced us from a modeling standpoint of view or from an image standpoint of view, except--not as far as the clients are concerned.  Let me put it that way.  The clients did not, was not affected by that kind of trend.  And when Richard was, the interesting thing about it, when Richard was in "Shaft" and what not, and, you know, [HM] Gordon Parks was the director of "Shaft" and so forth, and Gordon just died.  So, you know, and the interesting thing about it, they would still use him, even though he was in the "Shaft" for a commercial, and they, people did not connect the two.  And as a matter of fact, they, somehow the whites just ignored it and the blacks ignored it, and then they accepted Richard for what he was.  It didn't in--it didn't affect him at all.  One interesting thing about Gil Noble, Gil did fashions as well as commercials and whatnot in the modeling field.  He's that kind of a guy, you know.  So different people have different strokes for different folks.
Speaker 1: So speaking Gil Noble also went on to become a journalist--
Speaker 2: A newscaster.
Speaker 1: Yes, newscaster (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes, indeedy.  He's been on there for years.  It's still on A--ABC, isn't it?
Speaker 1: 'Like It Is.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Like It Is' still on ABC--
Story_ID: 106685
Speaker 1: And, you know, Ralph Cooper and I were on ABC in the 1950s, early on.  Interesting thing about it, ABC was one of the first networks to open up to blacks.  Melba Tolliver was first, one of the first females.  Now, Melba got into, into that industry because she wanted--she was a model, and one of my clients, Pharmaco, was casting for, for commercials.  You know, I had broken that market down.  And Melba didn't get the job.  So she was so disappointed.  I said, well, Melba, come in.  We'll teach you how to make-up, and then I'll put you in as the make-up artist for this client.  So that's what--so she went in as the make-up artist for this client.  So while she was getting involved with them, they got her a job as the first newscaster, black newscaster on ABC, and she went in making $125,000 a year, and that was, you know, in those days, if you made, if you made $50,000 a year, you were doing good.  That's right.  And that's how she got in, but see some--if you're prepared, you get your foot in the door, then you take that challenge on 'cause you got the experience and the knowledge, see.
Story_ID: 106686
Speaker 1: And that's what we're doing now with our new thrust, you know.  We're gonna--not upgrade the image of the nurses.  Nurses already know their job, what they're doing, but it's--you know, when you think about nurses, you don't think of the things that they're doing.  They're almost doctors, you know.  I mean your doctors are not there.  Your doctors come in once, once a day.  And the nurses are there all the time.  And that's why I'm so excited about this new thrust, you know, to make sure people know what nurses are about and what they're doing.  So whom do I go out and get, my, my top alumni, representative, Camille Petty who is well, well respected in the industry.  I mean she's head of the union and state-wide union for the nurses.  She's head of this, travel all over.  So--and she has the knowledge, she has the academic background.  She has the experience.  She knows the industry of modeling and communication.  She can write.  She's just, and I promised my doctors I'd do something about health education, and here I am, and you're getting the scoop (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So what are you planning to do?
Speaker 1: Well, the first thing we're going to do is, we haven't, we haven't put our plans in.  I'm going to meet with Camille, and then we're going to call another alumni.  You might have talked to her, Olivette [Taylor] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Or even just conceptually, what is your concept?
Speaker 1: Oh, conceptive, we're gonna follow the same plan we did with the modeling.  We're going to put on different kind of programs when they call up for--we're going to train them to be communicators in reference to not only the health field, but also when they make their appearance, how to walk into a room, how to sit, how to stand.  People say, ooh, wow, I want to be a nurse, you understand, because just like what happened to Lou Walters when [HM] Diahann [Carroll] tried to get that job, and Lou Walters said, "Look, I'm gonna take you on since you're so anxious to get this job.  I'll get a good manager so you can go into show business."  That's the same thing.  If you're a nurse or you're in another business, and walked in and you sit right, and you stand right, and you speak right, and you're not afraid.  You've got the confidence, and you don't let anybody defy your image, you have already defined it.  Now, you accept me.  And what happens, they're gonna, hey, this nursing business is something that I wanna do.  I wanna join the nursing industry.  See, we have a shortage of nurses now, you see.  And I can't complain because nurses were very good to me, but there's a shortage of nurses.  And it's a good job, and it's--and then you give back when you're there.  You take care of grouchy people (laughter) who, and you make them feel good, you know.  So, and as I said, and, you know, when I was thinking about someone in the alumni to head this, I didn't have to look very far because as I said, Camille was our president for about twenty years and, and traveling all over with all these alumni members and tours and everything.  She--I have never seen her be grouchy, negative or not follow through.  I said, you--and she was like, made to order, made to order (laughter).
Story_ID: 106687
Speaker 1: So, just as I'm seeing you and talking to you, I mean I'm thinking about other women that reminds me of you that are beautiful, elegant women, and I want, just wanna have you comment on some of them.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Or you've--if they're, if you've crossed paths, someone like Lena Horne.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lena, very nice lady, very, very nice lady.  Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that when [HM] Diahann [Carroll], her, her ideal was Lena Horne, you know.  Lena, very, very nice, yeah, very nice lady.
Speaker 1: [HM] Eartha Kitt, did you meet her in Paris [France] when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't meet her in Paris, but one of the, one of the alumni members you talked to, Dell Pinckney, Dell Pinckney danced all over the world with, with--what was the name?
Speaker 1: Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: Eartha Kitt, yeah, with Eartha Kitt, yeah.  No, I didn't meet her.
Speaker 1: So when you were starting your school, I mean, and you were--it was, you set it up as a charm school.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Were you inspired by Edith Post or Emily Post the--who was doing that for the rest of the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, not really because I didn't identify with Emily Post, you know.  As far as I was concerned as a young person, Emily Post was like old hat or something, and then my mother [Mary Strother-DeVore] had such excellent etiquette, and, you know, she just taught us, you know, the best behavior that we could find.  So we really didn't need anybody else as far as we were concerned.  So I didn't--and, and the things that we were doing that would be acceptable in the industry to represent the best in society, I got it from the, when I started modeling with the Vogue School of Modeling [New York City, New York].  And see, in those days that I went to Vogue School of Modeling, in the 1940s, you had the best teachers, and they would make sure you knew everything, and you did it very well.
Speaker 1: Can you remember some of the teachers' names?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 106688
Speaker 1: And you know, having just come out of the hospital, I tell you I can't remember, I can't even remember my own name right now.  I hate to say it but my memory is very short right now.  I was wondering if I would remember the words when you asked me a question, if I'd be able to answer you.
Speaker 2: Well, you've done great today.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  I didn't know whether I'd remember the words.  I was telling Camille [Petty] when I talked to her the other day, I said, "Camille, when I'm, if I forget the word, would you, would you say the word so I'll remember it because, because that's what happened, you know, sometime when you're on these medications, you lose your memory for a period of time.  I might lose mine forever.  I don't know.  But anyway, I got enough to keep 'em going.
Speaker 2: You're doing great today.  So when you look back over your career as a businesswoman, all you've done, what stands out most for you?
Speaker 1: What's what?
Speaker 2: What stands out most for you?
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, it, you know--and I don't mean for anybody and I should in a parallel, my children are the most--I'm more proud of them than anything else, and, of course, and then the, the organization, the business organization, the school, the charm, the alumni members, but my children--I have five children.  They were all born in New York City.  They were all reared in New York City.  We traveled, and I've been traveling all of my life.  And I have never had a problem of my children, you know.  They're all wonderful children.  I had, and I have nine grandchildren.  I have twelve great grandchildren, and we're all very close, and they all love everybody.  And we're all very, very close, and I have--I am just so proud of my children, and they fill in.  One directs the business here in New York, Jim Carter [James Carter], and Carol [Carter Gertjegerdes], my daughter, she runs the business in Columbus, Georgia, the newspaper business [The Columbus Times].
Story_ID: 106689
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't talk much about the newspaper business.  Who--your, one of your husbands originally owned it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the second husband [Vernon Mitchell].
Speaker 1: Second husband owned it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I only had two now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, two, okay.
Speaker 2: That's all right.  When I get up to talk, I said, everybody deserves a mate.  I say I've had two.  I must have had somebody else's, huh?  (Laughter) Yeah, but, no, I've had two.  The second one, he had the newspaper when I married him.  And, but he bought it from somebody else.  It's eighty-three years old, but I've had it only for thirty-eight years.  So, and we only print positive news.  We don't, we're not a rag (laughter), yellow, you know, yellow journalism, I don't paint that.  I only paint the positive and the good things.  Consequently, we get most of the clients.  We're in Columbus, Georgia, and we get--the clients don't have any problem identifying with our newspaper.  They never have to be embarrassed.
Speaker 1: Now, is it a black newspaper or everybody's newspaper?
Speaker 2: We call it a minority newspaper, yeah, because, you know, in this industry, black Americans are not the only ones black (laughter).  And they might not know it, but they're not.  They're, you've got--you got all these others too that are black, and they are treated that way in the industry, commercially.  Now, socially they might be treated a different way, you know, if you show 'em the passport (laughter) like my, like my, my brother-in-law had to show his passport, and my sister go in--my sister's the one that's supposed to be black.  He's supposed to be white, but he couldn't get in unless he showed his passport, and she could get in on her looks.
Story_ID: 106690
Speaker 1: So, why do you feel history's important?
Speaker 2: History's important because if you know where you came from, you know where you can go and, you know, what the, what the direction should be and how to focus it and how, how to make the challenge less challenging.  And then also history will give you certain kind of confidence, you know, what to do and what not to do in order to change it, to better yourself and the move ahead, not only with yourself and your family, but also with your culture and with your country.  I just think history is so important to know where you came from and where you're going.  And anyone who doesn't like history is, is starting out very naive and, and I would hate to say it, but pretty dumb too if they don't get it along the way.
Story_ID: 106691
Speaker 1: So what are your hopes for people of color?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that, that's gonna--well, people, people of color--and we're going to have to come together as a country, and then as a culture.  And we're going to have to stick together, but we're also going to have to stick together, not only from a standpoint of racism, but from the standpoint of people-ism, you see.  I think as, as the world turns, racism is going to be old hat, and a lot of racism exists in various places because they haven't traveled, you understand.  And as you travel, you see where racism is politically, is a political gimmick in order to make what the person on top justify why he's suppressing somebody else, you understand?  So, that's, that's why the blacks were, when they were brought in as slaves, to justify having been oppressed by the majority population, they had to make us look crazy and make you look silly and what not.  See, that's the gimmick, but as you travel, you know character is very important.  And character doesn't have, character doesn't have color, it doesn't have a language.  It doesn't have anything except character is that you're people.  We were all made by one, one energy above, whatever the energy might be.  You can call him God, you can call him Allah, you can call him anything you want to, but we're from, we're all--when we were cut, we bleed, you understand.  And when you get blood, half the time, you don't know whether it coming black, blue, green, yellow, red, you see.  We all, we all are people, just different colors, like the lady who had twins, identical twins, the only difference was one was black and one was white, you know, from the same woman who was white.  See, so just, you know, it, it's mystery, and anyone who's prejudice, and will act that way toward people because of color, or culture, whatever, that means they are, you know, they're simpletons, and they are un--they're not well-traveled, and they're not knowledgeable, and they're not intellectuals and everybody wants to be an intellectual.  They gotta move up the ladder some (laughter).
Story_ID: 106692
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be that I love, I love life, I love the world.  I love people, and I want people, all people to be as wonderful as they can possibly be.  My aim always, when someone comes to me for development, I look, I don't--everybody has something good, everybody.  I look for the good.  I don't look for the bad 'cause the bad I'm gonna knock down.  I look for the good and build that up and give them confidence.  I want everybody--my greatest, my greatest enjoyment besides my children is to take someone and make them bigger than I am, you know, go as high as they can possibly go.  That's my, that's--oh, I get so much enjoyment out of that.  I can sit in the audience and somebody is performing doing something, and they're doing it good, and, you know, I just love it and love it and love it.  So that's my biggest enjoyment to see that, that everybody can reach the maximum in whatever it is that they do, so they'll be happy.  They won't have, when, you know, they won't have to use sleeping pills.  They don't have to use anything to feel good about themselves.  They know they're good.  They know they're respected.  They've helped somebody.  They have done stuff to--that's my greatest aim to see everybody go as high as they can possibly go.
Story_ID: 106693
Speaker 1: And the last question for today, is--
Speaker 2: Don't forget our alumni?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, and we'll, and then we'll bring your alumni in for the rest, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, all right, the last question.
Speaker 1: Last question is what do you wanna be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Ah, I wanna be remembered as a great mother and also a people person, and I love people, and I wanna see people rise as high as possible.  I also want the world to know that I don't look at people for color or for any kind, anything that would identify, except for character, you know.  And I want the world to be a better place.  That's what I'm hoping for, and that's what I pray for.  And I find that prayer works, praying works 'cause I had almost forgot to pray either at night when I go to bed or when I say my meal.  I had forgotten some of these things.  I was so busy, busy.  I'm a workaholic.  And I started praying like crazy when I was in the hospital the last time, and do you know it comes to pass.  I'm, really, I--I go to bed feeling bad, then when I wake up in the morning, oh, everything is cleared up.  So I want everybody, everybody to experience that kind of life.  And I've had wonderful children, wonderful friends.  What else can you ask for?  And I have wonderful success, and I want our history recorded.  Our history is going to be recorded, and this is part of our history.  I have four, top major universities, want my papers, and four of the top, major universities in the country want my papers.  So it's a matter of what the best, whatever the best deal is, is the one I'm going with.  And, you know, when I say the best deal, a lot of things include, you know, the best deal, like how many students do they have from all over the world, to look at your records and what not.  But see, I have records unbelievable, unbelievable.
Story_ID: 106694
Speaker 1: We will have your alumni join in so you can--
Speaker 2: Oh, good--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --think about that.
Speaker 2: Now, yeah, but they, that have been with me all of my life.  She [Camille Petty] came as a teenager, and she's going out as an adult, and I, when I step down, she steps in.  Yep, she's got to be--she's not only going to go with the alumni, now she's got to be the leader of the alumni.  And, but she's always been the leader with the alumni anyway.  You know, we have life members and also we have regular members.  And the life members are the ones that have the leadership ability, primarily.
Speaker 1: We gotta pause and bring her in.
Speaker 2: We're continuing to roll.  This is your opportunity to talk about the alumni--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and your role as president.
Speaker 1: Are we ready?
Speaker 2: We're rolling.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  This is the alumni organization of our firm.  It's very, very important.  We have thousands of alumni all over the world, and not just here in New York, in the Caribbean and Latin America, and all over the world, Africa, you name it, and we have them.  And we have a president who's been with--a president of the alumni over twenty years, and has traveled all over the world with the alumni members on tours and trips and what not, and we have never had a problem.  And when I look at some of these tours, the problems they are having.  You know why?  We had Camille Petty in charge of them, and Camille Petty is, right now, we're, we're involved in a new thrust, and she's gonna take the leadership of the thrust.  And I'm gonna let her talk about it because she works, we work--we have a TV show we've been on about twenty years.  And it's the 'Ophelia DeVore Show,' and she's my co, co-host, and we--so she knows I can out talk her in a minute.  And it's her time to talk (laughter).  Camille Petty.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, as I said before, I'm a nurse, and I've been a city nurse for fifty years.  I told you that we're having a big nursing shortage.  It's getting bigger by the minute.  We have lots of nurses and lots of teachers of nurses, who are going to be retiring.  Because Ms. DeVore was involved in a hospital recently, she got a whole different overview--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: --of the way that hospitals operate.  And she realized that there was something a little off, and so she asked me about it.  So I told her that--about the nursing shortage.  And it's very crucial now, the nursing shortage because our population is living longer and which means they're going to be ill and hospitals are for nurses, nursing care.  They're not for doctor's care.  The doctor, you know, breezes through, but the nurse, as I said before, is the first line of defense for the patient.
Speaker 1: So what are you, what is your plan?  What is the concept?  What are you hoping to--
Speaker 2: Well, Ms. DeVore suggests that we begin to look at nursing and raise the image, enhance the image of nurses.  Right now, there are not a lot of schools for nurses anymore.  A lot of programs have closed down because a lot of people don't want to be nurses anymore.
Speaker 1: Well, with working with the image because your job or your industry is building image, image makers, what are the steps you're gonna take to rebuild the image of nurses?
Speaker 2: May I just say one thing since I'm in communication.  One of the things we're going to get more stories on the nurses.  We're going to groom them to the effect that, have them make different presentations and get first the newspapers and magazines--well, the media, all the media to interview them and when they are interviewed, they make a good presentation and to do stories on them because that's very important.  If you don't get the kind of exposure and the right things are said, and the right visual is there, you know, you don't get the, quite good--your respect.  And for recruiting, you're going to need, you need a good image.  And that's one of the things we're going to emphasize, to have a good image, good character and do good work.  And that, and that's that (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's really it in a nutshell.  We have to attract people to nursing.  We have to let them know how important nurses are.
Speaker 2: How will you use this school?  Will they come to the school for the training?
Speaker 1: They, well, they'll come to the school, but we'll train them in meth--if we, if we have a program.  Some of 'em might come and some of 'em might not.  We have a lot of nurses already trained.  We have doctors and lawyers.  We have all kinds of people in the alumni.  You'd be surprised, lawyers and doctors and nurses.  And one of the things we're going to do for one whole year, we're going to put them on our television program, the 'Ophelia DeVore Show' where Camille and I are co-hosts on the show.
Speaker 2: Now, when does that show come on?  What--
Speaker 1: It's on channel--it's a cable show on 57, and we talk about current events, and sometimes we'll put on a fashion show.  We'll talk about--we see, what we'll do, we'll interview the nurses.  Now, one of the things we're gonna put on a show.  We're going to--oh, first thing we're going to do is award, honoring all the nurses that we're gonna work with, take a core of about twenty nurses.  We're going to honor them all, and then we'll train them.  When they make their appearance, they'll be wonderful.
Story_ID: 106695
Speaker 1: Now, when they are in, when they are training for the program and what not, we're going to have one of our alumni members be a mentor to them.  So, show them how to get people to, to respond to them in a positive way, show them how to walk and how to sit, and how to make appearances.  So when they get the awards, they will look wonderful.  And then what we'll do is send the, send the story out and also the photographs to all the black newspapers.  We have over twenty--200 black newspapers.  You know, I used to be on the board for about twelve years, on the board of black newspapers, and send them all out to the black newspapers so they'll write about them.  Now, this is a new thrust 'cause there're no good stories out here about the nurses, use the same formula I did when I, when I wanted to improve the image of black people, use the same formula because it works.  If it works, why not go ahead and use it.  Is that right, to try and come up with something that's never been used, you--it's too high a risk, you see.  And we're not gonna take any risks, so we do is gonna be successful, you know.  We got the person who can do the job, who can follow through, who is creative in all the things.  And she [Camille Petty]'s gonna be out front, but I'm gonna be behind her.  I'm gonna be right behind you--
Speaker 2: Always.
