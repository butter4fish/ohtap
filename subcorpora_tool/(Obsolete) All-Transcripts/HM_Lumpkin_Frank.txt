Speaker 1: I am Larry Crowe.  I am the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  And, sir, could you please state your name and spell it, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Frank Lumpkin.  F-R-A-N-K, L-U-M-P-K-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, when were you born?
Speaker 2: October the 23rd, 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what's todays' date, and where are we today?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.  June, well, June 6, 2002.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) June the 6th, 2002.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, where are we?
Speaker 2: Well, right now that's pretty hard for me to say.  I was brought up to Michigan Avenue, I think Michigan Avenue.  Where am I, Bea [Beatrice Lumpkin]?  You dropped me off and I--
Speaker 1: This is the HistoryMakers at 1900 South Michigan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, alright.  Nineteen hundred South Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Now?  Well, after thirty some years in the Mill [Wisconsin Steel Mill], we--they closed the mill down and I really went out to organize the guys that was thrown out of work on account of they closing up the mill.  And so, at that time, you know, I worked at south of Chicago [Illinois]--at International Harvester.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're a former steel mill worker, or how do I say it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, well I was a steel mill worker once I come in that.  Because actually, it was a simple thing.  You take an air hammer and a chisel and level out the bevel before the steel would go through the roll and into what it is at (unclear) round the squares or what it is, you know.  The whole angle would be busted down and they would roll it.
Story_ID: 112063
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, I've got some questions that are kinda of People Magazine-type questions.  They're very simple.  They just require like a short, brief answer.  I'll ask you these first before we get into like an in-depth interview.  Sir, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy (laughter).  Most of the things I eat (unclear).  Well, rice and grits with pork chops, or ham.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Dark brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't get many vacations, but I mean, the ones I had was the ones I, you know, when you have some time off and go down to your in-laws or friends house, and what have you.  But, lot of times, out the twenty-seven years in Wisconsin Steel [Mill], I had used my vacation time to make enough money to send my kids to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like the time, the little difference between the winter and the spring.  You know, when it's warm enough to go with a jacket or without a jacket and it's too hot to go out in the sun, you know.  I try to get a (unclear), a sweater or something that would--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the transition season, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thanks, okay.
Speaker 2: In other words.
Speaker 1: Sir, do you have a favorite phase or saying?
Speaker 2: Now, let's get it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: See the whole thing is that, they bring the work there and we would adjust to how we gonna work that together because, it wasn't one man could turn this billiard but, we'd work together.  Two men could turn billiards with wrenches and stuff.  So, that way it was a corporation between you and the people who you work with.  And, it's the best thing in the world to work together with the guys there.
Speaker 1: So, what you all would say was, say it again.  Well, what is it?  What'd you say?
Speaker 2: Let's work together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said, "Let's get it," I think or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, let's get it; the same thing.
Speaker 1: Is that what you said?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That what it mean, that you get in and do the job there, you'll get it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 112064
Speaker 1: All right, now, firstly when were you born?  And, where?
Speaker 2: I was born in Washington, Georgia, 1916, October the 31st [sic, October 23, 1916] I think about there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, who were your parents?
Speaker 2: Hattie Boyd Lump--Hattie Lumpkin and Elmer Lumpkin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what did--what were the occupation of your parents?
Speaker 2: Well, he would--he worked on a farm and after the farm went down on 'em, they took mules and drove from Washington, Georgia to Orlando, Florida.  And, he got a job on the, on the orange groves, you know.  We had to plow and picking 'em up, whatever they do.  But, that was the jobs he had there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did he move the family to Florida, too?  Or, did (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, he moved the--well it was three or four of us.  And, after he got to Florida he had enough more to make ten in the family.  But they, you know, they weren't all born at one place.  I was born in Washington, Georgia, and part of our family was born in Orlando, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, your father basically for the balance of your childhood, he basically worked in the fruit business?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  In a sense, you see, what, what you do in the fruit growers, they--the workers cultivate that land.  And then, at a certain time, the tree began to produce oranges.  And then, the workers would go out a pick the oranges at certain seasons, and then prune the trees at other seasons.  But, it was something that they would be doing year round.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there is something to do year round?
Speaker 2: Year round, yeah.
Speaker 1: Either cultivating or pruning or something?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Picking?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did your mother do?
Speaker 2: The truth of it is, she used to do washings.  At that time (unclear) and they would have pumped where you pump water into a tub, wooden tub where you cut a barrel into and make a tub.  And, they would have her, you know, one of these things where you wash with a, washboard.
Speaker 1: Washboard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the beginning.  I mean, (unclear) before I got old enough to get out from home and go somewhere and get a better job.
Story_ID: 112065
Speaker 1: Now, did--what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?  I mean, what do you remember about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good one, because I actually in Georgia where I was born at, and I was probably eight or ten years old, I was working, no, every day, and you could work and then you'd go to school.  You go to school in the day and then you work in the night when you go there.  And, if you had some animals like hogs, or chickens, or something, you would do that.  At that time, we didn't have no eight hour day (laughter), you know what I mean?  You get up in the morning, you do what you supposed to do for the chickens and the hogs and whatever you was doing.  And, then you would go to school, and then you would come back, and then you would fill in the rest of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what--I mean, do you have any stories about growing up, or any stories you can tell us?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: About what things were like then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well a lot of them was fairly good.  See my--I was kid in a family of ten kids.  Then my father [Elmer Lumpkin], he left Washington, Georgia and he went to Orlando, Florida where we began to work on orange grove, where we would pick fruit and hold the trees and keep the thing rolling.
Story_ID: 112066
Speaker 1: Then after that, I come to Buffalo, New York and, and there I learned how to work in a mill.
Speaker 2: Now, we're skipping over a lot of time here, you know, like I'm--I guess I want you to go back to your childhood maybe, is there--did you do to school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I went to school, I think (unclear) the ninth grade school.  I had to go--
Speaker 2: Do you know the name of the school you went to?
Speaker 1: Jones High School [Orlando, Florida].  The last school--
Speaker 2: I mean, elementary school.  Let's start with the elementary school.  Can you--
Speaker 1: Well, the elementary school was with us was in the church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, peoples in that area would go and go to the church in the daytime, you know, and they go down and they'd teach 'em ABCs and other stuff about that.  It wasn't nowhere near to the instruction they get now, the help they get from, from you know, helping writing and others part of that.
Speaker 2: So, what denomination was the church?
Speaker 1: Baptist (laughter).
Speaker 2: Baptist.  So, you went to school at a Baptist church?
Speaker 1: Yeah, during the day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They had--we could, they allowed us to come in there.   And, I happened to take first, second, third, and fourth grade.  But, when you got higher than that, you went downtown to the other thing, Jones High School and you could study there.  But, they had a lot of books that you take with you and bring back with you.  With the help of your parents, you know, you could do it.  I was lucky, yeah, my father [Elmer Lumpkin] could read and write enough to help us out on that stuff.
Story_ID: 112067
Speaker 1: Did your father [Elmer Lumpkin] have any stories about when he was growing up?  Or, what things were like when he was growing up?  Did he tell you any stories?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Not much.  Not much, you know, I mean actually he--his father was a sharecropper.  And, what they would do is that have in the time of harvest and stuff he would take the kids out and do (unclear) help grow the stuff around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your father grow up in Georgia?
Speaker 2: He was born in Georgia.  But, he grew up in Orlando, Florida.  He growed up, where he get all the way down to Orlando, Florida and then began to work in Orange Grove and pick oranges and trees, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know your [paternal] grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Frank Lumpkin] was a, was a--on one plantation was an owner of it and other, my mother's father [Weber Martin] was a guy who worked at the house in (unclear).  He chauffeured and cleaned the yard and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is all in Georgia?  In Washington, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Georgia, Georgia, yeah?
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So, I left Washington, Georgia, I wasn't a real big man.  'Cause the deal was that that's where it started at and he went down there and he got a job on orange grove and then he sent and got the rest of the kids to come down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time, you had the church to go to where you'd study lesson and after (unclear) and Conway and you--when you got to sixth grade, I think, then they'd send us to over to Jones High School [Orlando, Florida] to go and get the rest of the education.
Story_ID: 112068
Speaker 1: Could you name your brothers and sisters for us and give us the order of their birth?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, brother.  My oldest brother was Wade, and next to him was my sister Bay Elizabeth, and then me, Frank, and then my next brother who is Oz [Ozzie], and then one was John.  It was ten of us in the family.
Story_ID: 112069
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what kind of a child were you?  What kind of a little boy were you when you--were you happy?  Or, did you get in trouble?  Or, did you like to go to school or what?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I got in no trouble, you know, because I didn't go for trouble (unclear).  And, I didn't mind, you know, going to school.  Like I was going to school in Georgia where you walk five or ten miles to get there and then five back.  And, you take your books home and all that stuff so you got the, they got a way to carry your books backward and forward.  Sometimes, when you got home you worked and sometime went to school without your work.
Speaker 1: How long did it take to walk to school?
Speaker 2: About hour, forty-five minutes.
Speaker 1: An hour and forty-five minutes, or--
Speaker 2: Somewhat along there.  I know, to me, I felt that it was a long ways to go 'cause I had to come all the way out schools.  You see at that time in Georgia, the school was in the church until you got enough to get to high school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, then you had to walk all the way 'cross town to the colored side of town and go to a colored school.  At that time, they had black in schools and whites in different schools.  And, so, you would pass up schools to get to the school that they had set aside for the Afro American people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there were schools closer to you, but you couldn't go there?  (Simultaneously)
Speaker 2: Naw, you couldn't go there.  You never forget it because when you go past that school and you go, you know, you get on the other side of the street and then go on down to where you--to the other side of town where the school was for guys like me, you could go to the school over there.  But, it wasn't an integrated school in there (unclear) at that time.
Speaker 1: Was there a public school for black students?  Other than the high school?
Speaker 2: Well, the public school would, yeah, well (unclear) until about fourth grade you, they would have the basement of a church and a church where they'd would let you have four or five hours and someone to teach the kids in different grades.
Speaker 1: Did you, or do you know if the state provided any money for black students to go to school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Or, did that come out of the pockets of the congregation?
Speaker 2: I have no way of knowing how they got paid at the school.  But--'cause they used the church in the week to go to--for school and then they had--on Sunday they would use it for--in the afternoon they'd use it for (unclear).  But, after you got to a certain grade, you go the schools on the other sides of town.  Where they had to black school and back over there where you lived.
Speaker 1: Were they a lot of student in grade school with you, when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: I think so, you know.  I think so.  She was, I think about twelve month, eleven months between me and my brother.  We come in from where we lived and first time we come 'cross to the high school (laughter) they would have some fights.  And, getting together and going from--you see, you would do one class in one room and then you go up to the next room to do the other class with another teacher.  And, so you had that kind of work around that thing; I believe I did that until I left Florida.
Story_ID: 112070
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you have any--were you close to your parents [Hattie and Elmer Lumpkin]?  I mean, were they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Close as you could be.  My old man had work over twelve hours a day.  And, when he come in, you know, you had to do what's supposed to be done.  What he could do around the house, in the yards, and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did you--you say you left Florida, right, at a certain time?  How did that happened?  How did you wind up leaving Florida?
Speaker 2: Well, you see, my father and like the rest of 'em were sharecroppers and everything else (unclear) they, at certain times, they left and went to Florida where they worked on orange groves and other things.  Daddy wasn't there.  And, if you could imagine, you know, working in cotton country where you, you chopped cotton, planted cotton, and you work, you know, you go done and get it done; chopping or what have you.  The thing that I remember forever, you know, is because they didn't plant cotton under trees, so you would chop the cotton in the open and you go round the, the tree and get to the other side and kept chopping down there.  But, you know, it was work and you could make you a quarter or fifty cent a day, or whatever they pay you at that time to do it.  But, one thing for sure, we had to go to school.  That was our parents' business--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Getting to school.
Speaker 1: Your parents were real concerned that you get an education?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 112071
Speaker 1: What did you like best about school, or did you like it, like school?
Speaker 2: Well, I like the teaching and everything else.  And, I actually, it was, I was living on a farm or outside then what you call 'em and I--so I dressed like a farmer, you know what I mean, I dressed, well, the best I could.  Well, you know, and a lot of times, it was homemade clothes.  And, it was a lot different from me going to Jones High School and the elementary thing with peoples who was dressed and I was, you know, didn't even have shoes in a lot of places and (unclear).  I had my share of the (laughter), actually the bad part of what was happening on orange grove.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did--so when you started high school did you, I mean, you said other people dress better than you and you felt like--how did you feel when you were in school?
Speaker 2: It was several, I mean, actually somewhere that they had (unclear) gems or something.  But, they were using the sugar sacks to make shirts and other stuff for the person to wear, you know, and you didn't go down a pick out a pair of pants.  You know, your mother would sew 'em, or somebody would sew 'em for you out there and then fit them.
Speaker 1: So, when you went to high school, you were wearing homemade clothes, when you went to high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I had some.  I got coveralls from somewhere and everything.  But, I didn't forget Jones High School because I was a country boy coming in town.  Going to high school it was always some fights or struggles between country boys and town boys and (unclear).
Speaker 1: Do you have--do you remember any particular students or teachers in high school that standout?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of 'em were Mae Jane [ph.] and the other one was Erin [ph.], but she was a real good teacher.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Mae Jane, I think.  Mae Jane, I think it was.  But, you know, when I started to school like I say, you went to the church.  Then you got the--for read and write, or third or fourth grade.  Then you would to go school and the school was on the other side of town.  So, we had to walk going to the other side of town to go to the high school and that.  Or, medium school or whatever you wanna call it (laughter) but it was about sixth or seventh grade.  I think I made it to the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this teacher Mae Jane, you said?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Well, what did she do?  Or, what was her--why was she important?
Speaker 2: Well, she dressed real good and I think her husband was a chauffeur or something.  But, anyhow, she was really good.  But, she was really strict on the students in that class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she's a good teacher?
Speaker 2: Good teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, in my opinion, the teachers is not the full thing of it, it's the person being forced to learn by his parents to study and to study all the books that you get by the school, so.
Speaker 1: So, did your parents [Hattie Lumpkin and Elmer Lumpkin] make sure you had time to study?
Speaker 2: They made sure (laughter).  We studied our lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's for sure.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you went to ninth grade, and what happened then?  I mean, what did you--why did you stop going?
Speaker 2: I got the chance to get out and make a living (laughter).  And, I did that and down there working yards, and chopping cotton, and whatever was done where you could make the money on it.
Speaker 1: Now, were your parents upset that you dropped out of school, or did they wanna see you finish?
Speaker 2: Naw.  They--see actually the area of which we were in, my father was working on a plantation and he was doing the stuff.  And, then it worked out that him and the owner, they fell out.  And, he took the mules and hitched 'em up and went from Washington, Georgia to Orlando, Florida.  And, then he was able to send to get part of the family to come down there.  And, when you went to oranges, the same--they give you, if you had a family they'll have a, they'll give you a house to live in, on the plantation.
Speaker 1: No.  I was asking if they were upset that you dropped, you know, when you dropped out of school, you know, in the ninth grade?  Did that bother your parents?  How did they feel about that?
Speaker 2: I don't know to tell you the truth.  But--
Speaker 1: This was like 1927, I guess, or?
Speaker 2: Somewhere along in there, yeah.
Story_ID: 112072
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so, how long did you stay in Orlando [Florida] after you dropped out of school?
Speaker 2: Orlando, Florida?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly.  (Laughter) Yeah.  What you mean, box?  Yeah, I boxed, I boxed, but I, I didn't make a living boxing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Box--oh, well--
Speaker 2: You know what I mean.  When we go to--
Speaker 1: You were a boxer, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We went to the college to box and actually they would have like four or five guys getting around the ring and box.  And then, you know, the winner would be in the--would wind up in the ring.  But, the big deal with that, you know, I would box for these things and they would throw money in the ring and if you were still boxing (laughter).  You didn't pick up no money.  The guys that was knocked down first would be able to pick up the money (laughter).  And, you would, you know, you'd try to get out the way to fight 'em.  But, I think that later on they learned a way that when fights like that they would split the money between the winners and the losers.  But--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It's just you tap.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  You're a little further away.  I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh okay.  All right. Yeah.  You said at the college, you all would box?  Well, what college was this?
Speaker 1: Naw, I went to Jones High school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At the high--
Speaker 2: You were talking--and so you boxed when you were in high school?
Speaker 1: Well, I boxed out there in the, in the ground.  But, I mean, I didn't box for money.  I boxed for money after ninth, you know, I'd go home and if they wanted somebody--well, they pick up two or three buys and get in the ring.  And, then they would make an opening where they had for the rest of the guys that would come in behind.  And, that's the way I was boxing then.
Speaker 2: Could you make money boxing?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  And, we'd boxed for colleges sometime and, you know, have a ring and they would throw money out in the ring for you to pick up and what have you.  And, then later on, they would pay you to box at certain stations, I mean, certain places.
Story_ID: 112002
Speaker 1: A lot of peoples can go out and box, walk ten or twelve miles a day to school and, you know, especially when the parents would insist that they get some type of education which would be number one on the bottom.  Because boxing is a profession--
Story_ID: 112003
Speaker 1: Yeah--you were talking, we were talking about, you know, your last days in school and the kind of activities you're involved in.  And, you were telling us about boxing, you know.  Did you, did you learn how to box in school or did somebody, or were there some coach that brought you all together to box, or what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a guy named Luther Yates [ph.] that lived on the next grove over and he wanted--and I'd go and cut the lot and he was boxing.  Actually, he had somebody who come in there and box and then they, the guy asked me to box with him, you know, to kinda help him work him out.  Because, you know, I wasn't a, I wasn't a professional boxer.  I'd go watch him and see, the moves and motions and that whole thing.  But, I didn't come up to be a boxer after I could go out and fight in a battle or something like that and get four or five dollars, I would go out and do it.  But, then, you know, from there we come to think Florida, and we would be able to get some fights in the ring for other guys where you would make money.
Speaker 1: Did you have a manager?
Speaker 2: One manager named Luther Yates.  He was a barber and he would--he liked fighting, so he would come around and let me--he put up a bag in his house, garage, so I could punch with it and that.
Speaker 1: Was he black?
Speaker 2: White.  White, white.  Yeah, no, no.
Speaker 1: Did he provide you with gloves and everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All you needed.  Okay.  So how much did you get and how much did he get?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I don't know, but I know, you know, in a lot of the fighting we brought a ring where the people would throw the money in the ring.  If you were the last one in there, the guy that got knocked down first was picking up the money (laughter).  So, it wasn't, you know, like later it become professional, you'd get paid for so many rounds of fighting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, you'd get fight.
Speaker 1: So, did you always box for Luther Yates, or did you--?
Speaker 2: He would, he was the manager of this whole thing.  I would box with black on black on (unclear), you didn't have it where you would--
Speaker 1: Luther Yates (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Luther Yates, Luther Yates was a white man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.  Did you box for him, always?  Did you always box for him or did you change up and get another manager?
Speaker 2: I did change up and got another manager.  I left the town in Washington, Georgia, went to Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay, so you were in Orlando [Florida], you went back to Georgia, and then came back to Florida again, or what?
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: Or, did I just get it mixed up.  You were already in Florida when you started boxing.  Were you in Florida when you started boxing or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But, then in the off-season I went to Atlanta [Georgia] and boxed there and with (unclear).
Story_ID: 112004
Speaker 1: The things was, I was, like I said, was born in the country and I didn't know a lot of language and didn't know a lot of--in fact, I didn't know how to eat, you know what I mean.  When they (unclear) and set the food out in the table.  I used to sop syrup with the biscuits.  But, then you sat around and look, and you see these people using a fork and knife and cutting.  And, I was trying to learn how to use forks and knifes, and I think that it got to be all right, but you sop syrup and you use the bread to clean up the stuff that you did there.
Speaker 2: I know my dad does that now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Same way.
Speaker 1: It's a good idea.  I mean, it's not a bad idea there, but you know, that's when you had plenty of butter and syrup.  And, you would take a biscuit man and put in there and soak up (laughter), the (unclear) the syrup and go ahead and eat.
Speaker 2: What was your favorite food when you were a kid coming up?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  It's pretty hard to figure out.  See, down on the farm, or down there certain times of the year, they kill the pigs and you could get--they'd make hams, you know, in the smokehouse, where they smoke the ham.  And, you can have a ham, and then if you get chickens, you'll have that.  Lucky enough to go fishing, catch some fishes.  But, it wasn't something you go in a store and pick out what you could buy there.
Story_ID: 112005
Speaker 1: Okay, so you boxed, all right, to make a living, but you also had other jobs too, at the same time that you were a boxer?
Speaker 2: Naw.  Maybe some time, but most of the time, I was boxing and working.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not just boxing, you know, especially.
Speaker 1: And, how old were you then, when you were boxing?
Speaker 2: About sixteen, I guess, I don't know.
Speaker 1: How long did you box?
Speaker 2: Pre-seasons and 'round the season, I'd be boxing, six or seven years.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about a time, I mean, the best fight that you had?  Can you tell me about the best one that you were in?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well, I'm trying to see.  In them days, you black for black.  It wasn't a black, white fight.  But, then it was a guy name Warby Walker [ph.] and other guys that was good fighters that was in there and I went to Atlanta, Georgia, I think I had a fight.  They are not a good game (laughter).  But, I was picking oranges.  Yeah, you walk and you train and then you get in the ring for hour or two hours and then you go back.  Let's see, even before I was boxing as a boxer, I went to these colleges and they would have--they let you have battles in the college.  And, then they would throw money out to the guys that was in the ring.  And, but that way, but if you really train and box like I did later, you know, you got into that.  But, it's a tough profession, you know, a lot of people they--you know, you get hit some time, in that ring, you get really bounced around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you didn't really enjoy it, you know?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You didn't enjoy boxing?
Speaker 2: (no audible response, shaking head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Naw, naw, I needed the money and I could box 'cause this guy--
Speaker 1: It's not anything that you really like to do?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It's not something that you really like to do?
Speaker 2: Naw.  Best thing I like to do is sail the ship when I was in the Merchant Marine.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you left high school, did you, did you immediately go to--you said you went to Buffalo, New York?
Speaker 2: (no audible response, nodding head).
Speaker 1: When was that?  When did you go to Buffalo?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Bea [Beatrice Lumpkin], we got copies of the book?
Speaker 1: We don't wanna read the book.  We want you to tell us (laughter).  We got--
Speaker 2: Man, a lot of things, I'm glad I forgot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, you went to Buffalo, New York, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's before you went out to sea, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You went to Buffalo first?  Okay.  Well, tell me that happened.  What--how did you get to Buffalo?  How did you decid to go, what made you decide to go to Buffalo?
Speaker 2: Well, you go where your parents was, you know.  They there and then you go, you know.  Actually, 'cause I had a big family.  I think it was ten of us.  And, part of 'em was going and the other would be left on the farm, till they find something for 'em to do where they was at, and they could do that.  In the summertime, when you go to Florida, you could pick oranges and, you know, you put a sack around you, and you would cut the oranges.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying your parents [Hattie and Elmer Lumpkin] moved to Buffalo?
Speaker 2: (no audible response, nodding head).
Speaker 1: And, you just moved with your parents to Buffalo?
Speaker 2: I stayed with my parents (laughter) 'til I got married, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you were in Buffalo what happened?
Speaker 2: I gotta think of what Buffalo, New York, I mean, Buffalo--
Speaker 1: It had to be different from Washington, Georgia, wasn't it?  I mean, was Buffalo different?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Washington, Georgia had one stoplight in the whole city (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, Florida you'd go--lot of sights out (unclear) living in the orange groves, you had to walk all the way through town, through the schools, the white school and go to the black school on the other side of town.  And, you would have stuff there going on.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, when you got to--well, you know, tell me about Buffalo.  What was it like?  Where did you live in Buffalo?
Speaker 2: Trying to think of some of the things I forgot.
Speaker 1: Did you have a job in Buffalo?  Or, did you have a girlfriend in Buffalo?
Speaker 2: Jobs.  Yeah, I had jobs and I had girlfriend.  I had all that.  And, she didn't have a--you know, I wasn't a professional do (unclear), you know, I would work and then I would on the weekends sometimes you'd box, if they need a boxer (unclear).  You read the history of boxer of (unclear) Walker [ph.] and all the old time black boys, black guys at that time and that was before they integrated the whole business of boxing.
Speaker 1: So, I heard that you were some kinda of a champion or something as a boxer, is that true?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think I was--dominated as a champion in boxing because at that time, it wasn't black and white champions and things, so I would box--I went to Atlanta, Georgia to box at other places, where you could make twenty-five or thirty bucks in the whole thing.  But, it came a long ways from there because, you know, the integration of--well, before Joe Louis come and the other guys that got famous was able to fight the heavyweight champions.  But, I'd watch 'em all.
Story_ID: 112007
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you joined the [U.S.] Merchant Marine out of Buffalo [New York]?
Speaker 2: Buffalo, let me see.  Did I go in the Merchant Marine in there?  I went the Merchant Marine from Orlando, Florida, huh?  From Buffalo?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you like sailing?  You like--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You liked being in the Merchant Marine?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a money making job and to me it was something big.  Yeah, I mean actually, it's gonna take some thinking because when I worked on the farm, I worked from sunup to sundown.  And, if I could find a job someplace else, like, you know, getting in the Merchant Marines, if you could possible get in the Merchant Marine and sign on and sign off.  And, you would get paid coming back, that was way, you know.  I think it was World War II, before World War II that I sailed ships to England and France and up and down the place, because I worked in the tool room, you know.  I mean, I changed the burners on the ships and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you--this was during the war, right?  You said just before World War II, or during the War?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't drafted during the war?
Speaker 2: (no audible response, shaking head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it because you were in the Merchant Marine that you didn't get drafted?
Speaker 2: I don't (laughter) know.  Yeah.  Well, it didn't bother me.  I had these fingers off when I was a kid.
Story_ID: 112008
Speaker 1: Oh, you lost your fingers when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: All this time we've talked about you being a kid and you lose your fingers and you don't tell us.  What happened?
Speaker 2: It's rough.  I was at the orange grove and actually, we use to work with--they had white kids on one side and then the other.  So, we would work together.  So, you use those things and so I just like to climb trees.  And so, this was a tree that a live wire went through.  Like the wires went through the trees, like the telephone poles where they go now.  And, this wire had, they had put through the tree and they knocked the insulation off.  And, so, one guy was up there.  Me and he (unclear) and he said, "Look out, that stuff is hot now."  And, I didn't believe him (laughter).  And, I went out to touch the wire that, and I, and I, and it really didn't charge me up.  And, I try to push one hand, wave with the other one.  And, so all my life, I've been three fingers and one finger on the other hand.  But, they got burnt through the electric wire.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But after that, you know, it haven't hinder me from doing anything, actually.  I would sail as a [U.S.] Merchant Marine in the ship and clean 'em up and everything else, you know, without them saying, let me see your (laughter) hands, and your fingers, and this thing.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you hurt your fingers?
Speaker 2: About, fifteen, sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's about the same year that you stopped going to school, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response, nodding head)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pretty sure (unclear).
Speaker 1: It's starting to make sense.  I gotta be a detective, but (laughter).  It's starting to make sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 112009
Speaker 1: But, how did you come to Chicago [Illinois]?  I mean, when did you come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  I put thirty-some years Chicago, Bea [Beatrice Lumpkin].  How long have we been in Chicago? (looks at wife, Bea Lumpkin) What nineteen years?
Speaker 1: So, you came to Chicago in 1949?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 2: (No audible response, nodding head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, why did you come to Chicago?  I mean, did you come here through the [U.S.] Merchant Marine, or what?  How did you--
Speaker 2: Naw, now, you catch a ride.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, I mean, actually (laughter) if you lived on the farm down there, you know, the only way you'd get--(unclear) my old man [Elmer Lumpkin], like I said before took a wagon and drove it all the way about five or six hundred miles to get to Florida, and I think what (unclear) there's catching a ride, you get on the wagon or something and do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you got a ride to Chicago from, I guess you came from Buffalo [New York], I guess, right?  Or, I don't know, you tell me.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Buffalo to Chicago, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's right.  You came from Buffalo to Chicago.
Story_ID: 112010
Speaker 1: All right, and, so what and you, you--I know you started working for Wisconsin Steel, right, at a certain point?
Speaker 2: (No audible response, nodding yes).
Speaker 1: Now, is that when you start--did you start working at Wisconsin Steel as soon as you got here?  How did you find out about it?
Speaker 2: Now, let's see, 'cause I worked there thirty-some years.  You see actually, in the steel mill, they wasn't like the ones are now, you know, if you got around there you could get a chance to get in there and see how things done.  But then, I learned how to chip defects, you know, smooth defects with steel.  And, so, I went there for a job and they said, "Well, come over here and if you can chip, you can get a job."  And, I was there for thirty-some years, but a lot of other things happened (laughter) during that time.  'Cause I lived on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] where--and then we moved from there to Gary, Indiana, and I spent thirty years with the steel mills.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, I know you were involved with a strike, right, in the steel mill?
Speaker 2: Strangely enough, I was always involved in 'em and I did it on purpose.  But, you see, the steel mill that I was in was International Harvester-owned.  And, they would guarantee to get the raise that anybody else in the steel got like the other steel mills that was around, like the one in Gary and what have you.  So, Wisconsin Steel was never a part of the steelworkers union.  It was separate but they would guarantee you whatever steelworkers got retroactive.  So, that was a break.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you ever join the union at Wisconsin Steel?  It was a company union, she's [Beatrice Lumpkin] saying. What--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a company union.  It was a company union that--that was you know, International Harvester that made them trucks and tractors and everything else.  That's where the steel mill, that made that kind of steel products that many were able to do what they were doing.  So, I got a chance to get in that mill and learn how to chip and then I applied for the job and got the job (laughter).  It wasn't the--the steel mills wasn't as tight as they became later, you know.  You could walk out there and you could walk up to the steel mill and you could walk in there and talk to the guy and find out what's going on.
Speaker 1: No security to stop you?
Speaker 2: Naw, they stop you right there.
Speaker 1: So, you could just walk on in there and talk?  Okay.  All right, so, did you like working in the steel mill?  Was it okay?  Was the--was management fair?  Did they do--did they treat you all right?
Speaker 2: According to who the management was, you know, usually it was fair.  It was fair, usually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: What do you mean, they wasn't fair?
Speaker 1: So, you had a good time working at Wisconsin Steel?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You had a good time, pleasant time there?
Speaker 2: (Nodding head).  Sixteen hours, one time I worked there twenty-one hours a day and they come out and stopped me.  But, I need the money, and it wasn't hard to get there, you know.  You chip or you do what you had to do until they resupplied and you just work till it get done.  You'd do what your job was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you got paid a fair wage for that?
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: You had good medical coverage?
Speaker 1: So far, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 112011
Speaker 1: Everything wasn't okay, 'cause--
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  They also had a (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: There's no job where everything's okay, that I know of.  But, I don't know, maybe--
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  You know, so it requires a different kind of preparation, 'cause it's not right, there at the top of the head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  (unclear) questions, and his whole life was around that, it wasn't okay.
Speaker 1: I know.  I know.  That's why I'm trying to get, but--see the purpose of--
Story_ID: 112012
Speaker 1: In my opinion it wasn't, wasn't difference between Wisconsin Steel [mill] and U.S. Steel.  In fact, we had the same thing guaranteed that U.S. Steel got, Republic Steel got, Wisconsin Steel got it.  They--it was owned by McCormick [the McCormick family of Chicago, Illinois] and then McCormick would take that steel and we would make kind of steel they need.  Because they made tractors, plows, and what have you.  And, that was really, we wasn't affected by a lot of the things that happened but, you know, we wasn't, we didn't wanna be scared to be walking through a picket line and we had no picket lines or nothing.
Speaker 2: So, okay.  You organized other workers, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was in there organizing things.  Yeah, I was there.
Speaker 2: What did you organize workers to do?
Speaker 1: To sit down and let's discuss whether we're gonna do this job or that job.  You see, actually, I was a chipper and then when they brought in grinding machines, they had grinders.  And, if you were the chipper, you made less than the guy on the grinder.  And, if you moved up to the grinder, you got that.  But, all the jobs wasn't there, you know, any kind of a job.  The jobs that you got at the steel mill.  And, they had them in there in certain categories where they had certain works done.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, when you brought workers together, you discussed like the discrepancy in pay?  Is that what it was?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, you see, all I had to do is keep going around talking to the workers.  And, let's sit down and discuss whether we're gonna, whether we're gonna keep working or we're gonna get a pay that U.S. Steel got.  Or, we won't do anything on the job.  And, that way we put pressure on the company and we would--got the prices that we had asked.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell me, can you tell me how--what do you have to do to get other workers to act as a group?  I mean, how do you get unity amongst your fellow workers?  How do you do it?
Speaker 1: Well, I usually talk to 'em, and lead them in the way in the struggle.  But, you see, we would have time to discuss how we're gonna work in there during that time when you taking the jobs, changing clothes in the middle to go to work.
Speaker 2: Did you have like one-on-one conversations with the, with your fellow workers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's the best way.  Or, maybe one-on-one or one-on-two.  But, you gotta watch that because the foreman or--they wouldn't have--catch you doing that and they could fire you for the stuff.  Or, you could invite 'em after work to come over to the Square Deal and have a beer.  And, we would really sit down and discuss what we should do about the conditions.
Speaker 2: What was the Square Deal?  What was that?
Speaker 1: The name of a place that they had on 106th and Torrence, where they opened up.
Story_ID: 112013
Speaker 1: All right.  Mr. Lumpkin, can you tell me about what happened when Wisconsin Steel closed [in 1980]?
Speaker 2: We had some marches.  I know at that time, Harold Washington was the mayor of the City [of Chicago].  And, Ed Sadlowski [Edward Sadlowski] who was a labor leader in the South Side, father knew about it and I talked with little Ed Sadlowski.  And, so, I go to City Hall to talk to Mayor Washington, no chance 'till I started down, and I met little Sadlowski.  And, he went right up the way and then he got me to talk, sit down and talked with Harold Washington who came out to a meeting one night at the union hall, and, you know, when he was mayor. And we worked there--worked together hand and hand to what you got doing there.  But, in organizing working with many people--you know, you gotta talk to the people and figure out what the best way to get things done there and the struggle in which we won out on the whole thing.  But, it's a lot of other things, you have to understand, that when I went in the steel mill, it was much different than the time I came out because we had a lot of improvements that went on in the mill.  I went in there to chipper that used the hammer to dig the--and chisel to cut the defects out.  And, while I was still there, they put in grinders.  Big grinders that would take the steel and would grind it out in a tenth of the time it take a guy to get with a chisel and an air hammer to cut it out.  So, it was an improvement that was made in, within the mill and what have you.  The idea of getting the company to increase the pay of the guys who was working there.  So, he was able to call a meeting and you were able to slow down.  Or, you was able to do what was necessary to force the company to sit down and let's talk about real business and that everybody there got a right to make a living.  And, so, things like that they, you know, was the things that I liked about working in the mill.  You could talk.  You call five guys together and say, "Let's talk."  And, then the foreman, when the steel goes down, the foreman would have to do what he was gonna do or either he had to listen to what the workers was fighting about.  And, that was my idea of what was going on in that mill and it wasn't long for--I think I had thirty years in that mill.  But, I knew the guys.  I did my job and I never, you know, done something that would force more work on the guy that was working next to me or with me in that plant.
Story_ID: 112014
Speaker 1: Now, when the mill closed in 1980, what happened to the workers that were working for Wisconsin Steel?
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: Did they get their pensions and healthcare?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got it.  We got pension and healthcare.  Didn't we?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, did you get it when the mill closed down?  When they closed the, right after they closed the mill down?
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  Or, didn't you have to fight for it?
Speaker 1: Well, the contract was based on how long you worked there.  You worked there five years, you had certain things guarantee.  If you had ten years, or you had, if you had so many years there, you had the contract guarantee that you would have the benefits of that time that you spent in the mill.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  And, so the mill closed, and you--were you paid?  And, did the pensions continue?  Or, did you have to organize?
Speaker 1: First, we had to organize because the union did not step out to benefit the workers there.  And, at that time, Harold Washington was Mayor [of Chicago], and little Ed worked for him, little Ed Sadlowski [Edward Sadlowski] worked for him.  And, I went down to talk to Harold because I knew him; couldn't touch him.  Then, I seen little Ed on the way out and I told him what I want.  And, he went right up there and talked to Harold and Harold invited me up and we sit down and talked.  And, then another week, Harold Washington come out to the plant, I mean, to the Wisconsin Steel.  And, he was talking about the benefits that was necessary to get there, but--
Story_ID: 112015
Speaker 1: It wasn't, it wasn't a simple, you know, you do what doing and, you know, and if you remember things during that time, you remember Trumbull Park [Chicago, Illinois]?  And, if you remember Trumbull Park, that's when they had black and white fighting going from Square Deal to 106th Street.
Speaker 2: Now, what was Trumbull Park?  What was that?
Speaker 1: Trumbull Park is a little park out there on the east side of the, of 106th Street.  And, if you remember that that was the time when this black family [Donald and Betty Howard] moved into this Trumbull Park to come over to--and then they start marching and picketing and what have you.  But, you know, it was a few and actually they could get up enough stuff that they, but they couldn't break the bond that the Wisconsin Steel workers had lived through and worked with and went up and down the street.
Speaker 2: So, you're saying, are you saying that the neighborhood was kind of a racist neighborhood, you know, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I guess if you get the book ['Always Bring a Crowd!: The Story of Frank Lumpkin, Steelworker' by Beatrice Lumpkin], you know, if you remember this thing happened when they moved the black family on 106th Street.  They moved them into a project, a housing project [Trumbull Park Homes].  And, then they had this trouble between the white and the black, you know.  And, the part about Wisconsin Steel workers, we all went to work.  We all--we had no fights.  No struggle on the thing but we had community help and support even with that Father [John Joseph] Egan of the church come over and worked down that's happening.  The trouble with these things--
Speaker 2: That's John Egan?  Father John Egan?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell we had to--we was able to meet in his basement; at the church basement and what have you.
Story_ID: 112016
Speaker 1: Did you, did you need a lawyer when Wisconsin Steel closed?  Did you need a lawyer?
Speaker 2: (No audible response, nodding head).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, why did you need a lawyer?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's not a simple question (laughter), you know what I mean?  If you got a case, you can't argue your own case.  You have to have somebody who know enough about law to argue the case.  And, that's where we got the help from down there, you know what I mean.  Actually, it wasn't, it wasn't as bad as a lot people would thought, if you read about Trumbull Park [Chicago, Illinois] and where they had these riots [Trumbull Park Race Riots in 1953] and what have you.  And, and going in there that we worked together and we had no major problem there.  But, they had a lot of money spent on that mill improving the six mill.  The new grinding types of things for the mill and what have you.  And, I go by there and look at it sometimes and think about how much money they spent and got nothing out of it, the company.
Speaker 1: So, did--let's see, how many workers did you have to organize?  And, did you have to organize a lot of workers to be able to get what you deserved, you know, from the mill?
Speaker 2: (Nodding) And, it wasn't a big problem.  You just talk to the guy and say what we should do and if you was--like, I was in the (unclear) and that thing.  Because if they didn't give the--get the scarfers and chippers working, they would close the mill down anyway, you know what I mean.  They were the main guys that would have that steel in condition where they could rule the bars and then make the, make the steel that was necessary for them to use that time.
Story_ID: 112017
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  When the mill [Wisconsin Steel] closed, were the workers paid for their work?  Did they get their pension checks or did the company cut off the health benefits?  Did the pension plan still pay out or did it go bankrupt?
Speaker 2: It paid out.  It didn't go bankrupt.  Did it?
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  I'm afraid it did.  The case that Tom Gaygin [ph.] filed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  And, won money.  What was that money for?
Speaker 2: The case.  But, every--
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  What did the company owe the workers?
Speaker 2: Whatever they--they adjusted the pay that they owed 'em.
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  I think we're tired, real tired.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  That's my guess, really.
Speaker 2: Now, that was a, it was a complicated thing because we had an independent union.  And, so, we didn't get the support from South Works and other places.  We had to work, work it out ourselves and march it out, and picket it out.
Speaker 1: And, in the end you were successful, I guess, right?  When you got--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You got your money.  But, you had to fight for it, right?
Speaker 2: You had to fight for it.
Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  How did you win it?  What do you think the most important actions were at that--made it possible to win?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Look at Larry.
Speaker 1: Now, the point being is that lot of things happened at Trumbull [Park, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.  We had guys that would break glasses in other guys' cars and that thing what went on in Trumbull Park and the whole business around that.  But, it was no fussing and fighting inside the mill.  The workers--
Speaker 2: The workers were in solidarity?
Speaker 1: In solidarity, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  But, what did you all do to force management to pay you what you were owed?
Speaker 1: Stop.
Speaker 2: Stop work?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Stop work or slow down.  You see, you know, (laughter), you punch in and you punch out.  But, that don't say you have to put in so many hours to work on that thing.  And, I--if they got steel builders to do the turn 'em, to mark 'em, you would take your time and turn 'em once, twice or how many time it took.  And, got it done.
Speaker 2: So, you kinda slowed down a little bit?
Speaker 1: You did--we did, slowed down.
Speaker 2: And, after they closed the mill down, what kinda of actions, other than the lawsuit, what else did you all do to get your money?
Speaker 1: Other than the lawsuit (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did--I mean, did you get on television and get in the newspapers and tell them (simultaneously)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got, we got newspapers and we got--
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  Did you march?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we marched.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  How often?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that to.
Speaker 2: How often did you march?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  Maybe a couple weeks and a month.  But, we didn't stop the whole thing down right at one time but--oh, excuse me.
Speaker 2: That's okay (laughter).  Yeah, so, it took a lot of marching to get the attention of the media, and of the public and?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Do you think the public pressure placed on Wisconsin Steel basically made them pay you?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was the unity between the workers and the, and the part of the union that was supporting the workers.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  Even though you weren't in the union, did the Steel Workers Union and Local 65 help you?
Speaker 1: (No audible response, shaking head).
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  That's where your office is and you don't pay rent.
Speaker 1: That's now (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  After the mill closed?
Speaker 1: They let us met in the, in the union hall.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  Did they charge you?
Speaker 1: Well, they didn't then.
Speaker 2: So, they helped you?  I mean, so, you had some help from the union?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Steelworkers Union?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  I kinda think it's the end of the day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  And, if we try it again, maybe in the morning.  'Cause, we did an interview six weeks ago and it was quite different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  But, actually that was with a couple of Wisconsin Steel workers.  It was for a university project.

Speaker 1: Mr. Lumpkin, I'd like to ask you, like, what do you--do you--what do you want people to know about fighting for their rights?  I mean, how do you feel about fighting for your rights and fighting for what's owed you?  I mean, you are a leader, you know, what do you want people to know about that?
Speaker 2: Well, actually what was necessary was to call meetings.  And, you knew the guys who was the most militant fighters in there.  And, you'd call 'em up and then we, we'd sit down and discuss what position we should take.  And, we did that.  But, at the same time (laughter) you had the whole business of Trumbull Park that disrupted black, white and Latino workers.  And, we was able to make meetings where we could, you know, down the street.  But, I don't know.  I don't know what the best answers and questions about this thing was.  But, as you wrote the book ['Always Bring a Crowd!: The Story of Frank Lumpkin, Steelworker' by Beatrice Lumpkin] Bea [Beatrice Lumpkin], and you talked to the workers what they felt about it.  And, when the stoppage come, they would refuse to go in, and we was able to win the grievance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, would you advocate that people organize around their own interest?
Speaker 2: (Nodding head) The big thing that I learned about man is, if you sit down and talk to 'em and you could convince 'em what can be done and get enough people together to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, I know the title of your biography is, "Always Bring a Crowd."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's the importance of that?
Speaker 2: Maybe (laughter), maybe the same thing to happen, you know, the same thing happen, you know, like and actually, Harold Washington, do you remember him, the mayor [of Chicago, Illinois]?  He was the mayor.  And, I went down to try to see Harold Washington.  And, I had met him a lot of times out in the streets and at meetings out in the place over there by 106th.  But, I got there and I couldn't get in.  Naw, we can't talk to you and talk to you.  But, that's the time I met little Ed Sadlowski [Edward Sadlowski], whose father was a big man in the steel mill (unclear).  And, we discussed the thing and then I got in and I talked to Harold Washington about what happened.  I showed him the books and what having that--and Harold come out.  He come out to one of them big meetings, Harold Washington.
Speaker 1: Ed was a union organizer?
Speaker 2: Ed Sadlowski, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, all right.
Speaker 2: But, Harold Washington would be--and he was the mayor of the city and he would come out and talk about, you know, the support they give us (unclear).  But, it wasn't, it's not as simple (laughter) incident that--at what happened at the meeting because we was an isolated situation when we went there because we wasn't, we wasn't in CIOs [Congress of Industrial Organizations], in an independent union.  And, CIOs and Public Steel and the rest of the steel mills around there.  But, we didn't get no harm from doing that to them and the whole thing.  And, well, then the next big thing we was trying to do is organize an independent group in the Wisconsin Steel and we tried to do.  But, I guess Bea wrote the book, most of it.  But, you know, and I don't know how, you're gonna put it together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, well, thank you very much and--thank you.  I mean congratulations.  I know you won a (simultaneously) victory.
Speaker 2: I don't mind reading the book (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Bea Lumpkin):  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Because, I didn't--it wasn't a planned program, you know, it was something that workers sat down and said, "This is what we're gonna do."  And, we're gonna form a picket line and nobody's gonna come through the picket line.  And, in order, we had to use this kind of an action to get action in the plan to get action from other places.

Speaker 1: (Beatrice Lumpkin):  I have one last question.  Are you still fighting?  Are you still at the union hall and if you're fighting, what are people fighting for?
Speaker 2: I don't know, Bea [Beatrice Lumpkin].  We could name a lot of things we could be fighting for.  The point of it is, my job is to try to still hold together about forty-five or fifty guys that worked a long time.  But, to tell you the truth, that a lot of the good guys died, and I'm trying to figure out where I go from here.  Because, they've given us an office in the CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations] Hall and we have rights to make meetings and what have you and support it.  But, what you have to look at is that, (laughter) what I have to look at is that things change so much.  I mean, right now to write a book about what happened twenty years ago, it would be a much different situation that we had then.  Because, you can drive by 106th and look at the old mill and everything else, but at one time, nobody could drive by that mill unless they get a brick thrown at the car, whatever.  But, they, you know, if you're lucky enough to meet some people who are really fighters in that thing, like, [Edward] Sadlowski and [Chicago mayor] Harold Washington and other guys.  I mean, what you think is all right but, if you can't sell it to the other people who are gonna help you in this fight, you're in trouble.  That's my story on Wisconsin Steel (laughter).  And, I tell you the truth, I've been in many of these struggles.  I was in the [U.S.] Merchant Marine during the World War II and I seen 'em stop, wouldn't even fire up a boiler, you know.  If you know anything, you had these things where you light the boilers on them ships.  And, workers have to stick together and not one (unclear) but let's all get together to make demand and fight for.  I don't know how to put it but, that was Wisconsin Steel at that time, but it's been many struggles before that and after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: All right.  I guess we had a lot of stuff but a lot the stuff is a slow memory (laughter).
