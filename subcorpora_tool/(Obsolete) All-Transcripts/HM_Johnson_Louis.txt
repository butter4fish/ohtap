Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother really raised me.  I was raised by my grandmother and my mother [Malisha Johnson].  My grandmother was from Newton, [North] Carolina and moved to Statesville, North Carolina with my mother.  And I went to school there, and my mother had come to, to Baltimore [Maryland] because she could get a job in Baltimore.  She and--she'd come back a lot to--we moved to Washington [D.C.], rather, and then when we got to Washington, my mother moved to Baltimore because she got a job there.  And I started staying with my grandmother until my mother could come back over.

Speaker 2: Don't forget it.
Speaker 1: And I've got it down.  I've got it down.  Now, at this stage in life, are there any other memories from Newton or Statesville, North Carolina that you can recall?
Speaker 2: Well, Statesville, I remember a lot because I, I did acrobatics a lot, just did it, automatically did that.  And my grandmother would go back to Newton, North Carolina to visit her mother a lot.  And I remember going back there.  And we'd spend our summers there with her, and a red dirt town, and out, with the outhouses.  And we would sleep on, what do you call this stuff?  Not mattresses, but the other kind.  You know, used to make the mattress out of in the early days?  And we used to have big stoves, you know, your fire stove.  You, you chop the wood and put it on to make, to heat the house.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: And your great grandmother was living at that time too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was at my great grandmother's home.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it was up high like on, on big trees, type thing, trunks of trees, and it was about nine feet high.
Speaker 1: Are there any other memories you remember from going back visiting with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Well, I did go back quite, quite a bit, like every summer.  And I used to help in whatever was necessary around the house, like chopping wood and stuff like that.  I was just a baby.  But I always liked to do and be involved with anything that was being done.
Speaker 1: And during that period--.
Speaker 2: I--.
Speaker 1: Go ahead, you were gonna say something.
Speaker 2: I remember and my, and my grandmother, she lived in, when we lived in Statesville, she had a house there, and I, I wanted a swimming pool.  So she said, "Go on and build the swimming pool."  And I began to dig up the ground to make that swimming pool, never finished, but I was going for it.

Speaker 1: Now, did you begin school in Statesville [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, did they have a kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah, kindergarten.  I remember that Mary McLeod Bethune came to the school.  I remember that I just knew she was a great lady, and we were all to, called together to hear her speak in Statesville, North Carolina.  I enjoyed it, hearing the speech, and going to the school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that elementary school where you were at kindergarten?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.  That's going back.  That's a thousand years ago.  Here you're calling me up on the phone talking about he went to elementary school.  That was something in itself.  So the Newton [North Carolina] was before I came to--I mean Statesville was before I came to New York City [New York].
Speaker 1: Are, are there any other memories there at the elementary school in Statesville?
Speaker 2: Well, as I say, I used to tumble a lot.  And they'd have--at the end of the term in school, they would have a big, sort of exhibition affair of, of whatever they did, acro--I was an acrobat, and I did acrobatics and stuff on the ladder.  And I was a little kid and, but I was able to do stuff like that.  And they used me to--well, they allowed me to do that because they were very proud of this, almost baby doing all this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was all in white, and cute (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you went to elementary school there in Statesville. Did you--were there any other grades, first grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the--.
Speaker 1: Before you came to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: --in the first grade in, in there in North Carolina or kindergarten.  Maybe it was just kindergarten cause I was so little.  And all that stuff I was doing, I was little doing it.  And if you, they saw anyone that could do anything like that, they didn't wait for you to get to be ninety and say, "You try this now."  They would let you do what you did to encourage you.
Speaker 1: So you were outstanding in acrobatics?
Speaker 2: Outstanding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In athletics, tumbling.  That's what you'll remember me from, tumbling.
Speaker 1: Okay, one of the things I did forget to ask you, or at least, I did not put it down, and you did give it to me, your date of birth?  And that was June--the date of birth?
Speaker 2: I done told you now, March 19, 1930.
Speaker 1: Okay, got it.

Speaker 1: Got you, and it's real.  Now, and so, either the first grade or the second grade you came to Washington?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you lived--?
Speaker 2: That's when I met you.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: On twelfth, no, no, twelve--what was that?
Speaker 1: Thirteenth.
Speaker 2: No, Twelfth Street, oh was (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: Thirteenth.
Speaker 2: [Francis] Cardozo [Senior High School], I mean Alshire, I mean, Garnet-Patterson [Middle School] was on Twelfth Street--.
Speaker 1: Garrison, Garrison Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Was on Twelfth Street in Washington, D.C. where I went to elementary school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I got this phone call from this gentleman saying, "Are you Louis Johnson?"  I said, "Yeah."  And he said, "This is Paul Brock.  I went to elementary school with you."  I fainted for a second, then I got up.  "Elementary school, oh, my Lord.  That's a thousand years ago."  "You remember me?"  I said, "I remember that name."  Lord, have mercy.
Speaker 1: Well, what are some of the earliest memories you have of going into Garrison then?  You were--?
Speaker 2: I remember going to Garrison.  I was always involved with arts, and I liked the arts and athletics.  I liked to play ball out in the, in the playground.  And when I was in school, I liked to do artwork, and the teachers knew that.  I later came to New York [New York] and got into the theater and was a wonderful dancer around the town.  And I got in a show called 'Damn Yankees!'.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna come back to--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: And I remember, let me tell you.  I remember this lady that taught me at Armstrong--at Garnet-Patterson Elementary School [sic, Middle School], writing and saying, "Louis, I always knew you would be something."  I'll never forget it.  Man, I can't think of her name.  You may remember it, Miss Brown.
Speaker 1: Miss Brown.
Speaker 2: She taught me at, at Garnet--,
Speaker 1: At Garnet, right.
Speaker 2: --Patterson.  And that was like nineteen one.  And then when I came in 'Damn Yankees' in 1950, I got this note from her.  And I don't know how--well, she came to see the show.  And I've always been just thrilled to hear that from Miss Brown, this note.  I had it for many years.  I moved several times, so I don't know where it is now, but I kept it--for her to say that.
Story_ID: 9202
Speaker 1: You started developing your movement abilities in elementary school.  Tell us about being in the second and third--well, as much you remember--?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to tap dance.
Speaker 1: --and the acrobatics?
Speaker 2: I tap danced around with my acrobatics, and there was a gentleman named Derwood Brent (ph.) and Melvin Hope (ph.) that tap danced.  And Derwood Brent was in charge of the New Faces Guild [NOT FOUND].  There was a thing in Washington [D.C.] called The New Faces Guild that Ralph Matthews started.  He gave a show like once a year at the Lincoln Theatre, which was the only theater that black people could go to.  And he would give a production every year, a fantastic production, tap dancing, comedians and beautiful show girls and all that kind of thing.  So I--and Melvin Hope was another young man and Miles Conte (ph.), and they would tap dance in the shows.  I was too young to, but they would let me tap with them around on the street.  So I would tap on the street with them  and some time I got older enough to be in some of those shows.  And that's how I began to dance around.  And I always did acrobatics with Nipsey Russell, Nipsey had a great tumbling team.  You could never say enough about this man.  You didn't know what he was doing then, but he was a great, great acrobat, like you see in the circus.  And he taught the young kids to do that.
Speaker 1: Now, was he teaching you at that YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]?
Speaker 2: At the YMCA and the streets.  And that's how I got involved with dance.  The YMCA was being renovated, so the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Assocation] let us use their place.  And Jones and Haywood, the ladies who found in me as a dancer, who introduced me to dancing professionally was teaching there.  And they saw us rehearsing at the YWCA, and they saw me stretching around and doing that stuff.  And they were very impressed, so they offered me a scholarship in formal dancing at the Y, you know, and I, I said, I'd love to.  And that's how it all started with me dancing.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the dance team that began teaching you?  Just give us some more details and some--?
Speaker 2: Doris [W.] Jones and Claire [Helen] Haywood?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They were two wonderful ladies that taught ballet.  And they thought I would be able to do that well, seeing me stretch and carry on.  So they invited me to take some classes at their school and gave me a scholarship and cleaning up their house like once a week.  And I'd come and take dance classes there, and I did.  And it introduced me to ballet and formal dancing properly.  And I fell in love with it, but I kept my tumbling going on, and that's how I got involved with dance; came to New York [New York].  They sent me to New York City to the School of American Ballet.  That's George Balanchine's school at the time; the finest training in ballet you could get anywhere in the world.  And I went on, carried on.
Story_ID: 9203
Speaker 1: I wanted to go back to Newton, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Newton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And tell me what was, what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Cedric Johnson, you mean Statesville, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, Statesville, okay, Cedric Johnson?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you--.
Speaker 2: My father's passed away--years ago, when I was very young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your, your father was, was born in Statesville or born in Newton?
Speaker 2: I think my father was born in, in Statesville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because his family was very, sort of educated.  I remember his sister.  She taught school, and I used to love to go to her house because she had a piano, and I used to bang on the piano.  And she'd let me do it.
Speaker 1: What are your, some of your earliest memories about your father there?  Any--?
Speaker 2: Well, my father and mother [Malisha Johnson] separated very early.  And so I don't have many memories of my father.  He was very athletic.  And I know he used to have a motorcycle, and ride around on a motorcycle a lot.  I don't have many memories of him, him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When we moved to Washington [D.C.], he came to see us once and took me out to like a movie or dinner.  But I was just about eight years old.  And he just took me with him, maybe to the movie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't see my father very much when I was young.
Story_ID: 9204
Speaker 1: Bringing it back up to where you were living on Thirteenth Street [Washington, D.C.], with your grandmother [Nellie Thomas] and your mother [Malisha Johnson] is working in, in Baltimore [Maryland] during this period.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you're getting very interested in tumbling or acrobatics and dance, and being an artist or doing your art and painting and so forth?
Speaker 2: They were my things in those days.  I was always, I always loved the arts, music, dance, drawing, and, as you knew--you knew me then, drawing and tumbling at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  There was a young man named Russell, Nipsey as I said, had, he trained young kids to, in the acrobats and what they did, and he would take it to another level, you know.  And we did that around the city, in the schools and clubs and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, the, the--we may not have gone into where you developed your interest in art because at that time, that was before high school, and you were still in elementary school.  Was there one person or a group of individuals that stimulated your interests in art?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, I--when I went to Armstrong High School [Washington, D.C.], which was a technical high school, the first of its kind at that time, I chose art to go into, to, at Armstrong.  That was Armstrong High School.  And the teachers that I had was Ms. Webber (ph.) and Lucille Roberts.  And Ms. Roberts was a dear--became a very dear friend and a wonderful lady, and encouraged my artwork all the time.  And she also encouraged my dancing because I was--I loved the arts, and I was very good in the arts, painting, dancing and tumbling.  So she encouraged them all, whatever it was.  And I won quite a few contests under her.  I mean countrywide contests, painting and doing things.  And [Doris W.] Jones and [Claire Helen] Haywood, the dancers, had taken over that painting at that time, and they got, gave me a scholarship with another young lady named Chita Rivera to come to the School of American Ballet [New York, New York].  And so I did that and continued by studying, and--.
Speaker 1: This was while you were still in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I had graduated.
Speaker 1: You'd graduated?
Speaker 2: I had grad--as soon as I graduated, they sent me to the School of American Bal--School of American Ballet.  That was George Balanchine's school at the time.  So I was here struggling to make my way and to, whatever.
Speaker 1: And now, Doris Jones, of course, is well known for a number of famous people that she has developed--?
Speaker 2: Who is that, Doris Jones?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, they were wonderful ladies.  They were fantastic ballet teachers, the best you could ever have.  And they knew that you--they wanted to send their students to the next step that they could go to like New York and the major dance schools and companies.  And they did that.  A lot of wonderful dancers came out of there, Hinton Battle, Hope Clark, Renee Robinson, Sylvester Campbell was fantastic.  Sylvester was a brilliant dancer.  There was no place for blacks in ballet in those days.  He went to Europe and became the prima dancer.  That's the person that does the lead roles like in 'Swan Lake' and things like that.  And they taught Sylvester, and he went to Europe, and became a huge success, came back to this country; couldn't get in no company, ballet, theater or New York City ballet.  And he was prima.  That means like, what are you gonna say?  The top in the dance, ballet dance world.
Story_ID: 9205
Speaker 1: And your fortunes were a little bit different as you moved to New York [New York] and started training under--?
Speaker 2: And mine was about the same.  They didn't want no black people around in those ballet companies on in those times [early 1950s].  I was at the American School [sic, School of American Ballet].  I was the only one there.  That was before Arthur came, and Jerry [Jerome Robbins]--.
Speaker 1: Arthur?
Speaker 2: Robbins used me in, in the New York City Ballet.
Speaker 1: You said before Arthur, but you meant?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arthur came about a year after I did.
Speaker 1: Last name?
Speaker 2: And we were very good friends.  We, at the School of American Ballet.
Speaker 1: Okay, last name of-- Arthur's last name?
Speaker 2: Arthur Mitchell.
Speaker 1: Arthur Mitchell, right, right.  Okay--.
Speaker 2: And I knew him.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: And I know him now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you and Arthur Mitchell were the only African Americans in, in the school?
Speaker 2: Well, what is African, I don't know.  They had a lot--there was Frank [Francisco] Moncion who was from, from the islands, and that, you could say, were, black people.  But I, I really stuck around.  Talley Beatty had been through there for a short while.  But I was there for quite a while.  I stayed there and was excellent.  I was in class with people like Jacques d'Amboise, Edward Villella, Melissa Hayden, the ballerina among us, and Maria Tallchief, Tanaquil LeClerq, [George] Balanchine's wife and all those people that were, I was in class with those people.
Story_ID: 9206
Speaker 1: My first job was in 'Four Saints in Three Acts'. [1952]  It was an operetta by Virgil Thomson, Gertrude Stein.  I was in it, Arthur Mitchell was it, and Bob Curtis, a wonderful dancer and Helen Tate and Billie Allen who's become--have you heard of Billie Allen, a great directress we have now and became a fine actress.  Oh, Lord, to think about those, back about those times.
Story_ID: 9207
Speaker 1: You're studying under George Balanchine, and you are--?
Speaker 2: The school, the school, American School of Ballet [sic, School of American Ballet, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: American School of Ballet, and you are hoping for the big break.
Speaker 2: Hoping for a big break.  That's life.  We hope for a big break every day. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Absolutely, until you get to be a hundred.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've been very fortunate about, I've had some wonderful things happen.  I mean things, (unclear) I think (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: What, what--where did, when was your first big break?
Speaker 2: I'm still looking for it, I'm still looking for it, waiting for it.
Speaker 1: Well, you appeared on Broadway [neighborhood in New York] in 'Four Saints in Three Acts' [in 1952].
Speaker 2: That was a great break.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: That happened by--now, what happened with that?  George Balanchine [sic, William Dollar] choreographed that, and he knew that I had went to the American School, and most of the people that were in it, dance-wise, Billie Allen, Arthur Mitchell, had touched through the school at one time or another.  And I was still there.  So naturally, a choreographer likes to use people that he know, know them and know how they work. So he hired us.  And there were about four of us.  The people, all the people that he used were from the American School.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got it from him knowing that you were at the American School?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 9208
Speaker 1: Was your next work that you did in 'House of Flowers' [1954]?
Speaker 2: I think the next thing I did Broadway [neighborhood in New York] was 'House'--oh, and--'House of Flowers', yes, because I did, I had begun to choreograph.  And I did concerts at the YM-YWHA [Young Men's-Young Women's Hebrew Association], which a lot of--it was a, a lot of people did their concerts there.  And it was a place you could do things.  And I began to do joint concerts.  I did one with Geoffrey Holder cause he had just come to this, to the country.  And he was also--Geoffrey was in 'House of Flowers'.  Geoffrey is a great artist, great pi-pianist, great musician, great dancer, great actor, fantastic talent, a dear friend.  And he met Carmen DeLavallade in 'House of Flowers'.  So many of us met there at 'House of Flowers'.  It, it brought a lot of people, that remain friends there; it brought Geoffrey Holder, Carmen De Lavallade, Alvin Ailey--that's how he got here was 'House of Flowers'.  Walter Nicks was in that show.  Arthur Mitchell was in that show, Diahann Carroll, it was her introduction to Broadway.  She, young girl.  And that was it.
Speaker 1: What, what was Geoffrey Holder like?  I'll start with, with him and ask about--(unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Geoffrey Holder was like he is today.  He's a wonderful human being, and he remains yet and I think he will because he just is; great artist, not there's one--one idiom like that.  He's in all of that, they'll say in painting, acting, dancing, music.  He has all of that, and he does all of that.  And he works at all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how about Carmen De Lavallade, what was--?
Speaker 2: So is Carmen, a fantastic actress, a dancer.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other people in 'House of Flowers' that are--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You, you had Diahann Carroll, just now--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Diahann.
Speaker 1: And you met her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and her husband, Monte Kay, really were very influential in my beginning days of choreography and dance.  They were very, very wonderful to me and helped me in those things.  Monte Kay was a producer, and he produced the Modern Jazz Quartet as long as they existed.  And he would always use me to do something on their concerts with a partner.  And I did one, a couple with Jack Wolcott, who was another great dancer that had been in the [Katherine] Dunham company.  And it just led to one thing after the other.
Speaker 1: Now, how about describing your role in the 'House of Flowers'?
Speaker 2: I was a dancer in the 'House of Flowers'.  I had begun to choreograph, and that's how Monte saw my work and thought it was wonderful.  So he wanted to encourage that more, so he gave me a job, working jobs, working with the Modern Jazz Quartet, and I was doing concerts at the YM-YWHA, and I used all the dancers in those, from 'House of Flowers', cause it was very special.  The people in it were very special.  The talent was very special.  So they wanted to do other things, and there weren't a lot of things for black people to do in those days.  'House of Flowers' was an all-black show, except for Ray Walston.  And you had to find your ways of making ways.  So I tried to find those by choreographing to make avenues for all these beautiful black dancers and talents in some of my works at the YM-YWHA, and I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First ballet I, I ever did, I used Arthur in it and--.
Speaker 1: Arthur Mitchell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arthur Mitchell, I used in it, and Claude Thompson, who was another wonderful dancer.  One leads to the other.  One, one job led to another and being at the Dunham School [of Dance and Theater, New York, New York] too, you meet so many wonderful black dancers there.  And I had a lot of white friends too that were very wonderful to me at American School of Ballet [sic, School of American Ballet, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used them, and they wanted me to use them, you know.
Story_ID: 9209
Speaker 1: Following your work in 'House of Flowers' [1954], was that where your break came with 'Damn Yankees' or did that come next?
Speaker 2: Let me see, I, I, I went into another show called 'My Darlin' Aida' [1952].  And that was a wonderful, wonderful people.  Elaine Malbin was the star of that, and Joe Nash was in that, and Walter Nicks was in that with me, and Billie [Allen] was in that also.  And Claude Thompson. Then I got into 'Damn Yankees' [1955] with Gwen Verdon, one of the greatest Broadway [neighborhood in New York] artists you'll ever know, fantastic.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did, how did your transition happen to come about?
Speaker 2: Choreographing?
Speaker 1: Well, no, in 'Damn Yankees', your work in the 'Damn Yankees'?
Speaker 2: How did that come about?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Well, at the American School [sic, School of American Ballet, New York, New York], I had had--several friends there, a lot of friends.  And I--and they all would encourage me to go to the auditions.  And there was a young man named George Lake that was in my class, and he had become a stage manager of 'Damn Yankees', one of the stage managers.  [James] Jimmy Hammerstein was the main, advocate, MSC or whatever it is, the top stage manager of that.  And George had asked me to come this audition for 'Damn Yankees', and I said, "No, George," because I knew they were not hiring black people.  And they didn't do that in those days.  Today there are ten--tons of black people in shows, shaking they booty, but in today, they don't have--I mean those days, it didn't happen.  And they weren't gonna hire you. So Jimmy had seen me dancing in one of June Taylor's shows.  June Taylor did, on the 'Jackie Gleason Show'.  She was a choreographer for the 'Jackie Gleason Show'.  And she did a, all-black show on his show called 'Tony', and Jimmy Hammerstein had seen the rehearsal of that and he was very impressed with my dancing.  So he asked George to have me come to the audition.  And I came to the audition after about three times of turning it down.  And he hired me.  Bob Fosse hired me.  There were a lot of people there, but he hired.
Speaker 1: Bob Fosse was the choreographer for 'Damn Yankees'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bob Fosse was the choreographer of 'Damn Yankees'.
Speaker 1: And we all know Bob Fosse.  Okay, and so they hired you the first time you--?
Speaker 2: That's how I got into 'Damn Yankees'  I auditioned, and was chosen.  There were a lot of people there, but I was chosen for this part.  This part--Timmy Everett had been in the show, and the show had opened about a week or two.  And it was a big hit.  And Timmy Everett had got the lead in 'Music Man', one of the lead kids.  So they were auditioning for this lead dancer in 'Damn Yankees'.  And so I auditioned, and that's how that came about.
Speaker 1: Okay--.
Speaker 2: That's how that, and me in the movie ['Damn Yankees', 1958] came about also.
Story_ID: 9210
Speaker 1: Were there any influences that helped you besides Ms. [Doris W.] Jones?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think friends, friends and people like Ms. Jones helped.  I was a young man in a field that there weren't many blacks in at that time, as I said.  And they saw this.  So they would encourage it.  Like Diahann Carroll and Monte Kay, they encouraged it.  Miles Davis encouraged it, you know, and things like--they see this young, black boy with all of this talent, and they say, "What you gonna do?"  And they will find, try to find ways and make ways to use it.  And not just dance-wise.  I, I was, had become quite a choreographer at the time.  And they thought it should be used.  And they wanted to help me use it, and they did.
Speaker 1: The, the--.
Speaker 2: And I'll always be appreciative of that.
Speaker 1: So even though this was Diahann Carroll's first Broadway [neighborhood in New York] show, she and her husband, Monte--.
Speaker 2: They got married [1956] during the time she was in the show.
Speaker 1: Oh, so they got married during that period?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, he was a producer, and he produced a lot of jazz things and shows.
Speaker 1: But, but they sort of adopted you and sort of tried to help you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they encouraged it.
Speaker 1: --and encouraged you.  So when you went to 'Damn Yankees', here you are standing on the precipice of history because it was something that major Broadway musicals simply did not do in those days.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You, you knew you were standing on the precipices of history.  Bob Fosse--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know nothing.  I just got a job, and I was up there jumping and kicking or whatever they wanted me to do, I could do it well.  And they knew this, so the, all the people--a lot of people that went to American School of Ballet [sic, School of American Ballet, New York, New York] were great dancers.  So they did the choreography, and they were in shows and things.  And they encouraged, encouraged me being helped.  And I don't know anything about those things.
Speaker 1: What was the reception like among the other dancers and other individuals besides--?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, I saw ahead--.
Speaker 1: And tell--?
Speaker 2: --some of my dearest friends are still, from the American School, and, and [Katherine] Dunham School [of Dance and Theater, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dearest friends were from there.
Speaker 1: So they embraced you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I made wonderful friends, Walter Nicks, who was a great Dunham teacher, and Maggie Newman who also was a great Dunham teacher and dancing my first ballet 'Lament', and Dee Dee Wood, they, they became very big celebrities.  Dee Dee Wood choreographed the, not the last one, but three, three world's Olympics things and TV shows and things like that.  And that happens to dancers.  They--Joe Nash used to always tease me cause he said, I'd say, "You take one class and then you end up coming--the next day you got your own company.  Next, you're producing."
Story_ID: 9211
Speaker 1: You had a successful career there in the Broadway [neighborhood in New York] play, 'Damn Yankees,' and then that went to--?
Speaker 2: I didn't know that I was successful.  I knew I was just doing the dances well.
Speaker 1: They didn't fire you so you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, I could do--the kids today are very young, and they know, they want to make a dollar.  And if they can do this--"Well, I can do just as well as you can--," (unclear) that's what happens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Today, they want to make the money, and if they can do it half as well as you could, they want to go on and do that half and get the money.
Story_ID: 9212
Speaker 1: Then they, they decided to do the, the Broadway [neighborhood in New York]--they were doing the Broadway show [of 'Damn Yankees'], and they wanted to do a film version [1958]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's when you went out--?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the first time we didn't use a lot of people from the original Broadway cast.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: And so, it was wonderful.  I, usually in Broadway cast they, they would use Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] people.  But they used--in 'Damn Yankees,' they used Gwen Verdon to star in it.  They usually take a Hollywood star like, like Cyd Charisse and do it.  But to use Gwen and to use some of the people that were, the men that were, they--baseball players, and I was one of the baseball players.  And the number that he did for the baseball number was, was outstanding.  So they wanted, they didn't want to spend a lot of time, you have to pay a lot of money to have somebody stay like a week or two a month to learn and everything.  They could take, who already knew it out there and do it.  And that's what they did.  'Damn Yankees' was a great experience.  It was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Now, while you were in Hollywood doing the film version, was 'Damn Yankees' then going on the road or was it still on Broadway?
Speaker 2: I don't think 'Damn Yankees' was on the road.  It had closed.  It opened back up years later with Lewi--I wasn't dancing then, but it was Jerry Lewis, I understand.  But I was out there, and I did, and I did it.  Geoffrey [Holder] had--no, after 'House of Flowers' [1954] Geoffrey choreographed a TV show, and that he used a lot of the people from 'House of Flowers' in.  And when I was out there, I spent some time with Brock too, Brock Peters was a dear friend.  He was also in 'My Darlin' Aida' [1952] that I did.
Story_ID: 9213
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go on to 'Hallelujah Baby' [1967], that followed your ascent there?
Speaker 2: 'Hallelujah Baby' I wasn't dancing.  No, I hadn't danced in a little while.  And I was asked to come into that cause I--they knew who, they knew of my--the young man that choreographed it, Kevin Carlisle, I did the first 'Modern Jazz Quartet' thing, I had used him as a dancer because he even became a cari--choreographer.  And he'd become a choreographer for the 'Garry Moore Show' [television program], and he had choreographed 'Damn Yankees', and he was replacing somebody.  Well, he needed a standby, and one name leads to another.  And a lot of people knew of my name, and they recommended me highly.  And I became the standby in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That means if somebody's out, you go in their place.  And I stood in for Alan Weeks and another young man, I'm--Winston [DeWitt] Helmsley.  They were called 'Tip and Tap', and they had a specialty number in there.  And I was on all the time.  I said, Oh, Lord, at least I'll get a chance to rest.  Every time you look around, they say, Louis, get ready, get in your costume cause you're on tonight.  So that--.
Speaker 1: So that way, you were quickly moving from being a dancer to being a choreographer?  And your first ballet was 'Lament'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, that was at the YMCA, YM-YWHA [Young Men's-Young Women's Hebrew Association].  I had done a solo that was, that--called 'Harlequin', which I used my acrobatics and dancing in it.  And it was outstanding.  And I forget the man's name.  How can I forget this man--he was a great producer of, of artists.  And he recommended that I would be on a show that they did on Broadway.  They used to do a show on Broadway where they used a lot of very fine talent to show them, to ex--to show their talent.  And he insisted that they did solo 'Harlequin' of mine.  And I forget this man's name.  I'll think of it.  He was a great, great, great impresario at that time.  He--and that's how it started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My 'Lament' [1965], you're talking about 'Lament'?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, also during that, the man who--I said made me do 'Harlequin' also was named Mr. Koreff.  I remember him.  He was Nora Kaye's father.  Nora Kaye was a great big ballerina at that time.  And he gave this thing called 'New York City Ballet Club' every year.  And he insisted I do a piece.  So I, I did a piece called 'Lament' that I had heard the music of Bachiana Brasileira of Villa-Lobos.  So I did that, and it was a big success at the Y.  Then I began to do ballets.  They, they, they liked it, the audiences did, and people did and talked--it was the talk--.
Story_ID: 9214
Speaker 1: And that [choreographing 'Lament'] led to 'Black Nativity' and 'Lost in the Stars' [1972]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Langston Hughes had seen it, I think, and he called me and asked me to do--(unclear) was directing it.  And he said, we need our help on this.  So he called me in to put some dance into it.  And I did with Cleo Quitman, Bernard Johnson's wife, and Clive Thompson.  That was their first jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you choreo--you did the choreography?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the original 'Black Nativity', I did it.  I created that Mary and Joseph and all that.
Speaker 1: And the 'Lost in the Stars' was your next--?
Speaker 2: 'Lost in the Stars' was a wonderful experience too.  It produced by Roger [L.] Stevens of the, the founder of the [John F.] Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I choreographed that, and it played in Washington [D.C] at the Kennedy Center and went on to, I think it was Canada, some, some theater in Canada or Boston [Massachusetts].  And it ran quite a while, wonderful cast; Gilbert Price.  Gilbert Price, he was a great, great singer, and a lot of wonderful people in there.
Speaker 1: What was your experience like with Roger Stevens because you weren't doing--?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, Roger was very helpful to me.  I did 'Treemonisha' [1975] that came from the Houston [Texas] Grand Opera, he, he'd produced that, brought it to the Kennedy Center, and it went on to Broadway.  He also did 'Lost in the Stars' which I choreographed.  And I was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for six years.  I taught there, and I did a wonderful show there called 'Niggers [a Musical Comedy, 1975]', the best show they ever seen.  And actually, he was helpful in trying to get me some backers for 'Niggers'.  And 'Niggers' was a fantastic show.
Story_ID: 9215
Speaker 1: We don't want to skip over that experience of you being, and teaching at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and being the head of that department.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I--the department that's there now, I started that department.
Speaker 1: What year are we talking about there?
Speaker 2: I think it was around '79 [1979], '78 [1978] because I left and had to do the movie 'The Wiz' at the time.  And I was at Howard for six years, another wonderful student, Kiki Shepard up there in the picture.  You've seen Kiki at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York], put the hand over their head and--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Lynn Whitfield, you've seen her, they were all students at the time.
Speaker 1: And they've gone on to greater things.
Speaker 2: Brian, Brian Chandler, huh?
Speaker 1: Kiki and Lynn.
Speaker 2: Lynn and people like that.  They've done the shows and things.  Marva Hicks, fantastic.
Speaker 1: Now, was, was that--?
Speaker 2: Brian, Brian Chandler, I'm trying to think of some these other people.  Some wonderful damn people.
Story_ID: 9216
Speaker 1: That comes to the great Broadway [neighborhood in New York] musical you did, 'Purlie' [1970-1971].
Speaker 2: Yeah, what about it?
Speaker 1: Well, I want you to tell us about it, how it happened?
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Purlie' was my first Broadway show, the choreographing of 'Purlie'.
Speaker 1: How did they happen to come and select you?
Speaker 2: They came to select me because of my work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Philip] Phil Rose had seen my work and had heard my name.  And he wanted me to do it.  It was that simple.  He called and said that, that's what happened.  As you know, great things, and he went on, wanted to do it, and he called me, and I went and worked on it and had the greatest arrangers in the world, Luther Henderson, Joyce Brown and Patty Brown, fantastic.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Melba Moore, fantastic, Cleavon [Little]--.
Speaker 1: Little.
Speaker 2: Linda Hopkins.
Speaker 1: It was an all-star cast or what would have--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, an all-star cast, yeah, the--.
Speaker 1: --today, it would be, it would be an all-star cast, but under your choreography and everything, all of them shined and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the play or the musical received a Tony Award [for theatrical excellence] nomination?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, but I, I was nominated [1970].
Speaker 1: What, what year?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: But what?
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year we're talking about?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that--.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) we're trying to get chronology?
Speaker 2: --I don't, I don't remember that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's (unclear).
Speaker 2: But it was nominated.
Story_ID: 9217
Speaker 1: You've also done choreography for the 'Ed Sullivan Show', Radio City Music Hall [New York, New York], Peter Allen and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and real, it was, and really, I've really been lucky in many ways.  These jobs I've gotten, I haven't had to audition nothing or show a film or anything.  The Sullivan office called, said, "We want you to choreograph this show."  It was a thing with the Temptations.  And so I used five other girls, wonderful girls, Mabel Robinson, Eleanor McCoy, who is that?  Sally O'Neil and Mrs. Brewer, and that's how the Sullivan came about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They just called.  The Metropolitan Opera [New York, New York], they just called me and said, they want you to choreograph this, our new, pro--new production of 'Aida' [1976] starring Leontyne Price.  That's fantastic in itself.  I mean, the Met and Leontyne Price, the greatest voice that ever was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Oh, what are you gonna say?
Speaker 1: So you said, "Yes."  You said those (unclear) words?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I said, "Yes--Hold on!" (laughter)
Speaker 1: And Aretha Franklin, you've worked with her.  And you (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--Yeah, for ten years I worked with Aretha--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Unclear) relationship?
Speaker 2: --another great lady, yeah, incredible.  (Chuckle) Aretha is a great lady.  It's--she calls, I call.  She has, you have her number to call her.  And she then she'd say, I say, cause I have a, of a line that--not a line, this is the truth.  I did her show, one of the shows at the City, [New York] City Center.  And this man who was a doorman was there, and Aretha's standing right there, and I'm standing here.  And this doorman opened and said, "I want to meet that lady, Aretha Franklin.  Is she gonna be around here?  What time does she go on?"  I said, "You want to meet her?  There she is right there."  He said, "Is that her?"  (Laughter).  So the reason I have a wonderful line, I told this to Aretha, and so when Aretha calls me, she say, "Is that him?"
Speaker 1: You were also invited by the Metropolitan Opera to choreograph the op--both operas, 'Aida,' of course, and--?
Speaker 2: 'LaGiaconda' [1975].
Speaker 1: 'LaGiaconda'.  And by this time, you're, you're developing a international name for yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so they don't ask--.
Speaker 2: I had done that, I had, I had had that already because when I--we went to Europe with 'Four Saints in Three Acts'.  And they changed directors there.  Orson Welles directed it and, and asked me to choreograph it.  So I had been known to do that, and then I went with the Modern Jazz Quartet, and I also went with John Lewis, that was wonderful, fantastic.
Speaker 1: Now, did you work directly with Orson Welles at that time?
Speaker 2: I did then, yeah.  He came in as director of 'Four Saints' in, in Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was that experience like?  Do you remember much about him?
Speaker 2: Not much of it because he just did his work, and I did my work, and he would let that go as it was.  And he liked it, so he didn't say anything bad about it.  So that's what happened.  And one experience, I did--Gertrude Stein, who wrote the lyrics for that, fantastic going to her home in Paris, fantastic.
Speaker 1: Now, the movies, we're going to get into the movies that you've choreographed, and--.
Speaker 2: I ain't done a whole lot of movies like--?
Speaker 1: Well, you did 'Cotton Comes to Harlem' [1970].
Speaker 2: --I did one or two.
Speaker 1: Harlem, yeah, 'Cotton Comes to Harlem', dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, fabulous, fantastic job.
Story_ID: 9218
Speaker 1: How do you approach your work?  You've been so successful on a number of Broadway [neighborhood in New York] plays and films and everything, but there's a unique Louis Johnson approach to that job.  When you're hired to do a job--?
Speaker 2: Well, the approach is you, what you feel about the project.  I've done so many different projects from Broadway to movies to, to what is it, jazz shows, and to different other projects, ballets and different companies, and you have to know some of these things about the things or the people.  And it tells you what to do, you know, like who you're gonna work with.  And that tells you, this gonna be that kind of person or it's gonna be that kind of person.  And you have a script, and it tells you a story, but they want that story to go another way.  You have to get your head to go in another way and give that to them and see if they approve and go on from there.
Speaker 1: So would it be fair to say that the first thing that you try to do is get your head moving in the same direction--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as the director?
Speaker 2: Well, getting the direction that's wanted, yeah, the director wants if you're working with the director.  Sometimes you are the director, and you have to do it yourself.  So you must do this, and it makes it much easier in working, in the, work, working process.  You aren't fighting all the time, where you have it, and you've mellowed together in the same thing, you know how it's gonna come out.
Speaker 1: So would it also be fair to say that you also have to get your head moving in the same direction as the producer of the--?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.  The producers and the director are the top people.  So you get your head, knowing that it's gonna please them.  It will cause you less headaches.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  What would be the major difference between working with, let's say, an Orson Welles and Bob Fosse, for instance?
Speaker 2: Well, that's different cause Orson Welles is a director.  He, he's a drama man and Bob Fesse--Bob Fosse is a dance man.  So when you're going in with a drama man, you know, he's gonna be about dramatics of it.  And if you're going with Bob Fosse, you know he's gonna be around dancing and good technique and stuff like that.  So you try to please that, and that makes them happy.  So your work in your mind, your concept has to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, like in, you know this is a drama man, you got to make a little drama.  But make a little drama so that it please him and you, and get your head into that direction, and it works.  But when it doesn't work, you're going against a director or producers way, they want to see it.  And that's why people hire--when they hire someone, they hire someone they know is gonna give them what they want to see.
Story_ID: 9219
Speaker 1: I was to choreograph 'Jamaica' [1957].  David Merrick did not want me to choreograph 'Jamaica', period.  He saw everybody in the world, a lot of people.  But Harold Arlen and [Edgar Yipsel] 'Yip' Harburg did.  And they'd, as a matter of fact, I had to do, repeat a concert at the YM-YWHA [Young Men's-Young Women's Hebrew Association] so that the director could see it, and he approved of it.  And, but I had done a concert that Yip Harburg and, and Harold Arlen had seen, and they liked what I did.  And they liked my feeling of, in my choreography, they--so they wanted me to choreograph very badly.  As a matter of fact, I heard they never saw the 'Jamaica', it was on Broadway because--I know they drove--Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg drove me down to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to see the one before they opened in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Let's go into yours, you said, David Merrick did not want you to do it, and by now, you are a well-recognized, accomplished choreographer.  So let me ask--what was in David Merrick's--?
Speaker 1: I was on my, I was on, I was on my way then.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was David Merrick's objection to your doing the--?
Speaker 1: Well, he was just, just didn't want a black man to do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was a black man, this black man.  He didn't want me to do it.  It was that simple.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, of course, we both know Arlen and Yip Harburg who's one of our great heroes.
Speaker 1: Yes, with the music, yes.  They're, they're wonderful, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, so they were in, in your corner fight, fighting for you.
Story_ID: 9220
Speaker 1: Let's go back to 'Purlie' [1970] for just one moment, to just examine.  Working with some of the dancers in 'Purlie,' for instance, do you have to just treat them with kid gloves or do you have to just them to respect you and your talents enough so they--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: No, I think that they respected that in the beginning, in, when they were hired because I knew a lot of them, and when I hired them, I knew their qualities and how--what their techniques and ability was.  So I hired them for that, you know, that's, that's how it happened in 'Purlie', extraordinary group of dancers.
Speaker 1: Now, it's a little bit different.  Now, we're talking about 'The Wiz' [motion picture, 1978] and we're talking about dramatic actors, actresses, and--as well as very talented dancers.
Speaker 2: Well, today, see, you have to a triple threat today.  I'm doing this show, I'm helping Maurice in the bit--.
Speaker 1: Maurice Hines?
Speaker 2: And he's auditioning, he's--Maurice Hines, a dear friend, and he tells him every day, I want a triple threat person that can sing, dance and act well, and they can do it today that way, they really can.  And that's what I--I didn't, and there, and in, in 'The Wiz' you just needed dancers because the drama, the story was told by Diana [Ross] and Michael [Jackson] and Ted [Ross] and--but that was a tremendous experience, one of my greatest experiences because we--so many fantastic dancers.  I, I don't really like auditions because you have to turn down some fantastic people when the director or the producer wants a certain type, a look.  And they, they may not, they may be able to sing well and dance well, but they don't have the look that person wants.  But see dancers just have--I just wanted a good dancer.  And I hired that, and I had tons of them.  I had the best dancers you could ever see in the world in 'The Wiz', and I'm very grateful to that.  And they were that.
Speaker 1: And the awards that followed, of course, reflected the--?
Speaker 2: Awards, yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, if you say award.  I'm not looking for awards.  I just hope it comes out good.  And that turned out wonderfully.  It really did.
Story_ID: 9221
Speaker 1: Now, thinking back as you started to develop your style as a choreographer, what, what, what was it that, in your style, that you were trying to, trying to get?
Speaker 2: Well, I--well, style is what the, what the project wants.  I wasn't looking for a style like Alvin [Ailey], he used the [Lester] Horton technique as a style, as his basis.  And, but you have to think of what's, you know, if you're working with the Temptations, you know their styles.  They had to work with [Charles] Cholly Atkins, my dear, the--one of the greatest in the, in, ever, Cholly Atkins, he was the choreographer for the Temptations [R & B singing group].  And I knew what they, would, would go well on them.  So that's that.  Now, like in, in the concept for 'Aida' [opera, 1976], I knew it.  John Dexter, who was director, great dance director, great director, gave me the challenge of life.  He wanted me to, to try out for a scene, which is done usually with tons of people.  He wanted me to do it with just two men, gladiator fighters.  So I had to make that equal about forty dancers dancing, and all that kind of thing, with two people, and still bring down the house.  And I did that with that scene.  So you get your head together to it, and you're just--it's a lot of mental and thinking work on whatever you have to do.  Like in '[The] Wiz' [motion picture, 1978], I knew that certain scenes would be, have to be big.  Some would have to be small, but you had to get that excitement all the time.  You had to bring your own things into that to know that you want it to be exciting so that people like it, and say, that was wonderful.
Story_ID: 9222
Speaker 1: And the, in the cart--'Cotton Comes to Harlem' [motion picture, 1970], did you meet any challenges that you were able to solve or had not solved, right?
Speaker 2: Not really because I had Mabel Robinson, and she was doing the, it was a strip that the--Sam Goldwyn wanted to do.  And he told me this idea which was tired, a tired idea.  So I told him a wonderful idea, and he did it.  And he told everybody about it like he'd done it.  He going around outside--after I told him, he'd go out there, yeah, well, this is my idea.  And I just told him about it.  So, and Mabel Robinson is incredible.  She, you saw her name.  Mabel Robinson was my assistant on 'The Wiz' [motion picture, 1978] and 'Treemonisha' [1975] and in 'Purlie' [1970], a great, great artist.  And what more can I say?  She did this strip number in 'Cotton Comes to Harlem', and it was my idea just to bring the cotton, bail of cottons there and all that.  And, but we had the strip--it was supposed to be how this lady did a strip that her people were proud of, could connect to.  And the lady that designed the costume helped me out a lot on that cause she did just what I'd liked to have had, what I wanted, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, you, you worked with the O'Jays, and--.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was wonderful.  I'd always loved the O'Jays and my dear friend, Ca--[Charles] Cholly Atkins and I said--Cholly is the one, I always say, this--you see all those dancers on the television now, with these singers, there's not a singer on today doesn't have three or four dancers behind them.  Cholly started that, Cholly Atkins was the, was the man, man, they called him Pops at Motown [Records].  He was hired at Motown when Barry Gordy started it.  He choreographed the Temptations, the Supremes, the O'Jays [R & B singing groups], and many others, it was a style, well, just dance, which is--that's the style behind these singers.  He created that.  I always told him, and he said, "Oh, Louis," but he's the one that created that.  You don't see a dancer today without four or five, doing some dancing.
Speaker 1: Right.  So he is the father of that technique?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And that's what they called him, father.  He is the father of that.  He passed last year unfortunately, wonderful man.  And I had known Cholly before he went to Motown.
Speaker 1: Well, he left us a wonderful legacy.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: The O'Jays, of course--.
Speaker 2: Fantastic, fantastic.  That sound.
Speaker 1: Now, you were involved in, in working them a great deal, so you can take credit for some of their success.
Speaker 2: The father and son too.  Did you hear about the father--the O'Jays had a father and son team, Gerald Levert and his father [Eddie Levert], his group, the O'Jays.  That's the father and son too.  I--Cholly called me in to choreograph that.  He said because you, you're the one that will do what I like to do.  And I always will be so grateful to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were fabulous, the O'Jays--oh, I loved them, you know, what are you gonna say?  And Gerald Levert, you know.  They were all wonderful.
Speaker 1: So you, you--.
Speaker 2: To work with those artists like that, and you're an artist, things would work out.  Same thing with Aretha [Franklin], we worked out fine too.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's just a shame that a lot of people never hear of these people, so it's good that you have mentioned them, and--?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't think people the name Mabel Robinson, Ray--.
Speaker 2: Oh, Mabel's a fantastic artist.  She's a greater dancer.  She went to Juilliard, graduated from Juilliard.  And she was many years at the North Carolina School of the Arts [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  And she was my assistant on 'Purlie', on 'Treemonisha' that I did.  And you saw her do the dance in 'Cotton Comes to Harlem'.  She danced with Lester Wilson, another choreographer, this past time in California.  She did a lot of work, but yeah, but Mabel was fantastic.  I mean a lot of people like that.  I guess you, like you say, you don't hear their names a lot, dropped every minute.  But they're great.
Speaker 1: Well, we want you to drop those, we want you to drop those names.

Speaker 1: Was it the Atlanta Ballet Theater?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I, it was already there.  I was asked to do a ballet there, and I did that ballet called 'Rocking to the Point' [sic, 'Turn to the Point'] because the man who is the artistic director of the company, his son managed a rock group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he had some rock music, but I had to take his music and make a score.  And the name, I did a ballet and called 'Rocking to the Point', and that's what happened there.  It was a big success there, big successful, 'Rocking to the Point'.  I did a ballet for the Atlanta ballet.  That was a major company in Atlanta [Georgia], an all-white company.
Speaker 1: Okay, any particular events that we should--.
Speaker 2: I thought you were talking about the Dance Theater of Harlem [New York, New York], I did that.  Then, then a little piece that was there, their signature piece called 'Forces of Rhythm' [1972] which is fantastic, I must say so myself.  And the kids who did it were just brilliant.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, so, but, but they--.
Speaker 2: Um?
Speaker 1: But they did, they did your ballet that you had developed and, and created.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Atlanta.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a big success for them.  They have nothing to do with one another.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the beginning of a Negro Ensemble Company too.  I was not an actor of anything.  I was head of the whole dance department.  In their productions, there was dance.  Also, there was a school as a part of the Negro Ensemble; acting school was, Lloyd Richards was a part of, Ed Cambridge, Lonnie Elder.  I was head of the dance there.  I taught classes, and I also did, choreographed a lot of their shows, most of their shows.  And that's how I was involved with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you happen to start getting--did someone come to you and ask you to participate with them?
Speaker 2: What do you mean, the choreographing a number?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the Negro Ensemble.
Speaker 2: Well, all of their shows, like ['Song of the] Lucitanian Bogey' [1967] was their first show.  And I sort of co-directed with Michael Schultz, and it required movement.  And a choreographer is about movement.  When you say movement or say dance, it's about movement.  So you know you got to--so I did that one, I did 'God is a Guess What?'  And what is the other thing (unclear).  I did about four or five shows for the Negro Ensemble Company, great company.

Barbara Tate ran Henry Street, the, the mus--drama, sort of, the School of Dramatics and Art or the art.  Melvin Van Peebles, I was doing a piece on Melvin Van Peebles.  I did several pieces, 'Champeen' [1983], and she saw me choreographing the show.  And she liked the way I was doing it and what I was doing.  So she asked me, told Melvin to ask me, say I need somebody to run a dance department here.  So that was how it happened.  She did, so I went there, and none of the things were there that I--and when I left it, were there.  But I had to build all those things, had a wonderful--people come in and build a wonderful program for children; built a school.  If you wanted to take a class--ballet class or tap class and all in the house like that.  It was not like that in the beginning, and made the studios so they looked like studios.  I built that whole department, and that's how I got involved.  And Melvin Van Peebles, through him, doing his show there.  They have a wonderful theater in there, and Melvin did several shows there which I choreographed.  And 'Champeen', Mar--that was one of Mario's [Van Peebles], one of his first shows, I think.

She, she encouraged me to audition.  She brought me and introduced me to the [Katherine] Dunham School [of Dance and Theater, New York, New York], a white girl.  She, she's a wonderful human--dear friend.  And most of the people I know are still friends that was around that area.  See, coming up at the American School [sic, School of American Ballet, New York, New York] and Dunham School, a lot of wonderful people that, that stayed, remained friends.

I, I think 'Forces of Rhythm' [1972] is a wonderful piece and 'Fontessa and Friends' [1981], 'No Outlet', and these are ones--some of these pieces are one-shot pieces.  What goes on, you've seen those quite a few times, but not as much as you'd like to.  But some you, I've done like one time, and I did the piece that--I started Fon--'Fontessa' sort of like the beginning at, in Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  'Malindy', I think, I did, I did a piece called 'Malindy', which started at Howard University, to a Paul Laurence Dunbar poem 'When Malindy Sings.'  They wanted something, the kids wanted a piece that related to black people and things.  So I chose the song, the poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar, 'When Malindy Sings'--"G'way an' quit dat noise, Ms. Lucy, put that [music] book away, t'ain't no use to keep on sanging 'til the end, to your grave, like Malindy Sings."  Then I used a lot of great black women, Aretha [Franklin], Roberta Flack and Leontyne, what's, what's her name, Nina Simone.  I used a record about all of them, and they all did the whole record.  And these ladies appeared and did it--yeah.

And I said, oh, my goodness, I'd be delighted because I thought Lester had--Wilson was doing.  I had heard that Lester Wilson was, that's another choreographer, great choreographer.  And I heard he'd been signed, but they had changed directors.  And so Sidney had chosen me.  And I think--I would always think that it was because of Lena Horne because Lena had, Lena had, Lena and her daughter, they had gone to see Dance Theater of Harlem's, 'My Valley', 'Forces of Rhythm' with them, and they were very impressed.  So I was very happy to hear that.  And when--I feel that way today.  Lena's con--contribution was, had a lot to do with me doing that.
Speaker 1: Right, and she was married to Sidney Lumet at the time?
Speaker 2: No, she was not.  Her daughter was.
Speaker 1: Daughter, okay.
Speaker 2: Gail Lumet [Buckley] was married to Sidney Lumet.  Gail Lumet is Lena Horne's daughter.  She is not Lena Horne.  Lena Horne is the greatest lady ever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She would open the door for the, all this stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 'The Wiz', what was it like?  Were there any particular, noteworthy experiences as you were working--?
Speaker 2: Well, experience was a great experience.  With that many dancers, I mean it was over three or four thousand people at the--that came to audition.  I used about three hundred dancers.  And they were all so great, you know, my, my assistant and I, Carlton Johnson and Mabel Robinson were my assistants.  They're brilliant.  And we, we just looked at one another, and said, when are these dancers gonna dance because they were all so fantastic.  And we hired as many as we could.
Speaker 1: Did you hire as many as three hundred?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You been to my study.  I built it as I went along.  I would rehearse this here or where there--I had skeleton crew, and I brought them, my dance company from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], they were the skeleton crew.  They got aut--they were automatically hired.  I hired them automatically.  They were automatically in the film, and they--I started off with them.  Then I built to about a hundred.  Then the other scenes I had to have more people.  I built about two or three hundred.  I would build it like that, and I worked on certain things with certain groups, and it was a certain amount.  And then I'd add on to it.  And it was great.  They were all so wonderful.  I had the best dancers in the world, I could say, in that film.  And they loved doing it.  They came in to work.  They'd come to rehearsal.  They'd see they had to really work, and they were in it.
Speaker 1: So that we don't get the two mixed up, we're talking about the film or we're talking about the Broadway--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't do the Broadway show.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: George Faison, another, another choreographer did the Broadway show.  He's a, he's one of my protégés.  He was at Howard too when I was there, and that's how he got here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he didn't, he did the Broadway show now.  People confuse that.  He didn't do the musical--I mean he didn't do the movie.  I did the movie.
Speaker 1: And did they shoot here in New York?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did they shoot the movie here in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they shot the movie in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was all shot in the studios out there in Long Island [New York]--I forget--they opened the studios that there hadn't been any movie shooting in, in years.  They used to shoot movies out there, and they opened the studio.  I forget the name of it.  And 'The Wiz' as the first movie they'd shot there in years, and they opened it back up, yeah, and we shot that movie.
Speaker 1: And the name of that--?
Speaker 2: Astoria [New York].
Speaker 1: Astoria, in Astoria (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Astoria, yeah.  We shot in Astoria, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did it take you to shoot or I'm sure there's some incidents we need to hear about?
Speaker 2: It was done very, it was done quick and the, and the, the whole film was shot like in a month or two.  And I didn't hear much because I remember someone was saying that, "See, years ago, this movie would have taken like two years to shoot, a long time.  But they're fast moving, and Sidney Lumet is known for his quick shooting."
Speaker 1: Yep, efficient shooting.  And then it went on to be a film success, just as it had been a Broadway [neighborhood in New York, New York] success.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think 'Wiz' the film, never got the kind of thing that it should have gotten, and especially Quincy's music.  Quincy Jones, what are you gonna say?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, I mean Quincy Jones is the genius of geniuses.  I will always be grateful to, for that score that he made, and especially for the dances.  It was such an honor and a pleasure to be working with Quincy.
Speaker 1: Now, you worked closely with Quincy Jones on, on that movie?  What was it like--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: I, closely with him, that's what you work with.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And he was a music man (laughter).  Who are you gonna work with?  Oh, and I did have two wonderful rehearsal pianists, Frank Owens and Tom, two rehearsal pianists, Frank Owens and Tom Bedwell (ph.).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wonderful, I wanted to give them a lot of credit cause they were fan--they were my rehearsal pianists, fantastic.  But Quincy was a man, he came and, and laid a whole score over what we had wanted to do.  He's a genius, I mean past a genius.  You don't know what to say about Quincy Jones.  Now, he, now, what amazes me about him, he know it all about, all kind of music, not just jazz and not just rock or just for the--the classics he knows.  He knows all the classics, so if you want to drift into a classic feeling, he can do it like that.
Speaker 1: So it was a great pleasure working with--?
Speaker 2: Oh, more than a pleasure because you have someone like that, what are you gonna say?  And he is that.  He's a great, great genius of music.
Story_ID: 9232
Speaker 1: Later, you were honored by [Nickolas] Ashford and [Valerie] Simpson, and we don't have a lot of the information on that.  How did that honor come about, and what was that honor about (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: You know, you, you, you speak of these people, and, and Nick and Val are two that are so special also.  They are the--as musicians as Quincy [Jones] is, as far as I'm concerned.  They're just great, great honored and just a heart.  They're just a giving, heartful people.  You know, they, they just are.  And they wrote the theme song for that film.  You didn't hear as much as you would like or should have been, but Nick and Val are just so very special--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very special.  I have no words to say about them or to him except, you loved them for their beauty and giving and artistry, you just do because they, they are great, great artists and they give so much.  And they enjoy, giving, doing it.
Speaker 1: Now, the International Association of Blacks in Dance honored you also, and awarded you the Pioneer Award.  What was that like?  What, what did you feel when you heard that you were going to be awarded (simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I guess I can say it now, holding, holding on, as old as I am, I guess I am a pioneer now.  I'm still here so far (laughter).  I'm still here.  That's a pioneer, pioneer, still holding on.
Speaker 1: Still holding on, I got you, I got you.
Speaker 2: The, okay--the--

Speaker 2: Right, let's, let's go ahead and talk about that.  That shoots us ahead, but we'll talk about that.  You were recently honored at the NAA--Beverly Hills, Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] branch of the NAACP award.
Speaker 1: It wasn't just me, but it was--I was a part of the Negro Ensemble Company that was honored.  They honored Fayard Nicholas, Laurence Fishburne, which is fantastic and Della Reese, and the Negro Ensemble Company.
Speaker 2: And Arthur French and--.
Speaker 1: Huh?

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And a greater group of people.  What can I say?  Denise Nicholas is fantastic, Judith Johnson, yeah, Lonnie Elder.
Story_ID: 9233
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your directorial credits and ask you about some of the experience of those, of those works.  What was--?
Speaker 2: Well, like Mary [Screen] keeps reminding me, I did a show called '[The] Ebony Game'--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --it was wonderful, about black baseball players.  We've heard Jackie--Jackie Robinson--.
Speaker 1: Robinson, right.
Speaker 2: And who?
Speaker 1: [Leroy] 'Satchel' Paige.
Speaker 2: Satchel Paige.
Speaker 1: Satchel Paige.
Speaker 2: Josh Gibson.
Speaker 1: Josh Gibson, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were the ones that--this play was about that.  And the whole thing was about those players that were before Jackie Robinson.  And it was a wonderful play.  I directed that and choreographed that.  I di--I directed 'Porgy and Bess', street production of that which was a great experience.  It makes you see what a fantastic job [George] Gershwin did on that, on that show.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And what is it I had on that thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I want to ask you about some of the experiences and going through each one.  So I'm gonna get into a little more detail.  For instance, 'Porgy and Bess', you got to work with--?
Speaker 1: Well, that, well, yes, I worked, Wilhelmina, Wilhelmina Hernandez did the, this production that I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And a gentleman named Greg, Greg Baker who played Crown, fantastic.  He has since gone to the Met [Metropolitan Opera, New York, New York], and he's the one who's sought after in the classic singing; a very wonderful singer, and they all are, Wilheimine--Wilhelmina.  And the gentleman named Clyde Parker played--he's passed on, played Sportin' Life, it's fantastic.  And I--what's the man's name, Michael Smart plays Porgy.  Michael Smart has passed on too.  That's so sad.  Michael was one of the greatest Porgys you'd ever want to see--I forget the other man. It's funny, I ran into a lady the other day, she sings for a group of--my dear friend has a music concert every year and she came up to me and said, "Mr. Johnson, you may not remember me but you gave me the role of Maria in 'Porgy and Bess'."  I directed three productions of Porgy and Bess and she was in one that I did in Cleveland [Ohio].  And I said, "Oh my goodness, so nice to see you."  And she sang fantastic. Her name was Simmons. Her last name was Simmons, beautiful singer.
Story_ID: 9234
Speaker 1: We need to talk about '[The] Ebony Game' just a little bit more.
Speaker 2: 'Ebony Game' was a special little thing.  It was an opera within that I did.  It didn't have a long run, but it was wonderful cause, this man who wrote it did a good job.  He did the, did the music and the--.
Speaker 1: Script.
Speaker 2: Book, yeah, script.  And he hired me to do this.  'Ebony Game' was about black baseball players before Jackie Robinson came into being.  And there were a lot of great baseball players then.  Who, who's--?
Speaker 1: Josh Gibson.
Speaker 2: Josh Gibson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and [Leroy] 'Satchel' Paige.
Speaker 2: Satchel Paige and, you know, these people were fantastic, and they couldn't get a, get a, get a job nowhere.
Speaker 1: Now, how about some of the people who starred in that particular thing; some of the names?
Speaker 2: They were, they were fresh, young, new people that just came to audition and I hired them.  There were no names.
Speaker 1: So you were never afraid to hire a new name?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  There's so much wonderful new tain--new, new name or no name talent out here, fantastic, you know.  We went--these people had no names.  It was anon--it really didn't--.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: There was one lady that played the lead that was a student from of mine from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I forget her name now, but she played the lead in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were, all were wonderful.
Speaker 1: It was an off-Broadway.  Did it ever go to Broadway [neighborhood in New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was off-Broadway.  It never got to Broadway, but it was a wonderful play.  It was wonderful, acted and danced.  Tawana Kyle (ph.), that's her name.
Speaker 1: Tawana Kyle.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was there when Lynn Whitfield was there and Kiki [Shepard] and all this, my company here, Tawana Kyle.  And--.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was in 'Ebony Game'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 9235
Speaker 1: How about 'Miss Truth', was that off-Broadway also?
Speaker 2: Off-Broadway, was, one--yeah, I guess so cause we did it at the [John F.] Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts]--.
Speaker 1: In [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 2: We did it at Nat Horne's [Musical] Theatre [and School] here in New York [New York] on 42nd Street.  And Nat Horne was a wonderful dancer and that, had--he had, had had a building here that he turned into a theater.  And we played there.  We also played at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the legit musical play that had been at the Apollo in years, many, many years.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: No, but I mean, it was--back in the '30s [1930s] or '40s [1940s] the first time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were leaving the Kennedy Center, and a dear friend, Bernard Johnson said, have you gone to the Apo--Apollo?  And Bernard Johnson was a great costume designer, dancer also.  But he was around a lot of people that, of the business.  And so we called the Apollo, and the man from the Apollo came to see it.  And I forget his name now, too.  He brought--but he said he liked it, and he brought our last performance at the Kennedy Center, he saw, and he brought it to the Apollo.
Speaker 1: Okay, could 'Miss Truth' have been at the Apollo in, in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: I think it was in the '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 9236
Speaker 1: How about 'Jazzbo Brown'?  What's the significance--?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Jazzbo Brown' was a great thing.  It was--it really wasn't the great jazz, '[The] Jazz Singer' movie on TV.  And it's a Jewish thing.  It's  Jewish rabbi who has a son and didn't want him to be involved with theater.  But he becomes a big star of that theater, and the father denounces him until he sees him at his starter theater.  Well, this was done as a black version, the same story, wonderful story, that was, I sort of adapted--made the script work for the man who wrote it.  And I forget his name, and Zulema [Cusseaux] wrote the music.  I don't know if you heard of--Zulema was a wonderful black singer and artist, wonderful.  She had albums out.  She wrote the music, and I finally convinced her to be in it.  And it was some great people in it, Andre DeShields was a star.  He played the boy.  Chris Calloway was a girl friend, and a dear friend that's from [The] Juilliard [School], a great singer, Ned Wright.  And he was there when all those wonderful singers like Leontyne [Price] and Martha Flowers were there.  And great singer, classic singer too, and a core of dancers.  I can't think of everybody's name now.  But they were the stars of the show.  'Jazzbo Brown' was a hit.  It was off Broadway, but it was a hit.  And these people didn't--who were producing it, screwed it up.  They've called me several times to do it now.  And that's at least twenty years ago or more.
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: And my head's not there now.  You know you have to do it when your head's there.  But it was just wonderful, people were wonderful in it.
Story_ID: 9237
Speaker 1: 'Time in the Wind' [sic, 'Time and the Wind', 1995], remember that?
Speaker 2: Another one of those.  Another of the great shows that, and "It's time and the wind and the wind" (sings).  It was on 47th Street [New York, New York] at the Townhouse Theater [sic, The John Houseman Studio Theatre], music was by, now I forgot, the man who wrote 'Hair' [Galt McDermot].
Speaker 1: We'll get it right after--.
Speaker 2: Oh, why couldn't I think of his name?
Speaker 1: Wasn't it Andrew Lloyd Webber?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Speaker 2: Oh, not, Webber, Webber, it was, now how can that--I can't think of his name.  He wrote 'Hair'.  That's a biggy.
Speaker 1: Right, we'll, we'll get it.  We'll, We'll get it in there, but tell us about the plot in 'Time and the Wind'?
Speaker 2: 'Time and the Wind' was really a connection of Norman--I forget, Norman Matlock had written some poems that I connected and made a story.  And it was a beautiful story, beautiful singers.  And the boy who, young man who I hired for other roles in it, became the star of 'The Wiz', I mean the star of '[The] Lion King'.  And that was his first job, 'Time and the Wind'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I for--his name is Jackson, no, his name is Jackson. And Galt McDermot.  Is it Galt McDermot?  Galt McDermot was 'Raisin'?
Speaker 1: 'Hair'.
Speaker 2: 'Hair', yeah, Galt McDermot did 'Hair', and he also did 'Time and the Wind' with Norman Matlock.  And it was a beautiful story, a love story about two people, but it went, it showed you so much of how they had to go through, fight the world, to hold onto their love.
Speaker 1: And you were the director?
Speaker 2: Yeah, director of choreographer, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, slash choreographer.
Speaker 2: And Galt played, Galt played just about two or three (unclear), but wonderful, 'Time and the Wind', a wonderful play.
Story_ID: 9238
Speaker 1: We may have missed, 'Miss Truth', and I meant to ask you--.
Speaker 2: 'Miss Truth'--.
Speaker 1: --about the plot?
Speaker 2: Sojourner Truth, you heard about Sojourner Truth.  Well, I have a dear friend.  She honored me the other night and she was there, Gloria Van Scott and I.  She wrote the--he wrote some poetry really that I didn't like at the time, and when I turned it into a play, with music and dance called 'Time and the Wind'--I mean 'Miss Truth'.  And we, we toured with it a little while at [the John F.] Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] and back here at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York].  But it had some great people in it, Loretta Devine, you've heard of her.  That was Loretta's first show.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Herbert Rollins (ph.), Phoebe Redmond (ph.), Al Perryman, a great dancer.  He's gone on, Loretta [Abbott] and Tom Brentwell (ph.) arranged the score.
Speaker 1: So that was another one of those where they, they're starting, but they might not be known to, by names--(unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It went to a big thing.  It started, it starred Gloria Van Scott who was a poet.  She played Sojourner.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a moment in there where she has to strip down to show her breast.  It was, it was great, theater-taking thing.  It, it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 9239
Speaker 1: I think we, you know, sort of forget a lot of these names.  And that's why I'm asking you to remember some, some of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was thinking of a lady I was just talking about that went, was at Cincinnati [Ohio] Ballet [from 1973-1976], when you asked me.  Marcia, Marcia Sells is her name.
Speaker 1: Marcia Sells, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she became a wonderful dancer at Dance Theater of Harlem [New York, New York], and she was from the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio].  And so I recommended that they take her at Dance Theater of Harlem.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: She's wonderful dancer.
Speaker 1: The--.
Speaker 2: She had so much--.
Speaker 1: Now, you've told us about the children's programs at the Henry Street Settlement [New York, New York], but it seems that your career has been focused on trying to give unknowns or people just starting out in the business or people maybe wanting to come into the business a break--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that break--.
Speaker 1: --as opposed to people who are just settling on known names, known talents?
Speaker 2: Well, that's very true.  I seem to--I was thinking about that the other day, that seemed to have been my, my life, is making avenues or giving avenues.  But then even from the beginning, Alvin's [Alvin Ailey] felt that, you know, he saw that, and before he came, before he had his big company.  My life has been doing that and just giving people opportunities or making opportunities.  Without having a big company, I've done that, recommending people for roles in things and, like that.  And I, I've that.  It's a--you know.
Speaker 1: And something to be very proud of.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm very proud of it cause some of the things, like Sherman Hemsley, Sherman Hemsley was just a student at the Negro Ensemble Company, and I arranged an audition for him to, for 'Purlie' [1970], and this is how his whole career started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Same thing with Debbie Allen, bringing her here and, you know, and she auditioned for 'Purlie', and taking her to that.  Same thing with George Faison, and many people like that.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, I remember Faison.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: The--and we, we had mentioned also the lady from the Bahamas who was also in 'Moving on Up' [sic, 'The Jeffersons' television program] with Sherman Hemsley, and I can never remember--.
Speaker 2: Who is that?
Speaker 1: --Roxie Roker.
Speaker 2: Oh, Roxie Roker.  Roxie was a friend.  I wasn't that close to Roxie, but I know she was from Howard University [Washington, D.C.]--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and had studied with Owen Dobson.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The man that brought me back down to Howard, and encouraged my career as choreographer to do shows there.
Speaker 1: How did your paths cross at--was it, did they cross at--?
Speaker 2: I had seen her, our paths just crossed--we'd always see other in the productions, and I'd go up and congratulate her.  The last time I saw her was at Henry Street.  Woodie King had produced it.  And that was the last production she had done--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the Henry Street--was at, at [Theatre of the] Riverside Church [New York, New York], but they rehearsed at--.
Speaker 1: Henry Street?
Speaker 2: Henry Street, yeah.
Story_ID: 9240
Speaker 1: I'm gonna name some other dancers and you can tell me where your paths cross or if they crossed.  I'll name Katherine Dunham.
Speaker 2: Well, Miss Dunham is the beginning of it all as far as companies and things go.  I never was in here company, but I--my training was mainly at her school [Dunham School of Dance and Theater, New York, New York] and the School of American Ballet [New York, New York].  And some of my dearest friends I met there.  They were the cause of me getting into these things, like you mentioned 'Damn Yankees'.  My friends, Dee Dee Wood and Maggie Newman were there.  These are two wonderful white ladies that were--and Dee Dee Wood became a big choreographer.  Toba [Singer] became a big soloist with my company [The Louis Johnson Dance Theatre] and Paul Taylor's company [Paul Taylor Dance Company].  Now, who was, you was questioning what?
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I just wanted to know how your paths crossed?  What impact they may have had on you, whether you knew them or not?  And I was just naming Katherine Dunham.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, Katherine, Miss Dunham, what can you say?  The beginning of it all, you know.  You--they had a thing called the Le Beau Blanch at the Katherine Dunham School when I was coming along.  And like every month or two they have this Beau Blanch which was like a big party all over the whole school.  And many people came there and, and things, like Marlon Brando and Eartha Kitt.  They would, have classes there.  And I went there, and I--Jimmy Dean was there when I was there.  And we became good friends, Jimmy Dean and I.  He, there was a gentleman there named Cyril Jackson that taught drumming.  And Cyril used to play for my rehearsals.  I had begun choreographing then.  And he'd play for my company--my, my rehearsals, and Jimmy Dean would play with him.  And he--cause Jimmy Dean really wanted to be a fine drummer.
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Jimmy Dean?
Speaker 2: Well, he--.
Speaker 1: As a person as opposed to an actor?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was a wonderful guy, very, very warm and very giving type, and he, he mainly was interested in the drumming.  And any chance he'd get to use it, like at my rehearsal, he'd use it with Cyril cause Cyril was fantastic.  And at the Dunham school was a wonderful meeting place.  The people that came, very warm and helpful.  In those day, if you--everybody wanted to help the other person get to where they wanted to go because there weren't as many, and not a, not a lot, I would say, opportunities, but they were, but there were.  They are today, more than they were in those days.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There weren't as many opportunities in schools and things as there are today.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanted you to--after I give you this next name, I want to go back and just talk about the difficulty as a black in getting into the industry.
Speaker 2: Difficulty, lord--.
Speaker 1: But now, let me, let me ask you about Pearl Primus first.
Speaker 2: Pearl (laughter), Pearl, I didn't know her that well, but I got to--I knew her in the latter part of her life, now she passed recently, a dear friend, he is a prodigy of hers.  He, his training was with her mostly.  And I was down in Atlanta [Georgia] choreographing that ballet I told you about.  And Miss, Miss Primus was there teaching and giving classes and seminars.  And so my, my assistant, Kim--Kimberly--what's Kimberly's name?  Kimberly, what's Kimberly's name?  My secretary, Kimberly, she was my assistant, Kimberly Jones, she calls me.  She knew Miss, Miss Primus was there.  And we had seen each other the day before and had dinner together.  It was a dear friend named Richard, Dr. Long, who has produced a lot of books on dance.  And they had done an article on Ms. Primus in the paper, and they said--she said, you got to get this paper and see it.  So I had, it was this book that Richard Long, Dr. Long had put out.  It had a picture of--who was it now?  It was dedicated to--it had Miss Dunham's picture in there and to Alvin [Ailey] and Anna Sokolow.  You know Anna Sokolow?
Speaker 1: No, I don't.
Speaker 2: Anna Sokolow is a white, very wonderful teacher of dance.  And they had her name and her picture there, and had Pearl Primus's name under it.  So she said, you've got to see this paper, and see what they did in the paper.
Speaker 1: Okay, let us go back to the difficulty for--?
Speaker 2: But I didn't really ex, express how I felt, and wonderful Miss Primus was.
Speaker 1: Oh, go ahead.
Speaker 2: What a great contributor to dance, and particularly, black dance that she did.
Speaker 1: Okay, the, the--.
Speaker 2: Wonderful, humorous lady.  I mean when I was in Atlanta there, and I was spending that time doing my ballet and she was teaching, I got to know her.  And I found how wonderful, what a wonderful, warm humorous lady she was.  And she knew the deal.  She knew all the hard work and stuff you had to put into dance, and you couldn't play around with her.
Speaker 1: We, you know, we know Pearl Bailey best, I think, those of us on the outside, we know her best as a singer, Pearl Bailey.  But I understand she also played major roles in getting blacks into African American musicals and dance and so forth.
Speaker 2: That, that was still Pearl's life, till she died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a think that she had to (phone ringing)--.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I had a, done a thing with Pearl, other than 'House of Flowers' which she was wonderful.  And I did a thing with Morton Gould and Carolyn Leigh, at the [John F.] Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.].  And I forget the name of the programs, but they needed a director, and I was hired.  And I forget the choir, a big choir that, that was to be conducted in the symphony orchestra by Morton Gould and Carolyn Leigh.  And I, I suggested her coming in to, to be the narrator.  And they liked the idea.  So Pearl came in, and I directed that and directed Pearl in it, and she was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was brilliant talent.  What are you gonna say?  She used her sense of humor, but she was a very serious lady about her craft.  And she was a fine actor and everything.

Speaker 1: As a dancer, and we're going back a few years now, you're just coming into the business, and all of a sudden you find out such people who simply would not accept blacks in these various roles as choreographers and directors and so forth.
Speaker 2: What is that now?
Speaker 1: Going back to the early years of your career [1950s], and you come to New York [New York].  You're dancing with the George--American Theater--Ballet Theater.  And you find out--.
Speaker 2: No, New York City Ballet.
Speaker 1: Oh, New York City Ballet, all right.  And you find out that you are, are not being accepted on talent, but that skin color has now, is now--plays a role in advancement and the work that you get and so forth.  What was, what was that like and what was your response?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very hard, but I didn't realize.  I was younger then, and I didn't know how serious these things really were.  So you went on, and I must say, Jerry Robbins was very encouraging in that.  He used me with the New York City Ballet, and had done, was gone, 'Afternoon of a Fawn', [Claude] Debussy, he had done that for me, but I wasn't allowed to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't even like to talk about it too much because, so ridiculous.  It was, today is much more open for things, but it's still the same.  Not that much has changed as far I'm concerned.
Story_ID: 9242
Speaker 1: And (unclear) what I did as a ballet dancer.  That's the one thing that I never got to do that I, that I was fantastic in.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, when you say you never got to do, you, you had performed in ballet, but you--(unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: Well, not, I--because of choreographing my own things, and a few people that were students in the schools that I was at had begun to choreograph.  And the only time I really got to do it with New York City Ballet was with Jerry Robbins, and that, well, (unclear), with a company that was a major company.
Speaker 2: Okay, so would you say that is, in your entire career, that is one of your major regrets, that you were never able to do that?
Speaker 1: No, I don't regret it now.  It's like Geoffrey [Holder] said, "Louis, in a way it's good that you didn't get to do that or you would never did all the wonderful things that you're doing now, choreographing at the Met [Metropolitan Opera, New York, New York] and doing Broadway shows, and doing Radio City [Music Hall, New York, New York] and all those kind of things.  You, what you're doing as a choreographer and director has been fantastic.  And you wouldn't have been able--you wouldn't have been doing all those things."
Speaker 2: So as you look back on your career, your entire career, what stands out most as maybe one of your most important achievements or just standing out for any other reason?
Speaker 1: Well, I have to stop here a minute, cause I'm sort of--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: What stands out the most?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't, I don't look at no standing out because, cause surviving, holding on is all it is.  I don't, standing out?  There were some moments that were very beautiful.  I think Leontyne [Price] at the Met was, stands out, I mean cause we knew each other before she became the star that she is.  And I hold her so high.  She is the epitome of artistry, and to be doing an opera at the Met that she's starring in, and I'm choreographing, you know,  you know, what are you gonna say?
Speaker 2: That's, that'd be a highlight.
Speaker 1: You're saying, is this, is that real--is this real, you know.  And you got to do a great job.  And the ballet turned out to be fantastic.  So it's fantastic, and, you know, and I hired a young man.  There's (unclear), they don't like you to hire outside people at the Met.  And I hired a black young man to do this fight with this other gladiator.  And the other one is 'The Wiz' [1978], that was a great experience, with Quincy [Jones], with Sidney Lumet and all those dancers and my assistant, great experience, and once in a lifetime.
Speaker 2: The film version of 'The Wiz'.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, those, those people, those names, Sidney Lumet, Quincy Jones, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson--.
Speaker 2: Louis Johnson.
Speaker 1: Nipsey Russell, I mean Ted Ross, I mean, it was such love in that, in doing it too.  And about two or three hundred dancers that really cared, you know.  They'd come there and they're ready to go.
Speaker 2: And you did it in two months?
Speaker 1: About two months or a little less.
Speaker 2: That's some sort of record--?
Speaker 1: It wasn't a long time.
Speaker 2: And would you also--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: You got to be prepared.
Speaker 2: --consider those three things your most outstanding career achievements?
Speaker 1: I, see, I don't look at it as achiev--achievements cause anything I do, I'm achieving something.  I'm trying to achieve, to make it fine, to make it beautiful.  See, I don't look at that I got make it the best thing I've done, this is the best thing.  This is better than that, better than that, so and so.  I don't look at it like that.  I look at just doing the fine job that, of, of note that you would look at and like.  I look at that, I, when I first did it in 'Rent', and I--Judith, that was one of the things I did with Judith Jamison.  She was in my first ballet.  That was sort of interesting, you know, just to have her do it.

Speaker 1: As you know, this is a historical project.  Why do you think history is so important?
Speaker 2: Why is history so important?
Speaker 1: Especially among African Americans?
Speaker 2: Today is very important, particularly, for black youngsters because they don't know no black history.  You know, you do so much and you say so much.  We did 'Miss Truth'.  They have to see it to know that, and you can't, I couldn't tell them about, you know, in Washington [D.C.], when you couldn't go downtown or L Street and go to, to the white theaters.  You had to go on U Street, the one, that to Lincoln Theatre.  You lived it, so you, you couldn't do that then.  And it's a different time today.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And young people need to know this history.  It's just history to be known, needs to be known.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: I was talking to Mers, Mercer Ellington the other night.  We were together at a thing.  And we were both saying the same thing, you know.
Speaker 1: What are your future hopes for the African American community?  Do you have any special future hopes?
Speaker 2: Future hope?  Lord, they have to make they own hopes.  They have to make their own, I think, you know.  I, they, they have to listen, the future hope is to listen.  You know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, cause you--anything you do, you have to really do it yourself, and you have to have that mind to listen, to evaluate this from that.  And it's given to so many today, but you wonder if they're hearing it because the results of what you see is not showing that.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy to be?
Speaker 1: And you can make it as short as you want.
Speaker 2: Well, the--who said that, I think it was, "Just keep on doing what you're doing and hope it's the best and say I tried," since I'm in something.  I'm involved in something to--that, you know, in theater, and this theater things, if you get in it somehow you--I don't know how I got in it, but you hope that it's, the things you do have said something to people, you know.  I tried, you know, that's the most you can say.  I, I try to do the best I can.
Speaker 1: Well, you've--.
Speaker 2: And keep on giving your best, you know, that can say to them, I see something there, you know, and, especially with young people, if you can get them to see that.
