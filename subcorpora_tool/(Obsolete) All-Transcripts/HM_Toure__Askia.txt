Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe; I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Neculai Burghelea.
Speaker 2: Sir could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 1: Askia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "M," just middle initial, I just use my middle initial now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: M. Toure, T-O-U-R-E.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 143144
Speaker 1: And now did--now is there a story behind that name, Askia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the whole, now what's gon' happen 'cause it's gon' take us into the '60s [1960], it's part of the cultural revolution.  What we were attempting to do was to reclaim the names of our ancestors because what we had it might seem strange--people have become so assimilated now, we had said that part of our thing was oh so, you know, you usually don't find somebody that's Chinese named Harry Brown, so they have their Chinese names, and so, so we were saying we were going to research and find our African names, and if we couldn't find the actual ethnic groups that we came from then we would actually rename ourselves after African heroes and heroines you know so we would like and try to give splendor to that name and give credibility to that name you from Don L. Lee to [HM] Haki Madhubuti; from [HM] Sonia Sanchez to Laila Menan [ph.], from Marvin X to El Muhajir, Askia, from Roland Snellings to Askia Toure, and Ron Everett to [HM] Maulana Karenga, on and on and on, and so we were doing that not only to reclaim part of our lost heritage from the Maafa, the African holocaust, but to also set to model an example for the young people in terms of you know being a proper, what you know we were very (laughter)--now one, one gets a little amused by it but we were very concerned about walkin' the walk as well as talkin' the talk.  I mean we were, called ourselves African Americans, new Africans and so forth you know after, Africa--African Americans after Brother Malcolm [X] and so forth, we were going away from "colored" and "negro" to "African Americans" or "New Africans" and so forth.  And so we took ourselves rather seriously and but that's, I guess in a sense we, it's somewhat interesting now but we were dead serious then, and we tried to create new standards for our people.  Now a very outstanding group of people I remember were the AJASS, the African Jazz-Arts Society [& Studios] outta New York [City, New York], Elombe Brath and Kwame Brathwaite, Jean Gumbs, Robert Gumbs, Black Rose Nelmes, Helene Brathwaite, they were part of a group called the Grandassa Models and they modeled the African hairstyles and the African dress and so forth and they linked up, they use to have the, the Naturally shows, Naturally '59, Naturally '60, Naturally '61, '62 and '63 and they had linked up with Max Roach and the beautiful diva Abbey Lincoln who is now known as Aminata Moseka.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now she, she was one of the first black women I saw on television that had a natural.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: She and Miriam Makeba.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and also [HM] Cicely Tyson too as well.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, yes sir.
Speaker 2: And so we were a part of this thing of reclaiming the lost heritage and that's probably part of the spirit that Alex Haley tried to get into with 'Roots' his book 'Roots' which later came in the '70s [1970s].  So we were trying to restore, resurrect the lost heritage.
Story_ID: 143145
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So what you're giving us in sum is the history of the black cultural movement in terms of the cultural parts, the names, the wearing of dashikis and African clothing?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: And, and you're saying that that started really with this A Jazz in New York?
Speaker 1: Well, A Jazz was one of the early organizations, it was many organizations, it was, they call that, I remember that whole, the "Freedom Now Movement" that was paralleled with Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln Roach's beautiful album 'We Insist! [Max Roach's] Freedom Now [Suite'] and we had became-- we were a real presence.  This I--you know by that time I was, I was a young art student, a young artist in New York and--this is kinda leaping ahead but I have to just clarify.  We--they had-around the same time they had international interests, imperialists and so forth had murdered the great Premier of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba and, and then they tried to rationalize it.
Speaker 2: This was like '61 [1961]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, down at the United Nations and we marched and we went up into United Nations and turned the United Nations out, we called 'em murders and imperialists, and Adlai Stevenson [II] and all the mouthpieces for U.S. imperialism, and so all of a sudden we were all over the headlines and everything.  I remember The New York Times wrote an editorial saying, "The Negro is identifying with the African in his struggle for his rights," and so forth like that was something startling that these weren't our people.
Speaker 2: It was an alarm, hun?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that they were shocked, and here you got people who were like of Jewish background, and they were identifying with Israel and that was normal, that was your heritage, your legacy but we did it with our heritage it was a big problem.  Why was it, why was it so strange you know, so that, that, but then in getting in back to the whole gist of the thing, we were trying to re-link up with the, the lost heritage, the holocaust had, it hadn't totally destroyed because we had a lot of that roots in our black culture both in the Caribbean and in the American South we had--
Speaker 2: Okay-
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --now what I wanna do is just may just get back to the name and we're, we're, we're gonna cover this ground later.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Story_ID: 143146
Speaker 1: What year would you say that the--what year would you say the black cultural arts movement you know started thinking about changing names and that sort of--what--or when or how far can you trace them back?
Speaker 2: I guess it started back with that period in the late '50s [1950] early '60s [1960] I would say with the whole Freedom Now Movement and so it was like so many tributaries flowing into a river.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People involved in that came in, you had the young black artists with Elombe Brath and the great artist illustrator Tom Feelings and Kwame Brath-- [Kwame] Brathwaite who was Elombe's brother who was an outstanding photographer and I think who's one of the leaders of the National Conference of the Artists in New York [City, New York]; I remember Tom Feelings, young scholar Matthew Meade and I put together a book, we actually wrote a book called 'Samory Toure' and it was the short illustrated biography of the great Mandinka Freedom Fighter, Samory Toure who is the grandfather, who fought French colonialism in West Africa who is the grandfather of Ahmed Sekou Toure who was President of Guinea, and so we had (laughter), we put together, we went and researched Mr. J. A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and I went to Mr. Rogers which is--that's a whole another story in itself , and we (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'll ask you about that too but, is that?
Speaker 2: Yes, got his permission to use research from his work to put out illustrated biography of Samory Toure and then we advertised it in our fighting journal, Liberator magazine.  I was, I was a staff writer for Liberator magazine and Tom, Tom Feelings often did illustrations for Liberator and also for Freedom Ways and so forth.  So, so we were constantly trying to resurrect our and restore you know our ancient heritage and then utilize the principles of our, our forbearers to strengthen our freedom movement of, we were more or less Pan Africanist of African people throughout the world you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now tell us how did you choose your particular name, Askia Muhammed Toure, and you are used to using it now so?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, we had, we were looking for we were trying to (laughter) resurrect our pre-western, our culture before we got--had contact with the West so we knew that our people, our bloodline stretched a me--after, after the South immediately to West African.  So we began to research and of course we had the great historians and griots like Dr. John Henrik Clarke, [HM] Dr. [Yosef] Ben Jochannan, Queen Mother Moore and them, they had--and the (laughter), we had the Harlem Street Speakers, Eddie "Pork Chop" Davis, Abdul Karim [ph.] and all these people were just griots, voices of our history and saying you know, "Look to home black man, black woman, discover your roots," and of course we had Brother Malcolm [X] who was constantly saying that you know that, that "your history was your roots, a tree without roots cannot survive" and so forth.  Who were you?  I'll never forget they had Brother Malcolm under the tutelage of the honorable Elijah Muhammad asked us, he said, "Well what is your name, who are you?  What is your name?"  He said, "Don't tell me you're Willie Johnson," he said, "That's just Will the slave boy from the Johnson plantation.  What's your name?  Why don't you know your name?  Who are your ancestors?  What did, what were their views on life, death and the universe?  Why don't you know them?  Who made you hate your dark skin and your kinky hair?  Why don't you know who you are what your ancestors (unclear)?"  So it challenged us and of course we went to the community griots and we went to Schomburg Library [later the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York City, New York].  I remember being up in the Schomburg just like a maniac going through the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois and every, everything I could get my hands on, the Honorable Marcus Garvey, everything to find out, to find that history and so forth.  William Leo Hansberry, so forth trying to find that history, trying to; it was so precious to us and part of that process, that inspiration led us back to the pre-colonial heroes and heroines who, who built on the mother continent, particularly West Africa where our direct roots and bloodlines, West and Central Africa and in looking at the great heroes, I in the process of struggle I was very, at that time due to the influence of Brother Malcolm was very Islamic-oriented as well and because we were after the pre-Western influence and so forth and so then I discovered the great grassland empires, Ghana, Mali and Songhai and of course Askia Muhammed Toure was the full name of Askia, the great legendary Emperor of Songhai and reading his history and contributions and so forth.  There was a book out, a study out of by Daniel Chu and Otis [sic, Elliott Skinner, and Moneta Barnett] called 'The Golden Age in Africa' [sic, 'A Glorious Age in Africa'].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It told about the Songhai Empire and the great leaders of that period and so forth, and so of course we went deeper but when we, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what, what year was it that you, you choose your name?
Speaker 2: That would be, the late '60s [1960] I would say, because I had been--everybody knew, I had been on staff in Liberator Magazine and the journals, Black Dialogue, the Journal of Black Poetry and so forth and we began to you know change our names from LeRoi Jones to Imamu Amiri Baraka, you know and so forth and so we began.
Speaker 1: So, so would you say '68 [1968], '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: I would say even a little earlier.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Around '67 [1967] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And formalized I guess starting in '67 [1967], '68 [1968] and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: During the beginning of the Black Arts period you know.
Speaker 1: All right, well I knew there was a story so-- (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 143147
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 13 October, 1938 [October 13, 1938] and that was Raleigh, North Carolina, both my parents were Southern-born.  My father [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] was from LaGrange, Georgia and my mother [Nannie Bullock Snellings] was from Apex, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna ask you this, these questions as we go along, but sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: What is my occupation?  Black freedom fighter, my occupation is poet, (laughter) jali, a griot, activist, Africana Studies pioneer and liberation-minded African (laughter).

Speaker 2: A former.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A former Professor, I had--I think the last formal time that I taught was at UMass Boston [University of Massachusetts at Boston] in the late, I think 1999.  Since that time I've been more or less a writer and a lecturer, and I've, let's see published about seven books with these books out, these current books will be seven books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I do a lot of lecturing at colleges around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay and now what's your position here at this, at where we are here today?

Story_ID: 143148
Speaker 1: All right, now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because management asked me to ask 'em (laughter), and they're kinda a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we are already warmed up but this, this is what they are.  Sir, sir do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Wow, now that came from left field, I don't know a specific food.  I have a lots of favorite foods (laughter), I can't even think of one.  Well I have to--what one specific (laughter), well I'll start out, I'll deal with the fattening deserts, sweet potato pie (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now do you have a favorite color?

Speaker 2: Not particularly, I guess I don't think in that, that kinda terminology.  I don't think that way, but I like different parts of the country, I particularly like in the United States, I like the South, and I also I like the West Coast.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from Dr. John Henrik Clarke "Children, this is not a sprint, it's a marathon."
Story_ID: 143149
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna ask about your family history. I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.
Speaker 2: Oh, good, good.
Speaker 1: Now we'll start with your mother's side, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nannie, N-A-N-N-I-E, Lynette, L-Y-N-E-T-T-E, Bullock, B-U-L-L-O-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: And.
Speaker 1: And what is her--oh is that all, or is it?
Speaker 2: Well she married my father [Clifford R.] Snellings [Sr.].
Speaker 1: Well Toure [sic], okay.
Speaker 2: Snellings, Snellings.
Speaker 1: Okay so that would be Snellings.
Speaker 2: Snellings.
Speaker 1: S-N-E-L-L-I-N-G-S (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) -L-L-I-N-G-S, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, now what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I don't know I'd have to get the birth certificate.  I think she was born in 1912 though, somewhere in North Carolina.  I don't know if it was right--it might have been in Apex but I'd have to look at the birth certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: How, how far back can you trace 'em first of all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were they doing and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well they were, I guess my--the person that I know more than anyone else was my grandfather, Tom Bullock and he was a product of a marriage between an African American ex-slave and a Cherokee woman.  So he was half Cherokee, but I mean you looked at him he looked like he was a Dogon elder (laughter), you know, but, so we had--in our family we had--there was a fusion and we were from the Carolinas, my mother's side so there was a lot of inner relationship between the African Americans and the Cherokees, yeah, you know, and that--you know what I got in terms of the other ancestors, I got primarily from my grandfather and he talked about their relationship, his mother and father and his father going back to slavery and his mother being a, a Cherokee woman.
Speaker 1: This is your father's side?
Speaker 2: That was my mother's side.
Speaker 1: You're, you're on your mother's side, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in North Carolina.  I know a bit more on my father's side--
Speaker 1: Well let me finish your mother's for a second and then we get to it, but can you--are there any stories passed down from your mother's side about the Cherokees or about the--about slavery or reconstruction or anything?
Speaker 2: It was more folk tales, my grandma, Julia--I learned, it's interesting, I learned a lot of the animal tales from my grandma, Julia.  Julia, my mother called her Momma and say Julie Bullock.  My Grandma Julia and Grandma Julia used to sing, well I was, my goodness I must've been about three or four years old.  She would sing all the, the folk tales about the frogs and so forth and the animals you know.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of 'em, I mean.
Speaker 2: Frog went a courting he did ride un-hun, Frog went a courting he did ride sword and pistol by his side, un-hun, un-hun.
Speaker 1: Okay all right so, so she told, she, she knew all those rhymes and stories.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he talked about how Frog went courting Ms. Mousey and setting' Ms. Mousey on his knee, said, "My darling will you marry me" and so forth and then all the animals attend the wedding and stuff and so I you know got the whole--the animal tales which I found to my delight years later that that was the living African oral tradition which I didn't realize that and which you know, Anansi the spider which was in the Caribbean and so forth, so our ancestors had passed 'em down to our great-grandparents and parents and that was part of that living tradition that Alex Haley spoke about in 'Roots.'  So the oral tradition brought a lot of our ancestral legacy down to us you know.
Story_ID: 143150
Speaker 1: But before we get to him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well what did your mother [Nannie Bullock] say about growing up in, what is it Apex [North Carolina] that she grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, well they were--she, she, she always said her father, Grandpa Tom, Tom Bullock was quite a character.  He was an outstanding leader, he was, evidently he was a mason and he was an outstanding brick mason and he built most of the prominent structures in his time in Apex, North Carolina, and she would point out the churches and other buildings that Grandpa Tom had actually did the brick masonry for and so everybody knew him and so forth you know and, and of course the whole, they had a whole, they had the black Masons [Prince Hall Freemasons] and of course they had the white Masons and you know being the South you know, but yeah she talked about that.  One thing which I was so impressed about was they had land.  I guess that's part of my legacy, we still got that land.  My--I knew my uncles, my mother's brother, Uncle Willie Bullock, Uncle Hugh Atlas Bullock and so forth and they had, they were like independent black farmers.  They had their own land, they had their cows and hogs and other, farm animals, chickens and acres and acres of land.  We use to go all back on the land trying to hunt wild birds and stuff when I was a kid because our, our--my parents were like southern migrants, really.  We were in the Midwest in Ohio, but almost every summer or every other summer we were always the black people you'll see from the South, they said so yeah we're going down home (laughter) and we would go down to either North Carolina or we'd go down to Georgia, we would alternate
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now did, did your mother [Nannie Bullock], did she have a chance to finish school and everything in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had, she and my father met at Hampton, what's now Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  At that time in the '30s [1930s] it was called Hampton Institute and I kinda (laughter), outta that meeting I came on the scene kinda interrupted the educational process (laughter), but and my father was an athlete.  He was--he played end for the Hampton Football Team you know.
Speaker 1: Well, well let's get your father's name and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clifford R. Snellings, Sr., so I'm named after him.  I used the middle name, I didn't use the first name, I used Rolland with two Ls you know and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so your birth name was "Rolland Snellings"?
Speaker 2: Clifford Rolland Snellings.
Speaker 1: Clifford Rolland Snellings okay.
Speaker 2: Junior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I always used Rolland, I guess to distinguish myself from the old man you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yeah he played, he was--he studied agriculture and he really had a desire to be a doctor, but it was just a rough period you know and you know he was literally building his life himself and he didn't have the kind of finances to go to med school but, and he also, he, he--like I said he was an outstanding athlete and he was a.
Speaker 1: What did he play?
Speaker 2: He played end for Hampton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time you had to play both offensive and defensive you know and so forth.
Speaker 1: A football player.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he's an athlete all his life too, he played football, baseball, particularly football and baseball and tennis, and so I had to--I never thought about that, but Pop was always in good shape, later on he played tennis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143151
Speaker 1: All right. Can, can you give us your father's [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: Now as far as I know I think Pop was born in LaGrange, LaGrange, Georgia and September, I don't, I don't now re--I, I'd have to look at the birth certificate.  I keep forgetting exact date, but I know its September 1915 in LaGrange, Georgia.  The Snellings family was quite prominent in LaGrange.
Speaker 1: Is it, is it Snellings with an "s"?
Speaker 2: S-N-E-L-L-I-N-G-S, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, the Snellings was quite, quite prominent in LaGrange and I guess our most immediate ancestors was my great-grandparents, the Reverend Randall Samuel Snellings, and his wife Fannie Snellings and they were, they were prominent black leaders in southwest Georgia during the, I guess you'd say the Reconstruction, the post-Reconstruction period.  I got pictures of Reverend Randall during the time around the turn of the century and he was listed as you know among prominent black Southern leaders and so forth and we had a tradition in our family of Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] and Grandma Fannie came outta Spelman and I think some of her daughters may have too, my, some of my aunts and so--great-grandma, excuse me that was my great-grandmother, that wasn't my grandmother (laughter) and when I was a little kid she was still alive, she was, was just sickly but she was up in age, she was close to, she must've been in her nineties then I guess, and so she was I guess, I guess she had Alzheimer's [Disease].  Her mind would come and go, some things she would remember and other things she didn't.
Speaker 2: So she was one of the early Spelman graduates, I guess.
Speaker 1: I guess so, yeah, yeah and so my father tickled me he said, you know, he said, "You know Fannie was a real snob," you know (laughter) I was talking to him, he said, "Yeah," he said, "He really liked your mother [Nannie Bullock Snellings], she really liked your mother" you know and it was a little hint about the whole complexion thing.  My mother was a little lighter persuasion and Grandma Fannie was very fair-skinned you know and my father, I'm, my father is darker-complected.  I, I look more like my father, he's even a little, even a little darker-complected than me, and he said, "Yeah Fannie was somethin', you know," and I said what daddy, he said, "Oh boy, she's a big--so he'd talk about the, the I guess that period when she married Reverend Randall and you know the whole, (laughter) the whole, the black bourgeoisie thing (laughter), you know the aversions of, at that time.
Story_ID: 143152
Speaker 1: You know, the society--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were they a part of, was he a--what, what denomination was your great-grandfather [Randall Samuel Snellings]?
Speaker 1: I don't know what denomination Reverend Randall was.  He was interesting because he wasn't like, he wasn't a journeyman preacher, he actually built and founded three different churches and he would do a circuit in southwest Georgia in the different churches that he built in different towns, which was amazing, you know.  So my father [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] talked about all that, he would you know spend periods at the different churches that he actually put together you know, and so I guess within the context of that period, it had to be probably maybe post-Reconstruction because the period that, when they had outstanding Southern leaders I think that was around 1910, 1915 like that and that was the first time that I saw a picture of him standing looking all grand with his bible in his hand and stuff you know.  So they, the, the Snellings families had a--I guess sort of a grand tradition from Reverend Randall and great-grandmother Fannie [Snellings] and you know their (laughter) their being.
Speaker 2: So you don't think he was a Baptist necessarily do you?
Speaker 1: He could've been.
Speaker 2: He could've been, okay.  Now were they members of organizations that you know about in those days, were they?
Speaker 1: Probably, probably, whatever it was 'cause they were part of the you know, the hoity-toity (laughter) of the, the black LaGrange [Georgia] and the southwest whatever they had.
Speaker 2: So he was a Mason you said then, yeah.
Speaker 1: My, my grandfather Tom was a Mason.
Speaker 2: Okay he was a Mason, great, great grandfather you're not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but the Reverend Randall I don't know what he was, but he was, when, oh, Dean Kelly Miller and them, they had put together a whole list of outstanding black leaders and Reverend, Grandpa, Reverend Randall was in there but, and he was like 'cause I guess you'd say the bright young man, one of the Southern post-Reconstruction bright young men, you know, young, young Negro leaders of the South you know in the you know and so I, I didn't get a chance to but I talked to my--in fact when I was just recently home and my Pop and I had some time to talk and he would talk about him and he told me about the different churches that he had actually founded or he might have physically help build, and that kinda amazing to me and then the fact that he would eventually get around--he had a circuit he'd preach at all the--I said well so these were his churches?  He said more or less but yeah, I guess he was a you know--I said boy that man was something (laughter), just you know 'cause I knew Reverend George [W.] Lucas at Bethel Baptist Church in Dayton [Ohio] and I know that was somethin' just keeping one well-attended Church going.  Imagine trying to deal with three of 'em man, you know (laughter), and so I was very--I was very impressed you know with Reverend Randall and so forth and it's been sort of a tradition in the family that you know as in probably many black families the whole thing of education.  And so forth, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay, so education was a big deal in your household when you were coming up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was important?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 143153
Speaker 1: Tell me now, now are there any other stories from back in those days that come from your father's [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] side?
Speaker 2: Oh let me tell you something too of my--my favorite person, I have had a very interesting life.  I was born in--I'm telling you the lead up to this.  I was born in Raleigh [North Carolina] and I stayed a little while with my, my grandparents and people on my mother's [Nannie Bullock's] side, but then later they took me to LaGrange [Georgia] and my parents went North to find work and my father went to drafting school and became an engineering draftsman and he later was employed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton [Ohio] and later became an aeronautical engineer, and my mother in the early years when they came to Dayton, she worked out there too until she had to you know, my, my brother was born and then she began to stay home and take care of the two sons that she had and, but my father was very much, well he was a Hampton [Hampton Institute, later Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] man, he's talking, you know you heard about a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] man, well he was a Hampton man and they had strong--but, but he always--it was interesting the way the path that his life took.  He told me had he had his way he would have been a doctor but it just weren't no opportunities for him  and he didn't have the finances, but I said well Pop given all that you didn't end up so bad boy with Wright-Patterson and stuff you know, and.
Speaker 1: No, that's now he must've been, I suppose you just have to think he'd have to be a pioneer, aeronautical engineer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess he was yeah.
Speaker 1: Who else would've been.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he was an outstanding engineering draftsman and I remember writing a short story about that.  A lot of times you'd be part of a crew and you think up something but the guy that's the head gets the credit you know and so they put him--put some pressure on him by the time he was middle-age, he must've been into his fifties that they were gonna cut jobs unless he went back to school and got an actual engineering degree, and he must've been about fifty, fifty-two.  He went back and got an engineering degree, that was.
Speaker 1: Where did he go to get his degree?
Speaker 2: I don't know which school it was, something, something in Dayton, you know one of the schools.  I don't know, so I hadn't--I was just stunned, I was in--by that time I was in the [U.S.] Military then, I was outraged by it.  I said all these years you work for people and then they gon' pull some stuff like that, but he--it was amazing that I mean the act of will to, you know, you middle age and you going back and then getting another degree like that, and he did it, he pulled it off you know and so that was kinda awesome to me and he got, he led his--one of the leaders of his department.  He got all kinds of awards, he had pictures of you know the awards he got for his work and he, they were out--that's why he didn't go to World War II [WWII] because he was doing vital war work you know at Wright you know at development and he didn't need to become a GI he was right up in there anyway you know.  So, so I was very--I didn't let him know but I was secretly rather proud of that you know.
Story_ID: 143154
Speaker 1: Now, now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Well I have the ironic position, I had my brother Elliott [Snellings] and he recently passed in 2001, both my father [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] and I were very traumatized because my brother who had been a big strong, healthy fellow and he went to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] as well, and he developed diabetes and kidney trouble and he, in, in April 2001--we feel, the family feels that these doctors misdiagnosed what was wrong with and he got some kind of virus infection and they didn't call it right and he ended up dying, and it just, just kinda, just stunned our family and then if that, as if that were not bad enough, my mother [Nannie Bullock Snellings] died the day after the planes hit the towers [September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks], September 12, 2001 so we were just doubly traumatized and all of a sudden we looked up it was just the old man and me you know, and it's funny 'cause my mom, we were all preparing for her ninetieth birthday, 'cause she passed at eighty-nine, so she had a good long run.  She was an outstanding Church Mother at Bethel Baptist Church and one of the Senior Mothers there and she was a community leader and she was a, she sang in the choir for forty years or more (laughter), that alto--I'll never forget that alto voice.  She had sang at the choir at Hampton with Dorothy Maynard, an outstanding--so she'd always and she was very creative.  I think I get my creativity from her.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna ask you like who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably both of them 'cause my father use to do a lot of independent, you know he use to design peoples' homes for them.  At home he had all his drafting board.  He use to always critique me, he said my writing was sloppy, my printing and stuff you know, and he, so he would just do, just making money on the side designing peoples' home for 'em you know for years you know and I think that he liked to do it but I think it, he somehow it relaxed him you know after doing that work.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know what--did he design homes on the West Side of Dayton [Ohio] or?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, yep and I remember people coming in and you know they'd say "oh we like this".  He was going over the, the design, the blueprints and showing different aspects of the home, you know and it's amazing the stuff you absorb but that was how--that was my reality growing up around that and then my mom she was real interesting.  I guess I get a certain kind of social thing from her too, (laughter), she, she designed clothes, so she was a seamstress and she designed--so all the ladies from the neighborhood would be coming to the house where my mom was and she'd be fitting out and designing this suits and stuff and then also she'd do hair too (laughter).  How--she's (unclear) champion cottage industry and so they'd be, that was back in the what, late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] when the ladies were still using the straightening comb, so they'd--they'd gather with my mother's house and so I was a little kid playing with toys and stuff and I'm absorbing all the gossip from the community and stuff (laughter) and all the women gathered at my mom's house and stuff, but yeah my mother was quite a--I guess you'd, you'd probably call her, what she would be called today both a church woman and a club woman or whatever you know.
Speaker 1: Was she a member of a lot of different clubs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of civic, and then she also did substitute teaching at the schools and stuff and mom was somethin' else, 'cause it was a different community you know.  I remember talking with young people and telling 'em we grew up in the village, you know the old statement "it takes an entire village to raise a child," well we grew up in the village so to speak.  The village hadn't been destroyed then and having a childhood there were no drugs in the black community.
Story_ID: 143155
Speaker 1: Wa- how did--now, now your parents [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr. and Nannie Bullock Snellings] met at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did they--why did they decide to go to Dayton [Ohio]?  Was it because of your father's interest in engineering?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were like, they went a young couple, they went north and to get more training and he went to drafting school, became an actual draftsman and I guess he sent out his resumes Wright-Patterson [Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio] you know asked him to come, and see all that time, I didn't know them, because that's what I was starting to tell you I was raised from the time I was a little baby till I was five years old by my grandparents and my aunts and uncles in LaGrange [Georgia] and so I thought my Grandma, Annie Mae [Snellings] who we had a very close relationship, I thought that was my mother you know (laughter) and then one day when I was four or five years old these strange young people showed up and I would say "Hi, you know who are they (laughter)?"  And so my aunts and uncles and 'em tell me that you know they said, "Well we came to get him and said, boy", they said, "Between you and your grandma y'all pitched a fit," and said she was hollering, "Oh they taking my baby," and you was hollering "Grandma, mama, mama" (laughter) and so they always, the aunts and uncles always tease me about that and so it was in a funny kind of thing, my parents were like complete strangers to me you know and so that was a whole thing.  I had to get to know them again, you know.
Speaker 1: So this is about 1942 that they're coming to get you right?
Speaker 2: Something like that yeah, it was right, it was right during the war because I have dim memories of traveling on a train.  I was a little kid then four or five years old like that and the, and the black soldiers in their uniforms and them you know giving me candy and Hershey Bars and stuff like that when my mother would travel on the you know the segregated trains interesting, segregated trains with the brothers on their uniform segregated, but that was the society that we were living in at the time, World War II [WWII], and so you had a sense, so it was very, kinda dim memories but I do have some memories of that World War II period, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143156
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this now, can you give us an idea of the neighborhood you grew up in, in--now you grew up in Dayton [Ohio] right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Basically Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: From five on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Yes until I finished high school.
Speaker 2: I already know it's the West Side of Dayton.  I usually ask people what their side of town was called, but I know it was the West Side.  So, so what was your neighborhood like and what was your street like and?
Speaker 1: Okay, we, we started, I didn't start at Kilmer Street [Dayton, Ohio], I started in the DeSoto, let's see DeSoto Bass Courts, the housing development.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was interesting because that was a real extended family existence in, in the projects more or less, but the projects then didn't have the kind of stigma that projects have on today.  The projects then in the 1940s and like that were young couples who were on the move and the projects was their stop before they got their own homes, and so they may have to just cool out for a while, while they accumulate the money for that down payment on that house, or that home and so, and it was like an extended family.
Speaker 2: Well DeSoto Bass, describe it, I know what it looks like, but describe it for people, it's kinda.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the red brick projects, and rather, rather grassy and oh boy that's taking me back, man (laughter) and you know neighbors like one of the things, it was the whole communal system of the village, I mean the older people watched you.  If your parents had to go somewhere it was like the communal thing.  The elders would sit out on the porch and fan and they kept an eye on the little kids while the parents had to work or whatever and so forth, and you know later on I found out that, that was more or less the African communal system no--it was just something we did, that's why our community--and I one of the things I wanna stress this was the pre-drug period.  There were no drugs in our neighborhoods, you know.  In fact people would get upset if somebody drank too much you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember in that period--you know now it seems almost quaint the women gossiping if some lady smoked in public.  "Now did you hear about Clarisse?  Honey she was walking down the street smoking, girl!  Really, smoking a cigarette, oh my God," that was a big deal then you know and, and so you couldn't get away with anything, there was always some adult with his or her eyes on you and knew your parents and knew your family, so don't even try it, mister.  So we'd do something dumb or something and (laughter) they would--the, the adults whomever they were would confront us, "aren't you Ms. Snellings boy?  I know you boy, don't lie, what, why, what were you boys doing", and so you do something and then by the time you got home your mother was there waiting for you "You she said, well what did you all do"?  Because they'd call your parents, so the young people, the kids were always under some adult's eyes, and it was like the adults like reinforced each other.  Another thing that we seem to have gotten away from, the parents knew the teachers.  Oftentimes they went to the same churches or were part of the organizations.  I remember Ms. Florence Hall, when I went to Willard [Elementary] School [Dayton, Ohio] Ms. Florence Hall was--taught in school and she played the piano in the church too and so, and they all knew each other so you couldn't pull anything, they'd call home and so home and, and school backed up and reinforced each other.  Again, what they call now the "village" you know and so that was so wonderful because their whole thing was to take us through that rites of parent--of passage and make us responsible adults and it was so--now you realize how nurturing when you see all this devastation, what the kids have to go through now how fortunate we were, you know?
Story_ID: 143157
Speaker 1: So how, how long did you live in de- DeSoto Bass [Courts, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Let's see, from the time I was about five or so to let's see, about I guess maybe ten or so, something like that ten or eleven, 'cause we moved briefly.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were there a pretty good time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause then we moved.
Speaker 1: About five, five years I guess?
Speaker 2: At least, at least and then we moved briefly, I can't remember where it was, but I remember I left the Willard [Elementary] School [Dayton, Ohio] and I moved briefly to Wogaman [Elementary] School [Dayton, Ohio] and I went to Wogaman up German Town Avenue and--which wonderful school.
Speaker 1: So you, were you did you all, you just changed schools but you were still--were you still living in Desoto Bass?
Speaker 2: No we left Desoto Bass and we lived in an area I think up near Wogaman I believe, I can't remember.  That's a little blurry on that, and then from wherever that was we lived then when I went to Wogaman we moved over to Kilmer Street [Dayton, Ohio] to the, the big house on Kilmer, South Kilmer Street.
Speaker 1: Okay so.
Speaker 2: And that's when I--by that time I was in the seventh and eighth grade and 'cause they--and I went to Roosevelt High School [Dayton, Ohio] before high school because they had more or less junior high at Roosevelt.  So at Roosevelt I was in the seventh and the eighth grade and I had moved over to Kilmer Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's true 'cause they did have that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah you know.
Speaker 1: That--most of the children over there went to Weaver [Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But some didn't go to middle school at Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, and so which I thought it was a distinct advantage because we were there and we got to see how the older high school kids carried themselves.  We met the teachers and so forth, we didn't know it of course but it was like really bringing us along as, as a generation of students of stuff you know exposing us early to what high school was like and the teachers and so forth you know and one of the things where we were so fortunate is only now looking back I realized we got the last of the old master teachers from the [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt era who were gradually going to be retiring soon and they'd tell us, they'd say, you come, (laughter) they said we expect the best from you, said we will not accept failure from you, that's--if you fail we're not doing our job and so it was just a high standard of excellence.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now the Kilmer Street community, now that was in an area that was changing from white to black.
Speaker 2: But yes, it was.  Yes.
Speaker 1: When, when you moved in right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hun--
Story_ID: 143158
Speaker 1: Be- be- before we get really deep into school I wanted to ask you about the neighborhood and, what were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up, Desoto Bass [Courts, Dayton, Ohio] and Kilmer [Street, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: It's a lot of things, I remember first time I saw Nat King Cole walking down the street by this club and Nat King Cole was with the King Cole Trio and he was playing piano and his hit tune was out "Straighten Up and Fly Right" and since I, I later became more or less at least an amateur rhythm and blues singer, I never--it always stayed with me.  I was peeping in the window 'cause they was saying, I heard elders were--adults say, Nat King Cole, you Nat's playing there.
Speaker 1: Now was that the Classic or the Palace on Fifth Street or, or Swat's Club on Fifth Street [Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah it might have been, I don't know the name of the club but that sounds familiar.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had a red and white awning, a big awning coming out, was that the one?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's Swat's Club yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I was looking, and they said "boy you too young get on away from here" and they wouldn't--'cause I liked the music and I was--I could hear and I heard the adults say this was Nat King Cole and I remember that, that smooth voice he was playing his piano and stuff and so, so we grew up, we grew up with the music.  It was all we had of course, you would, you had the music on the radio and it was where this later since called "soul music" but rhythm and blues and stuff and I mean we just idolized all.  It's not that much different than the kids from today just in our time all the different groups.  Until this day I got all kinda tunes, I if get in a happy mood I just start singing and it just comes right back.  It's like a computer, all the old songs and so forth you know, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, Clyde McPhatter, the Drifters, the Oreos.  It's interesting when public television begin to show the "Oldies but Goodies" and I remember Speedoo [Earl Carroll] and (unclear) the Cadillac and--Speedoo and the Cadillacs and I would be and all of a sudden I was a teenager again, singing because I grew up singing and once we saw them perform then we tried to imitate them and the whole stereotype so to speak of maybe cliche doo-wopping on the corner and stuff you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 143159
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of those eras, the doo-wop groups--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you said you were always singing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you sing at Bethel Baptist Church [Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the--come to think about it I was in the youth choir and the current minister that, oh my God what's his name?  Dr. [Xavier L.] Johnson, oh my God he's gon' shoot me I forgot his last name, but anyway he's the Minister at Bethel now.  He and I were in the Youth Choir together you know, and so, and so I was always singing.
Speaker 1: When you were there it was Reverend George [W.] Lucas right?
Speaker 2: Oh, Reverend yeah he was the like the--
Speaker 1: Who became, he became like a civic leader in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was like a charismatic, he was an old, the old-fashioned min--the serious the minister, community leader, father, patriarch.  Reverend Lucas was something boy, I mean he was not, he was not, he was serious and so what, what I remember is music being such a vital part of my life because not only--you know later on we found out that was culture, (laughter) because other people tried to make it look like only they had culture and that you were, you know you didn't have any.  Anyway I, I sang in the Church choir.  I sang in when I--in high school, Roosevelt High School Choir under the revered Cleofus Waldo Dietrich (laughter), it was a European gentlemen and he conducted the Roosevelt Senior Choir and so forth and you know I was a part of that and then we had the--in the neighborhood we were doo-wopping you know and what later began--it was rhythm and blues which later became called "soul music" via "Motown" and so forth, but so we had groups and I remember when we use to have groups competing with each other.  Was that at the, at the Classic and the Theaters and the Y [YMCA], the Y down on 5th Street--groups, we were so organized that groups used to compete for prizes and they use to trade singers and stuff among them and I remember a colleague of mine, Dewey Bailey, we used to call him "Buck Bailey" they had a beautiful group and we had "legendary nights."  Remember these kinda, they had a big competition, and these kinda rumpled looking guys came and they were outta Columbus [Ohio] or something and I remember Dewey Bailey and them.  They were sharp and they had, they had their berets and had their Bermuda shorts and their outfits, it was sharp, and so these were our local heroes so we--and we said Dewey and 'em they gon' smoke these guys.  These guys were all rumpled looking outta Columbus, man when they took--and Dewey and 'em threw down, everybody gave 'em standing ovations.  Man these guys came up on the, on the stage, the five of 'em, this little kinda chunky guy and we--everybody said "oh boy, these poor guys we feel sorry for 'em."  Man, these brothers got the mic and turned it out, it was like an angel came outta this guy's mouth.  Everybody said, "Whoa" I mean they turned the thing out, people were hollering and screaming and stuff and, and this was, I mean this was among us and our--
Speaker 1: Who were they; did they become famous later on?
Speaker 2: I don't know because they--what happened at least in the Ohio groups they would trade singers and stuff.  Somebody in some of those groups may in fact have become famous 'cause they had voices of the caliber of what you heard on the radio and the records.  There was the--and we could not believe, we said, "Man who are these brothers"?  And so they rocked our house, we shut our mouths up after that boy, and but so this was, this was just the people themselves and the youth doing this.  It was just so healthy and as I, I recall and I like to point out to young people, that this was the non-drug, the pre-drug black community, there were no drugs you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now as a youth could you go to the shows at the Classic [Theater] and the Palace [Theater]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah all the time, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh did, 'cause they both I think theaters offered like movies.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then they offered live stage shows with (unclear).
Speaker 2: And the Regal [Theater] too down in Germantown.  My momma [Nannie Bullock] and them were a little kinda, 'cause some funny characters was hanging out at the Regal (laughter).  They kinda didn't, they were worried about our safety, but yeah, we was all up in the Palace, the Classic, the Regal, everything--yeah seeing all the movies and stuff like that and I remember they'd have shorts with Duke Ellington and Satchmo [Louis Armstrong] and different people singing and the music--just our music was just everywhere.  I guess that was the universal force that influenced us; our whole being was the music.
Speaker 1: Yeah the big stars would come to Dayton too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah they would come.
Speaker 1: Yeah, everybody.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah they would come and appear at the clubs and stuff.
Speaker 1: Fats Domino [Antoine Domino], Frankie Lymon and (simultaneous) all of.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I got up and I thought I, thought I was grown I guess I was about (laughter) sixteen or so like that.  I--we use to like lie about our age and sneak in the clubs.  We was singing then too, sneak in the club and be hanging out in the clubs and stuff, thought we were men you know.
Speaker 1: Let me--
Story_ID: 143160
Speaker 1: I wanna get back to that but I wanna go, go, go to grade, back to grade school for a minute, but did, did you like school when you were going to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, school was fun, you know what it--why I liked it--it was so much the character and personality of your teachers and as I said before we were lucky enough to have the old, the old-fashioned teachers from the [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt era who were serious.
Speaker 1: Now, now I wanna start at, at Willard [Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio], now was Willard like all black or was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were your teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they black too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At Willard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what, what inspired me--Willard more than anything else, we had this beautiful teacher from down south named Ms. Turner [ph.], and as old as I am I still Ms. Turner.  You know why?  Now she was--she came from the Negro colleges [HBCUs], very refined but deep Southern accent and she read the poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar to us, and then told us that he was the great poet of Dayton [Ohio], and so we had heard but we didn't realize that he was in Dayton.  We thought he, you know lived down South or something.  We didn't know he lived in Dayton and she would take us, she would talk us through and she'd tell us about Dunbar and his poetry and so two things I grew up with was the music, which was just everywhere and also the knowledge of two great black poets, Paul Laurence Dunbar and Langston Hughes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Ms. Turner at Willard School was very important.
Speaker 2: Un-hun, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you, did, did you and your classmates ever write any poetry in school?
Speaker 2: Well that's very interesting, my orientation was towards the visual arts but what happened was, I think this was--I'm trying to really get a scent of when this was.  I think this was in junior high, I started writing, I wrote this poem about the snow, it just sorta seized me, and (laughter) it's a little--kids' poem but I, I remember the--only I remember is the first two lines: "See the snow come falling down in and out and all over town" and I went and I developed it and so when I read it, they said you know the teacher, nice guy Fred Summers, I think his name was.  He had been a prisoner in German Prison Camps in World War II.  He didn't believe, he thought I copied the poem out of a book and I remember him saying, he said well, he said you didn't--he said we shouldn't do that, and I said I, I didn't copy that.  He said "Come on now."  I said, no, he said because these--and what he said besides you're, you're an artist right.  He said you don't you know, and so what he did, I don't think he meant to do but he implanted in my mind that if you painted and drew pictures you couldn't be a poet.  So I said oh, it was like I was doing something wrong, you know.  I happened to--because now that I realize it we were writing lyrics to love songs and doo-wopping all the time, but that wasn't called poetry and so, something just took it and took it into more formal verse and you know and I got inspired and wrote a couple of things, but I, the--I, I realized we were very influenced by our teachers because I backed off from writing formal poetry after that because I was given the impression that if you, if you did drawing and painting then you couldn't do poetry like a specialization category.
Speaker 1: So, so you were a gifted visual artist--
Speaker 2: Aw yeah--
Speaker 1: --at that time you could--
Speaker 2: --that was, that was I thought my gift.
Speaker 1: --you could draw.
Speaker 2: I expected to become a muralist you know.
Story_ID: 143161
Speaker 1: What were we talking about?
Speaker 2: So we were talking about visual arts.  What was your subject matter, what did you draw and--were you drawing primarily or were you doing any painting?
Speaker 1: Yeah and painting, oil painting, yeah nature and stuff.  One of the things I, I recall and I didn't realize it was even in Dayton [Ohio], our, the life that we led was really interwoven with nature and I remember growing up even when I was a youngster in Desoto Bass [Courts Housing Project] our--being a cub scout and all that, the little, the little kid organizations that our scoutmaster was an expert fisherman, Mr. Brooks [ph.], I'll never forget that and he used to take us fishing.  So we were all always around the creeks and the lakes and then periodically we'd have us, and when we stayed up in the North we'd have summer picnics and stuff and my parent and their friends would go out and we'd go fishing and stuff and so I was--you, you the, the life in the both the South and the Midwest is very much rooted in nature and I was to find out that this wasn't the case everywhere, specifically when, when I went to New York.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dayton had a reputation of being a city with a lot of parks and recreation and.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, even the little woods that were still around you know, and so nature like in the South, that was just a natural part of our everyday experience and life and it was not so much that--what happened was that we--you just absorbed it into your being, you know.  It wasn't no thing, that's what you did, that's the way it was where you lived you know, and it did not even occur to me that I would be in an environment cut-off from nature so to speak.  It's only when I got to New York I learned otherwise (laughter), but and, and of course made me really miss the natural surroundings both in Midwest and in, in the Deep South.
Story_ID: 143162
Speaker 1: Now was Wogaman [Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio] all black school too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, more or less, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you have black teachers at Wogaman?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have any special ones there?
Speaker 2: Yeah when I was in the sixth grade, I was--I can't remember the lady's name, she talked real soft, but boy was she a disciplinarian.  I would venture to say the stuff that we were learning in the sixth, seventh and eighth grade was at the level that these kids learn in high school now.  Those people did not play, I mean I remember they crammed so much stuff into our heads you know, and we were learning all about the products of countries in the Caribbean in South America and Asia, what they produced, what their capitols were and stuff and I mean where--it fed something in me in the sense that it made me one, delight that there was so much variety in the world and also it, it fed a hunger in me for what became what's known today I guess you said it's internationalism.  It fed this hunger in me to see the world, to see these countries, to go to South America which I later did do briefly one summer and the Caribbean and to go to Africa and Asia and so forth and you know it's amazing.  Now I find that you know we were tremendously fortunate to have these brilliant teachers who not only taught us but opened up whole new worlds to us.  Opened up the world of our planet, I mean who talked about treaties and stuff and South America, the battle to free South America from colonialism and stuff.  Ms. Julia Moritz, I'll never forget that, I didn't know that people were fighting for freedom in South America.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: M-O-R-I-T-Z, Julia Moritz and I hope she's still alive today, God bless her.
Speaker 1: Was she at Wogaman or?
Speaker 2: No, no she was at--when I came over to junior high at Roosevelt [High School, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that would be the next year, seventh grade and Mrs. Julia Moritz and teaching us about the lives of the people in South America and how that, that continent tried to free itself from the Spaniards and other rulers and so forth and treaties and.
Speaker 1: Now did you have much interaction at the Art Institute as an artist?  Did you ever, were you involved in any special programs over there?
Speaker 2: We knew about it and we would go to things over there, but see one of the things which--if they had a program we would--as young people we would go over but we, art was very interesting in a sense that Roosevelt taught art so you didn't have to go, I mean anything special.  We had teachers who we had art classes and you learned painting and drawing and stuff right in school and now I understand that a lot of this is not so available to kids.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know.
Speaker 2: We had music class, we had choir, we had music class and band where the kids learned to play all kind of musical instruments and then we had like visual arts you can, you--we would, we were encouraged to make watercolor paintings and stuff.  They didn't deal with oils, oils were so expensive, but my parents bought me a set of oils and so I was messing, I didn't know what the heck I was doing (laughter), but I was messing around experimenting with oil and, and using watercolors on a day-to-day basis and you know and becoming rather proficient, you know in, you at a, I guess you say a student high "school-ish" level but people would say, you know "oh this boy has got talent, he needs to work at it and stuff" and then I had a--friends, buddies and stuff who were also budding artists as well.
Story_ID: 143163
Speaker 1: --You know?
Speaker 2: Now, now what was--I know that at that time there was--Dayton [Ohio] was going through Great Migration, a lot of black people from the South were moving into Dayton--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they started moving west on Third Street [Dayton, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in an area that had not been designed for black people.  Roosevelt High School [Dayton, Ohio], one of the, I think it was the largest high school in the Midwest when it was built.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Two swimming pools, two gyms, huge hallways.
Speaker 1: --and track.
Speaker 2: Track.
Speaker 1: Track, a track inside yeah.
Speaker 2: Rolling hill campus you know that, that all of a sudden now that black students enrolled in a town that thought that [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Dayton, Ohio] was gon' be the only school that blacks would go to right?
Speaker 1: Roosevelt under the esteemed Ms. Nettie Lee Roth the, the matriarch, the diva of education, a high school education in Dayton.  As I said we, we were fortunate, we had some serious teachers, I mean I remember Ms. Mildred Beam, Ms. Stuckhart, Ms. Beam, old maiden ladies.  Their whole life was teaching, they taught us Shakespeare, they had us doing Shakespeare, had us acting Macbeth.  They showed films of Macbeth and then we had to act out and stuff, and I mean it was just fascinating and I guess the, the kind of negative light came in some clashes we had with Ms. Roth who expressed that majority view that the black students were kinda gettin' above themselves, and in her own way attempted to curtail fraternization.
Speaker 2: Now there's a--I know there's a history, we interviewed [HM] Margaret Peters who went to Roosevelt before you did.
Speaker 1: Aw.
Speaker 2: And she talked about separate pools for black and white, they had two pools but they made them--they were girls and boys at one time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But now--then they became black and white when black students started going to Roosevelt, you know.  Was there a lot of racial tension in the school when you were there?
Speaker 1: You, you could feel it, you--because we were two populations of young people sorta getting to know each other and there was both curiosity and tension and then there was the stereotypes going back and forth and you know you had, you had class splits, two on both sides.  You had the, the white kids who were poor whites and you had the more middle class affluent white kids, and then you had the class splits among the African American kids too as well, and then you had the group solidarity and clashes and so forth and the thing I think that had we had a more enlightened principal a lot of this stuff could've been smoother, because I mean we, we gen--we worked very well generally together, athletically on our athletic teams and also and we had a beautiful choir like I said Mr. Dietrich was not a white American, he was from Europe, he might have been German, Cleo, Cleofus Waldo Dietrich, so he didn't care what your complexion was you had to learn this part and he didn't take any foolishness.  He's an old maestro, choir maestro, but I mean we worked together and we, we competed for state championships and choir and stuff and so, so we could work together with enlightened people guiding us but I'm, I'm, I have to say that Ms. Roth sort of threw a monkey wrench into all of that and she was a source of a lot of the tension and stuff to the point that in my junior year when we had the great basketball players, the Big Three, Norman Lee, Anthony Steele [ph.] and Uriah "Hoorah" Hollis when we were battling for the state championship she had heard that, that the, the kids were fraternizing after school and stuff and she conducted like a whole [Joe] McCarthy-ite-like thing of, of taking the athletes and the other kids into rooms and grilling them like it was, like she was the police or something and then she threatened the, the--ooh boy, this is gon', this is being taped and well, well I had to tell the truth.  She threatened (laughter) she threatened the stars, the basketball stars with expulsion for socializing with some of the cheerleaders and stuff and--
Speaker 2: Well these would be white cheerleaders right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah--
Story_ID: 143164
Speaker 1: And so because I think the first black cheerleader we had was my beautiful colleague Janeice Cochran [Day], Reverend [M. Bartlett Cochran] and Mrs. [Carrie Watson] Cochran's daughter who I to this day--I think Janeice is a educator in New Jersey now and Janice--
Speaker 2: Is this the Reverend Cochran that was a reverend of St. Margaret's [Episcopal Church, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Father Cochran, yeah.
Speaker 2: Father Cochran, okay yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah Janice was his, his daughter, his oldest daughter and she was our first black cheerleader at Roosevelt [High School, Dayton, Ohio] and she did a wonderful job of course and everybody she was very outstanding, beautiful, charismatic and, but Ms. [Nettie Lee] Roth I mean had serious problems with this and so she conducted her own little [Joe] McCarthy investigation and it was tension and she--that whole thing infused in all of the students that something was wrong with any kind of interrelationship between the ethic group, that this was a no-no.
Speaker 2: Now there was also tension in the surrounding community, I believe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I know that the, the lunch spot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Across Third Street from Roosevelt, the Teddy Bear.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah the Teddy Bear.
Speaker 2: Yeah I know there was the Teddy Bear and I think it was a place called the Sugar Bowl, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I'm not sure, there were two of them I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah
Speaker 2: But were they both--I know the Teddy Bear was segregated and?
Speaker 1: Yeah you had separate facilities and stuff and you know I (unclear).
Speaker 2: So if you went in there for instance what would happen, I mean, just give us a down on the ground version.
Speaker 1: There was tension, they would encourage you not to you know that you go down the street to the black--right down the street was a place where the black kids gathered, and I think as it.
Speaker 2: So they would encourage you how, would they just tell you to go there or what?
Speaker 1: Yeah well, they yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Or not wait on you?
Speaker 1: Yeah right, and so all of that.
Speaker 2: Well, well tell us.
Speaker 1: They were, they were people--there were incidents where they wouldn't--they refused to wait on people and told 'em "go down to your place down the street, what do you think this is?"  And so what happened was I think this was my junior year, I don't think it was my senior year, I think it was my junior year.  Some of the kids got tired of that and they called our great champion [William Sumpter] W.S. McIntosh and so, so Mack went down there and said "what's going on here," and he said "you can't be discriminating against these kids," and so Mack put a, he got some veterans and stuff and put a picket line (laughter) outside of there (unclear), and they was like "what, you, you can't do this," he said, Mack said "this is America I can do this," and so they had a picket line, it got all in the paper and then paper attacked Mack and tried to say he was well he was a troublemaker and possibly "communist-inspired" as they're red-baiting people and stuff and they did a whole thing on Mack and that just made us, made everybody love Mack more, but my father [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] said something about Mack needed to cool out and let the established Negro leaders take care of it or something.  Of course.
Speaker 2: I know there was a tension between Mack and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on some level ground (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah my father, which I found out later was a member of the NAACP and so yeah I guess they considered Mack kind of a rabble-rouser but you know you need everybody and so anyway, I remember being in class and Coach Gorby, Dave Gorby who was a football coach and we were in class he said "what's wrong with that man," and my buddy Dickey Jenkins [ph.], Dickey played, Dickey played guard on the football, he's a you know first-string guard. Dickey was very smart, I think Dickey later went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and his father was Mr. Jenkins.  I think he was an engineer or something and I remember Coach Gorby said "Jenkins, your father's a leader, can't, can't your father talk, can't some of you talk to this man, he's making trouble" and so forth.  It was obvious Gorby didn't like the tension which was growing from Mack's civil rights act, activism and stuff and so I guess I kinda and some of the younger, the youngsters we kinda liked the fact that there was some black guy who could shake the white folks up and so we went--and then I know Mr. Mack 'cause we use to--our families use to have dinner together and I, I remember from Mack, I didn't know--he use to have this sign he use to picket stuff "Free Jomo Kanyatta."  I said, "Well who--Jomo, who is that?"  He said the great Kikuyu leader.  We said "Who's Jo, ya'll know who this--we was all our little peer group, "Who's Jomo Kanyatta?"  So we had to go look up, and Mr. Mack said "Look it up boys, you should know this."  We had to go look up, find out who Jomo Kanyatta was, and so Mack was always like a kinda vanguard kinda activist, the warrior activist leader of the community and he was independent he had his own business, West Side Cleaners down the--on Summit [Street, Dayton, Ohio] right around the corner from Germantown and you know he was just an independent activist leader and we all respected Mack you know.
Story_ID: 143165
Speaker 1: And so yeah so gettin' back to school, yeah it was some.
Speaker 2: So this is 1954 I guess?
Speaker 1: That would be about '54 [1954], '55 [1955] around that period.
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954], '55 [1955] okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And yeah it was some tension and so forth but I think that it could've been handled--looking back that had [Roosevelt High School, Dayton, Ohio principal] Ms. [Nettie Lee] Roth been more of a cosmopolitan person.  She tended to play on the backwardness that you know that, that was manifesting itself and stuff instead of trying to be a--she was a polarizer herself.
Speaker 2: I, I know that there like quite a few Appalachian whites living in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: In those days and had a very.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also some of the old people from, came up from Kentucky too.
Speaker 2: Right, that's what I mean yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, outta Kentucky and so another--there was a little tension too that there was a buzz among the athletes that all the white boys get scholarships to [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and the Big Ten and the most that they could give us was the--some Negro college in the South and at that time we were you know into that civil rights progress, we had a right to any--which was right, we had a right to go anywhere and so it was--so it was tension and you'd have out--guys who'd all-city players and they wouldn't get the scholarship and some of the guys who were second, they were good, they were okay, but they weren't all-city, they'd get the scholarships to Michigan and Ohio and stuff, Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and stuff so it was tension you know.  We always ask "why it's got to be a two-tiered system?" If we all playin' shouldn't everything be open to all of us?  So we started asking a lot of questions then.
Speaker 2: Now what was the--how did people in the community react when the boycott of Teddy Bear actually resulted in the integration of the Teddy Bear?
Speaker 1: Well you know black people felt that--it was, it was it was like a class relationship.  Grassroots people said "right on, Mack" (laughter) you know Mack [William Sumpter "W.S." McIntosh] is our man and then some of the more kind of proper-colored people felt that "well yeah, but Mack didn't handle it right, he's just increased the tension.  He should have let the established Negro leaders handle it" or something you know so but it was like a general satisfaction that it did fall in our favor, but and especially at the withering attacks I remember it's interesting at--as the papers began to really center in on Mack and attack him, certain racist elements threw firebombs in his--through the window in his cleaners and there was--they started a fire but they were able to put it out and then they threatened Jay, Jay Wolford, his son.
Speaker 2: Who was a student then too right?
Speaker 1: Yeah he was a student, younger, Jay was younger than we were, but you know Mack's became concerned for security about his son and stuff you know.
Story_ID: 143166
Speaker 1: He [William Sumpter "W.S." McIntosh] grew up in Little Rock [Arkansas], his grandfather--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was a lawyer in Little Rock, was a big deal down there.
Speaker 2: Oh, no wonder 'cause he was conscious socially man--
Speaker 1: And he was.
Speaker 2: --and politically.
Speaker 1: Oh his grandfather was a trip, now I don't know what his father did, but his grandfather was really out there, he was like a leader in Little Rock.  He was an attorney in Little Rock.
Speaker 2: No wonder so he came by it honestly, 'cause he was always talkin' about fighting the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] and stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean he was, he was serious.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his, his grandfather (simultaneous) fought the Klan down there you know in South Carolina before he moved to Little Rock.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Little Rock.
Speaker 2: Okay so it was--I mean he was totally militant back then.
Speaker 1: His grandfather was born into slavery.
Speaker 2: Ah!
Speaker 1: You know and, and.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Made the transition to Arkansas.
Speaker 2: To Ar--yeah.
Speaker 1: And went to Philander Smith [College, Little Rock, Arkansas] and then became--got a law degree through the mail, believe it or not.
Speaker 2: See I'm just so proud that somebody's talkin' about Mack like this.  Is it, it is, are they gonna do a biography or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're trying to do something, we got a scholarship fund and we're trying to do some other stuff.
Story_ID: 143167
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the integration of the Teddy Bear [restaurant, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And some of the other--now there's a story I read in Dayton Daily News that--concerning [William Sumpter "W.S."] McIntosh and I was reading about him but they, they said there was a riot on the West Side [Dayton, Ohio] after the death of Emmett Till.  Do you--after, do you remember the lynching of Emmett Till being in the papers?
Speaker 2: Aw yeah.
Speaker 1: And how it affected you all in school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, it was just devastating and that was one of the real frightening things of my adolescence, because you felt that this is what they did to kids our age, and we knew about the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] and them, we learned that from our parents and so forth.  If you had any white friends, you had any pictures or anything people would check your wallet, said "Don't take none of that when you go down South said 'cause they will kill you know."  So we, you know it was still kinda abstract till we saw the picture of Emmett Till and that scared us for a generation, that's something you can't, that wasn't about no discussion once you saw that, so yeah, yeah, so we never, we never forgot two things, two things that I will never forget and I talk with young people today and it just shocks them and I find, I feel delighted that they're shocked, course Emmett Till that image which really fired up black people to roll their sleeves up and turn this thing around.  I think two, all of the black veterans coming from World War II [WWII] who had you know fought for this country felt they were gon' turn this thing around, but yeah, Emmett, Emmett Till and also the fact that as late as the mid '50s [1950s] when I, when I went into the [U.S.] Air Force in parts of this country, we were under--wearing the uniform of the American military ready to like give our lives and we were under segregation in the South so and people, I tell young people, "they said what", we said "yes", when--I remember when I was in, in basic training and afterwards in Texas at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio they had segregation against not only the African Americans but also the Mexicans, the Mexicans and Latino soldiers, and so here we were wearing the uniform of the country and barred from going in certain restaurants, theaters or whatever, you know and I remember they were messing with people in the Middle East at that time and they were going--talking about war and Lebanon and so they were getting ready to send some battle groups in to the area of Lebanon in the Middle East and they were talking about getting on alert from the bases and stuff and here we were perhaps getting ready to go into battle and yet we were just like in World War II, we were still under apartheid in this country and so I, I know when I speak to, I say "That's a bitter experience" I tell young people. They were saying "What?"  We said, "Yes we were wearing, we were soldiers, sailors, marines wearing the uniform of the country and yet we couldn't eat.  Well you would think that-- people would say "Oh, soldiers, come on in son oh we're glad to have these young men here representing our"--and they were like "not black GI, Latino GI, Mexican--stay out," so all these things happened to young people because you know somebody tell you, you can't do anything.  People said "What," and so this fired us up to just like our uncles and people from World War II to roll our sleeves up and drag America kicking and screaming into the true twentieth century you know.
Story_ID: 143168
Speaker 1: Let, let me ask you just go back to high school for a minute now.  Now were you involved in groups and clubs in high school?  Was that possible when you were at Roosevelt [High School, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well I was--I dabbled in athletics; I guess I was too small, I never made any of the teams but I, I did run track, I was very athletic.
Speaker 1: Did you play baseball?
Speaker 2: No I didn't play baseball, I think my major activities were cultural in a sense.  I was involved in singing groups and stuff.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your group, or how many groups were you in (laughter) I don't know?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) we, we trade people, different groups.  Now I got jumped on by the brothers Jackie Crawford and Peanut Albert Edmund and so we had--and Danny, I forgot Danny's last name, but anyway we had a quartet and according to Jackie Crawford he was the outstanding sportsman and community leader Cal Crawford, Ms. Evelyn Crawford were his parents.  They claimed--Jackie claimed that they were negotiating with King rec--King Records to get a contract, and then both--I went into the [U.S.] Air Force and Albert Peanut, Peanut went into the [U.S.] Navy and Jackie, Jackie said "you knuckleheads, man we could've been--we could've blown up man, y'all went into the Service you know" and we, we actually you know left and actually went and joined the military, both Peanut and myself.  It was interesting because when we went into the Service, now just because we went into the Service that didn't stop the rhythm and blues.  I was in the Service with Robert Green from the Flamingos and Herman [Curtis], now what the heck was Herman's last name?  From another--I lost Herman's name but anyway he was also an outstanding professional singer and one of the brothers that was stationed with us when we, and we were at--this is--we were at Youngstown Municipal Airport [Youngstown, Ohio] but they had a Air Force wing in Youngstown, and we were stationed in Youngstown.  Herman, what was Herman's last name, but he would--Herman sang with the Solitaires and then Robert Green was with the Flamingos and later on when I was in Texas, Little Willie John, the blues singer was in there.  So people were all in the Air--in the Air Force, the music was just right in the Air Force, then I met a lot of brothers who were jazz musicians, saxophonists, drummers and stuff and so when I was, when I was up in Youngstown I was--there was so much culture it was just, as much as culture inside the military as it was out.  So I remember a very great artist illustrator named Ronald Fant [ph.].  Fant was from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and another buddy of mine, Ronnie Johnson.  Fant, Ronnie Johnson and them were from Pittsburgh and they--so Fant, Fant played Conga drums but he was a great artist too and so Fant and I took classes at the Youngstown Art Institute 'cause like you did your, your Air Force work during the day.  Well the Air Force at that time allowed us to put on civil [civilian] clothes after our duty hours and so Fant and I actually went to art classes at Youngstown, the Art Institute in Youngstown and actually painted from the models, drew from the models and stuff and so while I was in the (laughter) in the military the music continued, the art continued and everything and some of the guys were scholars and intellectuals in there and I remember a very outstanding intellectual named [Wilford] Broadnax [ph.].
Story_ID: 143169
Speaker 1: Wilford Broadnax [ph.] and he was from New York [City, New York], that was the first time I had met a real hip guy from New York who was an intellectual, and Fant [ph.] and Broadnax and them, man they would discuss the meaning of life, Richard Wright's poetry and his novels.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he's the president of Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] now, [sic, Walter] Broadnax, I think he is.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the same, if that's the same Broadnax but--
Speaker 2: Did he work in, in work for the State Department or something or?
Speaker 1: I don't know, see I didn't--
Speaker 2: Forgot what, okay.
Speaker 1: --follow him after we got out. He as a very handsome dark complexion brother, sort of chiseled features, muscular you know and very brilliant mind, and 'cause he use to have--Broadnax was interesting he was saying he was taking courses at Youngstown University [Youngstown, Ohio], a lot of these [U.S. Air Force] officers were and he use to snipe at these arrogant white officers, 'cause he said, "So lieutenant you flunked the last huh?  You all right?"  And he said "Well what did you get?"  He said "Oh I got, I aced it with a B plus" and so he was always debating these guys you know and the youngsters, I, I would be looking, they called me "young blood."  He said, "What you looking at young blood?" I was saying, "Wow" I said, "Man you said that to an officer?"  He said, "Hey we all in class together what the heck you know?"  And anyway so I and then met--I had-- real enrichment because we ran into Airmen who had been in Europe and they were coming back to the states and so we--I saw the experience of the brothers who were in Europe post-World War II [WWII] and what--they were having big riots over in Europe, race riots on the bases and battling all in the towns and stuff, and so we got all of that and so forth.  In fact that helped (laughter) me get out--I guess my, my brother just may have been where it all began.  We--what happened was (laughter) was the guys felt it was discrimination going--the mechanics down on the flight line and you know I, I, I got transferred up from Youngstown [Ohio] to Wurtsmith Air Force Base in [Iosco County] Michigan, and I was the only black airman in headquarters and so it was a lot of tension developing on the flight line with the, with the mechanics and stuff and a lot of discrimination against the black, black air mechanics you know engineers, guys who were putting the planes together and stuff and so (laughter) I got to meet 'em, they come, they say, "Young blood," they say, "You work up here?"  They say, "You the only black guy up here?"  I said, "Yeah."  They said, "Where you from?"  I said, "Dayton, Ohio."  They said, "Oh yeah, okay you from the Midwest huh, yeah."  So they said, "We want to talk with you."  They said, "You do that typing and everything right?"  I said, "Yeah."  They said, "You know Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.]?"  I said, "Yeah Congressman Powell?"  He said "Yeah," he said, "Well we been having some trouble and we wanna do something about it".  So they said, "Well let him in," and so these old guys were veterans, the older guys you know, talking (laughter) and so I ended up typing up this letter on behalf of the black--(laughter) the sergeants and the black airmen at Wurtsmith Air Force Base to Congressman Adam Clayton Powell on the subject of racism against the black airmen (laughter) and sent it off and asked the Congressman Powell led an--a inspection committee to come and inspect the conditions at Wurtsmith Air Force Base (laughter) and--I mean I was actually in the office you know where the colonel was who ran the Air Force Base.  He was a war hero, he had been a fighter pilot in the latter part of World War II and then he was almost like an Ace in Korea, he was you know big guy (laughter) and so I got--it must've gotten back 'cause usually it was many other brothers involved in this and so I remember him saying, "Well you know it's, you know that progress is coming" and so and so and so, there've been--it all of a sudden people started talking about brotherhood and stuff (laughter) up in headquarters.  You know they hadn't been talking about that before and so--and then right after that, well they had frozen the rank--we wasn't gettin'--I only had two stripes, we could, no matter how much experience you had they froze rank in the Air Force so you couldn't make any more--no matter how good you were, any more promotions.  You couldn't get any more money and so they bet (laughter) with us and say they--everybody white and black, they met with--they said "Look fellas, that we know that you are ambitious young men, you've represented your country well and stuff, but as you well know due to unforeseen conditions, the rank has been frozen.  Now one of the things that--it has come to our attention that a lot of you young men plan on furthering your education and you don't plan to make the Air Force your career and so and they were looking at some of us while they were saying it," he said "so no that's just wonderful and then we, Air Force produces you know great Americans, you know the whole--so we were--we come up with an idea.  We think that it would both be help you forward in your careers and us too since--he said, what you have--I think I had six more months to serve.  So they said, you get an early out under honorable conditions, but early so you can go and apply for the college wherever you wanna go and so forth, and so we said "well, hey you know (laughter)," but actually that was the way they got rid of the troublemakers (laughter).  They said 'cause you guys aren't gonna be career members in the Air Force, so (laughter) they let us out, the whole crew of demagogues and rabble-rousers they let us out early you know, and so your good honorable discharge under everything, but they got us.
Speaker 2: So, so when was this, this was like fifty--
Speaker 1: Yeah I was supposed to get out--
Speaker 2: --eight [1958]?
Speaker 1: --in August or July '60 [1960], they let me out in December '59 [1959] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 143170
Speaker 1: And you know I came home, I remember my parents [Nannie Bullock Snellings and Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] being rather surprised.   I said, "Well yeah they let us out early, we couldn't make any more rank and we were just wasting time.  We could've been doing something else."  So I was out and my friend William Day who's he--Bill Day graduated a year before I--he graduated from Roosevelt [High School, Dayton, Ohio] in '55 [1955].  He played end on the football team and stuff.  Bill Day had come in, he had been in the Air Force in Japan and so Bill and I were, and so he, yeah he said why don't we take some courses, he said so you, he said, "You still mess around," he said, "You still draw and paint?"  I said, "Yeah man."  He said, you--he said, "Yeah man I still mess around."  So we started going and taking courses out at the Art Institute, Dayton Art Institute [Dayton, Ohio] and, and I remember Bill said, "But you know we really wasting our time man," he said, "This is cool," he-- "But you know everybody say the action's in New York [City, New York]" and so I said, "Yeah, I heard that too."  He said, "Well ain't nothing keeping us here is it?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well let's get on up here my brother and get on in the action."  And so Bill and I got our stuff and hopped the bus, did we hop the bus?  Yeah, hopped the bus and went on to New--to the [Big] Apple you know from Dayton [Ohio] you know and as the man said the rest is history.  I enrolled in the--we got jobs of course and I--we did all kinda jobs from including working in factories in Brooklyn [New York] or whatever and I enrolled in the Art Students League of New York [City] and where was Bill at?  I think Bill went there for a while but he went somewhere else after that and when I--once I had gotten settled in the Art Students League, I met artists, models and stuff and that's how, and some people referred me to who would become my sort of mentor, big brother like the Tom Feelings and I met Tom and of course Tom introduced me to his cadre of--his brothers, you know and then to Elombe Brath and Kwame [Brathwaite] and that began the whole cycle you know.
Speaker 2: Now, now Tom Feelings he's really an important black artist, who's--
Speaker 1: Oh certainly.
Speaker 2: --he passed about two or three years ago?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah which just devastated all of us 'cause it happened so fast and I think it was, I think it might have been stomach cancer, but I remember talking to [HM] Dr. Jemadari Kamara who has works with us her and he's a--he use to be the head of African American Studies at UMass Boston [University of Massachusetts at Boston, Boston, Massachusetts], but like he'll probably come through for the program that we have this coming Sunday with Marvin X and me, but I remember getting the word and Jemadari came, and I said "Did you know Tom has passed," and I remember Jemadari said, "Oh no Tom we were just talking together in Alabama, what are you talking about Tom Feelings?  You think--last week we were at this conference" and so it was that recent and just all of a sudden Tom was gone and he's--and so I asked him, "Well did he seem all right"?  He said, "Yeah it's Tom, you know, he said nothing was--he said you sure about this Askia?"  And he checked and he said, "I checked they said Tom had died", and so I guess it was sudden but he said it didn't seem like anything was wrong with Tom, he was just regular Tom.  You know, he was having a tremendous run with his whole epic book, 'The Middle Passage' with his great drawings and so forth and so it was a real--in a way it was like the end of an era.
Story_ID: 143171
Speaker 1: But Tom [Feelings] introduced me to the art world in New York [City, New York], and in fact he introduced me to the poetry world (laughter) too because he knew Tom Dent [Thomas Dent], Calvin [C.] Hernton, David Henderson and the Umbra poets and he was going to do some illustration, or he was meeting with the Umbra poets to talking about doing an illustration for the first Umbra [Magazine].  In fact he did, I think he did do that.  Anyway and so he asked me, he said "Do you know Tom Dent and them?"  I said, "No," I said well--at that time I didn't--I'd, I'd heard of--everybody heard of LeRoi Jones [Amiri Baraka], you know the poet and playwright but I said I know--I said "there are some black poets down in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York City, New York]"? He said, "Yeah," he said, "Come go with me" and so I, he took me at--to Umbra and Umbra had a Black Writers, Poet and Writers workshop at Tom Dent's apartment and I came up in there.  All these young black people and I mean people reading from poems and excerpts from novels and short stories man.  I said, "Whoa, yeah I was just intrigued and so, so I, but I was still viewing myself as a visual artist and I remember David Henderson did a real soulful poem about Harlem [New York] using all kind of rhythms and stuff and David, David came up on rhythm and blues so a lot of stuff that I had been picking up in the lyrics and stuff that I write, that I was writing for songs, he was doing it in his poetry and so I remember saying "Whoa," I said, "That's poetry," I said, "Well I've been doing forms" and I said, "But that's poetry?"  'Cause we had thought poetry was somebody, John Greenleaf Whittier or something, we were, we said, "Oh that's poetry," I said, "Well shoot I can do that."  I said, "We do that when we write the music."  I said man, and so.
Speaker 2: So this is like the tail end of the beat generation type stuff in Greenwich Village?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah you know.
Speaker 2: In Greenwich Village and?
Speaker 1: Yeah and they were in.
Speaker 2: The black.
Speaker 1: And they were independent and what was so beautiful is the edit--the head editors, Tom Dent, Calvin Hernton and David they all knew Langston Hughes and Mr. Hughes he'd just adopt you, and so and they would bring me, every so often they'd go up to his house in Harlem and he'd talk with 'em about stuff and so, and he just adopted the whole workshop and what, what Langston would do, we'd say "Papa Langston" he'd just like, he would--'cause he was doing his plays on Broadway and stuff and he'd get us tickets and stuff and if we didn't get to the actual play he'd could get us into dress rehearsals and stuff.
Speaker 2: I know in those days one of Langston, Langston Hughes' 'Simple' stories were very popular and I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah, in, in the newspapers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, CBS did a piece--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --on--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 143172
Speaker 1: Man we were, I mean, we didn't--you know see with us it was just like our lives but now later, it's like "Oh, were you there in New York [City, New York]?  It was a renaissance," well yeah I guess, but we didn't think.  It was just what we did and we were there.  We were young students and young artists and it was just reality to us and they had you know, Jackson Pollock and the Action Painters and all.  All that was just all around us and I remember Bill Day [ph.] and I--I mean we almost run ourselves into bad health.  We was trying to see every doggone artist show all over New York, we were--the people in New York--I guess they say, "Well these guys are crazy."  I mean 'cause they were very--people in Brooklyn [New York] just wanted to hang out in Brooklyn.  People in the Bronx [New York] just wanted to hang out, and so we was going to Brooklyn, Bronx, you know to Manhattan [New York], we were down in the [Greenwich] Village.  They were saying, "Well who are these guys?" (laughter) you know, but we were like "Wow" you know I guess you know country boys from the Midwest right?  And but it was just like an explosion of culture and creativity and thing, things which were outta sight, 'cause I lived--when I first got to New York I lived in Brooklyn for a while but I mean man you could get a, you could get a one-bedroom apartment down the East Village for shoot man, under fifty dollars a month, thirty dollars or thirty-five dollars a month man, and so I was saying, "Well man why am I paying this money in some room in Brooklyn when I can have me an apartment that's a--" everybody, everybody started moving into the East Village man, and, and we were like you were saying, down there well yeah all the remnants, the beat people and--not only the, the beat people but you had the old Bohemians and people from the 1930s and '40s [1940s] all of them were down there too.  They were elders by then but they were still around you know?  And so it was just this enriching kinda atmosphere of culture and the arts and all levels you know, and I remember I was--'cause I, you know I got tired of what I was doing.  I was going to art school during the day and then working in these factories in Brooklyn at night, even though I was you know like twenty, twenty-one well that, that'll get to you after a while. I said, "Man I got to do something else, this is bur--" 'cause then I had to go to, you know go into art school doing--I be tired.  So I said, "Well look I'm gon' take a leap in the dark." I started doing messenger work, where just delivering packages all of the city during the day and then you know after art class; I'd go to art class during morning hours up to about noon or soon and from about one to about five or six I'd take packages all around the city.  Hey, I mean I was getting as much as I was doing in the factories in Brooklyn and I was feeling good and seeing the city and then an interesting thing happened.  A guy I knew who was a painter, said he said, "Well look you say you still at the Art Institute, right Snellings?"  I said, "Yeah," he said, "Well look" he said, "What you doin'."  I said, "Man," he said, "You still in those factories man, 'cause that'll burn you out."  I said, "No, man," I said, "I just do messenger work."  He said, "Oh yeah, I know some guys who are doin' that."  He said, "There's an opening at this gallery," he said, "What you do you just watch the paintings and any sales from the--you get a percentage." So then so I started doing like messenger work, and then working in this gallery and stuff and every now and then the artist would make a sale and I'd get a little bit of money and then I was into the Bohemian life for sure then.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: Now about what year is this when you start working in the gallery too?
Speaker 2: Um, when was this (unclear).
Speaker 1: How long had you been in New York [City, New York] then?
Speaker 2: Less than a year, about a year, about a year I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it must've around '60 [1960] somewhere between '60 [1960] and '61 [1961] and then I and then I, and then I was--a great institution in our lives in that period was the Fulton Art Fair and that was the like the Black Arts academy in black Brooklyn [New York], that's basically what it was and it was overseen by Jacob Lawrence and other senior artists in Brooklyn and I can't think of the other outstanding artist that was linked up with that.  He was also worked with Freedom Ways, for some reason I'm blanking on his name, but anyway.
Speaker 1: Not [Romare] Bearden?
Speaker 2: No not Romey, I, I discovered Romey later, but Jake man, it was deep man, you could just come to Jake's house man, and his--Mrs. Lawrence [sic, Gwendolyn Knight] was a painter too and you just, you know somebody had to introduce you. I remember coming over there and showing Jake my paintings from the [U.S.] Air Force.
Story_ID: 143173
Speaker 1: He was just more the literary wing when--they were like radical democrats, they didn't like, they didn't, they weren't pompous windbags, I mean they'd said, "Yeah come on in young man, young lady come on in, you got your--some samples of your work, yeah, dear, would you like a beer or something, soda, get her something, let us see what you got.  What you got here for me?"  Like it was like you know and you'd say "Wow".  You had access and they weren't into that pompous snob stuff and that probably was from the old period of the WPA [Works Progress Administration] and all that when they were young people and stuff and so I couldn't believe it.  My man said "Well look man," he says, "You look, Rolland man," he said, "You got any of the paintings and stuff you did from the [U.S.] Air Force?"  And--
Speaker 2: Oh, we're rolling; I didn't know we were rolling yet so I (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter), I said "Yeah I do."  He said, "Well, look Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence] said for you to come by and here's where he lives."  And I brought my paintings from the Air Force and you know showed Jake and he'd give--he gave me a hardcore critique.  I said, "Whoa," he said "No, you got to work for your forms and you gotta do this and that and stuff" and so but I took it to heart you know, and 'cause I was--by that time you know I was really kinda almost semi-trained, I wasn't really--by the time I got to the Art Institute then I was under expert training, and so anyway so I guess it was about a year after they had the Fulton Art Fair and I had these--I had this triptych that I had done on black people and the whole concept of freedom of black people in America and Africa and stuff and so and then I wrote (laughter) it was interesting, the writing began to develop.  I wrote a little manifesto with the triptych and so I showed it at the Fulton Art Fair [Brooklyn, New York].  Now here's where Jake and them used their compliment.  So I was sitting, I was nervous 'cause I know that Jake and Ernie Crichlow.
Speaker 2: Ernie Crichlow right.
Speaker 1: Ernest Crichlow, they were like the presiding elder artist--senior artists there and so, so you have you know your, your paintings on these--you had this gigantic wrought iron fences and people attached their paintings to the fences and outdoors with the trees and stuff and then you know Tom [Feelings].
Speaker 2: Now, now is this the same fair, the Fulton Street's the main drag in black Brooklyn?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I know, is this the same?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah it would be on Fulton Street.
Speaker 2: Fair that became the, the, the big Brooklyn Street Fair every year that ran?
Speaker 1: No, no that's two different things.
Speaker 2: That's different, okay.
Speaker 1: No was pre that.
Speaker 2: Pre-that okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And so anyway Tom, and Tom I, I realized quietly opened some doors for me you know and so I remember Mr. Crichlow and Jake and some other of the elders, they would come around and they had official judges and stuff and I was, I remember being very nervous you know, and they came you know, you know just kind of ritualistic and about all excitement would get in the air and they would come and so I remember when I showed my triptych they stood, Mr. Jake Lawrence said, "Look man," he said, and he was standing a long time looking and so I was, you know I was so--my heart was beating all fast, so he turned, he said "Um, I see you've been working," and I said, "Wow!"  If you were serious that's how they said "Um, I see you've been working," and so I said, "Wow" man, I was in seven heaven, you know I was a young kid too, twenty or twenty-one, I said, "Oh wow man you hear what he said?"  He said "Yeah man, he likes it."  I said, "Man, did you hear what he said?  Oh man."  You know so like kids you know, but it was great you know.
Story_ID: 143174
Speaker 1: And it was--the fact that it was standards you know and a not--a number of outstanding, you had Tom [Feelings], you had Leo Carty, you had a number of the artists who would rise to prominence in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] who were like young professional artists emerging like, and, and it was just wonderful you know and then you had--while that was going on you had let's see Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln came out with their great--that's when the, the jazz was transforming more even conscious than it was.  The 'Freedom Suite' came out 'We Insist Freedom Now' Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln and stuff and then I had--Tom had introduced me to part of his posse Elombe Brath and Ronnie Brathwaite [Kwame Brathwaite], the Brathwaite brothers and they had Elombe and, and well Kwame [Brathwaite], he calls himself Kwame now.  They had organized the Grandassa Models with Bob and Jean, young lady Jean Gumbs, Helene Brathwaite who was Elombe's wife and Black, Black Rose Nelmes, Sister Rose Nelmes was the captain of the Grandassa Models and they--
Speaker 2: N-E-L-M-S?
Speaker 1: Yeah, N-E-L-M-E-S.
Speaker 2: --M-E-S, okay.
Speaker 1: And I think Black Rose's name, yeah and Black Rose she was also a beautician as well and I remember--what happened they were coming out with wigs in the community.  I remember being in Harlem and so Elombe and 'em said, "Oh no, we ain't going with--we ain't going for this" and they knew it was other ethnic groups trying to brainwash our sisters.  So the Grandassa Models picketed the wig stores.  Man, that--our people came with cameras, were taking pictures and stuff and then this guy Frankie Crocker who was you know one of these so-called "soul DJs" he said--so what happened was--it was a big fight started brewing in the black community.  I mean now we don't even talk about this, we done become so assimilated.  It was a big fight and Frankie Crocker said, "Yeah, all you hear is these ole' nappy-headed women picketing the wig store, that man got a right to have his, his wigs there and so forth, if you don't like 'em, don't buy 'em," and so then he said, "Yeah, this is your soul DJ Frankie Crocker."  You know and so, so what happened was Frankie Crocker started knocking the Grandassa and so the--the Naturally Shows.  They had like Naturally '58, Naturally '59, Naturally '60 and that was the African Consciousness Show and so anyway so Frankie Crocker and them started--so Elombe and them had, that must've been Naturally '61 I think and it was all on the radio advertising.  Frankie Crocker and them started knocking, they said, "Yeah come on out to Brooklyn [New York], we asking you fans, you hipsters come on out and we gonna picket these ole' nappy-head women" and so and so.  Yeah, man backward, so, so we told Elombe, Elombe said "No that's good, let 'em come on, let 'em come on", and so I'll never forget that and we could feel the tension in the air and we--the place was packed.  It was grassroots, black professional, everybody, community.  It was like--it must've been a two, three thousand people up in there and the spotlights came on and Abbey Lincoln would stand up on the stage looking like some African High Priestess in beautiful robes and a high gele with the mic in her hand and then started chanting the various "Zulu, Asante, Wolof" and you heard "boom, batta, rhum" and it came on Max Roach was on and playing the drums and they had this big beard and everybody started hollering then the spotlights came on and here the sisters standing in their beautiful African robes with their hair styled, Clara Buggs, Priscilla Bardonille, Helene, Black Rose and all the Grandassa Models, man people started screaming boy, because hip New York [City, New York] black women had never seen themselves in their natural African beauty.  We turned that sucker out.
Story_ID: 143175
Speaker 1: People was on their feet screaming and hollering and stuff and then the Grandassa Models would parade through and each--see they would have--see later what maybe you guys probably saw was the so-called "mushroom afro," the bush, but that wasn't the--
Speaker 2: I remember the short one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The first I saw Abbey Lincoln with on television.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Grandassas had the intricate woven hairstyles of natural--and each hairstyle corresponded to an African county or ethic group and they wore the hairstyle and then the national dress of the country so it was a complete outfit and I mean it--people, black people went crazy. I mean they had never, 'cause they had never seen their beauty, yeah.
Speaker 2: There's a--the only, I think the only thing I saw of that in the media was when they had--when you see the old clips of Malcolm X and you see him sitting at a show and [Kimati] Dinizulu I think was playing.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And you see the--
Speaker 1: Right, right Baba Dinizulu, yes.
Speaker 2: And then you see like the African dancers in there and, and the people with the African clothes on.
Speaker 1: And Malcolm's looking up smiling.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And showing the pride he had in that.
Speaker 2: Which is interesting because I don't think the Nation [of Islam] even promoted natural hair.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know and Malcolm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The nation promoted had they use to promote straightening out the hair.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know Malcolm had some differences on some of those questions you know.  So anyway what happened, this I think you'll find this interesting.  I don't know if Elombe [Brath] and them have ever written this up but I try to give you some idea, the politics and economics of it.  Attending this big gala were the matrons, the matriarchs of the Black Women's, what would you call it, [Black Women's] Beauticians Association, it was like these African market women, all these Sisters from Madam--like the heirs of Madam C.J. Walker.  They were all up in there, so they had the show and so I was with Tom Feelings.  Tom and I we were sitting and those ladies were there, I mean businesswomen I guess a lot of them were located from in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] and so they demanded, they had a delegation.  It had caused such a furor in the black community, they had a delegation there and they wanted to talk with the Grandassa Models and so, so Rose [Nelmes], God bless her, she Rose was--and Rose was a beautician herself, and so they had a meeting and so they said, Elombe said "You and Tom, ya'll stay okay?"  'Cause this was after things were over and so the delegation of these distinguished ladies came, he sat down and so they said "You gon' destroy the black beauty industry," and so I said "Oh my God," it was like fighting the old generation.  So Rose said, "Oh no", and Rose was just--she said "Oh no, Mother, we wouldn't do that so it's time we talked.  She said, "My name is Rose Nelmes and I'm the captain of the Grandassa Models and a beautician myself."  So they said "You're a beautician," she said, "Yeah," but beautician to them was you know burning, straightening hair.  She said, "No, no," and so they thought that you just wore your hair nappy and you didn't, she said "Oh no dear," and so Rose started talking about coconut oil and how you care for natural, and so some of the women started taking notes, she "No we're not trying to destroy the foundation you built, but we're just trying to add to it and show the originality of--you know."  She said, "Remember this is a new movement that--and so as beauticians you can be a part of this, we're not trying," 'cause they said, "You're trying to destroy our economy," she said, "No, no," and so she was saying it's not either or it's both and, and so they actually--they said "Well would you be willing to do workshops with us to show how to deal with this nappy hair (laughter)?"  And so Rose said, "Of course I would, there's a technique, there's a discipline to everything" and so she kinda soothed them down and so I said, "Man," I said, "Tom look at that."  He said, "Yeah," I said, "Man Rose is handling it" and she, she followed through and she had, she met with the, the beauticians and then she showed them techniques of caring for natural hair and the different oils and stuff that you use and everything, but they saw, they felt threatened, even though they may not of particularly agreed with the wig store guy, but they thought, they thought that was an assault on their economy and so, but Rose was the ideal person to handle that and, and she took care of business in a very diplomatic way.
Story_ID: 143176
Speaker 1: And I mean we were so impressed you know and you know and it's interesting because later Rose [Nelmes] went to Africa, and for a while I think was, she stayed in Nigeria for a while and it was funny we, we'd joke with her 'cause the Africans kept trying to marry her (laughter) you know, "You're not married (unclear) Rose Nelmes, yes?" you know but I said "yeah sister we ain't know we had to get a posse up to come over there and rescue your or something you know," but she said, "Oh no."  She say, she said, "I felt that when I went to the Motherland I wanted to have something to offer you know to--"  She was talking about bringing the gifts from the Africans of the Diaspora and linking up you know, and so but that was, that was history.  I was, as young as I was then I knew that what the Grandassas had displayed and the reaction of the traditional beauticians to this was going to affect the, the beauty culture of black people in the future from that period on.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you, I got two questions I guess, one question is, where--what do you think from your vantage point now was the inspiration for the Grandassa Models and, and the other question is what is its significance and we often talk about the '60s [1960] as a time of black political awakening and, and we, we understand black his--we start re-reading black history and the men like J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] who was largely ignored before, but now John Henrik Clarke, J.A. Rogers, here comes John Clarke, Charles Seifert in New York [City, New York] was teaching classes [sic].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: There's a historical awakening going on too, but how does the, how does the, the just the simple act of wearing your own hair you know fit into that and well, the just the first question, where do you think it came from or does it have a historical origin in New York some place and does, is there a--what do you think the significance of it is compared to these other?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it's the whole, the whole reawakening or awakening from the colonialism like the great scholar Harold Cruse said he saw African Americans as victims of what he called "domestic colonialism" that the colonized and the colonizer lived in the same country, I guess you could say the opposite of it but similar was South Africa and that even though they didn't allow you in their neighborhoods they try to control yours and with their media and stuff they tried to brainwash you to be you know, you know like anti-yourself and we could--one thing I can say I think the roots of it lay in independent movements prior to our period the [Marcus] Garvey Movement, positive aspects of the Harlem Renaissance and so forth, the whole thing of rediscovering our roots again, our heritage, who we are, what made us a unique and distinct people, what made Africa, what were African peoples' contributions to the various aspects of human culture and society and you know and what was going to be Africa's role in the world, in the evolving coming world of the twentieth and twenty-first Century, I don't--I still think that that's being played out, but we were, we saw you know ourselves, we were part of that process of trying to battle for a, to battle--like the Sankofa process to say it is all right to examine your past, to look back to your past in order to move forward to your future, and that's, that was part of that process and also trying to more or less put flesh on the foundations of the teachings from our elders like, like you said Seifert, Dr. Clarke, Dr. Ben [HM Yosef Ben-Jochannan], Queen Mother Moore all of the people whom had--then Langston [Hughes] and so forth whom had done the sacrificing and then even getting in closer down to our own elders like Max Roach and Aminata, Abbey Lincoln and so forth taking it forward you know and trying to rebuild a legacy.  I think that Dr. Clarke had said that the African people in the twentieth century and I think the Africans of the diaspora like played a magnificent role of the resistance and resurrecting ancient Africa and defending the legacy and the heritage of the African continent and its peoples magnificently producing a whole cadre of scholars, thinkers, visionaries, cultural artists to resurrect the, the specific glory, beauty and dignity of African heritage in the twentieth and now moving into the twenty-first century.
Story_ID: 143177
Speaker 1: You mentioned two people I wanted to ask you about, well J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] first of all you met him and I've met very few people that have actually talked to him, but what was he like and then the second thing I wanted to ask you about was Patrice Lumumba and that demonstration at the U.N. [United Nations], so.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah I was fortunate to be a part of that.  First, Mr. Rogers, I remember 'cause see I used to be, I, I came awake politically listening to Eddie "Pork Chop" Davis, Abdul Karim [ph.], and Carlos [A.] Cooks, all the ole Harlem [New York City, New York]] street speakers out there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Carlos Cooks and the African Pioneer Movement (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, an African Pioneer Movement, that's Elombe Brath and them's leader and stuff and being out there listening to the street speakers and also Mr. Alex Prempeh [ph.] who worked with Mr. [Lewis H.] Michaux in Michaux's bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore] and Mr. Michaux said the "House of Proper Propaganda" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, that's the, the bookstore right there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At 125th and Lennox [New York City, New York] (unclear).
Speaker 2: And Lennox, yeah and--well first it was 125th and 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he moved and I remember Malcolm [X] use to have these rallies out there, we had five thousand people out in the street.  Malcolm would talk to us four or five hours without talking, take us through all of African history, politics, economics and stuff.  Malcolm would hold class out there for the black community and then when Malcolm wasn't speaking the various, the old griots from the community, street speakers would be out there.  So you, you didn't, you couldn't be ignorant and be hanging out in Harlem boy 'cause the people, the elders would educate your behind.  Then they'd tell you "boy go on over to Michaux's Bookstore and get the book and so forth,--around the corner to the African--the other African American Bookstore.
Speaker 1: The one Mrs. [Una] Mulzac ran.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Her daddy [Hugh Mulzac] was a [U.S. Merchant Marine] captain of--yeah--Liberation Bookstore.
Speaker 2: Liberation Bookstore.
Speaker 1: A Liberation Bookstore, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Una Mulzac.
Speaker 2: Sister Una, yeah, yeah, so you couldn't just be ignorant but I think that all, that, that whole process of waking the generation-- think too at that particular time for the want of a better term, not only in our communal lives and our various neighborhoods across the country, but also in our cultural lives in our just daily lives the village was still alive, and when we first experienced all of this, they hadn't rained on our people with drugs, so that we were still vibrant, you had a Harlem where Langston Hughes walked the streets and stuff, then it didn't have the great magnificence of the '20s [1920s] and so forth but still that was a--and the old girl was still alive, you know Minister Malcolm would--cat [ph.] with Minister Henry and them would walk around--Jay, and getting back to J. A. Rogers--J. A.--I saw Mr. Rogers, I was at Michaux's Bookstore and he come in and his shopping bags with his books, he was carrying his books by shopping bag and putting' in the bookstores and stuff.  That's the first independent book dealer that I saw, and I was, I was looking' you know and then they got to talking about some very--him and Mr. Michaux and some of the elders about some intricate historical event and I was like, as a kid I was listening you know trying to get all the facts, memorized just soaking 'em up like a sponge.

Speaker 1: So in, I think it was 1965 or so Tom Feelings, the young scholar Matthew Meade and I, and Kwame Brathwaite later took the photograph, we, we got together and we decided to do--we--well originally we thought we were going to do a series of biographies of great African leaders and we started with the great Mandinka freedom fighter Samory Toure who was also the grandfather of the president of Guinea, Ahmed Sekou Toure, and so in order to do that when he--when we were gathering text 'cause I was assigned--Tom was, Tom Feelings was gonna do the illustration and I was supposed to write the text and so I, I was assigned to go see Mr. J. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] to get permission to get material from 'World's Great Men of Color' you know and so I came up to his house, an apartment, his house in Harlem [New York] and I was astounded, you'd go in there--(unclear) you very you know he invited me in and his whole house was a library.  I mean that's all I saw (laughter), I'm talking about like the public library was whole book shelves you know, one after the other everywhere you looked and it was like a--it was a private library, that was his house and so he said "sit down young man" so I sit down, I was stunned you know and we talked and he asked me what I was doing.  I told 'em, he said "Oh (unclear) oh, oh that's very commendable" and he said "You want to utilize some of my material?"  I said, "Sir, yes sir in terms of the 'World's Great Men of Color' we can you know, you know give us permission to use quote you from Samory Toure's life?"  He said, "Of course," he said, "You know I'm so delighted that you young men are taking up this quest.  He said so; he said, "This is going to be an illustrated, short illustrated biography?"  I said, "Yes sir," and I said, "And Tom Feelings is gonna do the illustrations."  He said, "Oh the young artist?"  I said, "Yes," he said, "Wonderful, wonderful."  He said, "Well yes, you have my permission."  It was simply his okay, I mean we didn't have to sign anything or--I mean his word was his bond and so man he was like a talking encyclopedia brother.  I said so I talked about how the French had sneaked up on Samory and captured him during or Samory was leading Muslim prayer and that's how they sneaked in on him.  Mr. Rogers knew the time of day, the hour, what week it was, every--I was say--I said now see that's a historian.  He knew, I mean I was saying "Dag gosh" and he just kept talking, I mean this was just like a gigantic computer giving--I was saying--man I was so impressed and he was just you know comfortable and stuff.  He was like a living institution like, you know like an institution that could talk you know, and so I was, I was so impressed you know and I said, "oh thank you sir so much" you know and so we went from there and we produced, we produced the book, 'Samory Toure' [Rolland Snellings (Askia Toure)] and we, we advertised it in the fighting journal Liberator magazine got all over the country and so forth and people ordered it and stuff.  It didn't do as well that we hoped because people, black folks generally were still with Dr. [Martin Luther] King talking about Civil Rights demonstrations, they--you know they hadn't gotten into I, I guess you would say the latter '60s [1960] going into the '70s [1970] where the whole black power, black consciousness thing jumped off so it didn't, it didn't go as well as we had hoped that it would, but still you know it was, if nothing else it was a model, it was independent, we put it out ourselves you know and so I was so impressed by Mr. Rogers though.  He was a walking institution and I never forgot his example, you know and he was so kind and so, he felt so gratified that we were taking up this quest and carrying it on you know.
Story_ID: 141322
Speaker 1: --Ask you about--oh, Patrice Lumumba and the U.N. [United Nations]
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, that you mentioned that in the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the outcome of this, well you all demonstrated under the auspices of who?  Was it an organized effort that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you call yourselves?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't at a main portion of it, but there were a group of prominent activists, many of whom were women by the way, who, who led that.  I know Abbey Lincoln and [HM] Maya Angelou were involved and a number of the activists black, black women activists from Harlem [New York] and other portions of black New York and a lot of groups participated, the civil rights activist Mae Mallory was, was a part of it, some of the various Harlem [Black] Nationalist groups participated.  We actually picketed downtown, picketed at the United Nations and when--and 'cause we knew that U.S. Intelligence and the European Belgians and the rest of them had collaborated to murder Prime Minister Lumumba, and to have Adlai Stevenson [II] stand up there and talk about "The people of the United States regret the death of the Congolese Premiere Patrice Lumumba" and I think Mae Mallory said "Murderer, liar, you murdered Patrice Lumumba."  Boy, they gon' run, gon' bring the security in, we turned that place out (laughter), people was fighting all up and--it got started up at the gallery.
Speaker 1: So there actually was fighting up in there?
Speaker 2: Yeah half the Harlem nationalists up in there, and turned that sucker out; went off fall all down the stairs and all into the streets and we were out there.  [Amiri] Baraka and them and everybody, well he was LeRoi, LeRoi Jones all of us was battling out in the streets and then they had the nerve to parade some Belgian soldiers by, we whooped every Belgian we could get our hands on.
Speaker 1: This is 1961 right, '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, "Harlem street thugs attack Belgian"--whatever you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now since that time of course, it's well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --known that the United States, the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]--
Speaker 2: Yes,
Speaker 1: --collaborated with the Belgians to--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --murder Patrice Lumumba.
Speaker 2: And see you know and our--'cause our elders had told us anyway so we were quite aware and then I mean we marched and demonstrated, they cut that out too--you could--we were right in front of the U.N. they wouldn't--they don't allow that anymore, they put you way away now, but they were shocked and then the New York Times came out with their editorial and they had, had a picture.  I'll never forget they had front page in the New York Times that this elder from Harlem who was crying tears (unclear) said, "My God they murdered Patrice Lumumba" and they were saying that the blacks, the Negroes are taking Africans as their heroes, they're identifying with the Africa.  We said, "You know well why is that so unusual when you are Irish you do it or you Jewish people do it, it's cool.  When black people do it it's some big, 'Oh my God' you know" and so we--
Speaker 1: What was it that, that was so appealing to Lumumba to African Americans in Harlem in 1961?
Speaker 2: Yah, well he was a freedom fighter, he was a poet and I remember when he wrote the great poem.  It's no telling how you know--we poets of course, we loved him for that, his poem was called "Epic Poem, Dawn in The Heart Of Africa" you know, great Epic Poem and he was like in many ways like we saw him almost like as another Malcolm X you know in the Congo.  This brilliant young, driving, driven charismatic young, head of state, young prime minister and speaking for the masses of the Congolese people; they said "Naw, we can't have this, is he crazy" you know and then 'cause you're gonna--and here's this man in his country speaking for his people and then they gon' just get some Uncle Toms to just massacre him and so and so, but of course it wasn't about brother Lumumba if anything it was about the diamonds and the raw material of the Congo that the Belgians and the Europeans and the international corporations planned to control and did not want the Congolese people to get their hands on.
Story_ID: 141323
Speaker 1: And so forth, so well you know we just we saw it another way and we, we united.  As I said we were not only nationalistic and wanting black power, we're also pan-Africanist and we had learned that from [Marcus] Garvey and Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois and all of our great leaders and we saw that we were fighting for the liberation of African people throughout the world and we were proud of that and then we had our elders like Dr. [John Henrik] Clarke and Queen Mother Moore and the rest of them, you know encouraging us and stuff and the, the writings of Dr. Du Bois and Paul Robeson and stuff and so you know our whole thing was let's get it on you know and-- 'cause we felt that you know we were doing the work of our ancestors you know so we don't care what, and so we made it very clear--'cause a lot of frightened Negroes, "We gon' get in trouble".  Like Brother Malcolm [X] said, "Well you were born in trouble," you know, they enslaved us for over three hundred years, what kinda worse trouble can you be in.
Speaker 2: Now, now what did your, what did your parents think about this new black cultural movement and your participation in it, did they know much about it or were?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter), it was some kind--it was some tensions, but I found very interesting my mother [Nannie Bullock Snellings] was seemed to be to the right, excuse me to the left of my father [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] and I remember (laughter)--well they were fascinated about--because they, my father use to tell me stuff of how those rednecks treated him and--a kid growing up in LaGrange, Georgia how, you know what happened and stuff and so they, they maybe--see their whole, their man was [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] as a generation.  Well Dr. King was cool, but you know how--I think our, our man was more Brother Malcolm (laughter) you know, but we, you know we respected Dr. King but we were we respectfully disagreed with him we, we were more, more or less like our brother Stokely Carmichael, Kwame Ture, we, we were--we didn't mind like James Forman of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee] said, we didn't mind non-violence as a tactic, but not as a philosophy, we, we were with more Robert F. Williams, we felt that black people had the right like any people to defend themselves--'cause we were--you know the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] was coming in and blowing up our churches and stuff and murdering our leaders, we had the right to defend our communities against the Klan and stuff.  You even had struggles in the churches because in the South the, the deacons rose up in the churches and formed the Deacons for Defense and Justice in Louisiana and Mississippi and places to defend their churches 'cause the Klan was blowing up the churches and so we just, we, weren't gon' put up with that and so we went into SNCC and led SNCC from the little kinda, little non-violence kinda thing, it was cool for a while, but.
Speaker 2: Now, now you were a member of a New York, a New York branch of SNCC or did you go to?
Speaker 1: No, I was a member of SNCC's Atlanta Project--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 141324
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --did you actually move to Atlanta [Georgia] then too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And when, when did you go?
Speaker 2: Well I was--the first time, well you know it gets intricate, some funny stuff happened after Malcolm [X]'s assassination and--
Speaker 1: Now this is '65 [1965] we're talking about, 1965?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we had, I was a staff writer of Liberator magazine and my comrade Larry Neal who was arts editor.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I don't want to get ahead of myself now.
Speaker 2: Yeah but you're asking.
Speaker 1: But let's, maybe let's, let's go back to the magazine first and to.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Before we get you in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay 'cause you started (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did the magazine get started and how?
Speaker 2: Who, you mean Liberator?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Liberator?
Speaker 2: Liberator was the prog--black progressives and people from the World War II [WWII] period, Daniel H. Watts and other people were active and it was a black radical political monthly journal and what we liked is that Dan Watts, he was activist guy of a Caribbean background.  He was open to young, young activists and artists and we was pleasantly surprised and I remember, he said, "No come on, what ya'll got, come on with it," and he had been active in the left and earlier periods and I guess he knew Langston Hughes and other people you know, Richard Wright and folks and I think Dan was of Caribbean background but he was a you know, a fighting, progressive radical, crusading editor and so he was looking for, he wanted to know well what are the young guys saying, what do the young people say and so they brought--they first of all they asked you know, said, "Do you all have any, any written work, any essays, any poems?"  We said, "Yes," he said, "Send them in" and so we started sending our poems in.  It was interesting because not only--the elders were very kinda indul--kinda tolerant is a better way (laughter), were tolerant of us with Dan and them with Liberator and then you had Freedom Ways with--I remember John Henrik Clarke was the editor of Freedom Ways and you had the very you know able editors and staff of Freedom Ways and they would encourage us to send writings either to Freedom Ways or Liberator and we were surprised, they, they you know and so getting back to Liberator, I sent a couple of poems in and Dan invited me to a meeting, I came, sit in with 'em, he said well look you have any articles?  I said yeah, he said well good, he said well bring some, let's discuss, and so I brought some articles and immediately they began to publish my articles in Liberator.
Speaker 1: Now, now what year is this, this is?
Speaker 2: This is around, well they started publishing my poems in Liberator around what, '62 [1962], '63 [1963] and by, by '65 [1965]--let's see I was active, I was all--I'd come back from the South in '64 [1964] and they invited me to staff meetings, C. Wilson [ph.] was a very popular writer was up in there and later the great movement activist and historian Harold Cruse and they invited me as a young activist and writer and stuff and they wanted to get with us, I mean we were surprised, 'cause we didn't think you know we had kinda viewed the older people just fuddy-duddies, they didn't want nothing to, but they said, "No, no we want to hear what you young, what, what you young bloods have to say," you know and so we were pleasantly surprised, but they came outta that same tradition of Langston Hughes and them of nurturing the young generation.
Story_ID: 141325
Speaker 1: Tell us about Larry Neal, he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he passed in '81 [1981] I believe it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Larry was our, we were all comrades, we were part of the black clandestine organization RAM, the Revolutionary Action Movement and Larry was out of, was out of Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he, we I used to call him, I'd say Larry Neal, "the Philly Bopper" (laughter), 'cause he was always sharp and stuff and he was in to bebop and the music and so forth and so we were you know active in.
Speaker 1: So you were in RAM then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you joined Liberator?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry.
Speaker 2: And so anyway you know we talked with Larry and stuff and I said well Larry why don't you, you know I said I was staff writer and you know I know Larry was doing' a lot of research on black art and black culture and I asked Larry, I said well look, you know I said, why don't you come in, sit in with Dan Watts [Daniel H. Watts] and them and stuff and we talked so he said well yeah okay I might, and so he came in I told him I told 'em yeah man he's real, I said he's doing work on Ralph Ellison and [James] Baldwin and what's his name Richard Wright and so Dan said yeah, he said oh yeah, well let me meet this young man--came, Larry came in and boy Dan was fi--Larry said "oh man, he said yeah Larry, but I mean Larry was very polished and stuff and very diplomatic and stuff.  I was tend to be kinda (laughter) passionate and stuff, they called me at that time "interesting, fiery young poet."  I had, it took me years to live that (laughter) stereotype down, but so Larry and Dan got along famously and then you know Larry was one of those hip Philly boys who came out of Lincoln University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with you know all its--with its history of producing black intellectuals and radicals and scholars and stuff and so he and Dan got along famously and sometimes we'd disagree with Dan on questions.  Sometimes Mr. [Harold] Cruse and I and some of the others and Larry would always kinda monitor, be sort of like the diplomat and so and then Larry was doing such great work that Mr. Dan Watts made him Arts Editor, and so he, and then Larry also was linked with [Amiri] Baraka and sometimes Baraka would write stuff or Larry would critique, would do a whole critique on Baraka's theater and his work and stuff so we were all, so we were tied in and so when Malcolm [X], when the establishment murdered Malcolm you know the whole black nation was shook up and ready to go to war and so we had did an analysis on, and so Dan tickled me, we said, "We got an analysis," Dan, Dan said "Cool", he said, "Put it in a manila envelope (laughter)," he said, "Address it and send it to me in the mail."  He said, "So therefore when they ask me," he says, "I can say that 'well I don't know, these young fellows sent it to me in the mail and I thought it worthwhile to publish 'cause these were the views of the younger generation,'" and so which we and we did an analysis of who really was behind Malcolm's assassination and true enough Dan published it you know.
Story_ID: 141326
Speaker 1: Oh I was gonna--I think I was right on the verge of asking you what your analysis was of Malcolm X's assassination in those days and have you--has it changed any since then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I, you know I would equate what happened to Malcolm is almost equivalent of what happened to Patrice Lumumba.  In many ways Malcolm was like our Lumumba and certainly you have to probably go back to Martin Delany in the nineteenth century to find as great a internationalist that was rooted in a movement, I guess some people would say Paul Robeson too, but Malcolm was a straight-up political activist and his statesmanship linking with the OAAU [Organization of Afro-American Unity] and bringing--and our case of oppression in the United States to the heads of the OAAU in Africa and then we were part of a collective of young people, young scholars and activists around Malcolm, we were preparing to bring the United States before the United Nations and the world court on charges of genocide against the African American nation and that was one of the reasons why they murdered Malcolm and it wasn't--of course they tried to make it look Malcolm versus Elijah Muhammad, this and that, that was just a--what they used as an excuse and of course the--I believe that the Nation [of Islam] collaborated in his assassination but I don't that they were the final source.  I think it was the same people that assassinated--Dr. [John Henrik] Clarke said the same thing, that assassinated Patrice Lumumba assassinated Brother Malcolm, and eventually would assassinate [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and I mean if they can get some henchmen to do it so much the better, they don't have to dirty their hands, but that's, that was more or less our analysis, the same imperialists that you know that forced over throw, overthrew [Kwame] Nkrumah in Ghana and murdered Patrice Lumumba, also assassinated Malcolm in the United States, a whole generation--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of leaders were wiped out.
Speaker 1: Let, let me ask you now, what was Revolutionary Action Movement and what, was it related to SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in any way or, or was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah well it was the clandestine wing of our struggle, (unclear) people's liberation movement (laughter), you know the model was for a tree, a tree has as many roots below the surface as it has above and it's called limbs above the surface and roots below and if you're serious then you, you know about protracted struggle then you have to, if you gon' liberate yourself, you have to develop liberation organizations, and we ventured to say to people that our movement did not collapse with the collapse of the Black Panther Party for self-defense, the various Black Panther Parties were part of our movement.  The Black Panther Party for Self Defense was a--one of many Black Panther parties that we were putting together and when the [Bobby] Seale--Huey Newton Black Panther Party collapsed, the Black Freedom Movement, Black Power Movement continued, because that was--that was the media's version of the black movement--
Story_ID: 141327
Speaker 1: That wasn't the black movement's version. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, now I, I don't want to get it out of sequence but, but RAM [Revolutionary Action Movement] is earlier than the Black Panther Party right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well what the Black Panther Movement grew out of a partnership between RAM and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  The original Black Panther Party was the Lowndes County Freedom Organization from Lowndes County, Alabama.
Speaker 2: That's '65 [1965] right?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And one of the things that Kwame [Ture]--Stokely [Carmichael] then said it then is it begin to build Black Panther Parties all across the country, and probably the first Black Panther Party outside the South was a Black Panther Party of New York, of Harlem [New York] that Larry Neal and other people put together.  Eddie Ellis, Al Haynes [ph.] and other people put together in New York and I understand they had one in Detroit [Michigan] too, though I can't remember for certain who led the one in Detroit and then you had the--both you had two Black Panther Parties in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California].  You had the Oakland [California] Panthers, the Black Panther Party for Self Defense by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton and then you had the Black Panther Party of Northern California with Mamadou Lumumba, Ernie Allen and other activists and so forth.  So you had many Black Panther movements and I would say that the reason that the Black Panther Party, the Oakland Panthers, The Black Panther Party for Self Defense got so big was because when Huey was shot at that time, we rallied and Mr. William [L.] Patterson, the great radical lawyer, Mr. Carlton Goodlett, the publisher, my comrade Marvin X and myself and Mr. Crawford [ph.] and several other people rallied together to form the Huey P. Newton Defense Committee in San Francisco [California] and was headed by Jim Lacey [ph.] who had been with Tom Feelings, [HM] Maya Angelou and other people, Lester Lacey [ph.] in Ghana under Dr. [Kwame] Nkrumah, and Jim was asked to chair the Huey P. Newton Defense Committee and created a foundation for raising funds for Huey, the whole "Free Huey" campaign and then Bobby and other leaders could take, going across the country to raise funds to free Huey and that process expanded the Black Panther Party for Self Defense.  It's interesting that it seems like we've never been given credit for this but we were the original people raising funds to free Huey.
Story_ID: 141328
Speaker 1: And by we you mean the RAM [Revolutionary Action Movement] or, or?
Speaker 2: No just--
Speaker 1: Just the (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --those of us at that time I was in San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) the [Huey P. Newton Defense] Committee, the committee.
Speaker 2: Yeah the committee, and you know we were a little hurt because it seems like Kathleen [Cleaver] in continuing I guess the legacy of the Black Panther Party doesn't seem that she gave us much credit but we played a key role.  I knew Kathleen, she and I had worked.
Speaker 1: Was Kathleen Cleaver?
Speaker 2: Kathleen Cleaver, we had worked in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] together and out of the whole process of the SNCC Freedom Schools came more or less Africana Studies and all these distinguished educators, and so forth of African American Studies and they never talk about the roots of African American Studies.  African American Studies as a discipline did not begin on the college campuses.  It came out of the black community.  I remember when the elders, the historians and griots, Dr. Clarke and Dr. Ben [HM Yosef Ben-Jochannan] were teaching black studies in Harlem [New York] under HARYOU [Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited] run by Livingston [Leroy] Wingate and so forth, and  you had projects like that all over the country.  You had the Institute of the Black World in Atlanta [Georgia], [HM] Vincent Harding and all of those comrades and stuff and that, and then in SNCC you had the Freedom Schools throughout the SNCC projects and so forth and I had done some work with Freedom Schools in Mississippi and--
Speaker 1: Now were you, were you there in '64 [1964] and--?
Speaker 2: I was there before Freedom Summer jumped off, Brother Max Stanford, Muhammad Ahmad and I were down in Greenwood, Mississippi in Spring of '64 [1964] in May and like that just before Freedom Summer and the [Ku Klux] Klan and the vigilantes were attacking black people then and we worked in the--I worked in the Freedom Schools there.
Speaker 1: Now that's the spring that [Andrew] Goodman, [Michael] Schwerner and [James] Chaney were murdered down in Philadelphia [Mississippi] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I remember Max Stanford and I challenged at a SNCC Regional Conference in Greenville [Mississippi], we challenged Mickey Schwerner and them and we told them that you can't just allow the black people, the black SNCC organizers to get shot at by the plantation owners and the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK], and you all sit up in the offices and coffee klatch and stuff, you all have to go out in the communities and make contact with the white people of the South and they said, "What do you think, you want us to risk our lives?" and we thundered back, "Your SNCC black comrades are risking their lives everyday going on those plantations and trying to get the peasants and stuff to register to vote, you think you're too good for that?"
Story_ID: 141329
Speaker 1: Oh, it caused a controversy; a woman wrote a book called 'Freedom Song.'
Speaker 2: It's Mary King, I know, I've known of (unclear).
Speaker 1: Dr. Mary King and attacked me and said "that I ran the white folks outta SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]" and so what we said when we wrote to SNCC Black Power Conference at the Atlanta [Georgia], at the Atlanta Project, was that we can't organize the white people, you all have to, that's not our role.  We can get our people prepared, your role is to go and organize the poor white people and the working-class white people and so forth and we'll, we can take care of the black people in the communities, and they didn't do that.  They did leave SNCC, but what they did and that was commendable, they didn't do that, but they did organize the anti-war movement, but SNCC led that and they followed and they organized the young white students and stuff and the anti-war movement.  So Mary King, and she put out a lot of stuff said that the poor black guys in, in the South were seduced the white women of SNCC.  We said, "Get outta here, those poor country boys," it's a whole lot of stuff I'm gonna save for my memoirs, but I never said anything, but she attacked us.  We said, "No, but you all were privileged elite youth connected with the northern student movement, a lot of your parents were big shot liberals in the North and stuff, and you came down in the, you know you--nobody was taking advantage of you, get outta here."  We could, we, there were, there were some hardcore white organizers who were really sincere, Jack Minnis and them who were veteran activists and organizers, they were sincere and they went on to do the core of the organizing for the anti-war movement, the anti-Vietnam war movement but you had these small darlings who when the, when the blacks field workers would be risking their lives on the plantation, they was sitting up in the offices, field offices coffee klatching--
Story_ID: 141330
Speaker 1: Yeah we were talking about SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and summer of '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tensions between black and white SNCC activists.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At a certain point.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Which--
Speaker 2: --well it was a transformation of SNCC and it was--a lot of hearts got broken, a lot of people I mean serious friendships got damaged I guess, and they kept saying that SNCC is being infiltrated.  So we said by whom (laughter) they're looking at us and so we, we felt that you know a time had come.  See SNCC went from--what happened was it transformed from the old kinda "we shall overcome" SNCC which was like the junior wing of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] to the black power SNCC of Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown and the Black Panther Party you know and, and you know frankly we went into SNCC to help, to help that process along and I guess that's why Mary King said that we sabotaged SNCC but trans--what is life but transformation?  We just felt that SNCC would've been more effective in terms of indigenous leadership and we told--and the sincere white activists in SNCC took us up on it.  We said, well look, said, "This is a fine job that you guys were doing, the ones who are serious, who are really out here like Jack Minnis and them," but said, "Who's gonna organize the poor white people?  We can't do this, somebody's gotta do this or the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] and the fascists and the vigilantes will get 'em.  What are you all gon' do, ya'll go let that go down?"  And so we had a big argument, Brother Max Stanford and I with Mickey Schwerner [Michael Schwerner] at the SNCC Regional Conference in Greenville [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: I guess a question comes, comes to mind that I don't know if anybody would ask it but I will (laughter), but Schwerner and [Andrew] Goodman were Jewish students?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: Students.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In the South?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Klan, if there's any group they dislike as much as blacks or almost as much is Jews, or some say they dislike them more.
Speaker 2: Possibly.
Speaker 1: So it's--in the black community to be Jewish is to be white, but to be in Mississippi in that state at that time to be Jewish is not to be white.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So I don't know if there was, I don't know how that.
Speaker 2: But see.
Speaker 1: To ask them to organize the, those.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that, that was Goodman wasn't down there that was Mickey Schwerner and his wife Rita, it was a whole bunch of SNCC people that weren't Jewish they were Anglo-Saxon or Irish or whatever and so what was they excuse?  Okay if Mickey said, "Well I'm Jewish" what was all these people at SNCC who were like WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] and Irish and stuff you know?
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's a, yeah, that's a definitely a point.
Speaker 2: So they were, that was a contradiction and we pointed that out instead of them stepping to that and saying well that's a good point that you all made maybe we'd better look at that, they wanted to condemn the messenger and we refused to back down and we, we wrote to SNCC Black Power Paper or they always said it later, that wasn't, it didn't represent all of us.  Okay, maybe not but we wrote it at Donald [P.] Stone who was a former (laughter) halfback for Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and an independent black writer and activist and, and part of the SNCC Atlanta Project cadre and the, the leader of the Atlanta Project, William Ware and I wrote the Black Power Position Paper at Don Stone's [Donald P. Stone] house and we, we put it together and then we produced copies of it and we put the copies in manila envelopes and we passed them out to the various SNCC projects and evidently we struck a nerve and when SNCC had its national meeting a lot of the activists, the black activists from SNCC raised those questions with James Forman and them and some of the things we said, while Stokely didn't agree with us you know in public, some of the things we said Stokely and them had been saying among the leadership, you know?
Story_ID: 141331
Speaker 1: How did Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] react, I mean I'm interested in like how, what was his reaction, what was Ella Baker's reaction if she was still around then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we didn't, we didn't see Ms. Baker we don't what, what her re--I guess Don Stone [Donald P. Stone] or somebody probably would speak to that but--well Bob had and I've, I've known Bob and I had to this day I've monster respect for Bob, big respect but we had some disagreements on some key questions because he and his wife Donna [Moses] were a part of the--Bob was really the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] leader for Mississippi and he's a brilliant, brilliant person and organizer but the kinda like the old SNCC like, and so when we got in the Freedom Schools you know even then you know I was, that was what '64 [1964] and like that we were teaching black history up in there and they had so devastated those kids in Mississippi that they didn't want to hear nothing.  I had, I don't know how I got hold of them but I had actual history books with pictures of the ancient Egyptians and the ancient Nubians and stuff and the pyramids.  I had that stuff with me and showed those black kids from Mississippi their--what their ancestors had created, the pyramids and stuff, they did not believe that black people had ever done anything.  They had devastated those children and they weren't even grown yet, they were teenagers and so I raised it, that infuriated me and so, so Bob and I had a little (laughter) confrontation and he said that I, he said that I was teaching propaganda and so I said I'm teaching African American history and he said well we feel it's propaganda.  I said well we feel that white supremacy is propaganda and, and he said, well look I don't want to go into this with you, you know.  And someone said that he was a proper white American in blackface you know, but I think time has gone on even though we had differences Bob has continued to work to advance the black community, his Algebra Project that was sponsored by Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and other schools taking into black young people in the South trying to develop mathematical thinking among them has just been tremendous and you know we had great respect, but we did have real differences on some of the questions.
Story_ID: 141332
Speaker 1: Even Kwame [Ture, formerly Stokely Carmichael] and I got into it in Mississippi one time, I always threw this up to him (laughter), what happened was the vigilantes had--what happened was the workers in the North were sending vans down loaded with food and supplies to the COFO, the Council of Federated Organizations, you know COFO in Mississippi and stuff to be given out to the people, you know it was like the South was like an under-developed country and so, so the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] gon' start calling in threatening somebody you know and talking about, "Boy we coming in there, we gon' get all that food" he said.  We said, "Come on in so we you know we'll be prepared," said "we'll be waiting to receive you."  You know he said, "Well we gon' come in," we said, "Come on."  And so well what happened was we was staying, like I said this was just before Freedom Summer.  We were staying in the Freedom Houses and right next to the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] Freedom Houses there were houses were local black teachers were staying who worked in schools in the area, and so the vigilantes was threatening people and stuff, so hey being part of RAM [Revolutionary Action Movement] I got with the local grassroots activist brothers and we armed the Freedom Houses and then they had a local resistance leader, a lady.  They had thrown Molotov cocktails on her front porch trying to set her house a fire.  So we set up community, armed community patrols you know we had, we, we considered ourselves like disciples of Robert F. Williams, Monroe, North Carolina that was the founder of RAM, and so said we didn't to that, ain't no crazy stuff was go down while we were there and so we had, we had organized patrols (laughter) and stuff so Stokely came in from Atlanta [Georgia] headquarters and I remember Project head, Jimmy Jones, James Jones, good brother from Mississippi so Stokely came in he said, "Jimmy let me talk to you a minute."  He said, "What are these carbines doing it up in here?"  He said, so Jimmy he was, you know he said, "Well look Stokely," he said, "They been threatening us and said they gonna come in and they gon' bomb, bomb the church" and said, "(unclear) so we were prepared."  And so he said, "Rolland I know you were behind this."  That's what Stokely said.  I said, "Hey," he said, "No man," he said, "This is SNCC, it's not RAM; we're non-violent."  So Jimmy said, Jimmy said, "Well man you gon' say so we gon' disarm in front of?"  He said, "Look," he said, "You wanna remain like head of this project Jimmy?"  So Jimmy said, "Well yeah," he said, "Well." I said, "Look Jimmy," I said, "Stokely is your leader, you do what he tell you to do."  I said, "But Stokely, you know we way off on it," he said, "Well whatever," he said, "SNCC is non-violent."  So then we had to take the arms out the Freedom House.  So it's interesting at Bronx Community College [Bronx, New York City, New York] in the, when was that, in the '70s [1970] we had a big panel.  We had Imari Obadele from the Republic of New Afrika and other people and Stokely and other people, we were all on panel and Stokely said, "As I said in my book 'Black Power' we must defend our communities.  He said I've always advocated self-defense in the face of a godless enemy by the Ku Klux Klan."  I say, "Is that right Stokely, what?"  I said, "What?" so he turned around he looked, I said, "Is that right?" When--I said, "Did you advocate that in Green," I said, "Greenwood [Mississippi] Stokely?"  He said "Hey man."  He started laughing he said, "We gotta talk, we gotta talk."  I said, "Yeah, yeah right," you know so I always teased him about that you know, but I mean you know but it, these were the issues that we had to grapple with and stuff and a number of people said that while they officially kinda put down some of the 'Black Power Position Paper,' things we said that some of the writings in his book ['Black Power: The Politics of Liberation'] with Dr. Charles [V.] Hamilton sound smack of some of the things we said in the 'Black Power Paper', but you know I always saw Kwame and Jamil Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown a.k.a. Jamil Abdulla Al-Amin] as the best of comrades and I remember when Kwame was, began his--when he found out that he had that fateful cancer, and he began his last trip in this country you know and we sort of stood together with him and Rap in Atlanta, big rally of support and love for him you know and you know.  We, I think that frankly that he was a brilliant, charismatic leader and I think our whole people have been robbed of a very great leader by him dying like he did, but you know we were comrades, we were activists and we had differences but we also had mad respect for each other and stuff you know because ultimately it was like Claude McKay's 'If We Must Die' I mean we faced fascism of the Klan and the vigilantes and that whole right-wing movement and so we had to unite in the face of fascism in the South you know, but we had differences, SNCC and RAM had differences but we managed to come together in the whole Black Panther Project, and form Black Panther organizations.
Story_ID: 141333
Speaker 1: And in fact when I was in, in Atlanta [Georgia] I had a Freedom School in Atlanta in '67 [1967] and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] organizers were in San Francisco [California] with [HM] Sonia Sanchez and Sonia called me and said, said she said, "You remember me Rolland?"  I said, "Yes," I said, "Poet right?"  She said, "Yeah, yeah remember from the Black Arts?"  I said, "Yeah," she said, "Well we doing a project in the community here at Black Studies noted [ph.] in the community, in San Francisco [California]."  She said, "Well look would you like to come up?"  She says, "What you doing?"  I said, "Well we just closing a Freedom School here in Atlanta."  She said, "Would you like to come out and work with us?"  I said, "Yeah you playing my song Sister" and that's how essentially we got to Black Studies eventually at San Francisco State [University, San Francisco, California] and Jimmy Garrett [James Garrett] was a SNCC activist who was out in San Francisco and he recommended me to Sonia who knew me from before, and that's how my wife and I came out to San Francisco but we began black studies in the community, in the churches, the community centers and then later we moved onto the campus you know.
Speaker 2: Now, now when was that, what year is this?
Speaker 1: That was '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty seven [1967], '68 [1968] okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and I--we always said this like the Negro Leagues we came in to like the Negro Leagues came into white baseball.  When we came onto the campuses at San Francisco State we brought the whole hood with us so that everybody, we didn't just go out and start teaching the matriculating students, we bought our whole, (laughter) everybody who was in our classes in the churches came onto the campus and so we had, so we were teaching the people and the matriculating students you know together in terms of what became black studies and so I was teaching African History and Sonia was teaching African American literature and I guess our most famous student was a young activist tiger named [HM] Danny Glover.  Sonia taught him African American literature and I taught him African history you know.
Speaker 2: This is '67 [1967]?
Speaker 1: Um-hum and he was a member of the Black Student Union in San Francisco State, yeah you never know where these young people gon' end up (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now is this the first black studies department I mean (unclear)?
Speaker 1: At a major university.
Speaker 2: At a--okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and 'cause we don't ever say "oh, oh it was us" because why, we were taught by Dr. Clair, [John Henrik] Clarke, and Dr. Ben [HM Yosef Ben-Jochannan] and them who go all the way back to Willis Huggins and all those people and John G. Jackson so, but we all, have always maintained the importance of independent black institutions, community-based and that hopefully your professors not only teach on campus, but also do things that independent black institutions or semi-independent just like that AAMARP [African American Master's Artists in Residence Program, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts], is part of that same process here.
Story_ID: 141334
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now when Malcolm X was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think there is a story there we need to tell--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the assassination of Malcolm X, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Brother Malcolm.
Speaker 1: --and that--the events subsequent to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So Malcolm was assassinated February 21 [1965] I think.
Speaker 2: 1965.
Speaker 1: Yeah 1965 and, and what was the community reaction?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), like.
Speaker 1: What was your reaction basically?
Speaker 2: Well not just mine but the community, I think that's much better.  It was like the Congolese when they lost [Patrice] Lumumba, I mean our people were devastated I mean Malcolm was like functioning as like international spokesman almost like the prime minister of black America, more the African heads of states knew Brother Malcolm than [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]. because he'd been to Africa and he had been campaigning for black people in America and sang and black, not only in America but in the Diaspora that we must be liked with Africa and it's like when we lost Brother Malcolm was like losing a head of state like a people losing their head of state, and our whole thing was you know how do we more or less stop the bleeding and bring our people together to continue the struggle, now that was our task because the establishment was trying to promote fratricide in the community to get the nation, the Organization of African American Unity and the Nation of Islam to fight each other and to start fratricide and stuff and so we, whatever our differences with the Nation, we knew Minister Henry [Majied] and Captain Joseph [X], the Fruit [of Islam paramilitary force] and them and so forth and so and we knew we working with Malcolm, second in command, James Shabazz and the brothers and sisters of the organization of African American Unity, and we were not going to allow any fratricide to go down in Harlem [New York] so what we did Brother Muhammad Ahmad and Brother Syed Haynes [ph.] and myself we went to see Minister Henry and Captain Joseph and them and told them to hold the Fruit and James agreed that he would hold the OAAU Brothers to prevent fratricide 'cause the New York newspapers were calling for it and stuff and we refused, and so everybody held their people so that they couldn't--and one of the things that I'll always love James Forman for, now the late James Forman, the Great Secretary General of SNCC was the--New York papers were attacking RAM and accusing us of assassinating Brother Malcolm and Robert Williams spoke out from exile "and the accused Robert [F.] Williams and said that Robert Williams was spreading drugs" or something in the community, so Robert came, he was in exile in China then and he defended you know the movement brilliantly from exile, and they were attacking us in the press and the police were ready to I guess to move on us and what happened was we got a call, we kinda had our backs against the wall then, and we didn't know what was gon' happen and then we got a call from--we said "hello" he said yeah this is Jim Forman, says "James, he say how ya'll, ya'll all right?  We said yeah, it's kinda rough, he said yeah, I been checking the paper, he said well look here, we giving the press conference downtown, he said we want ya'll to come on down and so we came down and Jim was giving, and indeed giving a press conference.  He said come on in here and so he started that crap "we understand that Robert Williams" he said what?  Jim said Robert Williams is a good friend of mine we fought together in, in Monroe, North Carolina.  He had nothing but admiration for Brother Malcolm and also the young activists and so forth, said, we--"well we hear he was (unclear) we said, Jim Forman said, well we heard the CIA assassinated Malcolm what about that?  And they started hollering and screaming talking about "are you accusing the U.S. government"?  Jim said well if the shoe fits wear it, you know and all that was being televised--that was being photographed though we didn't care you know by that time you know the sky was the limit so to speak, and so we had gathered in Harlem all the different groups and beautifully, [HM] Ossie Davis and [HM] Ruby Dee were there I'll never forget.  We met up in Harlem, Jesse Gray the Rent Strike Leader, Mae Mallory from Monroe, North Carolina who had worked brilliantly with Robert F. Williams, A.B. Spellman, the jazz critic, and good friend of [Amiri] Baraka, a bunch of us.  We were meeting in Harlem, Sylvester Leaks from both Liberator and Freedom Ways magazine.  We understand that the elder, Harry Haywood was up in there the black radical theorist, we didn't know it at that time, the whole community was up (unclear) what trying to work out how we were gonna respond as a community to Brother Malcolm's assassination.  Do you know why we were up in there, and James Forman and SNCC people were with us too?  Do you know these suckers came took TV cameras, kicked the door open and rolled into our meeting with TV cameras, they had on trench coats and I remember A.B. Spellman coming up the steps and saying "you all be careful, they got snipers on the rooftops right across the street from where you were".  And so we said we would not be intimidated, this is Harlem and we meeting for Brother Malcolm, we will not be intimidated.  Later I realized the deep courage that Sister Ruby Dee and Brother Ossie had being right up in there with us, you know and so, so we confr--Jesse Gray and Jim Forman, the rest of us confronted them, they tried to, you know gon' bogart their way into our meeting.  (Unclear) said, "We will throw you down the steps, this is our people meeting to develop a response to our fallen hero," and talking about they were the press, heck cameras came in on us with cameras.  So we said, "We're asking you in a dignified way to leave, but we have some people here who will be prepared to throw you out, we're not playing with you."  So they said some kinda stuff and then they backed out with their cameras you know and so we met and we worked out a response.  I'll never forget--
Story_ID: 141335
Speaker 1: And this was this atmosphere that we worked out this truce with Minister Henry [Majied] and Captain Joseph [X, a.k.a. Yusuf Bey] and them in the Nation [of Islam] cause they were trying to build a fratricide and so--now you had these big six-foot-three-inch, four or five inch cops.  I'll never forget outta nowhere all over the streets of Harlem big red face Irish looking cops what they had on white crisscross belts--all over Harlem [New York City, New York].  Up on the roofs all up on the roofs of the buildings, occupying Harlem and so you know.
Speaker 2: Now this is an aspect of this we've never.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I've never heard this before.
Speaker 1: And so we were under siege, so look they come into Mr. [Lewis] Michaux's Bookstore and stood in the bookstore, in the bookstore so.
Speaker 2: So this is how, how soon after Malcolm [X]'s, this is, is?
Speaker 1: That was the week after Malcolm's assassination.
Speaker 2: The week after, all right.
Speaker 1: So I remember I was with Brother Akbar and some other brothers and we said, we said, "Look at these suckers up in Mr. Michaux's bookstore."  We came up in the bookstore, we said, "Peace elder how you doing," we said, "We'd like to order some books."  (laughter) Mr. Michaux said, "Come back later" (laughter), he was kinda intimidated, man it's thug sitting' up in there.  He said, "You know the nerve of you."  First of all how you gon' up in the man's business like this?  He hasn't broken any law, he's operating his bookstore, try to intimidate black Harlem you know, and so, so they were building it up and fortunately we were able to go down and talk with Minister Henry and them and Mr. Henry said, we said, "Ya'll see what they trying to do, they trying to foment fratricide in Harlem to get us to fighting each other."  And so Minister Henry knew of us when we were students, he used to call me "Umbra," you know, he say "It's Umbra and the students coming in."  So we came in to the restaurant and the Fruit [of Islam] was everywhere, you couldn't even see Minister Henry just a wall of the Fruit and so, so I said "Minister Henry," he say, "Is that Umbra?"  I said, "Yes sir," so he came he said, "How ya'll doing."  So we said, "Fine" and so we talked to them and Minister Henry said "Well no, we ain't got no problem with the OAAU [Organization of Afro-American Unity] if they don't have no problem with us."  So we said, "We just want everybody just to hold your soldiers 'cause they trying to get us," and they agreed so they said, "Well we got, you know we don't bother, we just you know dealing with our institutions and so we talked to James Shabazz [a.k.a. Abdullah H. Abdur-Razzaq] and the people from the OAAU, we had been working with James [Forman] anyway and on speaking tours and everything talking about the situation with Brother Malcolm" and so he said, "We'll hold our people if Captain Joseph and Henry and them will hold the Fruit" and so we all agreed to an internal truce so that they couldn't start fratricide in Harlem and so they had to back off after a while.  They even put it out that Donald Washington and Omar Ahmed [ph.] who had been young men working with the OAAU were on their way to Chicago [Illinois] to assassinate Mr. [Elijah] Muhammad and I remember Omar called the Journal, what was that the journal, I always keep forget those, [New York] Journal-American yeah and he said "Sir," he said, "This Omar Ahmed and I'm the person that you wrote about in your article," and he said, "I'm not going to Chicago to assassinate Mr. Muhammad," and they said "Yes you are," and then slammed the phone down.
Story_ID: 146277
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the Independent Black School Movement and what's the relationship between the Freedom Schools and the Independent Black Schools that began I guess in the late '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I, I guess it was the anti-colonial model I guess that you know like Frederick Douglass said "He or she who would be free must strike the first blow" and it was a whole movement, remember we had not only you know models of our elders and people in the Civil Rights Movement but we had the sterling examples of black people in the nineteenth century and stuff, and they had independent black educational efforts throughout the South in the nineteenth century after the, after chattel slavery was over and so forth, and it was like people began to just move in their different areas.  I think what was--I always make people aware that we had a national--it was a national movement and so people from the South might learn from the Midwest, people from the East from the Midwest, people from the Midwest may, you know so we were always and we were gathering, going around the county.  We also had, you had different, you had the con--the conferences that were happening.  I was thinking the you know the sort of like the conference movements like the, what's its name, what was that in, in Illinois [sic], not--Gary [Indiana], the Gary Conference [National Black Political Convention, 1972].
Speaker 1: In '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah so you had conferences, black people coming together practicing basically self-determination.  I remember the Black Power conferences we had starting in '65 [1965] after the rebellion.  Part of the whole thing that in the gatherings and the workshops and from the Black Power conferences, the black people said that we must develop our own institutions.
Speaker 1: Now this is, let me just, now, just point this out maybe and just get you to confirm this, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Black Power conferences you had not just what people would call they Black Nationalist leaders, but you had you know sports figures and I mean Muhammad Ali was there, Lew Alcindor, then who became, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at the Black Power conference along with [HM] Maulana Karenga and other people.
Speaker 2: Whitney Young and them were there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was like, it was like, of course you--I guess you--the--Floyd McKissick from CORE [Congress on Racial Equality] and stuff, all of these outstanding activists were a part of this you know.  Well that's why it's so important and then you pointed out, and I agree with you, to write that independent history because then you get the knuckleheads that put it in the sensationalist media, then it's "a bunch of extremists got together" and so and so, and so.  You'd think that nobody was there but Imari Obadele, Maulana Karenga and [Amiri] Baraka or somebody, no man all kinds of folks came, it was a massive thing the Black Power Conference.  I think the one in 1970 it was thousands of people that met in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1970.
Speaker 1: Yeah the Congress of African People.
Speaker 2: Cong--yeah, yeah, and that, that 1970 it was thousands and Whitney Young and all those people were there, that was the so-called straight-up black bourgeoisie you know and black people well they were meeting en masse you know determining, trying to determine their own destiny.  How we were gon' move as a people, and of course I guess the most publicized one was the great Gary convention [National Black Political Convention, 1972].  Unfortunately we had some real problems by that time 'cause certain people seemed like they were gonna pimp the Gary convention for the Democratic Party, and the activists in the movement weren't going for that so it was some real tensions developed, but at even that it showed that various class formations and groups were and leadership were represented in those efforts.
Story_ID: 146278
Speaker 1: But yeah from, from the Black Power conferences on, there were definite moves to develop independent schools and institutions and I guess the most long-range product of that has been CIBI, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the Council for Independent Black Institutions, CIBI.
Speaker 1: Independent Black Institutions yeah, CIBI yes and so that's an ongoing tradition, one of the kinda painful things that we produced a whole middle class that so assimilationists that they seem to act like we are a bunch of nuts when we talk about self-determination. However, I think that what happened to our people after [Hurricane] Katrina and these continuing issues that keep happening may discourage some of these assimilationist Buppies, yeah, they used to call and say that we all, that were stuck in the '60s [1960s] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well the '60s [1960s] were quite a time now for black art, and I don't think that--some have said that there's never been such an outpouring of black art, even in the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: Well because we were on such a vast scale.  Someone had asked me in an interview, said well did, were you all more less bringing forward?  I said well we, yeah a lot of the things that particularly what Langston [Hughes] raised in his famous essay 'The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain' we, we agreed with what Papa Langston [Hughes] said but ours was so vast, I mean the great walls of respect that were in all the major cities where black people were, the great mural movement, the public art and stuff and we really agreed with Henry Highland Garnet, Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois and them that we were a nation within a nation and that we the black nation was gonna organize and build itself and prepare for its freedom and we were serious about that and you know we didn't care you know who didn't like what we said, I mean so ultimately it's gon'--we said it's gon' be decided by the great masses of our people anyway, that's what self-determination was and so people ask me about the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], "Well do you regret?"  I said, "Hell no, the only thing I regret is we didn't achieve full liberation."  We felt that the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] was a revolution that did not come to its full completion, but it created the foundation for a whole new group of people to emerge and interestingly enough a lot of them won't acknowledge what (laughter) where they came from 'cause we remember when black professionals and people did not, were not a part of white America, were, were not in the loop so a lot of times they don't even want to acknowledge what foundation that they stand upon.  That was the problem we had with Skip Gates [HM Henry Louis Gates, Jr.], he gonna knock the very movement that produced him, that produced the Black Studies, Skip and them didn't produce Black Studies, Black Studies came from the Black Freedom Movement, and the black communities and the churches and stuff and then went from the community onto the college campuses, you know, and so a lot of these people parading around like they created Black Studies, that's not so.
Story_ID: 146279
Speaker 1: I, I, I--
Speaker 2: And, and that's an important point too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That it, it, it's [Black Studies] something that the community imposed on the college rather than vice-versa.
Speaker 1: Right the black masses, the black community, one scholar was very insightful, Dr. Joyce Ann Joyce with her study, 'Black Studies As Human Studies,' she's the only scholar that recognized three people who were part of that process, now you know Dr. [John Henrik] Clarke and them are gone and that was our Sister [HM] Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka and myself.  The three of us were part of the core faculty of African American Studies at San Francisco State [University, San Francisco, California] led by the eminent scholar [HM] Dr. Nathan Hare and that she's the only person, scholar that interviewed Sonia, Amiri and I and asked what our focus, what our reading was on black studies and how it has evolved or declined, however you wanna define it and so forth.  You think a lot of these peacocks with Ph.D. strutting around that they had created Black Studies.  Black Studies grew out of the struggle of our people, the working class grass-roots black community trying to practice self-determination and resurrect its history and its heritage.  "There go Askia getting' on the soap opera," soap, soap box again but you know the truth is the light.  You know Baraka said, yeah say it in Kenya, said that people who actually fought the British in Kenya, the Land [and] Freedom Army, some of those elders now are somewhere on the sidewalk selling apples and you got all these big neo-colonial big shots making deals with the British and the Americans, you know.  I think they call that neo-colonialism but we were a part, we were a legitimate part of, we saw ourselves as yeah an extension of the Harlem Renaissance but actually the whole, the Black Arts Movement was like a black culture revolution, both the Freedom Now Move--the culture wing and the 'Freedom Now' and the Black Arts Movement was a cultural revolution.
Speaker 2: Now there's a, there's a friend of mine in Chicago [Illinois] that always has an argument with me about what comes first, politics or art, and see he would argue that you can't have art without the right politics, and I would argue that you know some that politics informs art and art really does more motivation than straight up politics, but I, I don't know, what do you think about it?
Speaker 1: There's a symbiotic relationship, I know Harold Cruse felt that because black people and other oppressed  people were so brainwashed by this media and this system that before they were--he felt that before they were able to raise--wage true social, political revolution transformation of society, you'd have to have a culture transformation to lead the way because otherwise you just end up with a bunch of [HM] Colin Powells and Condoleezza Rices, though some of our colored people consider that progress, but so how do you transform people's consciousness so that rather than a Condoleezza you know Rice, you get a Fannie Lou Hamer you know or someone of that caliber you know, you know, and not someone who you know becomes a cheerleader for the master classes who are still running the corporations, you know.  So, no I think you have, it's a, it's a symbiotic relationship and you know I don't know maybe it's like the question, "which comes first the chicken or the egg", but I tell you one thing you won't have social transformation without cultural transformation and I guess vice-verse, it's a dialectical relationship you know.  I--we didn't see it as a contradiction, I'll tell you why.  A lot of us were not only cultural activists, but we were political activists as well.  That's what James Mathers point out in his study of the Black Arts Movement, that often time the same people who were the cultural activists were the political activists too, you know.  So we didn't see any contradiction.
Speaker 2: So what one or the other.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You either, either it's a cultural activist and you're wearing a dashiki but you're not doing anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah blowing hot air, we wasn't about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So we were like off in the same folks, sisters and brothers doing it all like and so we didn't see a question of either or but both and, you know and so forth so.
Story_ID: 146280
Speaker 1: Now what did--you're--you started out as a visual artist, primarily and made a transition, basically you're known as a spoken word artist now.
Speaker 2: Not a spoken word artist--a poet.
Speaker 1: A poet okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't like that term (laughter) because it wasn't defined, we didn't define that but as a poet.
Speaker 1: My apologies (laughter).
Speaker 2: As a poet and a writer, well I think it never leaves you, like I still have a visual artist eye and I still see like a visual artist and I know critics have talked to me and about my work and say that you know, Askia paints with words.  That's what they'll say about me.  I, you know we could, there's so much imagery in your work and we see colors and we see this, so well what happened with me (laughter) it basically got down to economics.  I know my, comrades and colleagues at AAMARP [African American Master's Artists in Residence Program, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts] would probably chuckle at me, we were up there scuffling so and once I got to the Umbra's Workshop, writers' workshop and you know we were having, you know really struggling trying to buy canvas and paint and all that equipment and stuff and so the writers and poets said, "Look man all you need is a pen or a pencil and a, a notebook," and we said, "Yeah that's right," he said, "That's it and then everything else come outta your head," and so it made good financial sense you know and it's I guess the muse, the poetic muse won that one, you know and so it was practicality you know but I loved being a painter, a visual artist and that passion that I--in fact I would say that being a, a visual artist probably was the grand passion of my life and my youth in terms of creativity and I--cause what I wanted to do, and I've never, I don't remember saying this publically but I wanted to, to be of a muralist like the Mexicans and so forth and so maybe in another time in another age that would have happened, but.
Speaker 1: Do, do you still paint?
Speaker 2: Only in my head (laughter), but I'm a great, well you see where I'm hanging out with all the visual artists and so forth and I can still draw a bit but I have too much respect for the medium to be just an, an amateur doodler, you know, but yeah, but.
Speaker 1: So what was it, were you distracted at a certain point where you didn't develop it anymore that you thought you were comfortable in painting or?
Speaker 2: Yeah it--the images switched in my head to word--from visual to words and so forth and so I found that as I went on I was writing more manifestos, doing less painting and then all of a sudden, and I'd always been writing lyrics of some kind anyway and so, but I think frankly, I think it was the economics that won me over.  Man all I had to do was get a notebook and a pen, that was it, and then of course you'd, later on you'd get a little typewriter 'cause you had to type it up, at that time it was pre-computers so we--everybody had them a little beat up typewriter and typewriter paper, but it didn't cost like tubes of paint and canvas, and all of that costs.
Story_ID: 146281
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, now, now you, you, you've been a singer, a visual artist, poet, have you ever, have you ever thought about--well an essayist too and an activist--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about acting in the, in the--I know black theater was so big in those days, and so many of the elements were.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I hear what you said, well I, I, I--I had a theater, I had co-jointly we had what I call when I was in Atlanta [Georgia], we had a group called AFCOM which meant, short for African Community and we developed the gur--in the, what was that in the, in the '80s [1980s], the AFCOM Guerilla Street Theater and so I had, no it was in the '70s [1970s] we had the AFCOM Theater and we actually wrote plays and in the streets performed in the community in Atlanta and so forth and I've written a couple, couple of plays.  I wrote a play called 'Double Dutch, a Gathering of Women,' a short play which the Young Filmmakers of Boston [Massachusetts] made into a film and, and it showed at the 2003 Roxbury Film Festival and the young, young director of the play won Best Director and when we showed the film the women of, the black women of Boston gave us a standing ovation, and so had I had more time you don't know you know by the time you get up in my age, you don't know how much time as my father says, "The clock is ticking".  Had I more time I would like to do more investing in, in drama in actually writing plays.  I've done a couple of--written a couple of plays and a drama, sort of like a dramatic pageant from my long poem 'From the Pyramids to the Projects from the Projects to the Stars' so hopefully maybe I'll have time to do more experimental work with drama 'cause I really respect that, and I find it just so curious working with actors and still I you know, when I can I support black drama and recently our outstanding Sister dramatist here in Boston, Jackie Parker, Our Place Theater did a tribute to me, sort of like they do Langston [Hughes].  They actually acted out poems that I had written and they narrated and acted them out which help to further stoke the fires for drama in me you know, so you know I have a real interest and a growing desire to be working with drama and so forth and I've always respected you know my good buddies, you Ed Burns and [Amiri] Baraka and even Sister Sonia [HM Sonia Sanchez] 'cause Sonia's written several plays you know and I think I would brainwash myself out of drama.  I kept associating drama with the novel and I found--later I talked with people they said, "No it's closer," they felt that drama was closer to poetry.  I said, "What?"  And so that kinda knocked that barrier down so yeah I would like to do more work with plays, you know I hopefully if I have, you know, you never know if I have time.
Story_ID: 146282
Speaker 1: Now, now do you have a--I, I remember the first book I, was, was 'Songhai' the first book of poetry that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: The first collection?
Speaker 2: It was 'Juju.'
Speaker 1: 'Juju' okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was a chapbook called 'Juju' dedicated to John Coltrane, that was from Third World Press, [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] published that, 'Juju' and then let's see, 'Songhai' was the--well I put that little book together myself and illustrated by the great Harlem artist, Abdul Rahman [ph.], 'Songhai' and then after that "From the Pyramids to the Projects" which came out of Africa World Press and that won the American Book Award for poetry, for literature in 1989 which I, really startled me.  I didn't expect that.  I guess the greatest surprise is the ones you don't expect, so I've, I've written about seven books the, with the--I got a new one out called--I working, two--I got one that's coming out probably next month.  The new one that's out right now is 'Mother Earth Responds, Green Poems and Alternate Visions' and that was from World Wind Press out of Camden, New Jersey and those are my kinda my environmentalist poems, my reclaiming my old Midwestern heritage of unity with Mother Earth and so forth, 'cause I feel that these barbarians are destroying our beautiful planet.  I think more and more people are reaching those conclusions and then this new book is, it will be out any day not, it's from Africa World Press, the people that produced 'From the Pyramids to the Projects,' it's called 'African Affirmations: Songs for Patriots,' and it's around the theme of "What do African Americans Have to be Patriotic About or For?" and the anguish that we've gone through, I think those are key questions that African Americans have to ask themselves, in a society that despises you that speaks of your sister athletes like the Rutgers [women's basketball team] sisters as "nappy-headed hoes" what do you have to be patriotic about, and if we are patriotic, patriotic to what and to whom?  And so this, this new book raises that question and attempts to forward some answers you know.  And I know a lot of young people raising that question again as we raised it in a time when we were young, young people and activists and artists and so forth.
Story_ID: 146283
Speaker 1: Can--how has your poetry changed over the years from the, from the '60s [1960s] to now?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter), that's, that's, that's a whole thing within itself, I hope that there's been growth.  You know I tried to embrace the epical vision.  I think my most maybe interesting, maybe even controversial and advanced book was 'Dawnsong' which came outta Third World Press in Chicago [Illinois], 2000 and what I tried to do was to recapture the lost archetypes of ancient classical Africa, Kemet or Egypt and Kush, Nubia and I tried to do in poetic form what Cheikh Anta Diop and Ivan van Sertima, and [HM] Asa Hilliard, [HM] Maulana Karenga and other people were doing with actual history, and I tried to resurrect the imagery and metaphor of the ancients as, as part of the Sankofa process, Project and bring them forward and show how their energy and their essence is as much living in black people throughout Africa and the Diaspora as it was before and it was--it is part of a-it's a what you call it a poly-vocal trilogy. Book One "Dawnsong", Book two is called "Isis Unbound, the Goddess Poems" and which is just about finished and then the third one is called the "Matean Elegies" [ph.] and so it's a trilogy and I don't know you get my age you start wondering like my Pop said, "the clock ticking you don't know how much time the creator has got for you to finish your body of work" but and then I got a new book that I'm putting together.  Most of the poems are written for this with one of our great artists here Brother Akim Rakib [ph.] called "Great Black Music" bringing together my which was as what we talked about my, my soul music, my jazz and so forth and the various epic poems which flowed from that with the beautiful pristine images of Brother Akim's work, so hopefully we can get something out in vary soon you know so it's, you know my mind is jumping boy you know I feel so fortunate and I feel so challenged you know.  I just hope I have the energy and the stamina and the health to continue this work because it's interesting whereas people were calling us everything but a child of God and the, the tide turns my friend Muhammad Ahmad who is now Dr. Muhammad Ahmad at Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] from the old RAM [Revolutionary Action Movement] days.  He said, "Yeah," he said, "Askia, used to be," he say, "I see a whole crowd of these white people running towards me" and he said, "I don't whether they are trying to put me in jail or what."  He said, "Now they running towards me talking about, organize one of those militant conferences, we wanna, we heard about all this."  He said, "Now they wanna--"  I said, "Yeah they were putting to put us in jail before now they trying to give us awards and things you know," the tide turns you know and the same forces that were condemning the Black Arts Movement, now all kinds of all outstanding scholars are writing about it, doing studies on it.
Story_ID: 146284
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, we, we always ask this question, when, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: Probably, maybe would have tried to think things through more, what we faced um--that's un--that's not, it's not like that now things were just explosive.  They were happening just simultaneously day-to-day, week-to-week and so you really, thank goodness we were young men so you just had to, it was like a train blowing its horn, you just had to get in there and move with it.
Speaker 1: It was a movement (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah it was a tremendous--see I was saying people hadn't seen black people stand up en masse.  When black people stand up en masse the whole country shakes, and so given what we knew at the time, we did the best of what we could with what we had.  We weren't arrogant unlike some of the younger people, we went to our elders, we went to Dr. [John Henrik] Clarke and Queen Mother Moore and all them, the various elders J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and we didn't think we knew more than our elders, we might have politely disagreed with some things, John [Oliver] Killens was a great mentor for me in literature, like Dr. Clarke was in history so we, we respected them even in with if we disagreed on something we respectfully disagreed, but we had our problems and contradictions and but it's not too much given that I think that on the whole given with what we had to deal with we did the best we could with what we knew and we tried to back it up by consulting with leaders like Harold Cruse and James Boggs, James and Grace Lee Boggs and Dan Watts [Daniel H. Watts] and other people, Mr. Richardson [ph.] out on the West Coast.  We did the best--but I, I don't regret any--the only thing I regret is that we didn't win, that's the only thing, but I--anything else.  I mean just like [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and them said and it probably goes back further, you know, the worst kind of life is the unexamined life.  It's probably some things I would have done differently but basically like I said I don't have any basic regrets.  My only thing I wish some of our great leaders would have lived longer and I wished we could have developed strategies to protect them.
Story_ID: 146285
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, it, it you, you mentioned winning a couple of times and to you what would constitute winning?
Speaker 2: Well we tried to, we seriously wanted a liberated black nation and we wanted to transform this country and or at least put--when we say "black power" we weren't playing.  You see so many of the buppies today they don't even raise that question, we said black people had the right to self-determination and we meant it, and that was the--one of the tragedies of black people in the United States.  We've never been given the right to self-determination, to determine our own destiny and we tried to close that gap and we felt that black people could not be truly free unless there was a transformed American society.  We didn't completely transform it and they tried to co-opt and buy out and murder, and do everything but I will say at least there's no form of apartheid any more.  I remember like we talk, I remember when it was no such thing as black studies or anything like that.  I mean we had to, with all of our vulnerabilities as human beings, our frailties but with our creativity and our innovativeness we helped to create the world we have now with warts and all, its contradictions, but we always say we drag white America kicking and screaming and protesting and howling into the world of so-called diversity.  It's not, it's not perfect not by a long shot, but they're not having legal segregation and apartheid of black people like the world that we came into and when they insult our people at least we'll march on the radio station and get the son-of-a-gun fired or suspended you know, you know, and no it's not what we wanted but maybe each generation has to carry the torch and like a relay team take the stick and run and then pass it off to the next generation, we're links in a chain you know, and with all our contradictions I would think frankly, and want this, I want to say this on record.  I think this is the greatest generation of African Americans since the African Americans of the nineteenth century.  I put that in my book, 'Mother Earth Responds,' I think this generation is to be compared with [Frederick] Douglass and [Martin] Delany, Harriett Tubman, Henry Highland Garnet and so forth in terms of freedom fighters you know and you know I just wish and hope that the young people and the young scholars and the youth can really study and take from us and take things forward and please don't listen to the Condoleezzas [Condoleezza Rice] and the Colins [HM Colin Powell] and the sellout people.
Story_ID: 146286
Speaker 1: And I felt very good at Ebony magazine having the young activist hip hopper [Common] and [HM] Harry Belafonte on the cover because we, we--
Speaker 2: It's Common sense.  Common.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Common, we really respect Brother Belafonte and I think that makes up for the terrible snubbing that the King Family gave to him knowing that he was very close to [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and Mrs. King and so that was one--I was glad to see that and that Harry lived long enough to have that tribute and so forth, just to have Harry with us.  Harry helped to finance the, the whole SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and much of the Civil Rights Movement, raised millions of dollars, not--he didn't have any big money, but he raised that money for our Freedom Movement and he's never sold black people out and he could have you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe, yeah one important point was raised the other day by [HM] Judy Richardson was that Harry Belafonte funded a trip for the SNCC activists to Africa in 19, in the fall of '64 [1964] I believe it was.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Which is, is going beyond, it's, it's a cultural contribution but it's also political.
Speaker 1: Political as well yes, and so I'm just so glad that you know he lived long enough to be embraced by the younger generation and so forth you know, 'cause I think he set a fine example and he stood up and he called [HM] Colin Powell a Uncle Tom and a sell out and Condoleezza talkin' about "We, we've seen the last likes of Harry Belafonte." I said, "You need to sit down somewhere (unclear)," well let me go I'll stop. I got to poem on Condoleezza, that's in my book you know, 'African Affirmations.'  I remember I read the poem on Condoleezza at James Madison University [Harrisonburg, Virginia] in October of 2004, and when I finished it was about, about twenty-five hundred people in the audience.  They said "Oooh" (laughter), you know that old signifying thing you know, so but we have to--and by the same token even though people say it's controversial, but I think it was a fine thing and she didn't have to do that.  I think that was a, a generous thing that Oprah [Winfrey] did by setting up the school for young women in Africa you know, and I think we when our people do something that's decent and worthy we need to congratulate them and not always be nitpicking and hating, she could've of taken that money and done anything with at.  At least she tried to do something and it's up to the people of Africa to take and mold and shape that institution and make it and she did at the behest of Comrade Nelson Mandela, you know so you know we have to when, when they do things like that we have to you know hold 'em up you know, that don't mean that everything's perfect but you know the sister was trying to do something for young African women you know and I think that needs to be upheld you know.
Story_ID: 146287
Speaker 1: Tell me this what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well you know one of the things is that at this point I hope that we can as a people as a national community, in fact as a nation that we can survive the assault of the prison industrial complex against our young people, particularly our young men and also the attempts to bifurcate our people and to initiate a, a twenty-first-century genocide by pumping drugs and so forth into our community and disrupting our communal structures and so forth and I hope that the young people have the wisdom to see this and to truly, critically examine the structure of the U.S. imperial state and realize that people, a people who enslaved you cannot free you, you have to free yourself.  You have to develop the process of liberation among your peers and colleagues yourselves.  Like one of the things that Amiri Baraka said to never cease to tickle me.  He said the first thing black people had to do once they got 'em off the chains and outta the chains and auction blocks, he said the first thing black people had to do was master English.  He said because once they, black people mastered English they could invent white people called "abolitionists" and so I never forgot that you know that we have to implant within our people the realization that the people make history, that they can liberate themselves and that they would probably find that they have more people in harmony with their desire for freedom and democracy than against them.  I think this whole country is tottering on the brink of fascism and it was almost a fascist coup here with these "elections" or "Supreme Court selections" of the highest office in the land and that we need to be on our guard. It's not over yet; it's some serious people who wouldn't rest to place black people, Latino people, poor people in concentration camps.  It was done before and that we can't relax and escape into partying and drugs and buying commodities.  We have to be on our toes and we have to really link up, link the generations and do not get involved in Harold Cruse called "historical discontinuity" the one generation doesn't know what the other generation was about and have to reinvent the wheel all over again.  That's very dangerous in this period so I hope that the life of myself and my comrades will serve as an example that you can fight for the freedom and liberation of your people and live a decent life as an African person, and also be respected and admired by like-minded peoples of other ethnic groups and nations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You don't have to assimilate to become a seriously balanced creative human being.
Story_ID: 146288
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Probably I know that at least I--you know I will be identified with the Black Arts cultural revolution and the, the upsurge of the African American people in the '60s [1960], but I hope that people when they do that they examine the complexity of what we were attempting to do.  One way would be to read books like James Smethurst, it's 'The Black Arts Movement [: Literary Nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s'] and the young, brilliant young scholar, Robin D.G. Kelly's book 'Freedom Dreams: the Black Radical Imagination' so that the young people, the thinking young people will realize the complexities of what we were about in the process of trying to change the world, transform yourself and in turn be--transform your society and we made tremendous mistakes but our hearts were sincere and like Brother Malcolm [X] said, our greatest, I guess our greatest credentials were our sincerity, we sincerely wanted and gave our lives, our energy, our highest passion and devotion to try to liberate the African American nation, and bring true democracy and social change to this county, and like I said, my regret is that the cultural revolution and the transformation did not go all the way and that we lost a whole generation of leaders in the process, Malcolm and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Medgar Evers and the Kennedy brothers, John [F. Kennedy] and [Robert] Bobby Kennedy and other outstanding people and allies just to bring us to this point, and many people have said unfortunately the tree of freedom, the roots of the tree of freedom is watered with blood, you're not gonna transform the world without sacrifice.  That's one of the problems that I have with some of the hip hop, not all hip hop, but some of the hip hop knuckleheads. They look upon people who engage in self-sacrifice as fools and I think the most noble thing is self-sacrifice for the benefit of your people and your cause, so I don't regret anything.  It's been a beautiful, beautiful ride.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite poem?
Speaker 2: Well you know saying that is like trying to choose between your children.  I guess in terms of the effects, the overall effect is probably I would say is the epic I tried to write, now that I still hopefully wanna do something dramatically 'From the Pyramids to the Projects, from the Projects to the Stars.'  As I tell people, the audiences I say, "you will notice I did not leave our people in the projects," and I usually get a lot of laughter and applause, but I tried to put as much of the history of African people on the planet in that poem so that black people could never say no one ever told us and so forth and my poem 'From the Pyramids to the Project from the Projects to the Stars' was sort of my own Wall of Respect, you know that's the closest of a--to a mural that I could do with words.
Speaker 1: Do, do you have a favorite passage from that poem that you can do for us?
Speaker 2: Not right off hand.
Story_ID: 146289
Speaker 1: This is called 'A Few Words in Passing.'  The ancients are right.  Our common delusions imprison us all and our world becomes a modern gulag, but this is only a beginning.  How are we to find what truly matters in life? We are indeed fortunate, we have elders, Twa [ph.] Gogaju [ph.], Kung [ph.] of our human race, Yogi, Sufis, Lamas, Babas, Zen Master, Shamans, Masters of the Inner realms.  Only we must initiate contact, seek them out.  Begin the soul's grand dialogue with self.  Perhaps the rain forest can aid us on our paths, perhaps the mountains, deserts, lakes and the great oceans, perhaps the ants, dragon flies, butterflies, perhaps our fellow mammals.  We might seek counsel with dolphins, whales the happy ones.  Explain to brilliant ravens, sly crows, immaculate eagles, hawks, vultures, owls.  Begin rigorous chats with wolves, bears, tigers, leopards, moose, rabbits and otters.  Beings on our great maternal planet, elay [ph.] the Earth, speaking deep words, mirroring great truths, realigning beings, practicing divine harmony within the realm of being, my friend when was your last conversation with the rain?
Story_ID: 146290
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about your family.  Do you--who, who, who, who constitutes your family now and, and?
Speaker 2: I would say my family now other than of course my father [Clifford R. Snellings, Sr.] and my relatives in Dayton [Ohio] is my fellow artists and activists and we're kinda spread throughout the country.  Every now and then we do readings together, our brother Marvin X, the poet and play writer is coming nex--this coming Sunday I'm gonna have a double book party with him here and recently last October [HM] Sonia Sanchez and I read together at a college outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and we stay in touch with each other.  The various activists, I'm doing a thing the Monday after Marvin for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War and the fundraiser for them so I keep quite busy. Of course my sisters and brothers are great artists here at AAMARP [African American Master Artists in Residence Program, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] and I guess I would say that family to me is all the lovers and visionaries, people who want humanity and our Earth to prosper and to go on and the people who are about life and growth and development and who savor the future and who savor the spiritual and the Earth and our place in the universe. I think we are the planet--this beautiful little blue jewel, this (laughter) sapphire caste against the indigo of heaven as I say in one of my poems is a divine gift that this is sacred that all, this entire realm is sacred and we are blessed by the divine powers to have this and we must secure it and take care of it and not allow the negative forces to destroy this.  This is the only home we have and that everything is inner acts within this and that hopefully I want to grow to the point that I could say that all the living creatures of the Earth are my family not just my colleagues and so forth, but that's still much growing but I had to, and I must say and I would've never said it in other epochs that to me the most now, the most revolutionary force in the universe is love, but I think I had to grow to reach that realization and you know wade through many sewers, many bloody sewers to come to that realization. I have two young sons as well, Tariq who's a entrepreneur in New York [City, New York] and Jamil who's an independent filmmaker also in New York and I don't want them to inherit a destroyed wasted planet and we have to see that all of us who love our planet and love humanity and for its potential that we're fighting for our very future and so if I--anything you know I hope that you know my life is a lesson for people and that the--not only current humanity but the coming generations are the family that I reach out to and I hope that we love them deeply enough to preserve this beautiful planet for them and that we make it a better place than when we found it.  God knows we tried.
Speaker 1: Thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
