Speaker 1: I always ask people five questions to start out and they're a little "People" Magazine-ish, so just bear with me, but I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: Oh geez, let's see.  Favorite food, probably ox tails and beans.
Speaker 1: We haven't had that one, that's great.  I don't think we'll have that, that's great.

Speaker 1: No problem, don't worry.  I often--having a hard time--I, I'd like to--I was just thinking, you know, Italy to, you know, ox tails [unclear].
Speaker 2: Not at all compatible.
Speaker 1: That just means diverse.  That's what we like about our HistoryMakers.
Story_ID: 76197
Speaker 1: Anyway I'd like to start out by you telling us about your mother, her name was Mildred [Montgomery].
Speaker 2: Mildred.
Speaker 1: And if you could tell us about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--I guess she was one of, one, two, three, five children born to her mother and her father.  And her mom died probably when she was an infant.  She, she was the youngest of the five children.  Her father subsequently remarried and she was raised by an aunt, she called Aunt Mazie [ph.], who I knew, and her husband Uncle Jim.  In the summer time she would go and live with her father and his new wife.  And interestingly, I learned that one of the, one of her, her "sisters" turned out to be [HM] Judge William Cousins [Jr.]'s mother, who was, was really was raised by her stepmother and she was born to the sister of her stepmother.  So they were raised together.  And when I came up, I was you know, I understood that Bill Cousins and I were cousins.  She probably got a--I would say she got the equivalent of a high school education in the Mississippi schools.  She was raised in Yazoo City, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 76198
Speaker 1: And her--I guess she [Mildred Montgomery] married my father [James Montgomery] and became a schoolteacher in the Mississippi public schools, teaching elementary school.  And I guess in order to qualify, she had to have a high school education.  During the years that we were coming up, we actually attended school at schools where she taught and at least for a part of the time.  And she was, I guess it must have been when, when I was about seven, my father left Mississippi suddenly.  I didn't learn until after he died the circumstances under which he left, but I had in my mind some intrigue type stories about it.  But he came to Chicago [Illinois] I think in 1938 or so, and then sent for my mom.  And within a year they sent for my two brothers and I.  I later learned that, from an uncle after my dad died, that he had worked as a--the way he put it, he worked as a-- for a cleaners in Yazoo City, Mississippi.  And his job was to go out into the country where we lived and get cleaning and laundry from people, deliver it back to, to the plant, and then deliver it to the folks, collect the money and he'll take a piece of the money and the, the owner would take the money, take money.  He said they falsely accused him of taking more than his part of the money.  And so my uncle advised him he'd better leave and so he drove him to someplace called Midnight, Mississippi where he hopped a train to Chicago.  So he said "you know they were very racist at that time."  So it was interesting, the old man never told me about it in all those years.  When my mother got here [Chicago, Illinois], she took a job as I remember working for I think at one point W.F. Hall Printing Company.  Then I think she took a job in a factory sewing.  And then I think she took jobs as a housekeeper and maid for, for folks who hired maids.  And then I think after that he pretty much was a, a homemaker.  And I guess from that point until really, till she passed, she was pretty much taking care of the house, and that was about it.
Speaker 2: Did she ever, did she ever try teaching here?
Speaker 1: No, no.  She would not have been qualified to teach here because the qualifications were higher than she had achieved educationally.
Story_ID: 76199
Speaker 1: Did she--what, what type of person would you describe her [his mother, Mildred Montgomery] as?
Speaker 2: I would say that, that, that my mother was a, a very straight-laced person who was a, a disciplinarian to her children; very protective of her children.  A woman who was pretty much I would say almost afraid to be a boat rocker on issues of race.  She would--I'll never forget her, she'd say to me, she said now when I was--my first year as a lawyer or so and I was you know, rocking some boats.  She said now "Baby Brother," she says now "you better leave those white folks alone.  They don't bother you, don't you bother them."  She was a, she was a, a very, very protective and very concerned that her sons might go out and get in trouble, this kind of thing.  I remember her telling me one time when she went back to Mississippi on a visit, she said "I got in a telephone booth and I practiced saying 'yes sir' and 'no, no ma'am'" so that she didn't get in trouble.  What else can I say about her?  She was a great cook.  She--we had the usual southern kinds of meals and, and she was great at, at sort of satisfying everybody.  I remember days when we were you know really short of money when we got to Chicago [Illinois].  And I remember days when she would go without eating so that we could eat.  So she was a great lady.
Story_ID: 76200
Speaker 1: Your father, can you give his name and tell also what you know about his background?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is James Livingston Montgomery, and he is one of five children born to my grandfather Frank Montgomery.  He was the eldest of the five children.  There were four sons and a daughter.  He probably--I kid people sometimes and I'm sure it's not true, but he told me once, he said he quit school, grammar school when they tried to get him to spell "taters" with a "p".  And then he grew up in Mississippi and did what farmers do, pick cotton, we were in cotton country.  He, unlike most of the men there, he took a job in town with a Chinese man who had a grocery and meat market.  And he would go out and select the cattle, bring 'em in and slaughter 'em and cut 'em up for the market.  He did that for, apparently for a number of years.  And then I, then I learned later about this laundry job.  I didn't know anything about that until after he died.  And he came to Chicago [Illinois] first obviously, and when he arrived here, he took a job as a butcher.  He was working for a, a butcher at the grocery store on 55th and State Street.  It was White's Grocery.  And during the period of World War II, he bought a store on 40th and Indiana [Avenue] and interestingly about that store, you know it was--they rationed things like sugar and meats at the grocery store.  Things that were allegedly scarce.  So you had to have a stamp in order to buy meat or to buy sugar.  So the old man was a, was a bit generous when people came in and didn't have stamps.  He ultimately went out of business and had to go to work for the war plants.  And I think he worked for Douglas Aircraft.  He subsequently stayed in that butcher, butchering business working for other people until probably he was sixty-five or so, maybe, maybe a lit--yeah about that, that age.  And I think someone walked into the market one day with a shotgun with a crazed, glazed eyes and put it in his face and robbed him.  And he said "I think I'm done with this."  So he then began a heating and air conditioning business that he did as a sole proprietor.  He went to--I think he must have learned the trade from his younger brother who was in that business in Detroit [Michigan].  And he passed at age seventy-eight in 1987.
Story_ID: 76201
Speaker 1: Now your father [James Montgomery], what type of person was he also?
Speaker 2: He was a strange bird.  My father was one who did not have the--I cannot tell you if there was ever a time in my life that he ever said to me "I love you."  But he was someone who, if I were to objectively describe how he behaved in relation to me and my brothers, you know I can say objectively he loved us very much.  When he was working as a butcher in one of the 43rd Street stores and I was about eleven, I got a job at that store as a stock boy.  And, and I watched him cut meat, but he never showed me how to cut anything.  And everything that I learned about butchering was when I watched him.  So about--when I got to be a teenager, I got a job in a grocery store under another butcher.  And I learned from this butcher that he told the butcher you teach him everything you can, that you know.  And I was able within a matter of a few years, maybe from fifteen through the end of my period in college, I worked as a scab butcher and a summer time butcher.  That's how I worked my way through school.  He was probably--he was very industrious.  He was a guy who the boss would trust the store to him when he go--went on vacation.  One of the things that really characterized my father's life was that he, during most of my young years, and I'm talking through beginning of college, he drank a lot on weekends.  And I'll never forget the--when he would come home on Saturday night, frequently he would be broke and that was payday.  And he would, he would always blame that on the damn policeman.  So I grew up hating cops.  Sometimes I'd see them bring him home, you know.  So I believed him.  One night my brothers and I went out looking for him and we found him in the bar across the street from the grocery store with a woman.  But by that time, my psyche had told me that these cops were bad people and after he was I think about my first, first year of college, he went into one of those drunk tanks and my mother [Mildred Montgomery] basically told him he either had to straighten up or, or leave.  And, and one of the things I admired about him was the way he went there, took advantage of that opportunity, became a teetotaler and you know, took care of his family.  And things went a lot better.
Speaker 1: So you were in college at that time that he, he became a teetotaler?  Were you--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was in my first year of college, yeah.
Story_ID: 76202
Speaker 1: Mr. Montgomery, what--your siblings, can you give their name and order?  Are you the--
Speaker 2: I'm the middle child.  My older brother was Leo Montgomery, and Leo was about a year and a half to two years older than my, than I.  My younger brother is Cleon Montgomery, and he's a couple of years younger than I.  Leo was from the time he went into the Marines as a young man, came back from the service and was a hard working person, but he like my father [James Montgomery], drank like a fish.  He married, had a son, the drinking caused that marriage to go awry.  And he ultimately moved to Detroit, Michigan where he worked as a auto mechanic, heating and air conditioning guy.  He was a mechanical genius and could do just about everything.  And he had hooked up with a lady who was a high school sweetheart, had a couple of children with her.  And about when he was fifty-two he had come from somebody's house where he'd done some work and he made about 500 dollars and he went into a bar and I guess he must have flashed that, that roll.  And somebody put a couple of women on him and within a matter of time he walked out of the place with them, put them in his pickup truck, went to an isolated area and they attempted to rob him and he resisted.  And they stabbed him in the large blood vessel in his leg, and then hit him over the head.  So he, he bled to death.  My younger brother probably spent his entire adult life up until maybe 1994 as a dedicated alcoholic.  He probably didn't hold a job for 20 or 30 years.  My mother [Mildred Montgomery] and dad basically took care of him or he would be with one liaison or another.  But he was a dependent person.  In 1994 his ex-wife, he has a son who is probably about fifty now, his ex-wife had moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  And her--his son induced him to go to Atlanta.  She undertook to try and help him out of his problem and he got a job, got him a job and so forth.  And he'd been working and, and being a responsible person ever since.  His wife, he, he married--well he was married to another woman before he went down there, but she had moved there before and she had been an alcoholic.  She quit cold turkey and then he and she spent her last years together.  She died about five or six months ago I think it was.  And so he's doing quite well, he survived.
Story_ID: 76203
Speaker 1: Now you--I wanna take you to--that raises--I wanna, you know that, you had a sort of a meeting--a different path, so that's sort of an interesting story too.  I want to take you to what your earliest memory, if you have one.
Speaker 2: I think my earliest memory is--had to be about four and I remember that my, my family, my mother [Mildred Montgomery], father [James Montgomery] and maybe a couple of other adults, were on the porch.  We lived on a plantation that was owned by my uncle and there were a lot of homes, houses on the plantation.  And there was the big house where my grandmother [Ella Montgomery] and grandfather [Frank Montgomery] lived.  And there was a road that led from my home and then intersected with another road, you took a left turn and you went to my grandparents' home.  Well they had asked me to go to--go to take something to grandfather or something like that.  So I remember walking down the road and I remember them saying to me later, she says "Boy you were walking so slow.  We figured that you, when you grew up, you had to be a preacher or a bookkeeper 'cause you're slow and lazy."  That's one of the early memories that I have.  And hell I wanted to be a carpenter.  But you know that's, that's sort of the one that goes back as the earliest memory that I have.
Speaker 1: Now why did you want to be a carpenter?
Speaker 2: I mean that's what I saw.  I saw people being carpenters and I thought I'd like to do that.
Story_ID: 76204
Speaker 1: Now that takes me to another question.  If you take yourself back to your childhood, now you were in [Yazoo City] Mississippi until what age?
Speaker 2: Age seven.
Speaker 1: Okay, seven.  I can ask this question about Mississippi or I could ask it about Chicago [Illinois], but I want you to take yourself back to your youth and tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Jesus, that's a hard question.  You, you ask the damndest questions.  Sights, sounds and smells.  Smells you know, I think of smoked meats, the smokehouse which they had down there as you know the way of keeping meats from spoiling I guess.  Sights, cornfields and, and trees and gardens.  Sounds, sounds, the woodpecker pecking on the tree.  Those are some of them.
Speaker 1: That's nice, you don't think of woodpeckers, you don't hear woodpeckers anymore.  People think that's a figment of someone's imagination.
Speaker 2: Imagination, right.
Speaker 1: So when you moved to Chicago, that must have been a big change for your family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were I think, I know what happened.  We were, we were living with my mother's sister and after she left.  And when they got in a position to send for us, they sent us three identical jackets and they were brown jackets with green sleeves.  And my aunt put a tag on the jackets and sewed it onto the jacket.  "This is James Montgomery, he's from Louise, Mississippi.  He is going to Chicago, Illinois and he's getting off at the 63rd Street Station."  So the three of us were similarly attired and we were given a box, shoebox of fried chicken and whatever went with it.  And we were put on the train and we managed to make it to the 63rd Street Station where my mother [Mildred Montgomery] picked us up.
Speaker 1: So this is like a nine, seven and maybe a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like five, seven nine.
Speaker 1: So was that--do you remember that sort of trip being frightening at all?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it exciting 'cause you were traveling on--
Speaker 2: I suppose.  I don't remember to be can--candid with you.  But I know I didn't feel like I was afraid or anything like that.  And I guess excitement to the extent that we were going to a new place and going to our parents, yeah.
Story_ID: 76205
Speaker 1: When you, when you came here [Chicago, Illinois], can you describe what that process was.  And I mean 'cause you're a, you're a country boy, you know, and a country family.  And I know it must have been a surprise in many ways even to your family, your parents [Mildred Montgomery and James Montgomery], they were, they were here.  How long were they here before you--
Speaker 2: No more than a year or so.  But my, my memories of, of that early period when we came to Chicago, was that we talked funny.  And the kids in our block would make fun of our speech.  And of course we quickly as we could, learned to speak the way they spoke.  By the time I got into, well I'm jumping the gun, but by the time I got into college, hell I'm talking like those kids were talking on the block.  And realized that they were just maybe a generation before me from coming from somewhere down south.  And I had to take all kinds of courses in speech and voice and articulation to avoid the embarrassment of my speech pattern when I was called upon in class.  But I remember that's one thing I remember very vividly.  We had one of those old neighborhoods where almost every home was a home in which there was a mother and a father in the home.  It was a neighborhood where, you know the neighbors would look out for you.  There was, there were street gangs in those days and we were on the block where there was no street gang.  And so we were frequently victimized; they would take our scooters which we would make with two by fours and skates at the bottom, and break 'em up.  I remember one time they had my brother cornered in a, in a lobby across the street from where we lived.  And so I sort of eased up to the porch next door and, door and passed him my bat.  He sort of fought his way out of there.  The--there were no--we knew that there were drugs in the community, but they were people who would have reefers in their socks as I remember they'd carry 'em.  And, and later on as we became teenagers, I became aware that at least one or two people in the next block were addicted to heroin, but it wasn't a big deal at that time.
Story_ID: 76206
Speaker 1: School, we went to Oakland Elementary School first and then transferred to Fuller [Elementary] School.  I remember getting--my brother [Leo Montgomery] was a couple of years ahead of me and I was--they put me back a grade or two, and maybe my brother two, I'm not sure.  Because we didn't--we had gone to school in Mississippi [Humphreys County Elementary School] and we were in third or fourth grade, they kicked us down to third or second, whatever.  And I remember childhood being basically we had very limited--we didn't have a lot of money.  My dad [James Montgomery] made a, I guess a decent living as a butcher.  We really never went hungry.  We lived in a basement apartment when we first came [to Chicago, Illinois].  We moved across the street to a third floor apartment.  This, this, this place had no central heating.  It had a, an iron stove in the living room and it had a--one of the old fashioned stoves in the kitchen that I think you had to cook with wood or coal or something like that.  And we ultimately got a gas stove in the kitchen.  By the time I got to college, I remember staying up late hours at night with the oven on and the stove and, and we must have lived in that house until I was in my second year of college.  Then we moved to Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] where my folks bought their own place, a two flat that they cut the second floor up into two apartments for rental purposes, we stayed on the first floor.  And they fixed up the basement as a rental apartment.  We probably always from the time we were in high school, I think my dad got his first car.  And we both, my brother and I learned how to drive with that car.  And in my case I had to--I think the old man was in that, in that drunk tank, so I came home for lunch from high school and I would--knew where the car key was.  And I learned how to drive by driving around without authority during the day when no one would know.  I remember the watermelon man coming down the street with a wagon pulled by a horse and the--and I can remember one of the guys whose name was Earl, he would drive the wagon down Bowen Avenue and he would say "water mellow, come get your ripe water mellow here."  And then what we would do as kids, we would--while he would get busy and distracted, one of us would grab a watermelon off his wagon, hide it behind the car at the curb until he left.  And then we would take the watermelon over to the lake, put it in the lake, cool it off and eat it.  Then there was the, the iceman also coming in a wagon pulled by a horse with blocks of ice and then there was the, the rag man.  He would come down the alley in his wagon pulled by a horse.  And the, and the sound you'd hear was "rexall air" [ph.].  I had no idea what he was saying, and I'm told that that was "rags and old irons."
Story_ID: 76207
Speaker 1: The--what else?  Probably starting at about age eleven or thereabouts, or maybe even earlier, in order to get a bicycle, I took a job as a paperboy for the Herald-American Newspaper.  And if you sold so many newspapers and subscriptions to the newspaper, you'd get a bike.  So that's how I got my first red bike.  And then I think from that point, I worked from that point, which was probably age ten or thereabouts, until--for the rest of my life.  Because I went from there working in the grocery store, and it was in that grocery store environment as a young man, that I decided that I didn't wanna work for anybody.  The--Joe, I'll never forget him.  Whenever business was slow and, and people are not coming in, he'd look around.  I may have the broom in my hand, "sweep the floor, sweep the floor, sweep the floor."  Hell, I'm sweeping the floor.  So I'll never forget that as an experience that said to me I don't wanna work for nobody, you know.  Who needs that kind of grief?  You know.  I remember when one of the--my older brother [Leo Montgomery], he was real smart, he was handsome.  My younger brother [Cleon Montgomery], he was real smart, he was the baby.  And I remember the whole experience that I had as a middle child, you know.  I was always looking for more than I thought I was getting from my folks [Mildred Montgomery and James Montgomery], you know.  So I learned early on to try and perform to show them that I was okay.  And I think that's probably one of the motivating forces of my life, including going to college.  I mean that had been not among the requirements of my mother and father because they at that time felt that if you got a good high school education, you could get a good job.  And that was sort of what we were required to do, and that all of us did.  But when I went to college, aha, I get a little more play, you know.
Story_ID: 76208
Speaker 1: So by the time I graduated from the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign] in 1953, my poor mother [Mildred Montgomery], when she came down I had given her the wrong time for the graduation.  So she was a little late.  And so I can remember her crying saying "I didn't even think you were gonna graduate, and then you give me the wrong time."  So, you know it was one of those moments where you know you, you ask yourself why didn't she think I was gonna graduate, you know?  And then my dad [James Montgomery] said to me one day, he says "okay, so you got a degree."  Actually I was probably showing him my degree.  He says "so what can you do?"  I thought well I'm thinking 'bout those books that they pass out to you about careers.  I said I could--and then I realized they're probably not for, for black folks.  Well I could, and I finally told him, "well I'm going to law school."  And that was my only defense.  But they were very plain people who had their expectations that were within where they were coming from.  And I don't think they ever thought I would ever finish law school and become a lawyer.
Story_ID: 76209
Speaker 1: You know it's fascinating.  I wanna take you to--still to the young James Montgomery.  And I, I wanna ask you what type of person you were as a young person?  Were you introspective, were you outgoing, were you rambunctious, were you well-mannered, were you mischievous?  I mean what--
Speaker 2: I would say among those that you mentioned, well-mannered, that was one thing we were taught from the time we were little in Mississippi, to have good manners.  I was not a mischievous child.  We were--you could hear my mother [Mildred Montgomery] yell out the window about the time it got dark in the summer time when all--everything's 'bout to get underway.  She's calling her sons in, you know, and so we were pretty well disciplined and we were pretty well compliant.  As far as, as how I was as a, as a kid, I would probably say that I had a fairly normal childhood.  I had friends.  I probably was very shy with girls because I had no experience with girls.  We were, we were a, a bunch of brothers.  I, I was very competitive in, in school with my brothers.  We had some kind of a system, units or something that you earned in grammar school.  And I fought like hell to get more than they got because again there was that business of trying to perform to get love, which I later realized was just really attention.  I mean I was a big talker.  I mean I, I would--one day I got in an argument with a guy and he said well all right, we, he started a fight.  So hell I'm--I had kept people off of me with my mouth, you know.  This guy beat me half to death.  I went home and crying and my mother said "You mean you let him beat you?"  She's--"I feed you all these beans and, and, and, and you let him beat you?"  I felt so bad.  But I--from that point on of course I, I used my mouth to keep away from fights and get in fights.  I remember that in terms of, of my brothers and I, when one would get--somebody would attack one of us, the other would come to his aid.  I, I think that in terms of, of school, school came fairly easily for me.  I always had an after school job, so I didn't have a lot of free time in the street.  Always had fun playing ball with the other kids in the block.  You know I can really say that I had what I consider a fairly normal and a fairly happy childhood, with the exception of my competitiveness with my brothers.
Speaker 1: Now do you think your competitiveness came early with a second child trying to find a place?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 76210
Speaker 1: But you know the thing that I'm curious about is how, why was school--you know your parents [Mildred Montgomery and James Montgomery] did not necessarily emphasize education, so why was school--why did that--why was that what you latched on to really sort of prove, you know, I'm worthy?
Speaker 2: I think maybe I was encouraged by a, a landlord that we had.  She had basically told me, she said "James if you catch up with Leo in school," Leo being a year ahead of me, "you catch up with Leo in school, I'll give you five dollars."  And I think I went to summer school I think just once, and I caught up with him.  And so that was one of the things that I, you know, I never really thought about it until later in life as to what was going on then, I mean at the time.  I didn't have any sense of what I was doing or why I was doing it.  But later on as I reflected on it and had a number of years in therapy, I sort of look back at it and, and came to those understandings.  But you know I knew that if I went to, went to, if I went to college, that that ought to be, they ought to be happy about that.  And I think they were, you know and they always encouraged me about that.  My mother said she didn't think I'd ever make it.  But that's about all I can think of [unclear].
Story_ID: 76211
Speaker 1: Now what--were there teachers that were influencing you, and were there subjects that you gravitated towards?
Speaker 2: Well let's see.  I would say I only remember in grammar school, at Fuller [Elementary] School, two teachers that made an impression on me.  And, and they were sort of my heroes.  They were a couple of women, Mrs. Lane and Mrs. Payne.  Anybody got out of order, they'd take a little paddle and paddle your hand.  I think they paddled us on our butts then, it was okay.  In high school and in college [University of Illinois at Navy Pier in Chicago, Illinois], all of the motivation that I got from teachers, not all, but the motivation that I remember, was negative.  And the, there was a teacher of math who taught algebra.  And this lady told us how difficult it was to take those final exams in college and how tough college was.  I mean, hell I can't deal with that, you know.  And then by the time we got into senior year, the counselors that they would send you to, they were--they basically looked at you as, as black and you had limitations on where you were going.  And so you were discouraged instead of encouraged.  Probably the most significant negative motivation that I recall in my life was when I went to University of Illinois at Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois].  They require you to take a preference test and a aptitude test.  They then assigned you a counselor to interpret your tests, etc.  And I was assigned to a history teacher by the name of Dr. Bild, B-I-L-D.  I'll never forget her.  Never had her as a teacher, but she was my counselor, she only counseled me once and never saw her again.  But she said to me, she says well "Mr. Montgomery I looked at your aptitude test and you're average in this, you're average in that, you're below average in this and you're not above average in anything.  Anybody contemplating the study of law should be above average in everything and you're not above average in anything.  And as I look at your preference test, while it suggests the law, I don't believe it."  So I think you--and I'm, I'm going for this lady hook, line and sinker.  I'm eating it up, I'm--she's a counselor, I'm buying it.  And then she says something that let me know she was stupid.  She said, "So I think you should try something less taxing like physical education."  Well now it hit me, "Jim, you're a klutz.  This lady is telling you to take physical education."  So I got pissed and I told her "Well thank you very much, but I'll take a stab at it anyway."  That was a real motivating force for me.  It drove me to, to, to prove to her that she was a damn lie and was wrong.  I think the--even in I would say the--in law school, I was at the University of Illinois and probably couldn't afford to go anyplace else because the tuition was more than I could afford then at, at 40 or 50 dollars a semester, or 60 dollars maybe by that time.  Never more than 100 dollars the whole time I was there.  And the dean of the law school, Albert J. Harno, an old-fashioned racist, I had in my senior year a friend who had graduated about a semes--half a semester ahead of me.  And he had gone--he had wanted to go to law school.  So he came to me one day and he says, "You know Jim, I went over to the law school and I talked to the dean.  And he told me that we had not done too well at the law school and so he would suggest that I go someplace in Chicago like John Marshall [Law School] or Kent [Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago-Kent College of Law]."  So I said, "So what are you gonna do?"  He said, "I'm going to Kent."  I says, "Haven't you--didn't you read Sweatt v. Painter [1950]?  We all had a course where we read those cases where they could not keep you out of a state school.  He says, "Well no, I just don't want to fight it, Jim, I'm gonna go on to Kent."  So I, I said I am not going over there to ask them if I can come there. I am going to apply and get admitted, and that's what happened.
Story_ID: 76212
Speaker 1: Turned out that there had not been an African American in that school [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Law] since 1944 or 1945, and this was in '53 [1953] or, yeah '53 [1953].  So in the first semester, that dean [Albert J. Harno] taught criminal law.  And it was a freshman course, so during the entire semester I ultimately stopped raising my hand, he didn't know I had a voice.  He never called on me in the whole time we were there.  The--another professor who was a Constitutional law professor that I, I was--I'd taken a lot of Constitutional law in undergrad, so and a lot of that stuff was old hat for me and I sort of was interested in it.  And at the end of every exam, I would always lead the class.  And sometimes when he'd have the feedback on what the appropriate answers were, I didn't deserve to be at the, the lead, head of the class.  I did all right, but not that well.  So you've got the, you've got the double edged sword there.  Some of 'em felt that if, if you were not completely stupid, you were a genius 'cause their expectations were low.  But that sort of--some of the stuff that really motivated me all my life.  I mean I, I would say to you that the one thing that has, that has really screwed me up as well as inspired me was when I went into that darn law school.  I was the only African American there.  Whenever you'd leave the classroom and go out in the corridors and want to discuss some of the issues that went on in class, I was ignored, not heard, talked over.  I mean just uniformly like it was the way you do things.  So of course after a very short time, I used some of the rhetoric I'd learned in the hood, well fuck y'all, you know and I just went on about my business.  Studied my, my, my--by myself.  And then at the--whenever there was a, an exam, I would put on the only suit that I owned with a shirt and tie, shine my shoes, go over to the law school, look at the little white boys sitting nervously around waiting the exam and say, "What are you so upset about?  It's only a goddamn exam," you know.  And I would venture to say that it must have been 40 years later or close to 40 years later, I was in therapy and I had a noon appointment with my therapist downtown.  And I don't know what the hell we were talking about, but she asked me "Jim, I wonder if that had anything to do with the fact that you're black."  My mind traveled all the way back to those days in law school, and I must have cried uncontrollably for about fifteen minutes until I could--ul--ultimately articulate to her why I was crying.  And you know she said, "Well I guess you've not allowed yourself to feel the pain of that rejection."  And I mean, it really had a tremendous impact on who I am and who I became.  'Cause the day I started in the law business, the first experience I had before a judge where I was in court with three of the senior African American lawyers in this town.
Story_ID: 76213
Speaker 1: You said you were just out of law school [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Law].  I mean you had just--and you were appearing with the three of them.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah was appearing with these three very distinguished lawyers you know, of our community.  And I listened to the judge talk to them, talk down to them.  And so the next time I got before that judge and I'm appearing for my firm, he said something off-color, and I said to him, "Pardon me, Your Honor.  Did I hear you correctly?"  And immediately he backed off and, and apologized.  And from that day forward, I determined I was not gonna take shit or racism from a judge.  And it was interesting how quickly your reputation gets around.  "That crazy Jim Montgomery comin' in to watch him."  So that was one of the things when I first started the practice of law, I watched a, a guy who used to be a pillar in the community when I was a little kid.  Only lawyer I ever saw, you know, driving a big Buick automobile to, to church and so forth.  And I see this, this lawyer before a judge in my first year of the practice, and it--he comes across like this.  He says "Judge, Your Honor, I come up here for an injunction."  He said "now Judge Herman told me to come up here 'cause the law court won't help me.  I need to have an equity court".  And another lawyer said "Well Judge so-and-so and so-and-so, just a minute, just a minute.  I wanna hear from so-and-so."  And he went on and clowned until ultimately the judge gave him the injunction.  I said to myself then if that's the way I gotta get a goddamn injunction, I don't want it.  But I mean it was a part of the time.  That man had lived and, and practiced successfully being obsequious and a clown.  And he sounded so much like the character of my youth on the "Amos and Andy" show who was lawyer Algonquin J. Calhoun.  You know I mean they were the same things.  Oh God.  And I mean that kind of stuff--and I, and I would say that probably more than anything else from high school civics through college and political science and all that jazz, I believed that nonsense about the American way.  I believed in liberty and justice for all.  I believed in America the beautiful.  I believed that opportunity was equal.  And when I got to finding out that it was a damn lie, I got angry and I determined that I was gonna make society live up to that lie that they'd been telling me and I bought it hook, line and sinker and I was very upset with me for having blindly accepted everything that was spoon fed to me in the civics books and the political science books and all that stuff.  So that I think was a, was a strong part of what made me tick as a young man and, and it sort of affected my whole life and political and professional life.

Speaker 1: But, I-- you know you, you went to college [University of Illinois at Navy Pier in Chicago] in what year, 19--was it--
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949].  And then you went to law school [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Law] in 1950--
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Three, okay.  What--Chicago [Illinois] was such a different time there and so this is what I'm trying--what gave you the, you know the thought that--well at that time black, blacks wanted to be mainstream, right?  I mean in many--but I mean what gave you the pa--
Speaker 2: I don't even know what you mean by that.  Those were thoughts that never entered my mind.  I was not even involved in what the mainstream was then.  I didn't know what the mainstream was.  I'm talking to you about a, a kid who lived in the Near South Side [Chicago, Illinois] where my, my what do you call 'em--my, my--the people who were my ideal people were preachers who drove Cadillacs, the plumber who lived on the block who made 15 or 20 dollars an hour.  The grocer on the corner where we bought our nickel candies.  I mean I never saw a lawyer.  I never saw a doctor except when I had to go to the doctor's office, so that was infrequent.  But I didn't know any people that I would aspire to be like, you know.  When you talk mainstream, I'm not even thinking in those terms.  I don't think that, that that entered my mind.  I, I think that I knew that I wanted to be independent.  I knew that I wanted to be a lawyer, and I thought I wanted to be a lawyer like Thurgood Marshall, who was "a social engineer."  And I did a lot of that in my early years.  But I mean the people I knew were people like my mother [Mildred Montgomery] and my father [James Montgomery].  The adults that I knew.  The teachers of course, they were in a special category.  I don't know, go ahead, try that again.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I was just--the reason why I'm asking the question is because you know you said earlier you know, you had fear of the police in some respects.  I mean you grew up with--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I didn't fear 'em, I hated 'em.
Speaker 1: You hated them, okay, sorry you hated them.  And--
Speaker 2: And behaved that way when they stopped me for a ticket for years till I learned better.
Story_ID: 76215
Speaker 1: So I'm just trying--okay I'm trying--okay you're a complicated person.  I'm trying to under--when you said you were involved in theater also.  You said I was a thespian, is that later?  That's later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's in--that's as a lawyer.
Speaker 1: That's fine, okay got it.  Okay now when you--I know why you said your motivation was to say I'm gonna go to--you know I'm gonna go to college.  But it's--did you do very well academically in, in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I think maybe out a class of 200, I was number 50.  And didn't have to work hard to get there.  I didn't have to work hard until I got in college.  And then I really had to work hard because I was behind in terms of some of the competition.
Speaker 1: So when you--do you have like--when you're applying, you talked about when you were, you know, decide you wanna go to law school.  But when you were applying, decide you wanna go to college, how did you even decide where you were going and who was--I mean--
Speaker 2: I don't think that--I don't remember how I happened to go to [University of] Illinois [at Navy Pier in Chicago, Illinois], except that I knew that it was the only, only financial place that I could possibly meet their financial requirements because the tuition was forty dollars a semester.  And that was difficult to achieve.  But I always worked in the summer time, so I was able to work full time and save the money for, for the college and so forth, and I lived at home.  So I think that I chose Illinois and I don't know--I remember the, the circumstances simply because of what it cost.
Speaker 1: Now was there any significant about the U of I [University of Illinois] here at Navy Pier?  Was there any--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  First day I walked into my rhetoric class, some white boy looked at me who was sitting next to me with a smirk on his face.  And I said to him, "What the fuck are you lookin' at?"  He turned around, never looked with a smirk, with a smirk anymore.  But I mean it was that--it was with a hostile environment.  I mean it was just like I was the only black in that class.  I mean there must have been a good 25 blacks in the whole damn school, you know, maybe 30.  But in that class I was the only one and I'm sitting up there saying what in the world are these people--they're looking at me like I'm sort of a stranger.  Now I've lived in black community all my life.  When we would see--there were two white boys who lived a block away and they were--they would always go home through the alley and leave home through the alley.  And tryin' to be avoided and not seen.  And when we'd see them, sometimes we'd throw rocks at 'em.  When we would go east of Drexel Boulevard to go to the Oakland Square Theater, we'd have to fight our way back into the, into the neighborhood.  So I had never been around white people before, ever.  And so this was a strange environment.  And I think that I was also motivated there to be competitive because of what I perceived as somebody looking at me as being different or inferior or defective, you know.  So that was a, a motivating force for me.  I had a great professor of speech, Dr. Wayne Thompson.  Because I had this southern speech pattern, I took every speech course that I could find and I got him in a course called "Voice and Articulation," where I could learn to speak the King's English like the kings.  And he asked me to get on the debate team.  And he even sent me as the lone representative to the state general assembly for the youth assembly that went down one year to represent the University.  So he was a very positive, encouraging person for me.  And was really one of my motivators, and positive motivators in college.
Story_ID: 76216
Speaker 1: And you know, and I, and I must also tell you that, that--and I don't wanna forget this because when I was like 12 or 13 or so, there was a Abraham Lincoln Center was over at the building at 39th and Langley [Avenue] at that time, which is now Southeastern University [sic, Northeastern Illinois University- Center for Inner City Studies].  And the, the two people who were the executive directors during my youth were John Greene, who was an accomplished baritone musician, and he was succeeded by another man whose name I can't remember.  But they were great counselors for me, both of them.  John taught us music appreciation.  I was in the orchestra, which was taught by a very renowned violinist, his name was Elgar [ph.].  And John Griffin was the second one.  And John Griffin was the one who counseled me when I was so embarrassed when I would be called upon in class.  And he was the one who counseled me to take the speech courses and counseled me to study it twice, you know, so that I would, I would be comfortable and stuff like that.  So those were some great people, you know in my life when I would go from school to the library, I would always have those two guys around as counselors if I needed some, some advice on some people who had become educated with college degrees and so forth.  So Abraham Lincoln Center was a great place for me coming up.  We were, we were kids in the ghetto who were taught things like dancing, music appreciation, sports.  We had annual plays that we put on every year.  And went to camp every year and that kind of thing.  So I mean there's some good things that, that happened during my childhood and teenage years that, that I think were--enriched my life a lot.
Speaker 2: Do you--did you have a sense that you were--I know you say you're--you weren't the brightest of your brothers, but did you ever sense that you had--that things came easier?  Was that something you came, you came to later on in life?
Speaker 1: No, no.  As a matter of fact, I'm talking about the, the high school was not so demanding and so I, you know that, that's how I [unclear].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay I understand, okay.
Story_ID: 76393
Speaker 1: On the left is a photograph of the late [Chicago, Illinois] Mayor Harold Washington.  The event is a fundraiser at the Chicago Athletic Club that I put on for the mayor in his second campaign here in late '86 [1986] or early '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of two lawyers who tried a case with me in Las Vegas [Nevada] in the--on the left is Jerry DePalma.  In the middle is Dominic Gentile, and I'm on the right and we're headed the courthouse in Las Vegas where we were trying a case for a young man who was killed by the police.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Do you remember approximately what year that would have been?
Speaker 2: That would have been in '87 [1987] or '88 [1988], 1987, 1988.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, and just so we can get the spellings correct, could you spell DePalma and Gentile?
Speaker 2: DePalma is D-E, capital P-A-L-M-A, and Dominic Gentile is G-E-N-T-I-L-E.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Great.  Next photo.
Speaker 2: That is a photograph of a group of city commissioners and officers who went to Lille, France in February of 1985 along with a couple of other trips, to look at systems that were automated for transporting people so that we could create the people mover system at O'Hare Airport [Chicago, Illions].  And we looked at a system in Lille.  On the left I believe is the purchasing agent whose name I can't remember.  The next one is an engineer with the Department of Public Works, the gentleman at the top next is a Deputy Commissioner of Aviation whose name I don't remember anymore.  And the next gentleman is Charles whose last name I don't really remember.  The next one is myself, the next one is another--I believe that's another city engineer.  The next one is the Commissioner of, I think at that time the Department of Sewers, whose name I don't remember.  And the other, the follow--the guy on the right is another engineer.
Speaker 1: That's a photograph of me taken probably in the late '80's [1980s] or early '90's [1990s] when I was performing probably playing [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson in the Chicago Bar Association's annual Christmas Spirits show.  And that's about it.
Speaker 2: That is a--I'm on the left.  My son James [Montgomery] Junior is on the right.  And that photograph was taken in San Francisco [California] at the National Bar Association's annual convention where I was the Chairman of the convention.
Speaker 1: That is a 1983 Caribbean cruise where my wife [Pauline Montgomery] and I took for a couple of weeks together on the Norwegian Caribbean Lines.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  And could we get your wife's name?
Speaker 1: Her name is Pauline.
Speaker 2: That is--I'm on the left and on the right is Julian Frazin, F-R-A-Z-I-N.  That again is a picture taken during probably a 19, early 19 to mid-1990's [1990s] Christmas Spirits Show of the Bar Association.  Julie was a prolific writer and wrote all of the song--lyrics to the songs that I would sing.
Speaker 1: Did you say her last name?
Speaker 2: His name.
Speaker 1: His.
Speaker 2: Ju--Julian.  He's, he's, he's dressed--he's, he's in makeup and he probably dressed up as the pianist who played in Las Vegas [Nevada] whose name I can't remember.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Liberace.
Speaker 2: Liberace.
Speaker 1: Yes, Liberace, yes.
Speaker 2: But you said Julian, so I--
Speaker 1: Julian Frazin then I spelled it, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.
Speaker 1: That is a very recent photograph of most of my immediate family.  On the left is my son James Junior, next is my daughter Lisa Allen, next is my youngest daughter Jilian Montgomery, my wife Pauline, myself, my daughter Michelle Montgomery, and my daughter Jewel Montgomery.  That was probably taken at a recent birthday dinner.  We have, have dinner together at every--no that's a formal.  I don't know what that is.  That's a, that's--
Speaker 2: It's an event you think?
Speaker 1: That's prob--it could be an event that we had for the annual [Original] Forty Club, our annual dance.  Yeah that's probably what that was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to present before that group.  Actually Stewart [unclear] and I have talked.  [Unclear].
Speaker 1: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: That is--on the left is my wife Pauline and then me and we're dancing.  And somehow I believe the occasion is a National Bar Association affair, and maybe it was in the Bahamas.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Approximate date if you can recall.
Speaker 2: Probably '70's [1970s], yeah.
Speaker 1: That's just a picture of me kicking back at--looks like it may be at home in my library.
Speaker 2: That is a photograph.  On the left of my mother, and on the right of my father.  Probably taken in the '70's [1970's], late--early to late '70's [1970's].
Speaker 1: We would like to have you state your mother's and father's--
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mildred, and my father is James Livingston Montgomery.
Speaker 1: That looks like me coming down the stairs of my home into the basement.  Probably, probably we're talking middle '70's [1970s].
Speaker 2: That is on the left is DeElla Parker who is my aunt who is now about 101.  And the gentleman in the dark glasses is Damu Montgomery, who is a cousin from Detroit [Michigan].  That's--
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: D-A-M-U.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay thank you.
Speaker 2: And the person on--to my right I can't recognize from this distance.  That's, that is one of my cousin's husbands whose name is, oh God, I can't remember at the moment.  But that was a picture taken during the celebration of my twenty-fifth year in the practice of law at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.
Speaker 1: And was that your aunt, you--her name again.  You said it was--
Speaker 2: DeElla, Capital D-E, Capital E-L-L-A, last name Parker.
Speaker 1: Boy, okay.  On the left is one of my babies, and I think it's probably Jewel Montgomery.  And she is in the lap of a lady who I don't remember.  Then there is myself, my wife Pauline, and one of the lawyers who worked for me whose name, Jesus, last name is Smith.  What's Smitty's name?  Mauldin Smith, M-A-U-L-D-E-N [sic, M-A-U-L-D-I-N] Smith, W. Mauldin Smith.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  When and where was this taken, or what was the occasion?
Speaker 1: That looks like it was taken in the--I would say late '60's [1960s], early '70's [1970s].  More likely early '70's [1970s] cause I don't have my beard.  And that's--I had a 30 foot boat, and that's taken on the, on the aft deck of my boat on Lake Michigan.
Speaker 2: That looks like a picture of me in one of my offices, and it appears like it may have been in the middle to late '70's [1970s].
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  [Unclear].
Speaker 2: And that's about all I can say about that.
Speaker 1: Okay that's a picture taken of me during my beard days, and that had to be in--somewhere between '68 [1968] and '69 [1969].  And I don't know whether I am performing or whether that's simply a candid shot that somebody took, took of me at my surprise birthday party.  Could have been my fiftieth birthday party.  It could have been twenty years ago, which would have been '80 [1980], or '82 [1982].  No, that wouldn't work, that wouldn't work.  That's not the birthday party, that's some other photograph at some time and place.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Says something about Labs, Inc. doesn't it?
Speaker 1: You want me to look at the bottom, the back of it?  Photo by Week.
Speaker 2: By Week?  Let me take a look at that, photo taken somewhere what appears to be near a doctor's office or a lab.
Speaker 1: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: That is a picture of me I believe when I was like a very young teenager, probably before high school.
Speaker 1: Are these--these are sketches of you in court?
Speaker 2: Those are court sketches, right.
Speaker 1: The color photo is a picture of me singing a solo in the Chicago Bar Association's annual Christmas Spirits Show.  And that looks like maybe early, mid-'80's [1980s], something like that, or could be later than that, but in the '80's [1980s] I believe.
Speaker 2: In the lower right, that is a--I'm arguing before the judge in a case involving one of the--I think it was one of the trials of one of the Blackstone Rangers.  And that was in the late '60's [1960's] or the first year or two in '70 [1970] or '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: On the top right, the person on the left is a lawyer for [Edward] Ed Hanrahan and the police officers who were involved in the [1969] Panther raid.  And I'm on the witness stand of the trial of those police officers, testifying concerning statements made by some of the clients who were Black Panthers who were victims of the raid.
Speaker 2: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: Middle left, that is a picture of my oldest daughter.
Speaker 2: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: Linda Montgomery, and that appears to have been taken at looks like my brother-in-law's home.  Sometimes when she was probably about eighteen or so, which takes us back to late '70's [1970s].  Up at the top right is my daughter Jewel on the left and me and then my youngest daughter Jilian.  And that's taken in the living room of our home, and that would have been in the middle '80's [1980s].
Speaker 2: Can you spell Jewel and Jilian?
Speaker 1: J-E-W-E-L, and J-I-L-I-A-N, Jilian.
Speaker 2: That is a photograph of me on the left and my wife Pauline on the right.  And that had to be within a matter of months or weeks after we were married [March 5, 1971] because I'm wearing the suit that I was married in.  And that was in our home.  We had just bought the home within months of the, of the marriage.
Speaker 1: [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: On the left is a, a portrait taken by my late brother-in-law who was a professional photographer.  And I sort of thought it odd that he cut my--the top of my head off, but he felt it was good, great art.  On the right of that, that was probably taken in '69 [1969], '70 [1970].  Directly above that is a fairly recent photograph taken of me and in my captain's hat while on my yacht in probably two, 2000 or, or 1999.  And then on the far right in middle is me in probably at a point where I'm right out of high school and maybe going into college.  So we're talking about '49 [1949], '50 [1950] or thereabouts and I'm wearing one of those straw hats that was the style of the day.
Speaker 1: It's nice. Sporting picture.
Speaker 2: Right.  And on the bottom left, bottom right, that's me at Wilmot Mountain [Wilmot Wisconsin] where the family went skiing on a regular basis.  On the bottom left is me on the left and another lawyer whose name I don't remember at the moment, and we are probably doing a duet and I think in that particular one I'm playing Walter Payton I believe.  And then at the top right, that had to be a candid photograph taken in my home, and I'm wearing a cowboy hat which Mayor [Harold] Washington drummed me out of on the day I came to work, which that would have been about '83 [1983] I guess.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Wilmot Mountain, can I just--where is that located?
Speaker 2: In Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Okay, W-I-L-M--
Speaker 2: M-O-T.
Speaker 1: M-O-T, okay.
Speaker 2: Wilmot Mountain.
Speaker 1: Wilmot, okay.
Story_ID: 76394
Speaker 1: Spell it for us again.  And I want today's date and our location and then I'm going to ask--I want you to say your favorite phrase.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm James D. Montgomery, M-O-N-T-G-O-M-E-R-Y.  Today is July the 16th, 2002.  We're at 1900 South Michigan [Avenue] at [The] HistoryMakers [Chicago, Illinois], and what else?
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase.
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase "is it's only a movie, it's not real life."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that what you believe about life, it's on a movie, it's not real life?
Speaker 2: It sort of, it sort of takes the stress out of life and out of stressful situations.
Speaker 1: That's nice, okay.
Story_ID: 76395
Speaker 1: You know actually Mr. Montgomery, you gave a, a very powerful interview.  And when we stopped, you were actually--well you were sort of at the end of law school, I mean sort of at the end of law school.  And you were talking about even--the beginning your practice serving three African Americans in cour--you know the prominent lawyers, senior African American lawyers in town.  And that's where you stopped.  You didn't really--but you had some impression.  I think you were--by something you had said earlier were a little disappointed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that you know in referring to the lawyer who carried on like a character in "Amos and Andy," it really struck me as very demeaning, and it struck me as demeaning that the judge would play along with that nonsense.  And it sort of gave me an inspiration to make it very clear when I appeared in court that you don't treat me like a nigger, you treat me like a lawyer.  And in a very short time, I--the--my reputation among the judges spread very rapidly and that I was a prepared, no-nonsense lawyer and, and obviously would not take anything that appeared to be insulting.  And so that's about what that message was for me.
Speaker 1: When you came out in 1958, I mean '56 [1956], I'm sorry, 1956, what, what was your first job that you--I mean between fif--I know in '58 [1958] you went with you, you know, U.S. Attorney's Office.  But what was the period between '56 [1956] and '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: During that period I worked for a small African American firm, Rogers, Rogers, Strayhorn and Harth.  And that was [HM] John W. Rogers, Sr., [HM] Jewel Rogers, subsequently Jewel Lafontant [HM Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious], [HM] Earl Strayhorn and Raymond Harth.  And we basically did general practice from criminal to civil and we sort of covered the waterfront.
Speaker 1: Weren't, weren't they at the time--were they the largest black firm?  You know how many--who were the other firms?
Speaker 2: I think at that time there may have been one other black law firm, which was then the largest black law firm, and that was Moore, Ming and Leighton [HM George N. Leighton] was the name of it at that time.  And we were the only other black law firm--there may have been one other.  There may well have been one other, 'cause Judge [Charles] Durham was in a law firm on the South Side that had probably more lawyers than our firm had [Washington, Durham, Kennon, Bryant and Hunter, established in 1961].  So we were probably the third largest.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what the environment was for black lawyers at that time, and what were, you know, the nature of the practice, practice?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was probably a practice where you dealt with the poorest people in the community.  The people with the least assets, people who could ill afford to pay for competent legal representation.  But that was what you had as your opportunity to make a living.  And so you handled a lot of little cases for little money, and you earned a living that was almost as good as a well employed steelworker at the time.  It was, you know, also a period when lawyers coming out of law school did not have an opportunity to get a job with a law firm 'cause there were so few.  And they would go to work in a senior lawyer's office, and they would simply work for nothing for that, that lawyer in exchange for space and an opportunity to be trained by that lawyer.  So it was a very, very bad situation.  There were zero black lawyers being employed by white firms, large or small.  The buildings that you could move in and have an office in, in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois], were very limited.  There was clear discrimination on the basis of race in most of the downtown office buildings.  The old Garrick Building [Garrick Theater in the Schiller Building] on 64 West Randolph Street was one where there were black lawyers there, very old dilapidated building that's subsequently been torn down.  One Hundred North LaSalle, which I believe is no longer standing, is it 100 North?  Yes, it's still standing.  One Hundred North was a building where a black lawyer had been given an office who could pass for white.  And that office maintained itself as a black office throughout those early years when I was practicing with Sidney Jones and Cecil Partee and Otis Nicholson were in that office.  And then there was one other one at 188 West Randolph Street, where the great Cuz Taylor, Euclid Louis Taylor, the great criminal lawyer and the great fixer, had an office there.  But other than that, there were no downtown office buildings that you would find that would accommodate African American lawyers.
Story_ID: 76220
Speaker 1: So, so you come out and how, how does it happen that you end up going--you know identifying?  How are they [the law firm of Rogers, Rogers, Strayhorn and Harth] aware of you or did you go around looking, or--
Speaker 2: I tell you it was very fortuitous because I was in law school at Champaign-Urbana [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Law], and during my last year of law school, just about the end of it, [HM] John Rogers, Sr., Walter Black, who was with the, I think with the Moore, Ming and Leighton firm at that time, they came down for a seminar and I introduced myself as the only black law student in that senior class.  And they told me stop by and see me when you, when you graduate.  And sure enough, I did.  And Jack Rogers hired me right away.  So I was blessed.  I made my first choice to go to work for a criminal lawyer by the name of Joe Clayton, but between the time that Joe hired me and the time that I actually was prepared to go to work the following Monday or Tuesday, he died.  He had gone, he had--he was an asthmatic and show you the racism that existed at that time, he was driving, being driven to Springfield, Illinois to argue a case before the Illinois Supreme Court.  And he had an asthma attack in route, and his driver took him to the nearest hospital and they rejected him because he was black.  And he subsequently died by the time he did get medical care because he didn't get it immediately.
Speaker 1: So did you want--you wanted to practice criminal law?  Is that what you--
Speaker 2: Well realistically, I wanted to practice law.  I didn't know what I wanted to do in terms exactly, but Joe was such--Joe Clayton was such a legend that it was really would have been a privilege to learn from a trial lawyer of his skills.  And so that's basic--that's what he was--course he did criminal and civil work.  I mean one of the times I went to interview him was at--I was there from eleven until two in the morning and he's taking depositions in civil cases at night.  He was an amazing workaholic.  I don't think he ever went home.
Speaker 1: So how was that--so you end up going--you--does, does Jack Rogers then become your mentor of sorts?  Is he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jack Rogers, [HM] Earl Strayhorn and Raymond Harth were really my early mentors and they sort of taught me what it was to be a lawyer and to practice law.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were, they were people who were not spoon feeders.  I would ask questions and they would say to me, Jack Rogers especially, "have you read the statute?"  I said, "yes."  "Have you read the cases?"  "Yes."  "And you still don't know the answer?"  "No."  "Well have you read the court rules?"  I said, "No, I haven't read them."  "Well read those and then if you have a question, come back to me."  And rarely did I get back to him because it was a, it was a way of, of teaching that, that he did which I thought was very helpful to me because it, it made me thoroughly check things out before I asked any questions.
Story_ID: 76221
Speaker 1: Now you know you said you quickly developed a reputation.  Was that in those first two years, or was that--
Speaker 2: Within the first year probably.
Speaker 1: They didn't take you aside as older, you know, lawyers and say you know, watch your step a little bit?  You know you have to be careful how you handle yourself in town.  You don't want to create--
Speaker 2: No, never got any of that.  Because I did it on my own and when I was appearing in court alone, so there was no occasion for them to even be concerned about it I don't think.
Speaker 1: So they were hearing word of you back, you know what there was this young hotshot, you know, by--
Speaker 2: I don't know hotshot, but somebody who don't take no, no stuff.
Speaker 1: But they didn't try to clip your wings.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You know, okay.  'Cause in, in Chicago [Illinois] being a political city, there was attempts--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the only, the only thing that I remember we were very heavily in the days of McCarthyism at that time.  And the only caution I got was don't go to that bookstore down the corridor because that's a Communist bookstore and you might get a bad name if you went there, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Were there things in that early years that you were disappointed with, or you know was it sort of you were happy, you were learning, you know, you had a job, you had a steady job, you were going to court, you were--I mean--
Speaker 2: I don't know, those--you know law, the practice of law became a, a labor of love for me and, and so it couldn't get too hard and there was not much that disappointed me.  And I didn't have enough sense to care about money.
Speaker 1: Now what were, were, were there people that you met, either that you appear before as judges or things like that, that you would come across later in your career, or you know that saw you at that point in time in those early years, that would, you know would impact you later in your life?
Speaker 2: Well there were a number of judges that I ran into in my early years that stayed around for many years.  But nothing that especially, you know I hear judges talking, you know they'll tell me well this lawyer was before me, so-and-so and so-and-so.  They would say complimentary things.  But other than that, that's about it.
Speaker 1: You got married in what year?
Speaker 2: My first marriage was in 19--Jesus, '55 [1955] because I graduated law school in '56 [1956].  And my second marriage was in 1970 [sic, 1971].
Speaker 1: Okay, so Pauline [Montgomery] is, okay.
Speaker 2: That is my second marriage, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you, you're actually a young lawyer with a family at this point in time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And practicing.
Story_ID: 76222
Speaker 1: Now what--how does the assistant--how is the United States Attorney's Office come?  That's really sort of a plumb position at the--
Speaker 2: It was a very political position at the time.  And I was very happy practicing law.  I had sat in on a couple of great trials, learned a lot from some good trial lawyers.  And, and I wanted to continue to do what I was doing.  And Jewel Lafontant [HM Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious] became pregnant with [HM] John Rogers, Jr., and she was in the U.S. Attorney's Office and had been asked to recommend somebody, a black woman preferably, to take her place.  And that ended up being a black male and that was me.  And I said to the guys, I says "Look, I don't wanna go over there."  I says, "I really would like to stay here, but I, I'd like to be a partner."  They said, "Well no, you can't be a partner."  And away I went.  That was the end of that.
Speaker 1: So you, okay.  They, they believed that you hadn't earned your stripes in two years and you were like--
Speaker 2: This was [unclear] "If we do that, you'll be making as much money as we're making."  I said "So, I'm starting to bring in business."
Speaker 1: Well that must have been disappointing a little bit, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, and--but I'm very happy that it turned out the way it did because it provided me with a level of experience that was really invaluable.  I tried cases against some of the best lawyers in the business.  We had some of the finest resources for trials and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the Secret Service and those very sophisticated government agencies that were well funded.
Story_ID: 76223
Speaker 1: Tell me--let's describe the U.S. Attorney's Office at that time.  How many black--are you the black person there?  You know, to fill Jewel's [HM Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious] spot, or are you--
Speaker 2: There were two African Americans and one was the late Judge James Benton Parsons.  And he was there when I got there, and I think during the twenty months that I was there, it was just he and I.  I know that [HM] William Sylvester White had been an Assistant U.S. Attorney in prior years.  And, and when I left, they probably started a string of one or two and then it's been at least two or three African Americans in that office.  Great job for a young lawyer trying to cut his, you know stripe, you know.
Speaker 1: So were there things that you found out--'cause you're really on the other side of the process.  That's what the value of the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's a value of, of being on the prosecution side, knowing how to build a case.  From a defense perspective, learning how a prosecutor thinks and how he develops his case was very valuable.
Speaker 1: Who was the U.S. Attorney at that time?
Speaker 2: Robert Tieken, T-I-E-K-E-N.
Speaker 1: Now what--were there any important cases that you worked on, or were there things that you learned about the FBI that was, you know, the op--the mechanizations of, you know the prosecution team or--
Speaker 2: Well yeah I learned a lot about the FBI and I had--your first question struck a chord, the first part of that question.
Speaker 1: I said that was there anything that you learned about the F--you know I said the FBI or you know, the other--was that the FBI?
Speaker 2: You asked me about any cases, major cases that I handled.
Speaker 1: Right, any cases.
Speaker 2: And, and what comes to mind that I tried a narcotics case against two of Chicago's [Illinois] finest criminal defense lawyers.  I was twenty-six years old.  And I worked that case like a slave.  I had my witness in my office preparing him for days.  And by the time we got on trial, it came off just perfectly.  And I had those lawyers pulling their hair out.  And then when I would come in in the morning, "Good morning Mr. So-and-so."  I would overhear 'em say "the son of a bitch."  I, I have a great memory of that case.
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: The late Charles Bellows and Jack Cogan [ph.].  Really fine lawyers.  I learned a lot from both of them.  Charlie was a born actor who had even gone to acting school to prepare himself to be a trial lawyer.  So it was a, it was a real important case for me in terms of my experience.
Speaker 1: So the, the, the community--you're--this is all in building your reputation in many ways.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean this whole thing, okay.  And did you--so let me ask you.  Is the, is the U.S. Attorney's Office--'cause I remember the interview with William, [HM] William Sylvester White, and he spoke very fondly of his time there.  Is there a equalizing?  You're not sort of shunted as black person, you weren't sort of shunted aside, you know.
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  We were--we, we were fairly independent.  We had our own case load.  I mean I, I had no difficulty at all in my relationships with the other lawyers in the office.  My only recollection is when I would go to some of the senior lawyers to get some advice, and when I would go to Jim Parsons, he would talk to me endlessly and I, you know "I got it, that's okay."  He'd keep going with me, you know.  So I would duck out on him frequently and go somewhere else.
Speaker 1: He was trying to mentor you and make sure you--
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Be totally thorough and complete, you know, don't miss anything.
Speaker 1: So now you--the usual stint is about two or three years, right?
Speaker 2: At time it was.  Not anymore.  I think now people use it as a career; people stay there as long as ten years or 15, some 20.  But at that time it was like two to three years.
Story_ID: 76224
Speaker 1: And then you decide, what, to go out on your own at this point [1960s].  You feel--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that--was that a decision or did you ever think about going back to, you know--well Ro--Rogers had change--the, the partnership had changed at that point.  Or was it the same, was it--
Speaker 2: I'm almost certain that [HM John] Rogers [Sr.], [HM Earl] Strayhorn and [Raymond] Harth were still intact.
Speaker 1: Jewel [HM Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious] had left.
Speaker 2: Jewel had left.  Jewel was just a nominal partner anyway during my time.  But I had no thoughts of going back there because they were at a place where they had already hired a young lawyer quote/unquote, to take my place.  And I just wanted to go out into the practice and get my teeth you know, get my feet wet.
Speaker 1: You know before we leave, do you have any anecdotes about you know, either Rogers or Strayhorn or the, the other, the third one.
Speaker 2: Harth.
Speaker 1: Harth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Rogers was a guy who believed that a lawyer who charged fees that enabled him to earn more than a highly paid steelworker was stealing from the client.  Earl Strayhorn was a charming person who you know, sort of taught me a little bit of how to win friends and influence people, jurors and so forth.  He was a tremendous trial lawyer.  Raymond Harth taught me pleading in the old fashioned way.  It was a, an art at that time that you used the, the lessor and the lessee and the this--ee and the that--ee, and you always used legalisms.  And I had to unlearn all of that when it became clear that the new way was to keep things simple and plain and not use lawyer talk.  But he was a great guy at lawyer speak and lawyer write.
Speaker 1: Do you know how the--how they had come together as a, as a, as a, as a firm?  Do you know that history?
Speaker 2: Jack and--Jack Rogers and Earl Strayhorn had been probably in the [United States] Army together.  I think they were part of the Tuskegee Airmen or something like that.  I know that they were militarily related to each other.  Jack and, and Jewel went to law school at the University of Chicago together.  And I don't know how Raymond fit in that picture, except he was very bright and one of those people that anybody would pick up.
Speaker 1: These are really--what, what we have to understand is these are sort of the creme de la creme coming out of the best schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's probably right, yeah.  These were guys who were really well educated, and who prepared themselves well for, for the profession. Where other people may have been in the neighborhoods, you know, or see maybe in politics more involved, right?
Speaker 1: Right, like Cecil Partee.  He was basically a politician instead of a lawyer, came out of a great law school, Northwestern [University School of Law].  Sidney Jones had come out of Northwestern Law School.  [HM R. Eugene] Gene Pincham had come out of Northwestern's law school and he was always a solo practitioner and primarily a criminal lawyer.
Story_ID: 76225
Speaker 1: Now when you went on your own, what--it's a different thing being out on your own even though, I mean you know that, you know being with U.S. Attorney's Office or being, you know, an associate with a small firm.  And I, and I'm just wondering what you learned about those 'cause you're actually running your own business at this point in time [1960s].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And, and it's one thing to, you know, be a good lawyer, it's another thing to balance, you know, the practice and billing and things like that.  I'm wondering, you know what were those--were you good at that?  You know did you find that you had to get good at it, you know?  Did you find it a hassle?
Speaker 2: Realistically, I had no notion about the business part of the law.  And paid very little attention to it.  And really did not get into trying to develop the law as a business probably until my 14th or 15th year.  I was busy having fun practicing law and tilting windmills and throwing bricks at the power structure.
Speaker 1: But let's, let's talk with it because you're come--you've come out of a power structure environment, you know and then you almost immediately go into you know, the other part of that.  And you know where you're on the other side.  And, and, and the thing about it is I would think that you have information.  It's not like you're throwing you know, windmills, you've seen the other side, which is a whole different thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering what are some of the, you know, cases that you took on?  This is prior to though, your work with, you know, any of the Black, you know from '60 [1960] to '64 [1964], that's before your time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's say from '60 [1960] to yeah, round '60 [1960] or '64 [1964], I started with the gang [Blackstone Rangers] and the [Black] Panthers probably '68 [1968], '69 [1969], right.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.  Okay so I'm just trying to understand what are the types of cases you're really taking on and what is also germinating in you?  Because this is the time of sort of change, you know, in the country.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know and then--you know the change had happened in the South.  This is around the time of the Voting Rights Act and things like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I'm just trying to understand, you know, what's the nature of your practice and what things are, you know in, in, in, you know, in, in forming you.  'Cause it's, you know, as a prosecutor, you know you go after people.  You know you're a crime buster.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well you, you, you remind of the experience in the U.S. Attorney's Office and my twenty months there what I really learned was that most of my colleagues, if not all of them, looked at the world as black and white.  And I found I was sort of out of place because I looked at it as gray.  So in moving from that environment, I learned how they thought in large part.  What are the cases that I took on?  Almost anything, and I had what an older lawyer told me recently, a wig practice, and that was whatever I got.  And I did real estate closings, I did misdemeanors, I did felonies, I would volunteer to represent people who had difficult and impossible cases.  I got involved in 1961, '62 [1962] in my first major lawsuit and suing the Chicago Board of Education in the federal court, challenging their de facto segregation of schools and the neighborhood school policy that required kids to go to school in their neighborhood.  And we managed to get some kind of a consent decree which was called the Havekurst [ph.] Plan adopted by the Board of Education's response to that lawsuit.  That did provide for some--this whole business where they start transporting students, etc.  But you know as, as time went on, it was like you--historically you look back at it and things got worse instead of better in terms of segregation and blacks going to black schools that were below standard.
Speaker 1: Now that--so you are--you become--you are, not that you weren't aware, but this is the whole thing of be--of seeing, how I want to phrase this, the inequities of, of living.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and also your ability as a lawyer to sort of effectuate change or not effectuate change.
Story_ID: 76226
Speaker 1: That, that segregation case, who, who brought that--how did you get that, or who came to you?
Speaker 2: There was a group of, of parents who had young children in school and I was just one of that group of parents.  And what we did, we had learned about a lawsuit that had been filed in New York [New York City, New York] by a law--black lawyer by the name of Paul Zuber.  And so we invited Zuber to Chicago [Illinois].  And Zuber and I filed a lawsuit on behalf of these families.  You remember the, the young woman who was in the Washington administration, whose last name is Williams?  Very light complected--can't remember her first name.  But anyway she was one of the kids at the time.  And her dad Bill Williams was a major domo in that, in that--organizing those parents.  And so they--that's how I got involved in it.  Later on Raymond Harth joined us as a part of that team.  And so it went from there to one time we got some people who came to the office who wanted to sue the Board of Education because they were full time substitute teachers who were not getting any fringe benefits, but who were hired year after year after year.  And so we filed a suit on behalf of the FTEs [Full Time Equivalent] we called them, and ultimately resolved that lawsuit by getting the Board to adopt a procedure for certifying those teachers if they had three years' consecutive satisfactory rating, I think that was the deal.  So that was the kind of thing that I did.  There was a lawyer who was indicted for setting up cases, I think it was, setting up accident cases.  And he had gone to trial and been convicted while all of the real thugs were acquitted.  And so he managed to get a new trial through a different lawyer.  And then I went and just begged him to let me retry the case for him for free.  And I did.  And worked it hard, worked him hard.  And took that case and, and won it.  And then that was really the kind of a challenge that I was dealing with.  I think I was probably operating from a base of insecurity and it sort of you know, I had to prove to myself that I could do some of these things.
Speaker 1: Now so you know it's--to hear you talk, it's, it so really so interesting because things have changed so dramatically.  It's almost hard to believe that people, though, you know the law profession is, is a service profession, that people would go in it you know and be, you know really wanting to hone their skill set, help people, be on the right side of cases.  And the, and the thing I'd just like you to put in perspective, this is before you know, Title VII and things like that.  People were vol--a lot of times you might take a case on just because it would give you either notoriety or it was the right thing to do.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.  When, when they--I think it was [President Lyndon B.] Johnson who came out and declared war on poverty and they started to fund legal services for poor people.  And my comment was we've been doing this for years.  And that's what we did, we, we serviced people who could ill afford to hire lawyers or to pay a compensable fee.  And, and again, it was--it came out of the period when Thurgood Marshall had been very much active for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and we had developed that notion of lawyers as social engineers, people trying to change things.  And in those young idealistic days, I was right on it.  That was where I was coming from in large part.  Money was not a major factor.
Story_ID: 76227
Speaker 1: Now did you--who were the, the people that you admired around that time, and what or--were you affiliated or had any time to be affiliated with any organizations?  Were you doing things, working within NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], were you--was there--
Speaker 2: You know I think in those days, I probably--I was very active in the Cook County Bar Association, which is the black bar, the National Bar Association, which is the national black bar.  In 1975 or so I became President of the Cook County Bar Association.  And was very active in trying to get the senators to appoint black judges to the district court.  And, and I remember we would--we had a campaigns and were actively involved in doing that.  And at some point we went to the press and tried to embarrass Senator [Charles H.] Percy into funding a qualified black candidate to nominate because year after year he said well I can't find anybody.  So after we took him to task, he found [HM] George Leighton and a Democrat.  He was a Republican, and appointed him.  So in terms of organizations, I was a part of a group headed by [HM] Bennett Johnson back in, in the middle, middle and late '50's [1950s], where we were young Democrats basically fighting the, the "Silent Six."  I mean at that time we had six African American aldermen and they were totally captivated by--I think then Mayor [Richard J.] Daley.  And it was a disgusting situation for us, and so we were constantly involved in efforts to try and get involved in independent Democratic politics.  At one point I was so disen--disenchanted, that I joined the Republican party.  And, and I think I even ran for judge as a Republican once in a, in a--we had the chance of a snowball in hell of getting elected.  But I had fun doing it.  It's hard to go back to those years and really recall exactly what I was doing on an extracurricular basis because it was all pretty much extracurricular for me.
Story_ID: 76228
Speaker 1: The Cook County Bar Association is really older than the National Bar--is it older than the National Bar Association?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember, but I think they started in 1911 or something like that [sic, 1914].
Speaker 1: Cook County.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the NBA [National Bar Association] may have come later, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What--can you just--since I, I'm trying to capture some, some things, but with the Cook County Bar Association, what was its role at that point in time and how active a organization was it then?
Speaker 2: Well I think it was, you know its role was as a place for black lawyers to go because the major local bar association, the Chicago Bar Association, had denied admission to blacks until about 1947.  And people like me who came along in 1956 said the hell with 'em.  They don't want you, I don't want them.  And there were a lot of black lawyers who were involved in the Cook County Bar Association basically sort of--I, I viewed it as a group that ought to be an activist group out there campaigning for us and that's basically what we did.  Although sometimes I got a little disgusted that all we were looking for was opportunities to be judges, we needed that, but we needed more in terms of the economics of the profession.  But I think we served a good function and my only regret was that when I was president [1975], they worked me so hard that I sort of ceased to be active after that.  But I had been active probably for almost twenty years.
Speaker 1: What were you wanting to--the organization to do besides you know, go after judgeships?  I mean what were the, the things that you thought would be good to do?
Speaker 2: Well I think you know the, the whole idea of trying to develop among African American lawyers, respect was, was one of my, my principle concerns.  I thought we ought to be doing seminars and training our young lawyers and that kind of thing.  We did--but our focus was pretty well--I mean when something happened, I must tell you when, when there were riots in the street, we did actively go out and bring our members to the courthouse and volunteer to represent the masses of people who had been the subject of mass arrest, conducted bond hearings and so forth.  During the '60's [1960s] when there were demonstrations, we got together as an association, put people into the, the milieu of that, that struggle.  And that I thought was, was, was what we ought have been doing and what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Now who was active in the organization when you were act--or when you were pres--you were president during what years?
Speaker 2: Probably '74/'75 [1974/1975].  Some of the old timers were [Zedrick] Zed Braden, Sr.; Sidney Jones, Sr.; Archie Weston; Jesus, James Harris; [HM] Glenn [T.] Johnson; Levi Morris, the old timers; [James A.] Jim Lemon, fine lawyer, Jesus; Lucia Thomas who recently died.  What was this lady's name, I can hear her, Gloria Wilson.  Many more that don't come to mind at the moment.
Speaker 1: Now you, are you saying you went from president of Cook County to president of the National Bar Association?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: I thought that was in '70 [1970]--
Speaker 2: In '75 [1975] I chaired the national convention.
Speaker 1: Okay, of the National--
Speaker 2: Of the National Bar, and at that time, I had an opportunity to become president 'cause I was very active in the politics, but I chose not to because I was getting to the point where I had to make a living and in a meaningful way as my family was growing.
Story_ID: 76229
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back.  I wanna ask one other question I should have asked, but the, the lawyer that--I just wanna get clarification that was at 100, it was 110 North LaSalle--who you said looked white.  Who was that?  Was that--
Speaker 2: At 100 North LaSalle, I wish I could think of his name, but I think it was Albert--I think his first name was Albert, but I can't think of his last name, but it's not someone that I knew or even had seen a photograph of.  But he--historically we were aware that he became a tenant in that office building because he was first an excellent lawyer with a good reputation, and he could pass for white.  Whether he did or not, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Was his client base--it, it was black or was it mixed?
Speaker 2: He was a black lawyer, so I would probably was, was more black than not, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now back to, okay--
Speaker 2: Chicago by the way, has always been a place where the law practice is segregated.  White folks go to white lawyers, black lawyer--black folks go to white lawyers with good cases, and the black lawyers with junk cases.  And that's been our, our plight.
Speaker 1: That is true.  I was gonna say, that is true, you know people would say well if want something, go to a white lawyer, you know.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 76230
Speaker 1: Now you were describing the "Silent Six," who were those?
Speaker 2: Oh, Jesus, that was Claude Holman of the fourth ward, there was Alderman [Robert] Miller from the sixth ward, there was [Kenneth] Kenny Campbell from the 20th ward, there was Alderman [William H.] Shannon from the 17th ward [alternate accounts name either Benjamin Lewis or George Campbell of the 24th ward instead of Shannon].  I've got about four of them I think.
Speaker 1: You had four, yes.
Speaker 2: There was [Ralph] Metcalf from the third ward, fourth ward, who was second ward?  Second ward was, Jesus, [William] Barnett came later.  Yeah it was--I can't remember who was from the second [William Harvey], but that would have been the Silent Five at least.
Speaker 1: But describe what they--you know why they were for pe--you know this is--
Speaker 2: Well, well bottom line was that they were nominated by the mayor [Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley].  They owed their getting on the ticket to the mayor.  The Democratic party controlled black politics.  [William L.] Bill Dawson was a master politician who believed that what you needed to get for black people was jobs.  And including political jobs.  And in order to get political jobs, you have to obey the master.  And all of those people who got nominated, got nominated by the master, owed their fidelity and loyalty to the master.  And they were very, very reluctant to and did not speak out on issues in the black community.  And it was really a great transformation when Ralph Metcalf got ticked off about how one of his close friends was treated, who I think had--was a doctor or a dentist or something, by the police.  And he went to the mayor to ask the mayor to do something about police brutality.  And the mayor just gave him short shrift.  And so he got ticked off and, and abandoned Mayor Daley and went out to hold public hearings on police brutality.  And the mayor of course immediately dumped him and named somebody else as a candidate against him for Congress.  And it was one of the first times that the black community came alive and voted against Mayor Daley's candidate, who was a fine qualified guy, but they voted for Metcalf because Metcalf was standing for the people.  So the, the "Silent Six," it was a disgusting thing for a young idealist coming up in Chicago [Illinois] to see that those--that represented our so-called leadership.
Story_ID: 76231
Speaker 1: And who was leading the charge, you know at those times of this or the young group, or you know, or the group that was sort of outspoken against the system?  Who were the players?  That's what I'm trying to--even older than you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm think about [Albert] Al Raby, I'm thinking about [Robert] Bob Lucas, I'm thinking about [HM Lutrelle] Lu Palmer.  And obviously [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson as a young man.  And there were a number of, of people who both younger than I and older than I, who were very much involved in, in, in trying to make a change.
Speaker 1: Okay what--can you just go a little more, you know, what was Al Raby doing and what was Lu Palmer doing at the time, and what was the role of PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] at the--you know what, was it Operation Breadbasket--
Speaker 2: Breadbasket, yeah.  I think, starting with Al Raby.  Al was a part of the Triple CO [CCCO], which was the Community Coordinating Council Organization [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] or something like that.  And he was the leader, titular leader of that group, along with another young man named Larry--can't think of Larry's last name.  But they basically were people who, who conducted marches and had demonstrations and who spoke out and made statements in the press about issues relating to, to us, especially issues of education and issues of speaking out against the "Silent Six."  Trying to elect candidates that were--would speak for us.  Then there was--who else did I mention beside Al Raby?
Speaker 1: You mentioned Lu Palmer, Lucas.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bob Lucas had his organization in the Kenwood/Oakland [Chicago, Illinois] community organization.  And Bob was also very instrumental in basically demonstrations and public demonstrations, looking for things for his community.  He and Al Raby were right there when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] brought his movement to Chicago.  They were right there with him.  And while the people like Ralph Metcalf at the time and the "Silent Six" were urging King to go home.  So it was a--even [HM] Dick Gregory.  I remember when Gregory would come here with Al Raby's CCCO organization, and they would go to Grant Park and just lay down until the police would come and pick him up and lock him up because they're blocking the streets and things like that.  And I remember going to court one day to volunteer to help the guys who'd been arrested, including Dick Gregory, and as we got into the room next to the lockup, you could hear Gregory loudly shouting "Tell those goddamn lawyers to go home; we're not leaving."  They're gonna stay there forever.  And that was sort of disappointing, but I guess I later came to understand it.  We're out here, going here, volunteering our own time and he's--tell those damn lawyers to go home.  But it was a, it was a time when I think for the first time the black community was starting to awaken and to sense that we might be able to have some influence and some power in the community.  And we had enough of the police brutality, enough of the Panther raids where they killed Fred Hampton.  The, the Black Panthers for instance was, was a group that was sort of fed up with the leadership that I just described because that leadership they thought was too Gandhi-like and, and they felt that you had to confront the pig and to defend your community and defend yourself with guns.  So I mean all of that, that whole period I thought was, was a great period in, in my younger life where--I mean I enjoyed seeing some, some--what I thought were some real changes going on.
Speaker 1: And when you think about it, it's really a ten year period.  I'm not--you know what I mean--a lot of activity occur, even from Martin Luther King to the Black Panthers.  You know the, that was--you know he became sort of like you say too Gandhi and old-fashioned.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But--
Story_ID: 76232
Speaker 1: I wanna go back.  I mean not go back but stay--what was--how did you come to be involved with the Blackstone Rangers?  How did that come about?  And then I wanna know your role with the Black Panthers.  But you know I mean--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But so you can--
Speaker 2: Yeah at some point in 1969 or early '70 [1970], I was involved for Deborah Johnson who was Fred's girlfriend and who bore his child, defending her at the--what was then the Coroner's inquest into the deaths of Fred Hampton and, and the shooting of the other Panthers.  And basically I was on the steps of the courthouse at 26th and California, ranting and raving in front of a TV camera on behalf of what was going on in the inquest.  And I saw these three guys standing around, and when the conference--press left, Jeff Fort walked up to me and he said "Hey Jim, you got a card?"  I said yeah, I gave him a card.  About a week or two later, five of the meanest young guys I'd ever seen came to my office and they sort of situated themselves in a semi-circle around me.  And one of them said to me, "Jim, we like you.  You seem to hate those motherfuckers the way we do."  So--and at that point they retained me to represent the "Main 21," which was the Board of Directors of the Blackstone Rangers, and they kept me busy as all get-out 'cause they were always in trouble.  From anything from murder to attempt murder, usually with guns, you know.  Rarely drugs at that time, but violence.
Speaker 1: And, and see to hear--well I mean 'cause Jeff Fort, he created this whole system, I mean really, of communication.  It took a long time, I mean later, you know, and from jail he was--
Speaker 2: Running his gang from the jail.
Speaker 1: From jail.  I mean yeah, I mean that was sort of a--they had a hard time breaking that.
Speaker 2: Had a code that he figured nobody would break, but what he forgot is that people do break and they tell 'em about the code.  You know after a while you can decode 'em, you know, decipher it.
Speaker 1: Right.  But at that time, also the Blackstone Rangers were--they weren't viewed the way, you know Jeff Fort later in jail became to be viewed as a gang.  I mean they were gangs, but they were, they were--it was a--it wasn't--
Speaker 2: It was a more benign gang.  It was the typical gangs that social workers talked about back in the old days that come from impoverished communities where there are no solid families together and these kids seek their comfort in, in groups.  And Jeff was probably one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met who had no formal education to speak of, and could neither read nor write, and never saw any need to do it until he got locked up in jail.  But he was, he was a master in leading people, both out of love and out of fear.
Story_ID: 76233
Speaker 1: And what were they [the Blackstone Rangers] saying they want to accomplish besides, you know, just getting back?  I mean what were they, what were they trying really to do for the community?  They had started with some, some pos--I mean was it clear the distinction between they and the Black Panthers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a distinction to the extent that they were not a political group, but they were a group that because they were so highly organized and disciplined, they were used by politicians and political, politically oriented people from [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson to you name 'em, they'd use the, the Blackstone Rangers to go and march around construction sites and shut 'em down until they would agree to hire some black people there.  But that wasn't really where they were coming from.  But they were used, again, by politicians that considered themselves later to have been used.  They were--there was a group of white liberals from the University of Wisconsin and the Presbyterian church that sought to harness this energy and organization and carry it to positive levels, but it never, never really was realized.
Speaker 1: They did have funding coming in, though, didn't they?  Did they--did the government ever try, you know, fund them or anything like that?  Did they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was a trick because the government funded the Blackstone Rangers to a tune of a million dollars one year and the objective of the funding was to have them develop teaching centers to teach their members how to do things like applying for jobs and so forth and so forth.  And they had to keep records and dot their i's and cross their t's and so the gang figured it this way was okay.  The Main 21, you get so much a week.  The other troops, they get so much a week.  And so that the government subsequently when they said they dissipated all this money.  And they indicted I think the whole Main 21 for fraud in terms of dissipating this million dollars without having the proper records and following the grant, terms of the grant.  And I'll never forget it.  I defended, of the 21 I think I defended about 17 or 18 of 'em and a couple of 'em like Mickey Cogwell may have gotten his own lawyer and--were very excellent lawyer.  And we had another one, and we won 17 out of those 21 cases before a jury because we, you know it was ludicrous to expect people who could not read and write, to manage a governmental program and to sustain the kind of audit that you might expect from sophisticated people.  And we, we took the position that of course the purpose of this egghead who had, who had suggested this idea, was to cut down on gang violence; they gave some to each gang.  And in fact gang violence did go down during that period.  So we were able to convince the jury that, you know, except for the, for the leaders, let these guys go, and they did.
Speaker 1: Was that your, your strategy behind the case?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What you're doing is you're trying to sell something that would be palatable to people who are jurors in the federal system, who come from all over, the 'burbs, conservative people largely.  And a few from Cook County.  And it, and it works, you know.
Speaker 1: And the jury in that case, were they all white or were they--were there--
Speaker 2: I can't tell you, but I can assure you that rarely were we able to get more than one black on any jury involving criminal charges against black people.
Speaker 1: Tell me, this whole thing, the Main 21.  Jeff Fort was clearly the leader, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they did--in your representation of them, were you ever concerned about some of their activities or things like that?  I know, you know, your position is to represent your clients.  But were you identifying with them, you know, philosophically?
Speaker 2: Well not really.  You know I think that if you're going to defend people, you don't judge them.  And I didn't judge them.  They, they did what they did and I defended them.  And, and so I never really got involved in, in being concerned for that matter about what they did.  And a lot of folks really thought I was a terrible person representing those gang bangers as, as probably the people who are most adversely affected by the gang were black people in the communities where they operated, and whose kids were you know, solicited for membership, rather forcefully sometimes.  And so I remember one time we had a, a jury trial of, of some of them on--I don't know whether it was a murder charge, it probably was a murder charge, murder of a policeman as a matter of fact.  And we had, we had one juror during the course of the jury selection process, we asked her a question.  "Would you, in the event that these men are convicted, would you consider the imposition of the death penalty?"  And she said, "No."  And we were tickled to death, this is good.  So as she was excused, she walked out saying "the death penalty is too good for 'em."  So we got a lot of that kind of feedback for being involved in representing the gangs.  On the other hand for me it represented an opportunity to challenge the justice system to be fair to people who were unpopular.  And that, that's what really was, what was driving me.
Story_ID: 76234
Speaker 1: Now do you remember how you felt--this is going back a, a few years before the--when Fred Hampton was, you know when he was killed [December 4, 1969].  You know when that all happened.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how you felt during that time?  You know because that was sort of a--that was a rallying cry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that I had been involved maybe from the time that the Panthers were incepted in representing for free on a volunteer basis, various members of the Black Panther party who had been charged with one crime or another.  And had really come to spend some time with and get to know Fred Hampton.  I mean I was one of the people in the audience when he was making his speech on the West Side church, or a South Side theater, and I was really--he, he was a great spellbinder and he was really a hero of mine.  So when he was killed, I mean I just headed straight to the courthouse to defend his folks, you know, and his, and his girlfriend [Deborah Johnson].  So it was, it was like a great loss, you know to me because I saw this man as being a tremendous leader into the future, who really was sincere, who had no selfish motives, who didn't hate anybody, he just hated injustice.  And he was prepared to lay his life on the line for it, as were the other Black Panthers.  And so I admired those people a great deal.  I was an old dog by that time, so I was sort of out of that ilk, but I was still had you know, great feeling and identification with them.
Story_ID: 76235
Speaker 1: Now who were the four that you, you represented besides him?  Who were the--was [HM] Bobby Rush one of them?
Speaker 2: I represented Bobby Rush in a gun case.  I represented--this one guy who's the head of an organization right now on 71st Street who I represented as one of the first Panthers I represented.  And I later learned from the counter-intelligence program records, that in each of these cases where I had volunteered to represent people, the Rush case, the case of the young man whose name I can't remember, these were all situations where the FBI, through the informant William O'Neal who was a Panther, Minister of Security or something, would set up these confrontations like between the Blackstone Rangers and the Panthers.  Or set up confrontations that would result in shootouts between the one gang and the Panthers.  And in each of these cases, it was the fallout from these events that led to Panthers being charged criminally.  And we learned later that that was all being manipulated and set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  So I, I had been involved with, with--I'm just trying to think of individual cases, but those two come to mind immediately.  And I remember trying Bobby Rush to a jury in Harvey, Illinois.  And when the--one of the jurors as she was take--as we were taking a recess, an old elderly white woman came by and she said, she said "Boy you're better than Perry Mason."  I said, "Well, maybe we got a chance."  And so when the jury came back, there was the foreman stood up, I knew we were in deep trouble.  The lone black juror who I think was a retired post office employee, which was the only type of juror they would--prosecutors would ever accept.  He stood up and read the guilty verdict.  Course that--it was difficult to figure out how he could do anything else because I guess Bobby had come from the place where they'd set up the shootout.  Everybody'd been armed to their teeth in two cars that came from the West Side to, to Robbins [Illinois].  And the shootout was going full blast when they realized that there was Panthers shooting at Panthers.  And by that time one of the cars had its tires shot out from 'em, and so when they--when the police came, first they left to go get reinforcement because they were outnumbered, the local police. FBI called the police.  FBI got one set of Panthers to think that the other guys are gangbangers.  So Fred [Hampton] takes off 'cause he's got to be in court on his ice cream case the next morning.  And he walks all the way back to Chicago [Illinois].  Bobby takes off across a field, armed with a .45 in a holster in his shirt, in his coat.  And he sees this man leaving his home at four or 5:00 in the morning, dark.  The man's on his way to work.  He says, "Can you give me a ride to--you got a phone, let me make a phone call?"  "I don't have a phone."  He says "Well, why don't you give me a ride over to the closest public phone," and he sort of showed his gun.  And the man put him in the car, drove him straight over to the Harvey Police Department, which didn't look like a police department.
Story_ID: 76236
Speaker 1: He [HM Bobby Rush] got in the car and he was taken directly to the--
Speaker 2: To the police station where he went into the police station and there's a public phone in the, in the police station.  And so as he picks up the phone to put to his ear, the Chief of Police looks over there and says "That's a gun."  And he says, "That's Bobby Rush," and he immediately arrested him.  And of course you only need, you only needed to be in possession of a weapon on or about your person, period.  And so they, they had him.  But we went to trial anyway to try and see what we could do with him.
Speaker 1: And you--was he--wasn't that where he was declared guilty?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the same case.
Speaker 1: Same case, and then what happens after?  Do you, do you get--does he do time or does he--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think he did time on that.  I think that--I don't even remember whether he was sentenced, but I don't think he did any time on that, no.  Or if he did it was very little, you know.
Story_ID: 76237
Speaker 1: Okay.  When we were--I, I want to start out by slating it.  My name is Julieanna Richardson.  I'm the interviewer and Scott Stearns is the videographer and I want you to state your name again for us, just spell it and today's date.
Speaker 2: I'm James D. Montgomery, J-A-M-E-S, D Period, M-O-N-T-G-O-M-E-R-Y, and today is February the 25th, 2003.
Speaker 1: And the location?
Speaker 2: 1900 South Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 76238
Speaker 1: When we last talked, actually you know when we got together, you were talking about your representation of the [Black] Panthers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, we've got a ways to go. And you know the, the--you know how there was actually this wonderful story you told about [HM] Bobby Rush and you know and him going to--you know being involved in a gun shootout and going to the, you know the station.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know him making a call and they realizes that it's him and then he gets picked up, get him off.  And you also talked about you worked with Fred Hampton, you know, and the role you played there.  I'd like to just sort of start at that point and ask you if there's any other stories about your role, even with representation of the Panthers or representation of, of the Blackstone Rangers.  You know 'cause you talked a lot--
Speaker 2: Yeah I think that one of the highlights of that period was the Black P. Stone Nation [formerly the Blackstone Rangers].  We represented the Board of Directors, or the Main 21.  And there were indictments flowing regularly with all of them, and so there was trial after trial after trial.  One of the most significant ones was at some point I think the Gang Intelligence Unit of the Police Department was being really abusive toward those kids and they got ticked off.  And one night as the Chief Gang Unit officers were driving through the alley behind the Southmoor Hotel, which is at 67th and Stony Island [Avenue], a shot rang out and one of the officers seated in the back seat of the car was shot and killed, shot in the back.  Immediately the Gang Unit and Police Department surrounded and rounded up everybody at the headquarters of the group on 67th Street and took 'em all in and start questioning them and so forth.  And during the course of all these interrogations, I would get calls indicating what had happened to people when they were in police custody.  People were, were being hung out the window, you know by their ankles.  People were being typewriter ribbon--bags were being placed over their heads.  Some of them were--had their heads doused in toilets.  And in, and one particular individual gave a long detailed statement implicating members of the Black Stone Nation.  And he got out and of course he must have contacted the leadership and told them what had happened.  And sure enough they arrested him again and he gave a different story.  By the time the trial came along, he had given four different stories to the police as to what had happened, and he had given me a story about what had happened in my office, and they were all different.  The one he gave me of course exonerated everyone.
Story_ID: 76239
Speaker 1: And so we had this trial involving about seven of them as I remember.  And in the course of the trial, the principal evidence against the individuals was this individual who had given these conflicting statements.  So we had a tailor made situation to challenge the credibility of the major witness.  During the course of the trial, I think one of the officers was telling a story about his investigation and he was saying "and I shined the light in this dark alley."  Turned out that indeed there was a huge lamp over that area and even his credibility was challenged.  So at the conclusion of the case, we had 12 jurors and two alternates.  The last alternate was a, an African American who we had simply accepted without questioning him because he was black and we figured he wouldn't get involved in the case anyway.  Sure enough, the jury went out, let's say on a Thursday night.  That jury was out until Sunday at noon.  We later learned that the jury--this, this individual had become a member of the jury because of others being excused for one reason or another.  We learned that the jury had voted after the first night for acquittal eleven to one, and that that man held out until Sunday at noon because he, he knew the gang and he hated them.  And--but they--ultimately he gave in and they were acquitted.  One of the--that was one of the interesting cases in the Blackstone Ranger days.
Speaker 2: What was the name of that case?
Speaker 1: That must have been the Alfano case.  The officer was Officer [James] Alfano, and the defendants was the leadership of the Black Stone Nation, including a young man who was then sixteen, who during the course of the case, they were trying to induce him to testify against his fellows.  And so they--in order to ingratiate themselves with them, the state allowed the judge to let him out on bond.  Well sure enough the first thing he did when he got out on bond was to come and ask me if he could borrow ten dollars.  And I says for what?  He says I wanna enroll in school over at Hyde Park.  Well my--I think at that time my new wife [Pauline Montgomery] was so taken that she sort of took this young man under her wings and he became a member of our family, virtually, for the next umpteen years, and ultimately got in college and finished college.  So it was an interesting period.
Speaker 2: What year are we talking about was Alfano?
Speaker 1: Alfano was 196--1970 I think was the year that he was killed, and the trial must have been in '71 [1971], '72 [1972]-ish, around there.
Story_ID: 76240
Speaker 1: Now I'd like you just to put this time in historical context and also describe how your career is really shaping up.  Because you were now having gained quite a bit of notoriety, you know, I mean you have these--you're, you're representing these sort of controversial characters.  You're representing in a city [Chicago, Illinois] where, you know, we have, you know Mayor [Richard J.] Daley you know who is concerned.  You have also at a time when the federal government is trying to sort of quash you know or deal with unrest in the cities.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know and at that time also there are--the federal government is trying to put money into the cities to, you know in terms of programs.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering if you could--
Speaker 2: Well that was a period of, you know, for me where I think everything that we touched was right on the leading edge of the news, you know.  And you mentioned that the federal government put money into the community.  That was one of the things they did with the Blackstone Rangers, or the Black P. Stone Nation and the Black Disciples.  They gave them money to develop job programs and of course these folks didn't have the sophistication of training their members on how to apply for a job, etc.  And so they just split up the money depending upon their ranks.  So the government promptly indicted them for not dotting their i's and crossing their t's and spending the money in accordance with plan.  So they indicted about 20, 21 of them.  And I think they convicted three or four out of, out of the 21, and 17 the jury acquitted because of the very argument.  You can't put these people in a position where you expect them to behave like folks who have a Ph.D. or even a high school degree, and then punish them because they don't get the paperwork in accordance with "government regulations."  You wanted them to have money so that they would stop extorting the local businesspeople.  And that, that purpose was accomplished because they got a few bucks and they didn't have to do that.  So that was sort of the approach.
Speaker 1: Did you have any, any forces that you were concerned bout in terms of you know the work that you were doing and did you feel like--were there any people trying to pressure you politically?  I mean like the established--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there were a lot of folks who you know, really wondered why were you representing those kinds of people, this kind of thing.  But really I was so dedicated a defense lawyer, that you know my notion was that everybody is entitled to a defense, no matter whether he did it or did not.  The burden is on the people to prove their guilt, etc.  And besides, I was fighting my own personal demons, you know, and, and war was, was my mode.  It was a comfort feeling.
Speaker 1: Now I have a question.  Just because he just died, but [HM Holmes] Daddy O'Daylie at that time, did you come across him at all?  Because he--was it around that time that he also went after the [Black] Peace Stone [Nation], you know was--
Speaker 2: I don't remember that involvement, but he was around during those years, and I don't remember what his relationship was with the P. Stone Nation.  But interestingly, one of their good friends was Sammy Davis, Jr.  Sammy Davis, Jr. was--met with them when he was in town and he provided them with funding.  Very interesting relationship.  I don't know the total parameters of it, but he supported them financially.  And mind you, they had the, the--what do I call it?  They had the pretense of being a legitimate organization through the First Presbyterian Church I think it was over in, over in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] where the priest over there sort of allowed them to make that place their home and theoretically was trying to divert their activity to non-criminal areas.
Story_ID: 76241
Speaker 1: Now was there, was there any tension between the Black Panthers, you know and, and the [Black] P. Stone Nation, or were they coming together at that point in time?  I'm just wondering--
Speaker 2: I think that they sort of had their own persona, their own objectives and, and I don't think they were coming together.  But I think what happened was the federal government had a counterintelligence program, and a part of that program was to pit the P. Stone Rangers against the Panthers, and the Panthers against the P. Stone Rangers.  And in that process what they would do, they would have anonymous letters sent to Fred Hampton, or an anonymous letter to sent to Jeff Fort indicating that one or the other had said something threatening about the other.  I told you about the confrontation that they created in Robbins, Illinois.  And they had a number of events and communications like that, that were designed to have them at war with each other.  And occasionally they did cause them to meet and at least talk about the war, and then they arrested everybody who had a gun.
Speaker 1: Now were you aware of this counterintelligence activity at the time?  I mean really aware, or was it really afterwards that--
Speaker 2: Totally afterwards.  We had no idea that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was masterminding much of what we were involved with when they would be arrested for carrying guns, largely.
Story_ID: 76242
Speaker 1: Now who were your counterparts?  Were there other people, Mr. Montgomery, at the time that you were--that were in the trenches with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was, there was a number of lawyers that were involved.  The People's Law Office [PLO], which was basically an office of Caucasian, mostly middle class kids who came out of college with the socialist point of view.  And they basically adopted the Black Panther party and other radical groups, whether they were Hispanic or otherwise.  And basically represented them for free.  There was the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] had a Baldwin project and Kermit Coleman was their front person who did a lot of defense of activists and largely activists versus gang, gang members because the gang members, they paid their fees.  But as, as, as little as the fees turned out to be.  But there were people out there who, like myself, were involved in defending the Black Panthers.
Story_ID: 76243
Speaker 1: And the National Bar Association, was it active at that time, or were you active with it?  Maybe that's one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was active with the National Bar probably up through 1975, and at around that time I was the President of the Cook County Bar Association.  And I was sort of in line to become the president of the National Bar Association, but my resources had been so crimped by the year and a half I spent as heading the Cook County Bar, that I chose not to, to proceed with it.  And I think from that point on, I--they, they were, they were not really active, quote/unquote, in the so-called Civil Rights Movement.  But they were a very important part of, of my life and career.
Speaker 1: You mean the National Bar wasn't.
Speaker 2: National.
Speaker 1: But the Cook County Bar was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cook County Bar was because whenever there was anything that happened in terms of mass arrests, we would always convene a group of lawyers to go in and volunteer to represent the individual who were involved in demonstrations.
Speaker 1: Can you talk, just as someone who's active--who was active in that organization, just provide some historical, you know, information about it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think the Cook County Bar was formed probably around 19, early 1900s.  And it was formed because there was no admission to the Chicago Bar Association, Illinois State Bar Association.  Those were basically closed shops for black lawyers.  So it was formed because of that situation.  Probably it--through 1947 when the Chicago Bar Association first admitted a black lawyer.  It was the pretty much exclusive place that black lawyers could go to deal with their common interests.  And it always was a group that sort of dealt with issues in the, in the, in the African American community.
Speaker 1: Now did you get involved with the--did you become a member when you first got out of law school and was practicing, or was it a little later?  And then when were you really active with it?
Speaker 2: I was active basically from the time I finished law school to the time that I ceased being active in about 1975.  So I was active over 20 years, 19, 20 years.
Speaker 1: And can you describe that period of time?  What were the things that were really sort of accomplished during that time?
Speaker 2: I would say probably one of the biggest thrusts that we had was trying to induce the politicians to appoint a black federal judge.  We accomplished that with a lot of pressure and a lot of patience and a lot of--I think the last, the straw that broke the camel's back was when Senator [Charles H.] Percy was the, was the senator who nominated a judicial candidate had promised us at least two to three times that he was going to name a black to the bench as soon as he was able to find one who was "qualified."  So at the point where in probably 1975 when he nominated two Caucasians for the bench on two vacancies, we were at our wit's end.  And so we called a press conference and we did the best we could to tarnish his so-called liberal image.  And probably within a matter of--well it was the next appointment, the very next appointment, he found a qualified black who happened to be a Democrat, and put him on the bench, and that was [HM] George Leighton.  We already had [James] Jim Parsons on the bench and that had been accomplished through the good graces of [Chicago Mayor] Richard J. Daley.  Daley was very much impressed with, with Jim, and made him a judge.  So we had our second federal judge.  And of course since then of course things have improved a great deal and we've got others.
Story_ID: 76244
Speaker 1: Now I also want you to put in context--'cause lawyering has changed a lot and also the days you know, you weren't making a lot of money during those days.  I mean we have to--
Speaker 2: There's no question about that.  I've got several witnesses.
Speaker 1: But another important thing was happening, also, in hindsight.  You were really--I mean people say that there's nothing like criminal law to really hone your, your skills as a litigator.  And I wish, you know I'd like you to sort of comment on that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that criminal law is a--it offers an opportunity to get skilled in fighting a tough case with, with a short stick.  In other words, you have no resources, you have no money to pay investigators, you have limited money in, in legal fees that you get for your work, and you have the power of the state against you.  So that knowledge of the rules of evidence, knowledge of dispositive motions to get rid of cases on technicalities is very critical.  And you also have an intensity of trial work because the cases just come one after another.  So you develop a wide experience in various kinds of issues, whether they be medical issues, ballistics, that kind of thing.  So it really gives you a, an opportunity to hone your skills.
Speaker 1: Now what, what were some of the--why, why do you think you were, you were so good at winning cases?  Is it your--I mean what--did you learn any lessons early on, you know, were you--was it your being, you know, methodical?  I mean because these were not popular things, you know, you know and the prosecutors would have a lot of resources on their side.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering--
Speaker 2: Well the answer really was, was really thorough preparation.  I did not, I did not have any trust in my government and therefore I was very careful and circumspect in preparing my cases thoroughly in advance.  And then the--over time you develop what I would call scenes that can speak to people that sometimes override the miniscule facts that are involved in a case.  There are, you know there are things that you focus on in developing a theory of defense that is both legally viable and factually viable.  And I should put it this way.  If the--if you find that there is evidence--first you must know what evidence must be presented in order to convict your client.  And in order to--then you look at what of that evidence can I suppress because it was illegally seized?  So you then take away a layer of evidence that they have.  Then you, you look at it and you say here is a witness I can't suppress.  If they believe him, my client is dead in the water.  So you work at developing facts to challenge his credibility on cross-examination.  Again, your, your, your theory of, of defense is that that witness is lying.  You got rid of some evidence that would have hurt you so that, that gets rid of that.  And then you try and, and, and demonize the prosecution.  Demonize the witness for the prosecution and, and try and make your client in a light before the jury that he is really somebody who is a subject for sympathy or otherwise a good guy.  So you make a lot of, lot of methods you use, but that's basically where I came from.
Speaker 1: So a lot of your time was spent at 29th and California.
Speaker 2: Twenty Sixth and California.
Speaker 1: Sorry, 26th and California, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And did you learn also were there lessons you learned about dealing with the prosecution, or just you know, I mean those things, you know those, those aspects of really trying a case or people that were, you know, I mean whether it was certain judges that were the wrong judges or, you know--
Speaker 2: You learned your judges.  You learned the skills of your prosecutors.  I had the misfortune or good fortune of being one who didn't believe in pleading people guilty, so I didn't develop the kind of relationships so that I could go and make a deal.  And those--that was not where I came from.  I, I went--people hired me to try the case and if they didn't, I would try and figure out a way to try the case.  And frequently of course when you lose, in those cases your client really got hit hard and so those were--that were some of the disadvantages of that approach.  But largely what I did was to try cases 'cause that's what I like to do.
Story_ID: 76245
Speaker 1: At this point in time, you're on your own, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In your own firm [James D. Montgomery and Associates], okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But remember how you said the--one of the first times when you were first practicing and you saw someone who you respected and how he was treated by the--did you--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: The judge and that that embarr--you know, some--what was his name?  You had a high respect for him and then you were like you know, the way he was treated and you didn't want to be--
Speaker 2: Did I give you his name?
Speaker 1: You did, okay but anyway I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: In any event, he was, he was a--sort of a pillar in the Cook County Bar Association and the community.  And he had come up at a time when the way to get over was to be obsequious and to come across like Algonquin Jay Calhoun [from "The Amos 'n' Andy Show"].  And that was, that was really--to me that was sickening.  You know if I gotta have--behave that way, I don't want, you know, what the judge has to offer.  And, and that was a major motivating factor.  I even saw that in the first day I walked into the courtroom and the lawyers who were representing this man who was himself a, a distinguished lawyer, were just insulted.  And they just let it go by.  And I decided that that's no way to, to live and that's no way to practice a profession that is supposed--that they taught me in law school was a noble profession.  That was an ignoble way to be in it and I chose not to be in it that way.
Speaker 1: So you were really in many ways an ideologue, but also able--you, you know you were winning cases to allow you to be that way, to cont--I mean you had the skill sets.  And nothing--and you were winning cases.
Speaker 2: But I think the skill sets came from being in ideologue.  I wanna fight this system that is being you know, unjust to, to the people that they serve.  And I suppose at one point I tried a case when I came out of the U.S. Attorney's Office [1960] and I, I tried a case before a judge, a bench trial.  And the judge found everybody guilty, about six or seven kids.  My kid was no more guilty than I was.  And the judge sort of took a social worker's approach.  Well they were all in the car, so they're all guilty.  And from that point on, I mean my head, my head told me "He's a fascist, don't trust him.  Take a jury."  And from that point on I tried jury case, after jury case, after jury case.  And one case for 39 cents Nestle's candy bar in a theft case.  And--but that was the, the, the crazy way that I went about learning the business.
Story_ID: 76246
Speaker 1: Let's, let's take ourselves back to 19--you know, in the 1970s.  I'd like you to just touch upon anything that, you know, was significant.  I know that you were active with you know, Cook County Bar Association and you became--you served as president how many years?
Speaker 2: Year and a half.
Speaker 1: A year and a half.  What was that, from--
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974]/'75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Five, okay.  But is there anything else in terms of your career and development that were important there, or any case that was important during that time period or any case that you may have regretted taking?
Speaker 2: Well I, I, I guess you know it's hard to go back to that period.  I know that was the period where in '76 [1976] and '77 [1977], the 18 month [Black] Panther civil trial went on and that took up a big chunk of, of, of my life.  And during that period of time I probably tried a couple of federal criminal cases.  I had started doing some civil work in the middle and late '70's [1970s] really for the first time because I had done pretty much, except for the first years, mostly criminal work up through probably the late '70's [1970s].  And it was in the late '70's [1970s] that I started taking on civil defense cases.  Took on cases for the railroad, Amtrak and Conrail [Consolidated Rail Corporation].  Probably defended them for about two or three years.
Story_ID: 76247
Speaker 1: During all of that time, my personal time was largely spent trying fairly major federal criminal cases.  I remember during the late '70s [1970s] one of the cases that I tried was for a man who was accused of using a stolen tractor and trailer in interstate commerce.  And this man was a uneducated man.  But when the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] had approached him after they seized the vehicles in Ohio and found the numbers, serial numbers filed off and the confidential numbers showing that they were stolen.  When they came to talk to him about it, he said I bought that car in Mississippi.  I bought it from a white man and he drove it up here to Chicago [Illinois] and I paid him every month.  He'd come by and I'd pay him.  And he'd give me a receipt.  To make a long story short, the FBI didn't ask him "Well let me see your receipts."  And of course he had the receipts.  And in the course of the trial on cross-examination of the FBI, we made them look like idiots.  And at some point he had a lady who had signed the bill of sale as a notary.  I asked him "Where is she?"  He says, "I, I, I think she been, she dead."  And then finally he said, "I found her finally."  He said, "She's living up on the second floor on 84th and Drexel, and she's in a--in bed.  Her legs are all drawed up and she had a big bubble around her and they have to take it off for her to say a few words and then put it right back on her so she can breathe.  So she can't come to court."  So sure enough on--when I put him on the stand to testify as to who notarized the title and, and asked him "When is the last time you saw this lady?"  He says "last night."  I said, "Describe to the jury what you saw."  And he described in detail this lady was all--with her legs all drawed up and she's in this big plastic bubble.  And, and so finally the next morning when we came into court, jury was in the box and I was sitted at coun--seated with counsel table with my client.  And sure enough the FBI walked this crippled lady into the courtroom with a stick.  As she passed by, she said "morning Mr. Jones".  And I was absolutely bowled over.  But I kept my, you know, poker face.  The lady got up and testified, "Yeah I know, I know him.  He came to the house.  There wasn't, there wasn't no white man with him."  You know so, you know we--there's a rule whenever a witness hurts you, ya gotta cross-examine the witness.  I had no idea what I was gonna ask this lady.  So I said to her, "Mrs. So-and-so.  How old are you?"  She said, "60, I mean 78" or something like that.  I said I have no more questions.  I got her to make a mistake on her age, and I just got--sat down.  So to make a long story short, the jury ultimately found him not guilty.  And I got a call from one of the jurors.  He said, "Mr. Montgomery, did--weren't you upset when that witness came in?"  I says, "I sure was."  He said, "Well it sure didn't look like it."  I says, and that, "and I'm glad that worked out that way because that's what I was trying to do is to keep a poker face."  But I was bowled over because I didn't realize that he had lied to me, and he had, you know.  But that was one of the things I remember about that time.
Story_ID: 76248
Speaker 1: Then I think in 1979 I decided that I wanted to try and at least make some transition into doing plaintiff civil work, personal injury cases.  And as, as one would have it, I picked the worst two cases to, to start with.  One was a young man who had gone out to the suburbs with one of his white criminal friends, and they had had some disagreement over a dope deal.  And of course my guy had his gun with him.  And when he met his, his white adversary out there, there were five or six people shooting at him and of course he got, he got under a car and started shooting back.  They called the police, and when the police came they saw this black guy out here in a white neighborhood under a car with a pistol and they riddled him with bullets until he was paralyzed.  So I mean of course he said "I wasn't shooting at the police, I was shooting at the other guys."  So we tried that case and lost it.  The jury went out for two days, I had two black jurors who held out, then they gave in.  The next one was a Caucasian young man who had been in a dispute with his wife.  And she had put him out of--she had left home.  He had gone to her parents' home and he came--when they put him out, he came back, got all upset and he was in his home.  And the police were called because he was raising sand and the music was loud.  And when they came he was so irate that he had a, a hunting bow and arrow.  And he had it in his living room poised at the officers through his window.  Now the window's closed.  So one of the officers just blew him away with a shotgun.  And we managed to get a jury to find the individual officers guilty of excessive force, but find the village not guilty.  So because the dollars that these officers made at that time was probably twenty thousand a year, the jury found each of them liable to the extent of twenty thousand dollars or a total of sixty thousand dollars for the death of a person, which was at that time, not a lot of money.  So we ended up not only having to get short money, but there's a statute that authorizes you to get legal fees for your time when you're defending someone for a civil rights violation.  So we asked for our fees and the judge ruled that because they had offered us an amount of money that was equal to or greater than the sixty thousand dollars, we couldn't recover anything after that offer.  So we took that to the Supreme Court of the--to the Seventh Circuit and they ruled in favor of us.  To the Supreme Court of the United States, they reversed the Seventh Circuit and as I said, we screwed up the law for plaintiff's lawyers in civil rights cases forever.  So that was one of the key cases that I was involved with then.
Speaker 2: What, what was the name of that case, and what did the Supreme Court--what, what were the--what did they rule, rule on?  I mean--
Speaker 1: There is a statute that basically says that if the plaintiff or the defendant, I'm sorry, makes an offer of judgment in favor of the plaintiff prior to trial, and the plaintiff ref--does not accept that offer.  If the judgment ultimately obtained is less than or not greater than, the amount of the offer, then all cost and attorney's fees associated with the case that the plaintiff incurs cannot be recovered going forward.  And our issue was probably limited to the question of whether that offer of judgment quite, was in inclusive of attorney's fees.  And the court ultimately said it sure was.
Story_ID: 76249
Speaker 1: Now at this--how did you get Amtrak as a client?  You said you were doing--how did--because in 1977 you, you joined--became Montgomery and Holland.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And at that time--
Speaker 1: Was that, was that--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Was that at that time was it because you were coming off of the, the Black, the Panther case [Hampton v. Hanrahan] or--
Speaker 2: Probably had nothing to do with it.  I had been pretty much a solo practitioner with a couple of associates working for me, and then when I partnered up with Holland, it was to enable us to have a larger shop and to accommodate civil defense work.  And I had had a classmate in law school whose firm handled the bulk of that work.  And they were at that time trying to involve some minority lawyers and he recommended me.
Speaker 1: Now but was--how did the, the--were you looking strategically at-- I mean you had a lot of notoriety, you know.  But are--was it the plaintiffs, you realized that that paid more?  You know that there was potential more payout for plain--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was no question about it.  It, it--criminal law simply was not a profitable business for the best of African American lawyers.  And the reason basically is that the people who come to you are largely African Americans, and largely unable to afford to pay substantial legal fees.  And then those African Americans who had you know, serious resources, were as many of us are today, victims of the slave mentality who believes that the way you, that you know if you, if you're in real trouble, you get a white lawyer and if you're in real--if you're real sick, you get a white doctor.  Or as one minister told one of the victims in this tragedy that recently occurred, "and go find yourself a good Jewish lawyer."  And that, that sort of where that came from and why we work in the situation that we were in.  On the other hand, black people got involved in accidents.  Black people got killed in accidental situations.  And if you could get into that arena, you'd at least have an opportunity to make larger fees.  Problem with that though was that in order to be successful as a plaintiff's lawyer and a personal injury lawyer, you had to have the ability to finance the cases.  And so that that impediment still leaves to this very day many African American lawyers unable to handle the more substantial cases.
Speaker 1: Well that's a, that's an interesting point.  People don't, you know think or hear about that very much, you know.  'Cause those cases, you don't get--you have to fund them the whole time.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Some of those cases you can spend you know, in excess of 100 thousand dollars on those cases.  We just concluded one where the cost ran up to about 127 thousand dollars.  You can--but your typical case may be 15 thousand dollars.  But if you have a caseload, that turns out into big dollars.  And probably the, the biggest problem is that you know, if you're an African American lawyer, you're not likely to get a banker to bankroll you.  If you are a white lawyer, you are likely to get a banker to bankroll you.  Today I can get banks to bankroll me only because I don't need it, you see.  I went in partnership with a couple of Jewish guys in '66 [1966].  My God, they just walked over to the bank and said "This is what we need to fully furnish the office and have a few bucks to start out."  "Sign your name and you have the money."  It does make a difference in terms of your ability to handle those cases if you can't fund them.
Story_ID: 76250
Speaker 1: Were things that you learned in terms of your development as a lawyer and your representation of Conrail [Consolidated Rail Corporation] and Amtrak that, you know as a plaintiff's lawyer?  I'm just wondering, that were different from you know, the things you had done on the criminal system.  You definitely had your procedure down.
Speaker 2: Right.  Keep in mind that the defense of a civil case certainly helps you in you know, doing what a plaintiff's lawyer must do.  But as I say, a trial is a trial.  And I don't care if you're defending or if you're, if you're the plaintiff.  The plaintiff, you've got to bring the evidence forward and have the burden of proof.  The defense in civil case, you also have to bring forward evidence and you also have to prove your defense.  So it's, it's six in one hand, half a dozen in the other.  And I think one experience certainly aids in the other.
Speaker 1: But you didn't have any issues, any clients who, you know, 'cause you're dealing with corporate clients who said you know, you've been handling down the, you know these criminal cases.  It was none of that?
Speaker 2: None of with--as far as the railroad was concerned, they loved me.  I mean I could lose a case and, and, and for a million dollars and they thought I'd had a hell of a victory because I guess I did because they're a very unpopular defendant.  And they regularly sustain large verdicts.
Story_ID: 76251
Speaker 1: Now why did you go back on your own after, you know four years of Montgomery and Holland.  Was it just--are you a lone wolf sort of type guy, or was it-just the dealing in a partnership situation or--
Speaker 2: You know I really have not been a good partner, to be candid with you.  I have had, I had had at that time one, two, that was my third partnership.  And I believe that after that partnership, the only one I got after that was the one I'm in now [Cochran, Cherry, Givens, Smith and Montgomery].  And it is not so bad because I--my partners are in other cities.  And I'm, and I still run the shop here.  And I suppose that a good part of, of that has to do with a perception that you know, I just needed somebody who would work as hard as I worked.  I, I hadn't found anybody.  I think my first partnership, I had a partner like that but we were both starving to death.  But I found it much more successful to hire lawyers and pay them a salary and manage them.
Story_ID: 76252
Speaker 1: Now this--when did you meet [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: Probably in the early to mid-'50s [1950s].  We had a movement, I forget what we called our self, "Protest at the Polls," headed by [HM] Bennett Johnson.  And Bennett was a good friend of Harold, and Harold was an organization politician.  And periodically he would take us over to Harold's apartment and he was sort of like a senior type counselor, you know, guy on the inside talking with the young bucks on the outside.  So I didn't get to know him very well, but that's when I first met him.
Story_ID: 76253
Speaker 1: And did you have occasion to have much contact with him [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington], you know between--you know from like that 1955 period up through when he was, you know either in the state legislature [Illinois General Assembly] or you know, or as a Congressman?
Speaker 2: Very little contact with him over those years.  I was a 25 dollar a year supporter of his campaigns, and I think it must have been in the mid-'70's [1970s] we were, we had formed a group called The Committee to Elect a Black Mayor.  And I think that I was either co-chairman or vice-chairman with [Charles] Charlie Hayes of that group and I encountered Harold again because we were looking for people who would, could be candidates for that position.  And I think that's when Harold first ran back in those days, yeah.  And but again, from that point until '83 [1983] when he became mayor [of Chicago, Illinois], I had very little contact with him.  And I remember going to the hotel on the night of the election [February 22, 1983], getting a suite and having some friends over, and you know, so I would be able to commiserate with the mayor after he lost.  And we were sit--sat there in absolute shock when, when the returns came in and it was pretty clear that he was gonna win.
Speaker 1: So you really thought that he was gonna lose.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There were people who--you know, okay that's in--okay.
Speaker 2: No question about it.  Now I think that before that he had a lawyer's committee.  And they needed a litigator for some of the election challenges and I think that I joined that group and worked with him, worked with that, with the lawyer's group.  But that was the extent of my involvement with Harold.  And I had no expectation or, or wish to become a political person as Corporation Counsel in his administration.
Speaker 1: Now talk about how you felt that night when you start seeing the election results come in.
Speaker 2: I mean it was really an exhilarating feeling.  It was--you know I had always seen government as something you throw stones at because government was oppressive.  And here we have a man who is--had the charisma and had the fortuitous circumstances to mesmerize the black community, bring the vote out, I mean the percentages were unheard of.  And to, to have the--also the fortuitous event of there being two white candidates [Jane Byrne and Richard M. Daley] who had some degree of strength in the primary.
Speaker 1: I know that everybody, you know, walked taller the next day.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: It was, it was--I--it was a very sort of fabulous feeling.
Speaker 2: It really was, was a great time, was a great time in history.
Story_ID: 76254
Speaker 1: Now that day--how--talk about how the whole event around you becoming Corporation Counsel [of the City of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: I, I was in Las Vegas [Nevada] taking a deposition in a death case, and in the middle of the deposition I got a call from Chicago, from [HM] Earl Neal.  And I guess Earl and, and [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] had been together in politics for a long time.  And he must have--basically what Earl said was that he--Harold would like me to be his corporation counsel.  And I told him, "No man, that's not where I'm coming from."  He said, "Don't say no right away."  I said, "Aren't there other people that he can get?"  He says, "Well there are two or three, four people who presented themselves to him, but he's not happy with them.  So I suggested your name.  And he said 'Yeah, I saw, I saw him on television a few weeks or nights ago.  He handles himself very well.  Call him and see if he'll, he'll do it.'"  And that's how that happened.  Once I had told my family about it, of course they thought this was an exciting time and something to be involved in and to be a part of history, etc.  And so I succumbed then, took the job and I'm glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 76255
Speaker 1: Talk about that.  Because this is a whole different--I mean as you said, you were the stone thrower outside and you know you had been running your own shop.  And, and a lot of people didn't really understand what corporation counsel did.  It was not a place that black people had, had much--
Speaker 2: Knowledge about.
Speaker 1: Knowledge about and occasion, didn't understand the budget.  It was, it was sort of Bridgeport [Chicago, Illinois neighborhood on the South Side, home of Chicago Mayors Richard M. Daley and Richard J. Daley] as I remember.  It was sort of Bridgeport redefined.  It wasn't a lot of presence.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but for me what it was, it was two things.  One, it was to run a large law department.  Had no more idea of how to do that than a bear.  And so what I did was I learned from my office leadership.  You know I tended--if I wanted to get something done, I called the lawyer who I wanted to, to do it.  And they said "Jim, you gotta go through channels, levels of leadership."  So I learned that process.  I kept all of the good people who were in the office.  I terminated all of the people who were not making a contribution.  We had people there who were politically hired, who were--some of them were disabled and not really capable of doing competent legal work.  And others simply just were not prepared academically or mentally.  We had one guy who would stare out the window all day.  And [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] had said to me, he says "Jim, I want you to clean that office up."  He says, "you know I know that office 'cause I was there."  He had been an Assistant Corp. Counsel.  So it was, it was, it was a, it was a--but probably the most--the different thing about the Corporation Counsel under Harold Washington was that there was the fight between the [Vrdolyak] 29 and the 21 [Chicago City Council Wars].  And that made it a perfect fit for me.  I just loved the fight.  And it--the corporation counsel probably became high profile during the period of Harold's--while I was there.  I remember one council meeting where you--I sit at the mayor's side and, and advise him as, as the counsel is going on.  And so one day they came to an impasse and he [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] and [Edward] Vrdolyak were in a terrible fight.  And so the mayor declared a recess.  We were totally impasse.  He said, "Jim, go talk to him."  I says "Hell, I'm not talking to him.  He talks to people like they're on four legs."  "Jim, go talk to the man."  So sure enough I went and talked to him and we worked things out and got back into the meeting and, and moved ahead.  But those were really times where Vrdolyak was calling for my head.  Vrdolyak was in control of a lot of the government under Harold.  And I learned that he was doing things in the purchasing office.  He was getting contracts steered through Harold Washington's administration.  So when I found out about one, I sort of put the kibosh on it because it was my job to review contracts to determine whether or not they were legal.  But just for legal review, not for substance, not for whether they're--they should be awarded or not.  That wasn't my job.  But at some point Harold had given me the okay to try and see if we could do something to get minorities involved in some of these contracts.  And so I started reviewing 'em not only for the purpose of substance, but for, but for the purpose of, of legality, but for substance as well.  And so one--and when I learned about this contract that Vrdolyak had steered through, I was--I had been asked by one of the press people to go on I think it was Walter Jacobson's show, one--for a Sunday show.  And while I'm on that show, you know, I was, I was--handled it very well and, and got off the podium and walked out and there's the news media there print waiting there to talk to me.  And one of them asked me something about Vrdolyak and I blurted out what he had done, this contract and so forth and so forth.  And boy did that create a stink.  It created such a stink that Harold was in Africa I think at the time and it came to his attention and the Chief of Staff asked me, he said "Jim, would you mind coming down on Sunday and we're talking to the Mayor in Africa and I think you ought to talk to him."  And so I go down to the office and he's talking to the mayor, "Yes mayor."  And I could hear the mayor yelling.  And he said get me a copy of that video of that press conference.  Meet me with the airport with it, and so forth and so forth.  And he wouldn't talk to me.  He wouldn't even talk to me, he was so angry.  'Cause he felt that every time he went out of town, somebody screwed up.  So when he got back to town, you know I was sort of standoffish a little bit, stayed away from him for a while.  And then he decided--he, he came out one day, he said "you did, you did pretty well."
Story_ID: 76396
Speaker 1: It was, it [the Department of Law for the City of Chicago, Illinois] was not a position where you--it was a dead end position.  It was, it was a position that didn't have any respect in the courts and thank God we were able to bring in what I call "merit hiring."  The mayor [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] did not--I think he sent one person to be--asked me if I could find a place in the office for him.  And it turned out that he just wasn't the right guy.  And I said to him, I said "Mayor, do I have to do that?"  He said "look Jim, interview the man, give him a, give him a fair shot."  So I called a couple of my guys in.  I says, "Look, I want you to thoroughly interview this man with me.  And I want you to recognize that A, he was sent by the mayor.  But I don't want you to let that intimidate you.  But give me a good, fair assessment, your own individual, honest assessment."  They did.  It didn't work.  And I went back and I told the mayor, I gave him the details. I think the mayor knew. So I said--he said "Well Jim, figure out something for him."  And so sure enough, we got together and gave him a contract to deal with the trucks in the Water Department or something like that.  Lord knows if he didn't screw that up too.  But--so he let me run that office and, and with a--I hired a Jenner & Block partner to do the hiring and to create a Hiring Committee and to bring in people who you know, would do the work.
Speaker 2: Who was advising you on this?  Because I--the reason I'm saying this is that it's easy to look at things on hindsight, but you, you had never run a law department before.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And it's different running your own small shop, but you know I want you to talk about one, how many lawyers you know, on corporation counsel.  The areas that you know people have.  But also how you went about trying to make decisions and recruit, you know, in that, that period of time 'cause a lot of people would have gotten there and just said I'm just happy to be here.  You know, but--and seeing the budgets and things that are there.  So I'm just wondering if you could just describe the, you know--
Speaker 1: The learning process.  I guess the first thing that I did was to-[HM] Earl Neal, who was very familiar with the office, gave me a pretty good rundown on the people in the leadership of the office that I had there.  And that was a great start.  It probably--without it, I probably would have stumbled and fallen on my face.  And so I, I knew the people that I could deal with and who I could trust and, and who were competent based upon what Earl told me.  Then I started over time, making my own judgments as we went along.
Story_ID: 76397
Speaker 1: One of the things that I did first was to call a meeting of the entire legal staff.  I think we had maybe 150 lawyers when I started there.  And we had 'em all meet in a big auditorium.  And I gave them a long lecture, you know, esprit de corps kind of thing, but basically saying to them that you know when I walked into this office at 5:00, there's a stampede at the door.  I says now you don't have to leave at 5:00.  You can--you all have keys to the office.  You can use them.  When you have a task to do, the task is not complete until it's complete.  You don't leave 'cause it's 5:00, you fix--you, you finish the task.  And I basically did with them what I did with my little office in that respect.  And sure enough, we started getting people who felt good about themselves and who started to really bear down and work hard.  I was starting to get feedback from the judges indicating that you know, you got some good people coming over, they're doing a good job.  And we developed systems.  We, we, we computerized the office.  We developed automated research.  We hired clerks, we hired support staff.  I mean I think with the leadership that was in the office already, with new leadership that we brought in, you know, I learned from them, to be frank with you.  And I'll always had, thank God, as a failsafe, [HM] Earl Neal was really the wise person that I would go to if I had some issues.
Speaker 2: And when you told--just for, you know, purpose of the audience who would know, why Earl Neal was able to serve that role?  You know what--
Speaker 1: Well I think Earl was a former Assistant Corporation Counsel and chief of its Real Estate Division back in the, back in the day, back in the [Chicago Mayor] Richard J. Daley days, '60's [1960s], maybe late '50's [1950s].  And when he left that job to go into private practice, they maintained Earl as a consultant in real estate issues and in land acquisition issues.  And so Earl had a very intimate knowledge of that office.  He became an advisor to Mayor Daley after Daley tapped him to do some work that would release some funds to the Police Department from the federal government, which had been held up because of--I think maybe [HM] Renault Robinson's lawsuit or something like that.  And so from that day forward, that's--he, he played a major role as an advisor to the mayor, and one who enjoyed the fruits of city business.  When Jane Byrne became mayor [of Chicago, Illinois], [Michael Anthony] Bilandic became mayor, he was advisor to them.  When Harold [Washington] became mayor, mayor, he was a natural.  And I think the mayor relied upon him a great deal.  And I would say that Earl had great political wisdom as well.  And that was a big plus in terms of my access to him, the mayor's access to him.
Story_ID: 76398
Speaker 1: Now you also went and recruited young, younger African Americans out of major law firms to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To, to--right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Can you talk--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well what I did was we had a Hiring Committee, and one of--Jayne Barnard was my deputy for hiring.  And basically I just gave her the assignment of finding some African Americans for leadership positions and line positions in the office.  I think when I arrived in that office, there was--there may have been one African American lawyer in that office.  He was a deputy, having been brought in by my predecessor.  There were no line lawyers in that office who were African American.  And I think historically you'd find that maybe there were two or three at most.  So we had to--we, we really took an active role in trying to bring in African Americans to the office, representative of our population in the city.  And we got quite a few good people from Harvard [University].  We got--we had a couple of deputy, we got a couple of division heads and a lot of people who came in even as clerks from law school.  And we took some of those clerks and when they graduated law school, brought 'em into the office.  And that was about the size--that was the easy part.
Story_ID: 76399
Speaker 1: Now the other part of it was actually operating daily in a battlefield.  You said that that--was that a easy--I mean you were operating in a battlefield.  You hadn't--I mean there is the aspect of municipal law, you know and just sort of being able to sort of operate within the confines you have, you know, another entity, the City Council [of Chicago, Illinois] to sort of operate within 'cause you're, you know, dealing in a governmental body.  And I'm just wondering, you know what--if you could describe some maybe of the, you know, fights that you're proud of that you own, or things that you know, you learned or you know, were losses that you--because a lot--what is surprising when you look at the time that Harold [Washington] was mayor [of Chicago, Illinois], you know, at the things that he was able to beat, you know with the press, you know again, you know a lot of things operating against him.
Speaker 2: Right.  See there were lawsuits against the mayor.  There were--I think there was one lawsuit that they filed to try and disqualify the mayor from public office because of one of those forms that you're supposed to fill out--ethics, one of those ethics forms.  And we were successful with that.  I mean there must have been--
Speaker 1: There were tax issues, issues of tax payment, you know lack--him not paying taxes.  Wasn't that--was that--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: It was ethics, it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah there was the ethics business.  And I think there may have been others; I just can't think of 'em off the top of my head.  But what we would do, we would bring in lawyers from the outside and get the best lawyers that money could buy, to defend those cases and, and we did quite well.  One of the major problems that we had during the Washington administration was that Harold had agreed to implement the [Michael] Shakman decree.  And that decree was one that prohibited political hiring and political firing.  There wasn't a person that the Washington administration fired who didn't file a lawsuit in the federal court against the city seeking reinstatement and back pay and the whole nine yards.  And sure enough, they--many of them succeeded in getting their jobs back.  I remember one of the deputies in the Water Department who, who we fired, he got his job back with back pay and the whole nine yards.  And at that point, the Chief of Staff came to me, he says "Jim, I think we need to get a little bigger guns into that legal battle."  So we hired Jenner & Block to start handling those cases and we finally got it to a point where we were able to manage the government and then fire people who we needed to fire, and hire people who we needed to hire.
Speaker 1: And that, just for people who don't have perspective on that, Chicago had always operated under a political patronage system.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And then all of a sudden a black mayor is in charge.  I mean it just was a thing of timing.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was timing.  And I think that the city had, had fought this Shakman lawsuit tooth and nail.  And just like they had fought organized labor, and Harold came in, assented to labor unions for the bulk of the city employees, assented to the Shakman decree.  And we, we pretty much abided by that Shakman decree--was interesting how that decree has continued to exist even until today.  And yet political hiring and firing is business as usual.  Getting around the Shakman decree.  And at this point I think the city is taking efforts to vacate that decree because they wanna do what they've been doing.
Story_ID: 76400
Speaker 1: Now what--I mean will you--can you describe any like anecdotes around, you know I mean other anecdotes around [Edward] Vrdolyak, you know and the 29, or--I wanna ask that and--
Speaker 2: Let's see, Vrdolyak.  You know I remember his calling me on, on the phone and saying "I've got some people in my ward who have been waiting for a water main for X number of weeks" and so forth.  "Well what is--where is the water main?  I need some identification of it so I can see what we can do."  So when I was acceding to, to do what he wanted to do, he started talking to me like I walked on four legs, you know.  I said just a minute, just a minute.  Don't ever call me again.  If you need something from this office, we represent you.  But you talk to my first assistant, you don't know how to talk to me.  And I didn't talk to that man anymore until that day in City Council when Harold said "Jim, go talk to the man."  And that was the first time I'd talked to him.  Subsequent to that during the course of the council wars, he would call me and say "Look, there's nobody in this administration I can talk to.  I'd like to have a conversation with you."  And of course Vrdolyak was such a snake that before I did anything like that, I talked to some people.  And they said "Jim I tell you what, why don't you cancel that appointment because--he said he wanted you to talk one-on-one."  He says "you can never trust him."  So that was one of the events we had.  The next one was the one I told you about after that show with Walter Jacobson.  He went out publicly saying that he called for my head.  "Jim Montgomery's gonna get fired.  The council is gonna fire him" and so forth.  Other than that, most of our battles were not directly Vrdolyak related, but they were legal battles and political battles.
Story_ID: 76401
Speaker 1: There was one time that somebody came into [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] Harold's apartment with a recording device and I think recorded some of Harold's conversation.  And I think that Harold had said some things that were not very flattering about some people, maybe like Alderman [HM Dorothy] Tillman or something like that.  And oh my God, that was a public relations situation where I had the opportunity of being the defense for the mayor publicly on TV and so forth.  And that was a tremendously great time, I enjoyed doing that, like defending a case.
Speaker 2: Did you--were there any dealings with the, you know, [Edmund] Ed Kelly or head of Finance Department, Ed--
Speaker 1: [Edward] Ed Burke.
Speaker 2: Burke.
Speaker 1: Ed Burke, yes.
Speaker 2: That, you know, you would like to recount or you know that--because those were all about, you know you had the, the three Eddies and--
Speaker 1: Right, now Eddie, Eddie Burke and I had known each other when he was a police officer and I was doing criminal defense work.  So that when we had our first budget negotiations, I was the guy, the point guy to go down and try and work things out with Burke.  However, I had no knowledge of the complexities of budgeting, and, and--but at least, you know when we got approval there, he and I could talk to each other, was what it amounted to.  And eventually they put I think [HM] Sharon [Gist Gilliam] into that mode.  And she also had the relationship with him where there was mutual respect.  But at one point in that budgeting process, I think that they perceived me as somebody that they couldn't intimidate.  And so they decided that they were gonna take away some of the perks and prerogatives of my office.  One of those was the right to, to settle cases on behalf of the city.  And in the budget negotiations, they decided that they were going to limit the corporation counsel to settlements under 100,000 dollars.  Anything above that had to be brought to where?  The Finance Committee.  And that's the rule to this very day.  And as we were negotiating the budget and Harold caved in, and I was so upset.  And so that night I think was like either New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve, whenever the budget goes down to the wire, probably New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve.  It's late.  Everybody's tired.  I'm leaving my office, which is next door to Harold's.  Harold's side door to his office is open and [William] Bill Ware says "Jim, come on in."  I said "I'm not going in there."  "Jim, come on in."  He says "you know the mayor's you know, come and talk to the mayor."  I went in with my jaws tight.  And there I see the mayor for the first time sitting at his little seating area where the couch is and the table, and he's having a drink of some kind of liquor that somebody had given him, left with in his office.  So I said the mayor must be down.  I was really ticked off at him.  It took me a long time to understand the political realities that, that caused him to do what he did.  And, and I, and I came to respect that.  I mean he was a great teacher of politics to me.  What little I know now, I got from him.  There were other times when we had those budgetary battles, where Harold would just--he knew when to hold and he knew when to fold.  And those guys got something, Harold got something.  The government kept going, and Harold kept going.  And I think that with the way he had handled it, had he lived, he'd have been mayor for life, you know.  He just had that great appeal to people of all stripes and colors.
Story_ID: 76402
Speaker 1: Do you think--what would you say was the turning point for that [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] administration?  You know in terms of--because it came in under a battlefield from the very beginning.  But what do you think--was there any, you know sort of legal turn--you know was there any turning point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as I remember there had been a challenge made of the districts, the restricting that probably had occurred in 1980.  And the plaintiffs in that case were successful so that by the time the election came around for 1985 I think it was, the mayor had the districts in such a fashion that he was able to get a majority of the city council, bringing in at least one or two Hispanic aldermen, and maybe an additional one or two African American aldermen.  He had control of that council for the first time.  I think it was in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: But can you talk about that whole thing?  Because that was pretty histor--it was historic and there was a lot of attention from around the country, right?  Or was that after when--that was the special election.  Was there a special election afterwards with, you know when [Luis] Gutierrez and --
Speaker 2: I don't remember the details, but I do remember that the straw that enabled him to do that was a successful redistricting of the council boundaries.  And I don't remember the special election [After the November 1985 remap, there was a special election in seven wards, including the 26th, where Luis Gutierrez beat Manuel Torres].
Speaker 1: Do you, do you remem--do you--this whole thing with redistricting had, hadn't [HM] Earl Neal played a role, you know with that?  Was he an advisor on that at all?
Speaker 2: I think that Earl was not involved in the redistricting.  I think that that redistricting case was done largely by my successor
Speaker 1: Judson Miner.
Speaker 2: My-- Judson Miner, yes.
Speaker 1: Now with--were there any things where you felt, besides the budget issue, that you were defeated on, or that you were, you know, really sort of particularly upset you in any way?
Speaker 2: I think the only time that I really remember being particularly upset during the Washington administration was that time when I had to fire the young man who I had hired who had a felony record.  But I got over it.  Other than that, I, I think I thoroughly enjoyed that process.
Story_ID: 76403
Speaker 1: Now was there--you--I mean a lot of things happened during that time.  There was the airport, you know there were a lot--minority purchasing.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I would like you to--I'm just--
Speaker 2: During that time, we had all kinds of demands were being made on the mayor [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] by African American businesspeople to get some of the city contracts.  And the mayor pretty much would send those people to me because he, like all politicians, he said somebody else had to say no.  But after a while it became apparent that we had to do something, and [William] Bill Ware who was Chief of Staff, had an intimate knowledge of the law and the history of set asides for minorities, and affirmative action plans.  And he had some serious reservations about it and what it might entail.  And so he sat on it a lot.  So at one point, I said to the mayor, I said "Mayor, we're getting a lot of pressure and I can't get Bill to okay getting something done about this."  He says "I tell you what, Jim.  Why don't you just go ahead and figure out what to do and do it?"  So I had my guys develop a, an affirmative action plan that was to be implemented by executive order and the mayor signed that.  And that was a tremendous help in terms of having a vehicle whereby he could allow some of the people in the African American community to participate in city purchases.  And I think that even at that, I don't think we got any real substantial opportunities, because people had these things locked up.  People like [Edward] Vrdolyak was operating in undercurrent in the administration.  But at least it was a, a move that resulted in what has become an ordinance under Mayor [Richard M.] Daley.  So I think that initiative that, that Harold took is something that's still a legacy.  The other thing was the Ethics Ordinance.  I think the ethics--was that first, or the executive order?  I believe that may have been an executive order initially as well.
Story_ID: 76404
Speaker 1: You mentioned something else that triggered, triggered something.
Speaker 2: I was talking about the--I had mentioned the airport.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: 'Cause there was--
Speaker 1: Here's what was an exciting piece.  [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] was a, was not a hands-on manager.  Harold didn't tell his department heads what to do about issues.  He gave them their own heads, and if they screwed up, then he'd have Bill Ware punish 'em.  He wouldn't even--I think I only, I only know of him firing one person in the whole administration, and that was someone who had a fundraiser without, without getting his permission.  But in the, in the, in the whole process of developing a plan for implementing a people mover at the airport [O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois], an automated transit system, Harold formed through his department heads, a group, a committee, and he put me on this committee.  Well most of those department heads on the, on the committee were accustomed to the mayor telling them what to do.  And so when nobody would tell 'em what to do, they wouldn't have any direction, and were not accustomed to having their own heads.  Because if you don't do anything, you can't get in trouble, that was the attitude.  So it provided me with an opportunity to, to take a leadership role on that committee.  And I would keep the mayor informed as to what was going on.  And during the course of that process that we developed, we had to make choices among competing bidders.  And we had made a choice of Westinghouse [Electric], an American company who had at that time, the best bang for the buck over the lifetime of the system.  So Vrdolyak must have been backing the French company [Matra].  And when that award was made, he went to the press and blasted the mayor and blasted me as having opened the bids in the toilet.  He said in private, "public bids, he opened 'em in the toilet."  So he was calling for everybody's head and resignations and all this jazz.  And so the next thing that occurred was the mayor is really catching a lot of heat on this thing.  And being a politician and sensitive to heat, the French president of this French company came over to the United States and talked to Harold.  Harold sent him over to talk to me.  He said "This is unacceptable.  You understand?  You understand?"  I said, "Of course, you said this is unacceptable."  But to make a long story short, I told him that the technical engineering reasons for not accepting his company had to do with that his cars were independent cars.
Story_ID: 76265
Speaker 1: You were talking about the, you know the, the whole people--
Speaker 2: People mover, yeah.  So to make a long story short, we decided as a committee with [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] Harold's blessing to resubmit, have them submit cost saving proposals to cancel the award to this company and let 'em all present cost saving proposals because the airport [O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois] said it's too much money.  So we want you guys to reduce the, the bill.  So we gave the French [Matra] the opportunity as, as we did the others, to give, come up with some cost saving proposals.  And so what the French did, they engineered their train so that they were not in married pairs.  They, they made them independent vehicles so that if you wanted to have a-- consist of, of two vehicles, you could have two.  You wanted one, you could have one.  If you needed three, you could have three.  Whereas before their cars were married.  So if you needed three, you had to pull four.  And so over the years as the engineers called train ton miles [Gross Ton Miles], you would have maintenance costs far in excess of what you need because of carrying cars that you didn't need.  So they, they, they put together the best price and, and matched Westinghouse.  And so we switched.  My God, then Westinghouse sued us.  And that brought a lot of heat on the mayor.  And we had this very strange meeting.  Everybody knew what to do except me.  He called in the department heads and assistant department heads and said I'm catching too much heat on this people mover situation and I--we need to figure out what we're gonna do.  And so he went around the room.  "Well, Mr. mayor I think we ought to dump it, and have this and that."  "Mr. Mayor I think we ought to dump it."  And the only guy who said it should go was the Deputy Commissioner of Aviation, whose name I don't remember, African American, and his boss.  So when he finally got around to me after everybody had made it pretty much a consensus that we gone dump this thing.  I said "Mr. Mayor, I think you ought to go ahead.  First I think you ought to go ahead because your corporation counsel's butt is hanging out the window with--getting shot at.  And in two weeks I can guarantee you we're going to be vindicated in court.  And secondly, I think you ought to go ahead because that's the mayoral thing to do."  He jumped straight up in his, in his chair.  "This meeting is over.  I'm gonna catch a lot of heat in this case.  And so forth and so forth, and I'll talk to all of you later."  He walked out of the conference room.  So about hour later, I'm into his little lobby area and I see the press secretary, what's his name, with glasses on his head.
Speaker 1: Re-- no, no, Alton Miller.
Speaker 2: Alton Miller.  And Alton gave me a thumbs up.  I said, "He's going for it."  He said, "Yeah."  So just as he had given me that signal, Harold walked out of his office with some other people.  And he passed by, he said "Jim, I'd like to see you at my apartment on Sunday morning about 8:00."  I said "Yes, Mr. Mayor."  So I go to his apartment at 8:00 in the morning.  In his robe, he's making coffee.  "You want a cup of coffee?"  I said "Yeah."  He said "have a seat."  He came over after he got the coffee and he sat down he said "I wanna talk to you about a few things.  But first let me just say this to you.  There shall never be another time when you tell me what is mayoral.  What I do is mayoral."  I said "Yes, Mr. Mayor."  And then we went on talking about other things.  But that was a memorable occasion for me.  Everybody knew that the, that the thing to do in there that day was to go with the mayor.  Me, I'm not going with the mayor, we're in a fight.  We're in a fight to the finish.  We did the right thing.  They falsely accused us.  And I mean the newspaper just vilified me in the media and, and mayor's saying hell, I gotta cut my losses.  So I was so pleased when I had resigned from the Corporation Counsel's office [1986] and they finally got the people mover, ready to cut the ribbon, he invited me over.  So I always take credit for saving the people mover.
Story_ID: 76266
Speaker 1: With--were there things that surprised you about city government [Chicago, Illinois], or the resources that were there?  Were you--did you have any--I mean you know that were surprising 'cause it is a major--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that all of it was a surprise to me.  The whole budgetary process; the whole notion that departments had to compete with the limited resources.  The whole notion that you had to keep your budget politically balanced so that it had initiatives in it that were politically popular.  The, the whole notion that you know you, you as a matter of principle what [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] did once was to cut all executive salaries.  This is, this is good government, you're cutting executive salaries and it really, really hurt me 'cause he took $5,000 off my salary, which was low in the first place.  But there were--I mean it was a learning process, complete learning process for me.  But I'll never regret the experience, I really developed some good relationships as a result of that experience, and was able to make a complete transition in my business from being a criminal defense lawyer to doing civil work and ultimately doing only plaintiff's work.
Story_ID: 76267
Speaker 1: Now I wanna ask, what about things like [HM] Renault Robinson and the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority]--did you, were you involved at all with that?  You know that, that process--not--
Speaker 2: Very, very little.
Speaker 1: Any, any involvement with the takeover, you know I mean the, the ability to get [Edmund] Ed Kelly out of, out of the control of the parks?  Were you involved?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Not at all with that.  So those were more political administrative fights.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not legal fights.  Let's see.  But you were involved in the re--fights with redistricting.  Anything with the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] in that--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  The only time that I was involved with the CTA was when the mayor [Chicago Mayor Harold Washington] would, would, was seeking people to go and he would some--he got me involved in getting the person selected for the Law Department who turned out to be a very bright young woman who is a professor at Northwestern University [in Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 1: It's [HM] Joyce Hughes.
Speaker 2: Joyce Hughes, of course.  I think that when we had--we had a, a committee put together to work on the city applying for the World's Fair.  And I think the--I was involved I think as a member of that group.  And he also--I also recommended Jim--what's Jim's name who's the head of their Law Department?  The legal--Lawyer's Committee.  Jesus, know him very well.  But anyway, that situation was aborted after it became clear that big cities just have a tremendous time coming out even with those kinds of ventures and we had gone as a committee to New Orleans [Louisiana] and had observed how those people had ended up losing a lot of money and not really getting any public benefit from it.  And so Harold sort of put the kibosh on that and probably rightly so.
Speaker 1: Now what about, what about the school board?  Were you involved at all?
Speaker 2: Not at all with the school board.
Speaker 1: That's so interesting the things--okay.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay 'cause [HM] Ruth Love wasn't that--she was, was that around the--
Speaker 2: Trying to remember.
Speaker 1: Well, Ruth Love was brought in by [Chicago Mayor Jane] Byrne.
Speaker 2: Was it Manford?
Speaker 1: It was [HM] Manford Byrd, that's right.
Speaker 2: Manford Byrd.
Story_ID: 76268
Speaker 1: Okay that's--in terms of civic involvement, did you have any time to really be civically involved?  Or were there other organizations, civic organizations that you--or legal organizations that you were invited to be part of that you had not had priv--you know, been privy to before?
Speaker 2: Well I think in, in 1983 I was admitted to the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, which is a organization of about 500 lawyers across the country.  And at that time they had [HM] Earl Neal as the sole African American in that group.  And so I, I was nominated to that and was reasonably active with them, going to one meeting a year, maybe two sometimes.  Other than that, during those years, I didn't have time to do anything.  We worked ten, eleven hours some days, worked Saturdays some weeks.  It was always a crisis during those three years.  We called it crisis management is what we were involved in all the time, putting out fires.  It wasn't until [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] had gotten control of the [city] council that we could sort of focus on really moving the government ahead and getting things done.  There was also a move to redevelop Navy Pier.  And the mayor didn't have the horses in the city council, and they put the kibosh on it; they didn't want him to get points on the board.  There were constant fights about confirming his appointments to department heads.  And the council held many of those hostage for a long, long time.  And we even had one of our guys trying to curry favor with the [Vrdolyak] 29 because he wanted to be confirmed, whereas he could have worked the whole time without being confirmed, you know.  But that was a big stick that they held over the mayor's head; boards and commissions.
Speaker 1: Now what about the Police Board and the work there?  Were--did you have any--were there any around the police and--
Speaker 2: Well we had assistants who worked that as prosecutors before the Police Board.  But that was the extent of our involvement.  At one point the Police Department had its own Legal Department.  And we took that away from them, they were very upset with us.  They kept lawyers there, but, but they had to have their legal work done by the Corporation Counsel's Office like all other departments.  But other than that, that's the only involvement we had.  I remember when I first became Corporation Counsel, the police brass, you know I guess they sort of knew who Jim Montgomery was, always fighting the, the state and the police.  So I walked into the office on May 1st I think it was, and they were in my First Deputy's office in a huddle.  And boy you should have seen the looks I got when I passed by the door.  And it took them a long time before they would trust me as their lawyer.  But we got there ultimately.
Speaker 1: Now were there--so you--were you able to still do planning and department building in the face of all that fighting?
Speaker 2: Only through the work of my deputies.  That's why, that's where I learned to delegate.  And like my Hiring Committee.  Probably when you say planning, I suppose most of our planning was around personnel, was around promotions of the right people to head the, the appropriate department.  Staff being appointed to deal with the automation of the office, the training of people in doing automated legal research, that kind of thing.  So yeah that was some time for that.  But most of my time was spent as I say in the, in the council wars mode.
Speaker 1: And do you have any other favorite council wars stories?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 76269
Speaker 1: But can you, can you sort of sum up some of the changes that may--you know you talked about the department [City of Chicago Department of Law] as you found it.  That there may have been one or possibly two African Americans.  I want you to address the department when you left.  You know what changes were made within that department?
Speaker 2: I think when I left, we can say that we had at least three top level African Americans in the, in the office.  We had probably a dozen or more you know, lawyers within the various divisions of the department.  We had for the first time women who were heading divisions of the office.  We had for the first time the respect of the, of the courthouse, federal and state.  We had raised the level of pay for the lawyers so that we could attract people who had the proper credentials.  We had pulled a number of people out of large law firms who were people who were skilled, skilled people.  All in all, we had, we had changed it from a patronage office to a hiring on the basis of merit office.  And we had a good quality product coming out of that office.
Story_ID: 76270
Speaker 1: Did--what were the circumstances under you leave--under your, your leaving [the City of Chicago Corporation Counsel's Office]?
Speaker 2: I had--when I had started [in 1983], I told you I was at--taking a deposition in a death case in Las Vegas [Nevada].  In, I think it was, must have been scheduled for, for trial in February or March of 1986.  And I had about a two month period when I resigned to prepare for the trial.  And, and that's basically why I left.  And also at that time there was some, there was some serious heat going on that involved me, that involved I think the--one of the Sawyer brothers who was the head of the Revenue Department [Charles Sawyer], and the Chief of Staff, Ernie--
Speaker 1: Ernie Barnes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No he's not Ernie Barnes, Barefield.
Speaker 1: Barefield, thank you.  Ernie Barefield, sorry, sorry.
Speaker 2: I had gotten a call to come down to the Revenue Department by the, by Ernie one day and in the meeting was Sawyer, Barefield, myself and a young man who worked in that office named Adams.  And they apparently had been meeting already.  And Ernie sort of wanted my advice because apparently this Adams had borrowed 10,000 dollars from some guy who was trying to get a contract with the Revenue Department to do city collections.  Turned out to be the incubator, the mole [Michael Raymond], FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] mole of some sort.  And we got--I questioned him about what had happened.  And somehow Clarence McClain had learned about it and he was the one who blew the whistle.  And I think Ernie had received a contribution from this mole that he had put into Alderman [and later Chicago Mayor Eugene] Sawyer's campaign fund.  And so I said to Ernie, I said, "I don't think-- you know, we gotta protect the mayor from this."  And basically what I did was to say "I think what you need to do is you know you gotta figure out a way to get Sawyer on out of here, get Adams on out of here, and let's leave this thing where it is, under the table."  And that--we got kicked left, right and sideways about that.  So that giving the mayor a little grief.  So it was really fortuitous that the case was set for trial.  And I said to the mayor, I said "Mr. Mayor, I ain't got no problem with resigning.  I can do that at the drop of a hat."  And he, he was very pleased.  And so I went out, prepared for the trial of that case, tried the case after they offered me 800,000 dollars and my client insisted on a million.  And I lost the case.
Story_ID: 76271
Speaker 1: Now the--with--with the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] mole, because that was--who was that--what was it?  It was--were you, were you aware of what was happening with the FBI mole at the time that--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Because that came out much later.
Speaker 2: No, no that came out probably you know when we learned--when I, when I tell you about this meeting we had, it must have been in the fall let's say.  And I think it was like Christmas day or Christmas eve [1886] that the mole [Michael Raymond] was exposed.  And lo and behold, everybody and his brother was in trouble.  Aldermen, you name it.
Speaker 1: And you, you had--so you didn't know of his, his dealings around.  'Cause he took a lot of black aldermen down at that point. A lot of them.
Speaker 2: Right.  I knew that he--I knew that this person existed because of the--I think the first reason was that I was called in on this meeting and learned about it.  And I probably knew that he was around even before because I know people were vying for that contract.  So I was aware that he was around, but not that he was an FBI mole, nor the extent to which he was compromising public officials.
Story_ID: 76272
Speaker 1: Were you--when, when you left, did you, were did you feel really a sense of relief, or were you dis--you know, were you--did, did politics sort of--did you feel beaten down at all by the political situation?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  I mean one of the--I remember one of the times I was being pummeled in the, in the press and the, the late Alderman Fred Roti, he says "Jim, boy you really know how to take heat."  And I did.  I mean it was--I didn't--that didn't trouble me at all, you know.  I've always liked a good fight and, and been prepared to take it on the chin when you have to take it on the chin.
Speaker 1: And now when you, when you finished--so most of your effort for those, those, that--those two months were for the case.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So after the case, you know and after losing the--you know you say you lost the case.  It's the issue of getting your law firm back in shape, right?  No one had been running it, right?
Speaker 2: Well no, yes as a matter of fact, my son [James D. Montgomery, Jr.] had wound down most of my business when I had--that I had.  And he was practicing law in my shop with a staff I think of two lawyers.  And so I had a place to go back to, and went right back to that place.  And started practicing again and changing the quality of my practice because now we've got a African American in government, and we got an African American who just left as Corporation Counsel.  So I got a lot of business from corporations who wanted the kind of lobbying that I could do with the city.  So it was a, it was a great opportunity to make a transition in the kind of things I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were really--you, you had an inside track and so you were able to take advantage of that in other ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean in a positive way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from a, from a perception point of view at least, you know.  People perceived that this lawyer ought to be the one to hire to take my message here or there.
Story_ID: 76273
Speaker 1: Do you have any comments, you know a lot of people during, during the [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington years [1983 to 1987], it was con--not a--there was some tension between Atlanta [Georgia], you know the black business people in Atlanta and the black business people here.  Though, you know a lot of other cities, New York [New York City, New York] converged here, Atlanta converged here.  Do--were you involved in any of that?  You know--
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  I, I was just as an observer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was aware of the kind of tension that was there.  The so-called "Atlanta Connection" they called it.  And one of the brightest lights that he had in his government was from Atlanta.  And he was a consultant and I can't remember his name, but he was a very sharp man and did great contributions to the government.  Ernie Barefield was a part of the Atlanta Connection.  And I can't think of any other Atlanta people except--
Speaker 1: [Atlanta Mayor] Maynard [Jackson].
Speaker 2: Maynard came in and then got bond work from the city.  And I think that's about it.  There may have been others.
Story_ID: 76274
Speaker 1: I--do I have--let me ask a question about [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington.  Would you--can you describe him?  Do you have a favorite--you've told some Harold stories, but how would you just sort of describe him as a person?
Speaker 2: I would say, start it off, as an avid, voracious reader.  A person who loved and lived, ate and slept politics.  Never failed to answer his phone by himself, at his home, at any time.  Nobody would answer it for him; he answered his own phone.  Probably loved politics.  He, he--he was a, a brilliant lawyer, brilliant lawyer.  I remember going into his office and giving him some advice on some issue.  And the questions he asked me were so thorough and so complete, that I never was that unprepared again when I came to him.  He was a--he had a great nose for what was politic and what was not.  He, he ate soul food to the, to the, to a fault.  He, how can I put it, he was a big, friendly bear with the public.  Harold would go to a Polish restaurant in the Polish community on the Northwest Side [Chicago, Illinois], and the women would line up to shake his hand.  Just to touch his hand.  And he was that kind of a warm guy.  One of the things I learned about him from the Press Secretary, [HM] Grayson [Mitchell], was that he had very hard time empathizing with people who were in tragedies or disasters.  Had a hard time going when we had a crash of the Illinois Central train and many people were injured seriously and some killed and in hospitals.  Well it was--the Press Secretary got him and took him to the hospital.  And he was very uncomfortable I'm told.  But all in all I think Harold was somebody who, had he lived, would have been the head of this city because he was winning people over every day.  The business community loved him.  He put sidewalks in communities, white and black, that had never seen a sidewalk before.  He made city services equal citywide, not based on political favor, but every--when we did streets, we did X number of miles per ward.  When we laid sewers, we laid X number of miles per ward.  I mean he I think had sold this town on the fact that he was the mayor for all of Chicago.
Story_ID: 76275
Speaker 1: Can you just comment about, on camera, about the role that [Mayor] Harold Washington played with the city [Chicago, Illinois] and what, you know if you look at it, what the black community should be proud of.
Speaker 2: I think first of all the black community should be proud of the image of, of an African American mayor in terms of--as a role model for their children.  I mean it, it really gave people an opportunity to look at a black man who was charismatic and who was running a city with great skill.  I think that his--probably his best meaning was that he instituted reforms in government that had been driven previously by political consideration.  And those reforms included opening up the government process by an executive order, creating freedom of information so that information from city departments was now accessible to the news media and government, government was now open for public inspection.  His Ethics Executive Order, his Affirmative Action Executive Order, his using government funds to serve each ward equally.  Same streets in each ward, same sewers in each ward, not based on political favoritism.  I think that he basically made Chicago a city that works for everyone.  In terms of the black community, he created opportunities for people who would do business with the city.  In terms of employment, he created opportunities in government for African Americans to an extent that had not existed before.  I mean he demonstrated that the city would not fall apart if the city elected a black mayor.
Story_ID: 76276
Speaker 1: Now tell me where you were the night of the Sawyer, the city council, the Sawyer, Sawyer, Sawyer--Tim, Tim- [the Chicago, Illinois city council election between HM Eugene Sawyer and alderman Timothy C. Evans]
Speaker 2: Tim Evans.
Speaker 1: Tim Evans.  Where were you, and were you in front of your TV set, were you--
Speaker 2: Well I think--wasn't that the same night after [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] died?
Speaker 1: Yes [sic, Harold Washington died on November 25, 1987, Eugene Sawyer was sworn in on the morning of December 2, 1987. David Duvall Orr served as mayor pro tem in the interim].
Speaker 2: I was in my office across the street at 100 North LaSalle when the call came indicating that the mayor had died and was being taken to the hospital.  I didn't leave that office for the next several hours into the night.  I was probably in my office talking to various people on the phone, getting a handle on what was going on, and when the--when all of that happened.  And I, and then I was looking later at home on TV at some of the shenanigans went on in terms of the selection process for, for Sawyer.  That's the night you're talking about, right?  I mean it was pretty clear to me that the--if there was going to be a black, it was going to be Sawyer because Sawyer had been one of the team players of the [Edward] Vrdolyak and the Burkes [Edward Burke] for a number of years before Harold was in office.  And so I perceived as I think they did, that he was someone that they could "deal with."  Tim on the other hand, you know was just not their kind of, their breed of cat.  Tim had been--I think Tim was there before Harold.  But again, they, they chose Gene because Gene Sawyer was, as I say, the kind of a guy that they had dealt with in the past and figured they could do in the future.
Speaker 1: Had you gotten politics out of your system at that point and were, you know--
Speaker 2: Well in the sense that I never wanted to be a politician in those years at least. Early on, I had run for alderman but by that time it was out of my system a long time, you know.  I enjoyed the power of, of being in government and being able to have some influence on decision making.  And I really didn't miss that because I've always had a passion for the practice of law and I never had any intention of doing anything but that, even when I went into the Corporation Counsel's office.  So by that time, I was back into my groove, you know, practicing law, trying cases.
Story_ID: 76277
Speaker 1: And so you've grown your firm [James D. Montgomery and Associates], you know and you went back to sort of a, a sole practitioner [in 1986].  Your son [James D. Montgomery, Jr.], I assume, working with you.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And, and can you talk about how the whole relationship--'cause it's, it's almost light, it seems light years away, you know, Harold Washington and then Johnnie Cochran in many ways and O.J. Simpson in between [1995].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering, you know, if you can talk about how that, you know how you, you know decided to do, do that and what the process--
Speaker 2: Well I think that during the years between [Chicago Mayor Herald] Washington's death and the time that I got together with Johnnie Cochran, which only happened in 2001, first of the year.  We'd been negotiating during 2000.  I basically had a six to seven person law firm that was busy doing primarily civil defense work.  And every now and then I would take a major federal criminal case.  I had escaped 26th and California, and that was a transition from the government back to the practice where I didn't have to go to that dismal court anymore.  I would venture to say that in the years from 1986 until 2001, I tried no more than three cases in a courthouse where I used to go every day.  And restricted my criminal work pretty much to the federal building.  And I think that what was really happening was that I was doing work largely for public entities.  I had spent five or six years as Corporation Counsel for the City of Harvey [Illinois].  I did all of their defense work.  But realistically it wasn't really lucrative work because the public agencies pay minimal hourly rates, enough to keep your doors open and if you don't get something else that's gonna give you a big shot in the arm, you don't really make any real money.  So it was during the period I was trying to make a transition into doing exclusively plaintiffs work that I met Johnnie Cochran.  He became a member of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, and he, he and [HM] Earl Neal and I got together on the phone and decided we'd better go to a meeting before they put us out of the, the organization.  And I think we went to a meeting in around '98 [1998] or thereabouts, and became acquainted.  And then maybe about two, the year 2000 he was starting to develop this national law firm [Cochran, Cherry, Givens, Smith and Montgomery].  And he had gone to Baltimore, Maryland and had spoken with a long time friend of mine, who was--they were talking about setting up a shop in Baltimore.  And he had told this friend that he was thinking about coming to Chicago [Illinois] and going into that marketplace.  And so this friend of mine said "Be sure to look up Jim Montgomery, that's the guy you ought to hook up with."  He said, "I know Jim."  And that's how that started.  And we began negotiations and ultimately formed a partnership in January of 2001.  And I mean it's really been a, a rare opportunity to do what lawyers call cherry picking, and pick the best of the cases and it's been eons better than ever before in terms of the kind of--kind and quality of cases I'm able to get and try.
Story_ID: 76278
Speaker 1: Well you have--well okay I know we don't have a lot of time.  But the Tuwana Broadlake case where, right--was what?  No I'm not talking about--I don't mean Tuwana--
Speaker 2: LaTanya Haggerty case?
Speaker 1: Sorry, that's New York, I'm sorry.  I know it didn't come out right, but, okay.  The police--
Speaker 2: Shooting of LaTanya Haggerty [in 1999].
Speaker 1: But that--I mean you were taking--because he [Johnnie Cochran] had his notoriety, but you had your own--it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like the Haggerty case was a case that came to me before we [Cochran, Cherry, Givens, Smith and Montgomery] got together.  And of course I had fortunately--I, I can never avoid being a high profile lawyer, I don't know whether it's 'cause I try or the cases that I take.  But that certainly was one that was a high profile case.  And when we joined together, of course they only multiply.
Speaker 1: And this is at a time when there's a lot of focus, refocus on police brutality, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause police brutality sort of ebbs and flows in terms of the community focus on it.  And that was a, a time which resulted in a very fortuitous resolution of that case.  Because it was settled just before the hot summer was coming.  It was settled at a time when there was unrest in I think it was Ohio or someplace like that.  And the negotiations went very smoothly.
Speaker 1: You made a lot of money off that case.
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: Pauline [Washington] is pretty happy isn't she?
Speaker 2: No question about it.
Story_ID: 76279
Speaker 1: So where, where is Jim Montgomery today?
Speaker 2: Well probably at a, at a mode where I am trying to organize my way out of the practice [Cochran, Cherry, Givens, Smith and Montgomery] with a, with a view toward looking at a--not definite timeframe, but certainly a timeframe that's within the next four or five years.  I celebrated my seventy-first birthday last Monday, and so far my doctor tells me my health is good.  And, and I'm enjoying the ability to cherry pick cases and to earn the kind of money I've never earned before.  And I would, I would say that I'm working four days a week now instead of five.  I have three day weekends.  This summer I'm gonna take two months off to be on my boat and, and vacation.  And I'm really organizing--I've got two partners and I'm sort of organizing to try and shift some of the management over to them.  And so that I can cut down the stress level of the, of the business and sort of be a senior counselor.
Speaker 1: So you don't really feel at this juncture that you have any cases more that you want to try.
Speaker 2: Well I won't say that that's the case.  I don't have anything to prove anymore.  I'm a great believer that you can't get money out of cases unless you load the gun well and that you are prepared to go to court and fire that weapon.  And I think that I'm, I'm prepared right now.  I mean like the last year I tried two cases; that's enough.  One case was in Nashville, Tennessee.  The defendants offered us 50,000 dollars for the death of a thirty-four year old autistic mentally retarded black man who had been asphyxiated by the police when they cuffed him and bound his legs and sat on him and laid him on his belly until he died.  So we tried the case.  And asked the jury for about ten, ten million dollars I think.  They awarded us 4.4 million dollars.  That was a big thrill to, to, to be able to walk in on those guys and say "Okay, you don't wanna play fair, let's go to war."  We went to war, we were successful.  I enjoyed that, that was a big high that I got out of that.  Fortunately I have good people working with me, and I didn't have the full burden of the trial.  And it's--I still enjoy it.

Speaker 1: And what, what would you say makes a good litigator?
Speaker 2: Well you got to have the ability to think on your feet, number one.  You've got to have the--you gotta be able to prepare.  You've got to have a good average mind like mine.  You don't have to be real smart.  You have to have the resources to actually make your case, to hire the appropriate expert witnesses, to get the appropriate visual aids because jurors nowadays look--they, they prefer to see things in this modern technological era.  We, we now have courtrooms that are pretty much automated with screens that pull out of the wall and with devices that will allow you to put a film clip on the screen, or put a still picture on the screen.  And it really takes--it takes somebody who's willing to dedicate himself for a period of time completely to a case.  That is both the pre-trial preparation and the trial itself.  Trials mean that you work from nine until five, or, or ten till five.  It means that you go, go have some dinner.  It means you work another three or four hours at night in your hotel or in your office.  It means that you get up the next morning and you work another hour.  It's a all--it's all an all-consuming process and it requires you to be aware of everything that's going on in that courtroom so that you can protect your record and what's going on before that jury.
Speaker 1: You have a profound love for the law don't you?
Speaker 2: I do, I do.  When I started, I thought the law was a noble profession and I sort of insisted that people treat it that way.  And then I learned from--the reality was that the law, that lady justice peeped all the time.  And she was not blind.  And I, I guess the motivating force for me is a, is a kind of idealism.  The kind of angry disappointment at what really exists in the system.  And with a desire to try and at least make it right in this case or that case.

Speaker 1: Now with--what do you believe in terms of African Americans and the law?  You know as a profession; as something that--because you've done good.  You've, you've had a career that you were able to do good while doing something that you love.  And I'm just wondering for young African Americans coming along, do you have any advice for them?
Speaker 2: Well I, I can't, I can't say I don't because I, I, I'm advising young lawyers and people who are talking about going into law all the time.  I guess what I would say to them first is to make sure that in your undergraduate studies, that you have a good business background because the law is a business, and it's a difficult business.  It is not what I thought it was.  And you need to be able to understand that in order to do good for your clients, you've got to be a good businessperson so that you can finance your operation, make a decent living, and then be able to serve your clients.  You gotta recognize that the law is a segregated business.  The practice is a segregated business.  Don't let that stop you from trying to get involved with Fortune 500 corporations, getting involved with major law firms.  But you gotta know what the downsides are of doing the big law firm.  I find many young people who go into these large law firms who come from the finest law schools, and who spend most of their first five years before they are rejected in the partnership track.  And they haven't had the kind of experience that will make them valuable to somebody like me.  Whereas if they had started with somebody like me, they would have been exposed to the courthouse at an early time and, and by the time five years roll around, would be able to be independently able to move into the, into the litigation area.  I would also think that it would be very important for African American lawyers to understand that the bulk of the people who are going to seek out your services are people who can ill afford your services.  And that because of that, you have to get away from the temptation of undertaking so many cases for so little money that you can't serve anybody, not even yourself, and that you run a high risk of neglecting your clients' cases and losing your license.  That's about what comes to mind.

Speaker 1: And with--what do you see as the next horizon or things legally that face maybe the African American community?  Do you see that?  Or is--or the next hurdle.  Let's say maybe it's not a legal hurdle.  Do you see--
Speaker 2: I think that probably the biggest deficit in the black community is that we don't have organized, independent think tanks.  I think we need that more than anything because what we don't have--we, we are not involved in planning, in strategizing, in developing agenda, in focusing on what's happening to the masses of black people.  What I call you know the people by whom all of us are judged.  There is no bourgeoisie, ought not be any bourgeoisie because when a policeman decides he's gonna stop you for driving while black, it doesn't matter whether you are a Ph.D or somebody on ADC [Aid to Dependent Children].  I think that we need to have a collective that gets, that's independent.  Problem is if you, if you're not independent, you can't--you're vulnerable.  You're vulnerable to being corrupted, used.  And I think probably one of the most pervasive problems that we have as a community arises from and extends all the way back to slavery.  We still have been burdened by our deep-seated feelings of inferiority and white superiority.  Until we can focus and until we can try and stop that plague from traveling from generation to generation, we're doomed.  And it happens.  It is--not only does it happen from mother to daughter to son to father to son, generation after generation, it is fed and nurtured in the media, in the educational system.  We don't even know our own history and what we think of our own history is all negative.  And if we knew who we were, that might go a long way of helping us escape this slave mentality.  Makes me wanna cry.
Speaker 1: Makes me wanna cry too.

Speaker 1: Let me--I, I always end with a legacy question, so just in case.  But what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Basically that I have been privileged to be economically independent, even when I was broke.  And, and that's so important to me.  It's been a family trait that's been the last two generations that I know about.  And one of the reasons that I've always been my own boss is because of it--of the feeling there's a need to be independent.  One of the reasons why I started caring about money in the law business was because, you know, I wanted to be independent.  I wanted to be able to speak my mind when I thought it was important to speak my mind.  I wanted to try and be an instrument of change.  I feel like I have had an opportunity to change the way African American lawyers are perceived in this community, and maybe others.  That's about all I can think of.
Speaker 1: And what, what does Jim Montgomery wanna do with his life before he takes his last breath?
Speaker 2: Write about four books.  That's what I'd like to do.
