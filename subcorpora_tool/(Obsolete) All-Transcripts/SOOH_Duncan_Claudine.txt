 Wilson  Duncan  Today is April 6, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I am  west of Frederick, in the home of Claudine  Duncan. I   m talking with Claudine today for the Spotlighting Oklahoma  oral history project. Thank you for having me. To start out with, would  you mind telling me when and where you were born?  I was born two miles west and three miles north of Frederick, Oklahoma  in a farm home on my Grandfather Woods    farm. My parents were  Floyd Woods and Texie Hayes-Woods.  My grandfather was Edgar  Woods.   How do you spell Texie?  T-E-X-I-E. (Laughs)  So, were you the first child?  No, I was the last one. I have two brothers and a sister.  They are all  deceased now.   And was your father a farmer?  Yes, he was.  What crops did he farm?  Well, we did lots of cotton. In fact, I did most of the cotton chopping  and hoeing on all the acres. Then as my brothers could get off of the  teams and my dad, they would come and help me. But I know one year,  we had 105 acres of cotton, and they   re all half-mile long rows. I helped  go over, and you went more than one time. You went to thin the cotton,  5  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  which was chopping it. And you went to hoe the cotton, which was  taking the weeds out of it. And walked. It was hot in the summer and it  was hard work, but it was good for me.  How old were you when you started doing that?  Oh, probably eight. Somewhere around that.  And would there be many other people out there doing the same job?  No, because it was just our family that did that  on our farm . When it  came time to harvest the cotton, I was in school. We didn   t turn out of  school in our little school. We didn   t turn out for the harvest. Some  schools did. I would go after I got home from school in the afternoons  and maybe pull some cotton with the ole sack over your shoulder.  (Laughs) And help keep the weights as I grew older and so forth, but  that   s what we did. We had cotton, and we also had wheat and oats. We  used to shock the wheat, cut it with a binder, and have the different  shocks of wheat. Then we   d go out in the field and put them   stand two  against each other and then stack the others around them and make the  big stack.  For the bundle wagons, when we went to thresh it, they would come by  with their pitchforks and put that on their wagon and take it to the big ol     thresher. Not every farmer had his own thresher. There was a thresher  that either neighbors or someone came in and brought and had their own  crew. They would thresh for us. After that threshing, the wheat or oats or  whatever it was, was put in the bin in the barn. But we had this big stack,  straw stack out there. So, after it settled, after it rained and all, of course,  first, it   s chaffy and you couldn   t get  on it . But after that, we had a ball,  you know, playing on the haystack and sliding down. (Laughter) Really  enjoyed that.  How long would it take to get a bundle of wheat together?  I don   t know what you mean. To get it together? Well, see, when the  binders went down, they cut it and bound it with binding twine.  Well, how much wheat made up a bundle?  Well, they were probably about this big around. (Gestures) They had the  string around them, so you could grab it by the binder twine to handle it.  It   d probably take, if you put two together and one around it, it would  probably take ten or twelve bundles to make that shock, big stack of it  for the wagons to pick up.  6  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  And then with cotton, when you had the sack on you, how much would  that weigh?  Do you know, I don   t remember for sure. Not too much, because it does  get awful heavy to drag. You put it over your shoulder to walk to the  wagon, and then you have to put it up on the scales to weigh it. You  have to get it up there and turn it around and weigh it, and then that   s  recorded by the person that   s keeping all the weight to pay people. Then  they throw it up on the wagon and there   s somebody up there that  empties it out and throws you your sack back down and you go back   (Laughs) I don   t know exactly, because as I grew up, of course, that  increased. But we had men, grown men, and people that came to pick  cotton. But actually, they might pull one hundred pounds or more. I   ve  forgotten how much, but they had long sacks, much longer than mine.  They had them full. I   ve just forgotten how much a day they could pull,  but they made pretty good money by doing that. They   d come out and  have a crew come out.  My dad would take the wagon load of cotton after we got it picked and  on there and it piled high as we could get. They had a man in there that  tromped it. He went in with his feet and tried to tromp it down, so we  could get more on the wagon. After the day was over, Dad would hitch  up the horses to the wagon and had to go to Frederick to the gin. He   d be  overnight, because when he got down there, there was a long line of  wagons waiting to be ginned. So, it was a pretty hard life, but we didn   t  know it. I never did have any feeling that it was hard. I never did. I  enjoyed working, and we had a lot of fun with the other things that we  did.  What were some of the things you did? What would you do for  entertainment?  Well, I   ll tell you one thing we did. When we got the crops laid by   it  was August, the latter part of August. We usually had the last week in  August off before school started. That is when we took our vacation.  The way we took our vacation, we loaded up cots and bedding and  groceries and everything we might need for a week and went up to the  Wichita Mountains, because then we were allowed to camp there. They  won   t let them now because of liquor and guns. Can   t keep them  overnight except in one restricted area that   s policed and watched. But  the rest of it, they have to close off. But we went and we camped out  there and we stayed all week. We took food. We had hams we   d cured,   home canned fruits and vegetables  and things like that. Then we also  would take fryers, chickens in cages, and just put them out under the  trees, feed them and take care of them and then we would   when we got  ready to eat them, we   d just kill them and dress them right there like we  7  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  did at home.  We cooked over campfires with Dutch ovens, iron skillets,  coffee pots, etc.   How would you all kill your chickens?  We   d wring their necks. There   s an art to that. Some people get them,  they just go round and round and round and put them down, they run off.  But when you go to go around with them, you jerk on it a little and it  breaks the neck. It sounds awful, but I   ve done it many, many times. We  raised chickens here, lots of them. Hang them up by one foot, by a wire  on the tree. And then you start there and you strip the skin off. We didn   t  ever   oh, on special occasions, after they were dead, we might dip them  in a thing of real hot water and pick them. That leaves the skin on. But  just maybe for Thanksgiving or something. But the rest of the time we  skinned them. I didn   t like the skin anyway. (Laughter)  But anyway, in the mountains we would have the swimming holes,  there. I   ve got lots of pictures from that time. That   s where I learned to  swim. My dad took me down there and showed me how to dog paddle,  keep from drowning. (Laughter) As we grew up, that   s where he      Jack  and his folks also did the same, but we didn   t know them then,  until we moved closer to here. I didn   t know him (her husband Jack)  until I was in high school. Anyway, we   d spend our vacation there and  climb the mountains and swim in the pools. We took games to play on  the big ol    concrete tables. I can remember the way we had any news or  music, we had the old radios that had the battery with it. We   d take an  orange crate and put the radio on top and put the battery in the bottom.  So, we did have the music and the news up there.  What are some radio shows you remember listening to?  Oh, I don   t know. Just all of those old ones. The Lone Ranger,  Lum and  Abner . I really hadn   t thought about it. (Laughter) But anyway,  those  vacations were  something we looked forward to all the time. I  lived   two west and three north, which was Bethel Church Community. Burt   s  Spur, where the railroad track went through there, there was a spur right  there. My school was just right east of that, on the corner from that  railroad spur and the store that was there. I   d go to school and we kids  would have pennies. We could go there and buy penny candy at noon.  Sometimes I   d walk up there. It wasn   t even a quarter of a mile, maybe  an eighth of a mile. It wasn   t far. We   d go up there and back during the  noon hour.  I rode my horse. I rode a horse all my younger life and loved it. I   d ride  my horse to school. And then we had trees out by the road, and I   d take  her saddle off and her bridle. I had a rope and tied her to the tree, and  8  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  she   d stand there in the shade while I went to school. Then at four, I   d  go out and saddle her and bridle her. (Laughs) I had a neighbor girl that  did the same thing with her horse, so we had company. A lot of the kids  walked. I walked many times. It was two miles from where I lived. It  wasn   t far, then. Isn   t too far, yet. But I would ride my horse in the  summer a lot, that   s what I did for     How old were you when you started riding a horse?  Oh, I   m not even sure. Real young. I had two older brothers, see, and  they already had the horse and the saddle. They were ahead of me in  school, but while they were still going out there, sometimes, why, we   d  ride double. I   d ride with one of my brothers on that. So, I don   t know. I  probably started riding about six, or something like that. (Laughter)  What was the name of your school?  Union District 146.  And how long did you attend school there?  Eight years. Had two rooms. And rural schools, then, were every three  miles apart. So, the kids wouldn   t have to walk more than three miles to  school.  And was there one teacher for the eight grades?  No, it was a two-room schoolhouse, so there were two teachers. One for  what we call the little room and one for the big room. (Laughter) It was  heated with a big coal stove. Of course, the teacher had to take care of  that. We had a teacher lodge on the premises where they lived there. But  we had wonderful times at school. We played out   of course,  everything, basketball courts and everything were just dirt. (Laughs) But  we didn   t know any different. We just enjoyed it.  Do you know how many kids went to that school when you did?  Well, probably about forty. Maybe twenty in each room, around that.  What are some games you would play?   Drop the Handkerchief and Go In and Out the Window.  We played  Red Rover. Have you ever heard of that?  Yes, I   ve played Red Rover. (Laughter)  9  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Yes  (Laughs) We had a baseball team, too. I played basketball and  baseball, because we didn   t have enough boys to have the team.  (Laughs) So, I played first base most of the time.  With the boys?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And same way with the basketball. There was one boy  that was especially good. Of course, I   m not bragging, I   m just saying, I  was the girl, and so if we could get on the same team we had it made.  (Laughter) They didn   t have a chance. We had merry-go-rounds and  ocean waves, they called them. I don   t remember any slides, but we  had   what do you call it? (Gestures)  Teeter totters?  Yes, but we didn   t call it that     See-saws?  See-saws. We had see-saws. (Laughter) Of course, we had the outdoor  toilets, girls and boys. Then when we had classes, when the teacher rang  the bell   usually, it was a couple and the wife taught the first four and  the husband taught the last four, the higher four grades. But usually  when they   d ring that bell, we   d all go line up in front of our   we had  our certain place because when we marched in, we had a certain seat that  we sat in all day, you know. We always did say, in the morning early,  we always said our Pledge of Allegiance and all those good things. I  don   t know whether kids even get to do that anymore or not.  I   ll tell you one drawback. Our little school, all the seats faced south,  inside. The teacher was over there. (Gestures) All of your books were  facing south. Do you know what that does to geography? Right now,  you know, I would say that New York is up yonder, okay? And Florida,  down here. I mean, every time from years past, even to now, when it   s  mentioned about a location, in my mind, I have to go to that and then  turn it around and face north and decide where they are. That   s a  handicap. That   s a handicap.  Yes, they just didn   t think about it, I guess.  I don   t know. I   m sure they didn   t. I   ve never discussed it with any of  the other kids, but I wondered if that bothered all of them. I would think  that it would. (Laughs) But I really   I   ve really noticed that all my life,  that everything is turned backwards because I faced south in my  schoolroom. (Laughter)  10  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Would you bring your lunch?  We brought our lunch. Out in the, what we called the, cloak room, when  you march in, it   s a cloak room and then the main room. That   s where  we hung our coats. We also had like a bench here, but it was enclosed  with a lid on it where you can put down. That   s where we put our  lunches, down in there. We usually just took   my favorite lunch was  when my mother would cook ham or bacon, because we raised our own  pigs and had our own milk and cattle   I mean the cows, and the butter  and all that. But my mother would cook either bacon or ham or sausage  for breakfast  and have  enough over that we could take a sandwich for  dinner.  Then sometimes, when we got home after four, if we were on the horse  or got home quicker, otherwise it   s going to be later than that to walk  two miles, but I   d always go straight to the cabinet where she kept the  leftovers and see if there might be some cold ham and a biscuit. Mother  made biscuits every morning, every morning for six of us, so she usually  had some left over. I remember how good that was because you were  just starving by four or five o   clock. (Laughter) I remember how good  that tasted.  What are some other foods she would make?  Oh, just everything good. We had a lot of fried potatoes because we  raised our own potatoes and onions and things like that. She wasn   t the  same type cook that Ms. Duncan was, his mother. (Refers to husband)  She was an excellent cook and my mom was, too, but my mom was  more the practical everyday things. His mother could do all that, but she  made the bread and she made the rolls and she made the cinnamon rolls.  All the extra things. Some things, I don   t remember, when we married or  when we were dating and I   d go to his house for lunch or dinner, why, it  would be my first time to taste certain things, which was regular with  them. I guess according to how you   re raised, but my mother made  excellent pies and cakes and everything. I didn   t suffer any for  something good to eat. But we could not afford things like pineapple,  shrimp. We had no seafood, anything like that. We had a good market in  Frederick that stocked a lot of things like that, but we didn   t trade there.  We traded down at the other little store that had beans and potatoes.  And that was in the Bethel area?  Yes, it   s Bethel and Union School and the   what   d I tell you? (Laughs)  The railroad. Burt   s Spur, that was named for our neighbors. Good, good  friends. I   ve still got little books and things that she gave me when I was  a baby and a little older. There   s a Burt   s Lake right out here, too, down  11  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  this road between here and Frederick, between here and Alco, out there  that   s named for that family.  And how do you spell their name?  B-U-R-T. A lot of people don   t know that that   s what it is. It   s Burt   s  Spur, and it   s Burt   s Lake. I know them and I know about that lake. That  lake had a lot of waterslides and things. Really nice, for then. We   d go  there, maybe on a weekend or something special was going on. We did  go there because that was close to us, there. And they had big ol    trees  with the swings that had the ropes go way out there to the limbs that you  could swing way out. I remember those swings. We could swim in the  lake. So, we had picnics and things there  at no charge .  We also had a guy kind of connected   I mean connected with my  remembering   that had an airplane and that was new. So, one of our  neighbor guys, they were a lot older than me, but they kind of favored  me sometimes and were good to me. One of them asked my folks if he  could take me in that airplane for a ride. (Laughter) That was scary,  then. So, they said yes and that was my first airplane ride. I was  probably about eight, nine, somewhere in there. (Laughs)  What was it like?  Well, it was really   I wasn   t scared. What I noticed most, I think, was  looking down and seeing all the land, the farms in squares, the cotton  and wheat and things like that. It didn   t last very long. They just made a  big ol    circle and came back, but that   s what I remember about it.  Was it enclosed completely?  Yes, it was.  How many people could fit in it?  That was it, the pilot and  my  friend and me. (Laughs) Of course, I was  little. But that guy was the pilot. I don   t have any idea where he came  from or who he was. Our first airplane owner here lived right west of  Frederick. This is west, not north, really. We   re just a mile north of the  highway, a mile north of Frederick and then west. That big curve is  west. Go straight west and then turn north on that curve to Tipton. That   s  where you turn north and of course our road comes down north from the  highway. There was a family that lived in the house you   ll see west of  Frederick, it   s a big two-story on  the south  side, and it   s a big, brick-rock  looking house with big long white columns in front that faces the  east. If you go through there, you   ll notice it. But his folks were well-to-  12  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  do. They bought their son an airplane and he learned to fly it. (Laughs)  So, that was our community   s first plane, first pilot.  What were their names? Do you remember?  Oh, I know their names, if I think just a minute. Boaz, B-O-A-Z, I think.  It might have been B-O-A-S-E. I   m not sure. But his name was Bucy, B-U-  C-Y. (Laughs) Bucy Boaz. Oh, man, that has really been a long time  ago. That was in the    20s. Let   s see, I was born in    21. If I was eight,  that   d be    29. That was in the very last of the    20s or the very first of the     30s.  When was your birthday?  February 3, 1921. His  Jack   s  is in 1918. April 15, which is coming  right up  Tax day. I said well, he was here long before income tax day.  (Laughter) He   s got a real interesting history himself.  How did your parents come to this area?  They came up from like down in Texas, around Decatur and places like  that.  Were they married when they came here, or did they meet here?  No, they met here. My dad   s folks settled right west of Frederick on the  other mile, a mile south of Highway 5. Where I   m a mile north here, the  Frederick airport was out there, then. It was one mile south, which came  out of Frederick, the south end of Frederick out there. The airport was  there at that time. My dad had horses, and he and a lot of his friends his  age had horses. So, out there by that airport they had a racetrack. When I  was working for the Tillman County Monument Company of Frederick,  I had a nice gentleman come in and introduce himself, which I knew his  name, but I didn   t ever  know  him. He lived there in Frederick all that  time. He wanted to come and tell me about my dad. Wasn   t that nice?  Yes.  He said they used to go out there and race horses. He remembered all  that and remembered my dad   s family. I said something about my dad   s  horse and he said,    Your dad had a good horse and won most of the  races.    (Laughter) But I really appreciated that. I thought that was so  kind of him and caring and thoughtful to know that I   d be interested in  that. Of course, he   s long gone. There   s none of those people left.  So, would people bet on the horse races?  13  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Oh, probably. (Laughter) Probably, but I don   t know.  So, where did your parents meet?  After Dad lived out there by the airport, they moved up close to where I  was born, the Woods  farm . The Hayes, my mother   s people, when they  came, they settled out just a little bit north of that Union School and had  a farm there, in the proximity, whatever they did in those days. I know  they had parties and get-togethers and church. See, that Bethel Church,  my grandfather Hayes, my mother   s dad, was the deacon in that church.  I   ve got the history of it in here, but I   ve forgotten what year it was  started. But it   s been there a long time. So, I know that they went to that,  so probably   I don   t know about school. They went to Union School,  but I don   t know about my dad. But the Hayes did. My aunts and those  went to Union School, where I went. (Laughs) Isn   t that something?  They   re long gone.  When did Union School close?  I can   t tell you what year. I know that a lot of the schools consolidated  and Union went in with Frederick. Jack   s school was right down here  where that old gin was.  What was it called?  Well, the actual name of it is Alpian, A-L-P-I-A-N, but there was a gin  there and a store and the school. It was all Alpian Gin and Alpian Store  and Alpian School. But in later years, that school went in with Weaver,  consolidated. That   s where he went to high school is Weaver, down  here. They have a reunion coming up week after next, but he won   t be  able to go. He can   t see or hear them, so there   s not any future in going.  When the Chickasha Gin Company came in from up, I guess Chickasha,  I don   t know where they came from, they bought all that. So, they didn   t  know anything about the history or anything else. So, they just named it  Alpine instead of Alpian, A-L-P-I-A-N. Because the Alpian was named  way back when Jack   s grandfather came here from Missouri, from  Pennsylvania, from Missouri, came on down here and proved up on all  this land. Anyway, when they came, they helped start Sunday school and  stuff. They had it down there. I can remember him trying to tell that, that  they helped organize the first Sunday school that was in the region.  Where did Jack   s family come from, from Missouri?  They actually came from Ireland. Then they came through Pennsylvania.  They settled in there somewhere, this way. (Gestures) My map is up  14  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  there  (Laughter) I don   t know where they were. They   d always been in  Pennsylvania. Part of that history shows something a little bit about  coming out of Ohio, maybe, or Iowa. Somewhere in there. But anyway,  they  know  his family left Pennsylvania and came by wagon train. They  came as far as Missouri on the way to California. When they got to  Missouri, it was getting wintertime and a lot of them were ill, and they  decided to stay over the winter up in Missouri. We   ve been up there and  been to all the places and all the cemeteries and all the names and  everything. It   s so interesting. I have all that in here, stacks of it.  (Laughs) But anyway, after they stayed there all spring, they decided  they would just stay and they didn   t want to go on to California. They  liked it and they liked the people. That   s where his mother and dad met,  was up there.  So, about what year were they in Missouri?  Well, I could look that up. I can   t tell you exactly what year. I know that  after they married his granddad  George Alexander Duncan  came on  down to Lawton down to the drawing, or whatever they called it for the  land opening, you know, rush  in 1902 . They did have a drawing. He  came on down for that and his grandmother stayed in Missouri with the  son. They had one son,  Jack   s  dad,  Walter Samuel Duncan . He came  on down and he got in the line for the drawing and the guy right ahead  of him got the last one. So, when he turned around to Grandpa and  offered to just sell it to him, he bought it. He just bought that for two  hundred dollars. It was to this land that we   re living on right here.  (Laughs)  Wow.  So, it was real interesting. But that   s how   he had to come and prove it  up for a year. They had to live on it for a year before he could really  claim it. That was part of the government   s deal. So, he made a half-dugout  and he and his sister   he had a sister that was a tomboy, red  headed, rode the horses, which women didn   t much do in those days.  (Laughs) Kind of tomboyish and a great person. But she came down to  help him and that was a big adventure in those days. The closest place to  go for supplies, and all that, in those days was either clear back to  Lawton, or, if you could get across the river, you could go to Vernon,  Texas and get it. So, you either had to lay in a lot of groceries that would  keep, like potatoes I guess. I don   t know what they did. (Laughs)  But anyway, they did that, and then his  grand mother and his dad,  (Jack   s dad), came on down and they built a house and all that later. I   ve  got all that history in there and it   s really interesting. Even if your  children aren   t very interested in it right now, when they get older they  15  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  will be, to trace it back. But it was really interesting. I remember him  saying one time when they had that church down here, that Sunday  school, his mother played the organ. Well, she never had a music lesson  in her life. I thought about that. I never did get to ask her about it. I   d  forget about it, but I thought,    Well, isn   t that neat?    They didn   t have  any music in their home, really.  So, what were his parents    names?  Walter  Samuel Duncan  and Cora  Effie Tindle  Duncan. He is Walter  Junior, but his dad said,    I   m not going to call him Junior.    He didn   t  like it. He said,    I   m going to call him Jack.    So, the whole country here  knows Jack Duncan. Like me and Nelma, people don   t know who  Nelma is, but they know Claudine.  So, is Claudine your middle name?  Yes. Then when the government comes along, they don   t care what your  middle name is. Everything is first name. (Laughs) All the legal papers  and everything.  Did you ever hear any stories from his family about what it was like in  those early days?  Oh, yes. Yes, lots of them. It was farming, you know, it was just manual,   and with mules . It was hard work, but nobody expected anything  different. Of course, their tools were either one-row or two-row and a  half-mile on the 160 acres. It takes a long time to get over. (Laughs)  And was there a water source?  Oh, yes. They dug wells and they also had cisterns where they made the  roof of the houses would channel the water down from the rains and go  into the cistern. So, they always had that water. We didn   t have droughts  like we had last year. (Laughs)  Yes, last year was bad.  We had over 100 days over 100 degrees. It wasn   t all together lack of  rain that killed everything, I even lost trees and things like that. It was  the intense heat for such a prolonged period. You couldn   t go outside. It  was 100, 106, 113. You just couldn   t. You just had to come in under the  air conditioner unless you got out really early. And even all night, it was  in the nineties and close to 100.  So, if you were living in a dugout with that kind of temperature     16  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Yes, the dugouts were cool. They were pretty cool because they were  underground. But you think about all the bugs and the spiders and     Snakes. (Laughter)  They may not have had big trouble with that. That   s what your  imagination will tell you. That didn   t have to last too long, because after  they served that time and maybe even before that, they began to build  and make things more comfortable, livable. (Laughs) It   d take a long  time to tell all about it.  How did you meet Jack?  Well, when I was thirteen, fourteen, we moved from where I was born.  I   d been there all that time on my grandfather   s farm. My grandfather  decided to move back to the farm, so my dad rented this farm on the  highway. If you come west of Frederick, there was a house there four  and a half miles, we   re five. So, we   re right up on that hill. That was the  drawing line between Frederick district and Weaver district. He was a  senior at Weaver when I moved up there, and I was a freshman. I guess  he was getting ready to be a senior because he wasn   t that much older.  But anyway, I started my freshman year in Frederick. But as we farmed  this land up here, I was out there with the hoe, hoeing the cotton. Just the  usual, I never thought anything about it. I freckled really easy. I hated  hats. I never had time for them. I was busy climbing in the barn and  riding the horse, and I just didn   t worry about that. But my mother had  gotten a bonnet on me that day and I was coming down that hill down to  this road, down there next to the highway hoeing cotton. Jack saw me  out there. So, he told his mother   he lived on the corner, and he told his  mother,    I want to go up this road and see if I can find that ole turkey  nest.    I don   t know if he told her that first or when he got back. But he  said,    I think her nest is out and may have some eggs up there,    because  Ms. Duncan raised turkeys as well as chickens.  He saw me up there, so he timed it to where he   d get out there at the  time I got to the end. That   s where I met him, right there. Of course, we  didn   t talk long. When he got back, why, he told his mother, he said     well, he said he went up there to look for the old turkey nest. She said,     Honey, we sold all the turkeys. We don   t have turkeys anymore.     (Laughter) So, he tells that story and she laughed because she knew what  he was doing. So, it wasn   t long until he called me. We had the old ring  telephones on the wall, where you ring them up, party line.  So, he called me one Saturday or one Sunday about noon. He asked me  17  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  if he could take me   in those days, the churches were so hot and were  not air conditioned. But we had what we called arbors that we built  outside and put the benches in. And then overhead, you had the limbs on  to make the shade, and so our church was having one down here at the  gin yard. They had built it on there to get all this community to come.  He said he wanted to know if he could come take me. He had a Model A  that his dad had got him when he was sixteen, I guess, seventeen. He  was about seventeen, then, going on eighteen, getting ready to be a  senior in high school. So, that was our first date, going to church under  that arbor. I was about fourteen.  I dated a few guys after that, but not too many because by the time I got  to be a junior or senior   I did go to the junior banquet, but with another  boy. But by the time I got to be a senior, he didn   t want me going with  anybody else. He wanted to go steady. (Laughter) So, he took me and  put me out at the hotel for our junior/senior banquet there in Frederick  and then picked me up. We didn   t dance, so we didn   t go to the dance or  anything like that. But anyway, we had lots of fun.  We did lots of dating with other couples. One of the couples, the lady is  still living at Blair, that was at the Hotel Frederick when it was first  built. Her uncle had a pharmacy there. She worked for him there. Well,  the hotel had a night clerk, and so they began to date and we went with  them and then with other couples from out here. From around Weaver  and all that. We had so much fun. We   d all go up to the mountains and  take picnics and just had lots of fun. That lady up there is ninety     probably -six, now   or maybe -seven. But she and we are the only ones  out of all that group that are left. We still correspond all the time, and  she has a daughter that lives in Frederick, so she comes there  occasionally.  Where does she live?  Blair, up there by Altus. She   s had knee surgery and eye surgery and I  don   t know what all, just keeps a going  (Laughs)  What   s her name?  Naomi Tripp. She was Naomi Walker when she was working at the  Hotel Frederick because she was working for her uncle and it was  Walker   s Drug. She was working in there. (Laughs) So, we were there  when the Hotel Frederick was built and the Ramona Theater. We were  there. When we   d go to the show on Saturday   on Saturday, you could  go to the nine o   clock show, the second showing, and stay for the  preview, which didn   t start until one. So, that night, we got to stay out  late.  18  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  What was funny, we watched Frankenstein and it was so scary that we  were scared all the way home  (Laughter) I   ll be  I laugh about the kids  now because they have some pretty scary stuff going. My grandson will  say something about it and gives him nightmares, you know. I said,     Yeah, we used to watch Frankenstein, that was pretty scary.     (Laughter) Nothing to compare with what they show now, because I  don   t even want to see it. I haven   t been to a movie in years because the  last time I went, it was so full of cursing and terrible words and stuff,  and it   s just progressively gotten worse, evidently. Everything, so I said,     No use in cluttering your mind up with that.     So, was the Ramona Theater the first movie theater you went to?  No, no, there were three or four other movie theaters that were westerns,  small things. That   s where you got to see all the old westerns   and I  didn   t go to those. That was before I met him. But he did. He was a great  cowboy fan. But I didn   t go to those because we didn   t go to town but  once a week and that was to buy groceries and clothes or shoes or school  supplies, whatever we needed. But we didn   t have money for movies.  After we started dating, there was a hamburger place right across the  street from the Ramona, Star   s Hamburgers. They were so good.  (Laughter) So, you could go in there and get a hamburger and you could  go across the street then, to the Ramona, and see the one show or the two  on Saturday. I think the hamburger was   I don   t know whether it was  ten cents or    I know it wasn   t over a quarter. But I think about that, and  so that   s what we would do. We   d go in there and eat a hamburger and  go across the street and go to the show. (Laughter)  And would people drink soda, ever, then? Would you get a soda with  your hamburger?  Oh, yes. Well, yes we did. Yes, we had sodas.  What did he do when he graduated high school?  Farmed.  Okay. So, you were still close.  Yes. Yes, he graduated in    36, and I graduated in    38.  Both from Weaver.  No. Remember, I said we were on the line and I went to Frederick.  19  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Okay. You stayed at Frederick until you graduated.  We had a teacher from Frederick named Myrtle Mays   I mean from  Tipton named Myrtle Mays, that was one of my teachers. She would  come by and pick me up on the way coming to school, and then he   d  (Jack) pick me up, usually at three, because I   d get out at three if I  wanted to because I had study hall, then.  Would you ever go to Tipton?  Not during those years, hardly ever. Now, after we married, he did a lot  of work at Tipton. He worked on the orphan   s home with his brother  who is a carpenter. Also, he did a lot of custom hay work. He   d go and  cut the hay for people. He did the cutting, he didn   t do the baling. But  because of that, he knows a lot more people at Tipton than I do. We just  didn   t have any reason to go to Tipton. We did everything in Frederick.  What little we did. (Laughter)  Well, when did you two get married?  We got married in May 27, 1939. It   s coming up next month.  What anniversary are you celebrating?  Well,    39 and seventy-three makes 2012. (Laughs)  So, seventy-three years of marriage     In May, yes. And living in the same house.  Oh, yes. Tell me about this house.  When we married, his folks had   in May, his folks had started  probably   because we   d already set the date   they started early. I don   t  know whether in January, February, March, somewhere in there, they  started building us a house here on this eighty, and they built the  bungalow type, which is what was right here through the middle. It was  the living room from the front door, which was over there, then straight  back to this wall, right there where that china cabinet is. (Gestures) That  was the living room and dining room because we had one of those big  old round tables. Behind that was the kitchen and then a back porch.  Then on the other side of that was the front bedroom and the hall with  the bathroom and the back bedroom. When we got back from our  honeymoon, which was Oklahoma City and we went to Spring Lake.  (Laughs) Not even there anymore. I could tell you some funny stories  20  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  about Spring Lake. But anyway, when we got back from our  honeymoon, they had the house all ready.  Wow.  His grandmother had died just the year before, and his grandfather  moved out with his dad and mother and they took care of him until he  died in February before we married. When they closed the house that  they lived in, in Frederick   because they originally lived out here, but  they moved to Frederick and his mother and dad moved in that house  that they   d built. That   s where he (Jack) was born. But anyway, when  she died, Ms. Duncan (Jack   s grandmother), she was such an unusual  person. I never did really tell her all I needed to tell her about how much  I loved and appreciated her. (Laughs) I did my best.  But anyway, she kept the furniture. She kept the linens, the curtains,  everything because she knew we were getting married. She moved that  stuff into her house because it wasn   t too long, but that was when she  died, though. That was probably two years. I don   t know how long, but  anyways, she kept everything. So, when they got the house finished    I  mean, they had hardwood floors and had them polished and shining and  all. Back there, we didn   t have anything but pull-down blinds. But when  we got home, all the windows, all the curtains, the beds were made, the  dishes were in the kitchen, the living room furniture was in, couch and  chairs    I mean, she just moved their stuff in for us. It meant so much.  Later, we got Venetian blinds, which were a big deal, then. But right  then, that was sufficient. I still have some of those things. I still have  some of those linens put away. (Laughs)  What wonderful in-laws.  That   s what I said. And he wasn   t an only child. He did have a younger  brother, but he was seven years younger than Jack. So, all of this in the  meantime then, in those years, why, they got Bob a house and put up on  the next eighty when he married. That   s Erma Duncan   s husband. But  Bob had a birth defect in the kidney, evidently because he had a terrible  babyhood and couldn   t gain weight and I don   t know what all. But he  got better, went into the service. They drafted him into the service. Then  when he got out from that, he and Erma married. You know all that, but  see, he had so many complications. We just finally lost him. It was sad.  It was hard on Jack, too.  What are your Spring Lake stories, your stories from Spring Lake?  Oh, Spring Lake. Okay, we went up there on our honeymoon. My sister  and her husband were over at Edmond. He was going to school there as  21  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  a teacher. So, we got a motel in Oklahoma City, but we would meet  them out at Spring Lake sometimes. We went out there that night, and  they had this big   what do you call it? Like, to ride, the big thing     Oh, like a Ferris wheel?  No, no, the big one. Like down and     A roller coaster?  Roller coaster. They had the big roller coaster. We   d never been on one.  We looked at that thing and I said,    I don   t want to go on that. No, I  don   t have any desire. We   ll just go do something else.    No, he wanted  to ride it. He wanted to ride it. He just kept insisting and insisting. I said,     Well, okay.    (Laughter) So, we got on it, and they put the bar across  there and we started. Well, you go out there, you know, so far and you  begin to gain speed and you get out there. When you do, you just can   t  see anything but sky out there, but you just drop straight down. (Laughs)  The whole ride, from that, he was holding onto that bar and when it  would go down, he would come up. I was sitting there the whole ride,  holding him down  (Laughter) When we finally got back to where we  started, the guy came to undo the bar, his hands were clamped so tight  around it he couldn   t turn loose  And I said,    Yeah       He never rode  another one since. (Laughter)  That   s a great newlywed story   I said,    You insisted on riding it.    It didn   t scare me that bad because I  didn   t have time to even sit up and see. I tried to keep him from going  overboard. Of course, they have those buckles on you, but he   d just  come up. (Laughter) That was really funny. Jack worked all his life,  really. When he was about fourteen, maybe, he had a neighbor that was  doing slush pits for some oil property down south of here a little ways.  What are slush pits?  That   s where you dig out with Fresnos, which are slips, with mules.  They had mules, and they had these big Fresnos where they go in and  get the dirt and they put it up out of the side and make a pit. That was to  hold the waste oil. So, the neighbor hired him at about   I think he was  fourteen. I   ve forgotten how old. It   s on his card. But anyway, he drove  a team and helped him dig that. That   s when he got his social security  card. Isn   t that something? From then on, he always was working at  something. He said his first job was when he was eight and they used  to   I think it was baling hay. I   m not sure. He could probably tell you.  They had a mule that went round and round   you   ve seen those  22  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  somewhere   and worked this machinery, whatever it was. So, they  hired him to lead the mule around and keep it going when he was eight.  (Laughs) He   d do that all day. You know what they paid him a day?  What?  A dollar. A dollar a day. (Laughter)  That sounds like pretty good for being eight years old.  Yes, and pretty tiresome. But anyway, he   s always worked at something.  He farmed full-time, but he always had other jobs on the off times.  Different jobs?  Yes, he worked at this gin down here for several years, before we were  married and after. And he worked at   on the highway up there, they had  the OSU experiment station. In those days, they had him and another  guy in there and they were counting cotton seed. (Laughs)  Wow. (Laughter)  His boss was Mr. Parrot. There will be records of him at OSU. Anyway,  he did that. He did that a lot. He did custom work for other people on the  hay business, and he did carpentry work with his brother, built houses  and parsonages and churches. That house right here east of this corner,  that first brick house they built right there.  Who lived there?  Who lives there?  Yes, or who was it built for?  It was built for a couple that the lady came over from France or  Germany, one. Her husband, through the war they had met somehow.  Her husband owned that, but in the meantime, he   s dead and gone and  she moved to Florida. They sold that, and she   s dead now. They sold  that farm to Mr. Walker that lives right on down two miles west of  Frederick on that corner over there where those longhorns are laying out,  if you   ve seen those when you come by. But he bought that house. They  built that and built a lot of residences in Frederick and some in the  country and some up by Tipton. So, he did that when he wasn   t farming  because he took over the farming so Bob could do that, because Bob   s  health didn   t really permit him to get out there and ride that tractor all  day.  23  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  You were saying that Jack   s brother was drafted because he was single?  Yes, and Jack was farming, so he was deferred for a while. Then when  they began to need them, they began to call the farmers out. He sold his  cattle and got ready and took the bus with the others and started to  Oklahoma City. On the way to Oklahoma City, they got word that the  war was over.  Wow  (Laughter)  So, he never did have to enter the army.  And you were married at that point.  Oh, yes, yes. Our son was born in    44. I was just trying to think  when  the war was over , I don   t know exactly. But anyway, he didn   t have to  go, but almost did. (Laughter)  That   s a close call. (Laughter)  Close call. But Bob, his brother, went on up to Camp Gruber close to  Muskogee. They had the grenades on the rifles at that time, and they  were practicing shooting those grenades out in the field, laying down on  their stomachs. But somehow, the guy   s next to him exploded or  something. The shrapnel hit Bob right in the neck, just barely missed his  jugular vein. He was in the hospital for a good long while, but he was  finally discharged and came home. But from that time on, he never was  able to farm. His arm was numb.  But he was a carpenter?  He was a self-taught carpenter. It was amazing. Never had any formal  training for it or even another guy, the carpenter that   to instruct him.  But he learned. His folks were good enough to let him take some old  lumber that they had and construct a one-room building out in their back  yard, just for practice or whatever. Then he got to where he was building  office buildings. He was building churches and parsonages and  residences, brick or whatever. So, he was really gifted in that. But his  health just deteriorated, so we lost him. My daughter lost her husband in  that plane explosion, just a year apart, those two.  Oh, really? Wow. That was in the    80s?   Nineteen  eighty-eight and    89.  24  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  During World War II, did things change a lot with all the young men  gone?  Well, I think that, out here, we had a farmhand, a colored man with his  family, that lived down in the original house that Grandpa Duncan built  before they built the big house. That house was across the highway on   the north . So, we had help in the farming because of having them. Not  everybody did. But Mr. Duncan was so good and so was Jack, all his  life, to those who worked for him. They saw they had everything they  needed. After Mr. Duncan died   and his mother was still down there in  that house by herself   they moved a house in, he and Bob did, right  there in the orchard pretty close to her house and put a family in there, a  white family.  That man worked, helped them with the farming and anything that she  needed help with, close there. If he would see her light come on in the  bedroom, which faced them at night, he   d watch a while. If it didn   t go  out, he   d go over and check on her. It meant a lot to them. But they were  real good to him. A lot of farmers would hire help in the harvest time  when they needed it, but then they wouldn   t keep them. They wouldn   t  keep them over the winter, so they had no income. But Jack and his dad  and his brother always paid them just the same, summer, winter, fall,  and spring. Besides that, they had a deep freeze put in there in their  home and kept it full of meat for them and did a lot of extra things that  most farmers didn   t do. That   s to their credit. They looked out for them.  Well, how has this area changed over the years?  Everybody   s moved off, moved away. (Laughs) We used to have a  house every quarter-mile. Some of our best neighbor friends lived here  and two of them lived up here, the Nultys and the Richards. The Nulty  boy  Lawrence Nulty, an only child  went to war and didn   t come back.  He   s the one we named our son after because he was Jack   s best friend.  They used to ride their horses down to Alpian school together when they  were in grade school and all that. We had them and we   d go and play  Forty-two and watched TV because we did get TV and they liked to  watch the boxing games of some of those famous boxers. He   s seen  them all. (Laughs) We   d go down there and have two or three tables of  Forty-two. They   d come here, and we   d go there. So, we did that. That  was a lot of the fun things that we did.  But the change, now, we don   t have any neighbors hardly at all. We  used to have the man that lived just a half-mile  east , that was one of  the main men, Mr. C.D. Warmouth, that helped us get the REA  Rural  Electric Association  started out here. He was on the first organizing  committees and all that, and that lived right there. We had one across the  25  Wilson  road right here, one across the road, one down there. And Bob used to  live right up on the hill right next to us, where there is a house now. But  these three houses are the only ones out here in the country anymore,  close. There is a mile and a half down that way  west  before there is a  house. There   s miles north. It   s another mile or two east of us before  there is a house.  But when this young man  Aaron Henson and wife Jennifer  here  graduated OSU in about 2002, I think it was right in there, they called  and asked if they could move a house trailer out here. We   d already said  we didn   t want one because we didn   t want noisy neighbors, we didn   t  want pets, we didn   t want dogs barking all night. We didn   t want people  coming and going and not knowing who they were and all that. So, we  first told them no, but the lady  Micah Treadwell  that was in the OSU  office there in Frederick said,    Would it be all right if they just came out  and looked?    Well, the minute we met them, we just fell in love with  them  and gave them their first month rent free . (Laughter) He   s our  county agent. She works for the dentist there in Frederick, now. They   ve  got two little children, now. Over the years, didn   t have any, then. But  they   re just precious. They   re like our own kids. They   re a big comfort  to our children because they know they   re close if we need them. All we  have to do is call. So, that   s been a blessing. But that   s the reason those  houses are there.  Aaron   s brother bought the house on the hill, that white house up there,  and remodeled it completely, gutted it and remodeled it. That   s where  Bob and Erma used to live. So, he lives there, now. So, it   s Aaron and  his brother out here. There was a man who bought the old Duncan house  down on the corner on the highway, the big square-looking house. And  Bob and Erma lived there several years before he died. He had gone in  and completely remodeled that house and modernized it. It   s beautiful  inside. Outside, it doesn   t look like anything.  But there was a man   after Erma decided she didn   t want to live there  anymore, she was going to Tipton, there was a man who bought it from  her after Bob died. He lived there a little while, but do you know that  last month, he died? He had a heart attack and died. He was an older  man, lived there by himself. But he had friends in  Frederick ipton. But  anyway, that house is empty now. That   s where Jack and Bob were both  born, right there, and their grandparents lived there and then their  parents and then Bob and Erma. (Laughs) But it   s not Duncan anymore.  That   s the biggest change we noticed. It doesn   t have the Duncan name  anymore. We had all of this side of this section and half of the next one  at one time.  And now, how much do you have?  26  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  This house. We deeded everything else to our children because we  thought if we have to go into the nursing home, they   d take it, use it up.   Nursing home care is so terribly expensive.   How many children do you have?  We have three  children. Our son, Lawrence Allen Duncan, recently  retired after thirty-one years of civil service with air force contracting.  His wife Gail retired as Director of Special Studies for the University of  New Mexico Cancer Center. They live in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Our daughter, Dena Gaye Duncan Northcutt, lost her husband,  Lieutenant Colonel William H. Northcutt, pilot of a KC135 refueling  tanker that exploded in mid-air near Loring Air Force Base in Maine in  1989. Dena is director of the historic 1915 Carnegie Library in  Frederick, Oklahoma. Our daughter, D   ann Duncan Gabriele, whose  husband, Paul Gabriele, is an electronics mechanic for the Firefinder  Radar program at Ft. Sill, Lawton, Oklahoma. They live in Faxon,  Oklahoma.  Do you do most of your business in Frederick?  Yes, we do. It   s not only that we always have, but it   s a necessity  anymore. I go to town about twice a week and buy groceries and  medicines and take care of the business and pay bills and do lots of  errands. We   re members of the church in Frederick now instead of  Bethel. We   ve been members of Frederick since the    70s, but we can   t  go anymore because   we tried for a while, but he can   t hear or see. He  can   t sit very long. He has to go to the bathroom pretty often. So, there is  no way we can even go sit even for our Sunday school class anymore.  We miss that, but we   ve had fifty years or sixty or seventy. I joined that  church over here at Bethel when I was   tried to join at five or six, and  they thought I was too young. (Laughter) So, finally, about eight when I  went down they accepted me and baptized me. I tell you, we didn   t have  a baptistery in this little church when I was there. So, we went to  Frederick and used their baptistery, and that   s where I was baptized. But  I   ve been a member there twenty-some odd years now, both of us. But  anyway, we don   t get to attend, but they   re on radio.  Oh, well that   s nice.  In the mornings, so we get to hear it anyway, or I do. He just can   t hear  anymore. It   s too bad. We used to watch a lot of his western videos and  all that, but he can   t hear them or see them anymore. I   ve got  headphones and he hears a while and then he gets tired and takes them  off.  27  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, it   s just home because I   ve never lived anywhere else. I moved  from there, up here, up at Tipton, and here. That   s it. (Laughter) I lived  up by Tipton about a year. That   s where we were married up there at my  home, but that house isn   t even there anymore. Isn   t that something?  People moved out of the country.  So, is that about a twenty-five mile stretch?  I don   t think it   d be that far.  Fifteen, maybe?  From up here?  From where you lived.  Yes. I lived two west and three north, then I lived four and a half west,  and then I lived down around the curve and about three or four miles  toward Tipton. Then I lived here. So, that   s not a very big territory.  And your kids went to Frederick schools?  My two older ones graduated from Weaver because we   re in Weaver  district here. My son was valedictorian down there. My  older  daughter  graduated  in 1965 . Then my youngest one, my younger daughter is  fourteen years younger than my other daughter, so she went down there  through the eighth grade and by that time, the high school was gone. By  the eighth grade, then she had a choice of going to Frederick, Davidson,  or Tipton. So, she visited. She didn   t go to Davidson to visit, but she  visited Frederick.  During that time was when they were integrating the blacks into the  white school. The blacks had been told by some, not all, we had a lot of  good black people. We loved our guy that lived down here so long,  thirty years with us. But anyway, the blacks had been told to assert  themselves and that they were in charge and that they were owed a lot.  All that stuff they told them, still are. She said when she tried to visit  there, the classrooms were just chaotic. They were hanging out the  windows and hollering at the traffic and other kids, and the teachers had  no control. She said,    Mom, I   m not going in there.    So, she went to  Tipton and went her four years of high school there. My grandson went  up there. He graduated from Tipton. That   s him right over there in that  picture.  28  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  Duncan  Wilson  How old is he?  He   s almost thirty, now, twenty-nine.  How many grandkids do you have?  I have four. One of them is in Oklahoma City and one of them is here in  Frederick, and the two girls I was telling you about are in Dallas.  That   s great. Well, I really appreciate you visiting with me today.  You didn   t expect me to talk all day, did you? (Laughter)  It   s been wonderful.  -------  -------
