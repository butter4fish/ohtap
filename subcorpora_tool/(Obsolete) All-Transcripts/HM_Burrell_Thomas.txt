Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And I want your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Thomas Jason Burrell, B-U-R-R-E-L-L.  I was born March 18, 1939.
Speaker 1: And I want to have today's date and the location we're at.
Speaker 2: Today's date is June 5, 2001, and we're at 20 North Michigan, the headquarters of Burrell Communications Group in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And I want to know your profession.
Speaker 2: I am Chairman of Burrell Communications Group.  I am basically a marketing communications specialist.
Story_ID: 4295
Speaker 1: I ask five questions of everyone.  They're 'People' magazine-ish, this is how we begin.  So there's no right answer or anything, just short answers.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: Hummus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Hummus.  That's the first one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm really stuck on hummus.  I love it.  There's only one brand that I really like, but I really have a thing about hummus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is black.
Speaker 1: As we can see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year is probably right in here, right now.
Speaker 1: Summer.  It's between spring and summer.
Speaker 2: Late spring, late spring.
Speaker 1: And favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I haven't learned how to do those yet.  Favorite--I would say probably Paris [France].
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I used to contract "how are you" to "how you," but I've cut that out.  No, I don't think so anymore.  The thing about it is I think other people need to tell me that because I'm not--people tell me about things that I do, and I'm not aware of it.  People say that I do this a lot.  I look through my fingers [puts his hand over his face and peeks through], and I wasn't aware of that.
Story_ID: 4296
Speaker 1: I want to start out talking about your mother.
Speaker 2: Ah, okay.
Speaker 1: And her name was Evelyn Burrell?
Speaker 2: Her name is Evelyn Burrell.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  She is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But she was born in Clayton, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I want you to tell us about--what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Kendall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'd like you tell me what you know about her and her growing up or her family.
Speaker 2: She is one of ten children born to Lorna Kendall ['Honey'] and Dozier Kendall.  He was a farrier, or blacksmith as they used to call them, among other things, and he--they had a little bit of land, I believe.  They grew up in Clayton, Alabama, not well off, especially after he died.  He died fairly early in their lives, and I think things became a little tough after that.  There were three boys and seven girls, and they--they spanned from over a period of--the oldest--the youngest would be seventy.  The oldest living would be about ninety-five so she had children over twenty-five years.  My mother was in about the fourth or the fifth from the oldest.  She is the oldest surviving sibling.  We only have four left now.  She's eighty-six, and she has lived longer than any of her other siblings.  She beat out my Aunt Bernice by a couple years.  She was older, but she died about eighty-four so she grew up, and I mean they could see the ground through the floor, and they could see the sky through the roof, and there were other extended family in that area.  Clayton is an area that is near nowhere that I can think of.  I mean, the closest city is probably Birmingham [Alabama] and that's quite a ways away and - but uncles and her grandparents were also there.  Both maternal and paternal grandparents were there, and it sounded like a very interesting kind of situation because, you know, I don't know if they knew whether they were poor or well off because some relatives were more well off than others.  Some had some land, some did not, and some were poor, and basically in the cotton-picking business basically, and that was the--and I believe that all of them did a little of that.
Story_ID: 4297
Speaker 1: Did she share any other stories about growing up with you?
Speaker 2: She [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] has shared stories, and so have other people.  The interesting - one interesting story about her growing up is that she was like - let me just put it this way.  One of her aunts was known for saying "you can never tell the luck of a lousy calf," and that was a way of saying that you can be born and start off as a loser or a - seemingly a weak part of the family, but you never know how you're going to develop, you know.  It's not how you start.  It's how you finish, and she apparently was the 'lousy calf' of the family in the sense that, you know, she was not seen as one of the brighter stars in the - you know - and it turned out that she, in fact, became the shining star, you know, amongst the siblings.  In terms of her attitude, in terms of her outlook on life, she went through a lot of trials and tribulations in her marriage as well as afterwards and - but she - she's a survivor and she is very vibrant at eighty-six.  She's working on her Jag - she has a Jaguar S-type [model of automobile] now, and we don't know what's going to be next.  You know, she'll get tired of the Mercedes [automobile], and she's 'Miss Fix-It'.  She's always - you know, always nailing and hammering and, you know, fooling around with things, you know.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  It really is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: It's nice.
Speaker 2: It is a terrific story.
Speaker 1: And I had never heard that slogan.  I was curious about what it meant.
Story_ID: 4298
Speaker 1: Your father [Thomas J. Burrell] - he was fifteen years older than your mother.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering what you know about, you know, him?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  I know that he came from Tennessee, a place called Clayton.  I think it's Mason.
Speaker 1: Covington.
Speaker 2: Covington, okay, Covington, Tennessee, and I didn't know - I never knew any of my grandparents because they were all gone except my maternal grandmother [Lorna Kendall, called 'Honey'].  I didn't know either my grandfather or my grandmother on his side.  I did know some of his extended family, a very strange family, a very unusual family.  Because I don't know very much about their parents, I don't know how they got to be that way.  He had two brothers, and I believe he had three or four sisters - Mary, Cora, Essie - three sisters, and I can't explain them.  They just were very interesting people.
Speaker 1: Eccentric or?
Speaker 2: Eccentric?  Yeah.  They were eccentric.  They had - they had - my Aunt Essie was a very, very, bizarre, eccentric person.  My Uncle Cornelius was the same.  You know, they dealt in all kinds of things, almost supernatural kinds of things and dealing with, you know, incenses and things.  My Uncle Cornelius actually sold over in the Maxwell Street area [Chicago, Illinois] - what was then called 'Jew Town' - and my Aunt Essie, I never knew exactly what she did, but going over to her house was always kind of a very interesting kind of trip because it was always dark and, you know, candles and things like that going on.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Do you think they - do you think they - are you talking about things more related to voodoo, or some African?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I was not sure.  I don't know if there was that kind of a clean kind of string.  I mean, it was just kind of an amalgam of stuff, you know.
Story_ID: 4299
Speaker 1: My father [Thomas J. Burrell] was - I'm still trying to think.  You know, I - it's unfortunate he died at the age of fifty-eight, and I was about eighteen years old, and by that time I still didn't understand him, you know.  We went through - I went actually through three stages of feelings about him.  I think the first one was fear.  The second stage was hatred, and the third stage was pity so we never got to the love stage.  We passed that one by totally.  He was a - he was cold.  We were actually not poor, but we lived poor.  He - you know, he rationed out a nickel or a dime a day so that we can go to the store every day to get something, you know.  My mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] just sort of made do with things.  I mean, he was a - he was a smart businessman, I believe.  What he did is he - during the Depression [1929], he had saved money, and he went out and bought buildings for cash and so he did well.  He owned a tavern on the West side of Chicago [Illinois] and - but we never - I mean, we never had very much.  My sister was fairly sickly as a child, and one vivid memory I have, very vivid.  I remember him sitting up in the living room.  It was snowing outside.  The snow must have been two and a half feet high, and I have this very vivid image of looking out the window and watching my mother coming down the street trudging through the snow with my daughter - my daughter - my sister on her back because the snow was so deep, and there was a blue Lincoln Zephyr [model of automobile] that he owned parked out in the front of the house, and I must have been six or seven years old.  I can't remember exactly, but I remember thinking, you know, that she had just taken her to the doctor - to the [University of] Illinois Research Hospital [Chicago, Illinois] which is, you know, the free hospital.  I'm saying "What's wrong with this picture?" you know?  "He's sitting here, the car is out there, and my mother is trudging through snow after getting off the streetcar and off the bus and, you know, all the transfers and stuff with my sick sister."  I mean, it's like - I mean "What is this?"  So it was strange.  When people ask me if I lived in a middle-class kind of environment, you know.  Being African American and living on the South side of Chicago, you know, it was hard to determine whether you were - there was no middle-class neighborhood because black people basically had to live together, so we had people who were well to do on one side of us and people who lived in the basement, who were, you know, almost poverty stricken, and I mean, of course, the kids all came out and, you know, basically played because we were basically put together as a part of the neighborhood so I really was confused as to whether we were poor, rich, middle class, or what have you, you know, and my father always had good cars, you know, like Lincolns [automobile] and Cadillacs [automobile] and stuff, but we didn't have enough money to go to a movie, you know, so - or to - or I'd go to my aunt to get some money so I could buy some skates or whatever I wanted so it was pretty interesting in that sense.
Speaker 2: And your sister - she was a younger sister, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, she's.
Speaker 2: One year?
Speaker 1: About eighteen months.
Speaker 2: Months, okay, and her name?
Speaker 1: And she still is, too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Her name is Wilma, Wilma Joanne.
Story_ID: 4300
Speaker 1: Now how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: They met - he [Thomas J. Burrell] was here in Chicago [Illinois] on the West side.  My - when my family started migrating from Alabama, they migrated to Chicago to the West side, and so the oldest one would come, and then she would work, and then they'd send for the next one, and so forth, until they all eventually came here, and I'm pretty sure that that's how they met.  He - I think he had the tavern at the time that she [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] came here, and I think they met somehow through some connection there at - in that neighborhood around Roosevelt Road and Ashland [Avenue].
Speaker 1: So you were how old when he passed away?
Speaker 2: I was eighteen.
Speaker 1: Eighteen?  That's right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now what are some of your earliest memories growing up because you were born, you know, here, and so do you know how - you don't know how he got here, though.  Do you know that story?
Speaker 1: I don't really know exactly how he got here, but all of his siblings - well, all of his - the male siblings wound up in Chicago along with one of the sisters.  Another sister wound up in Detroit [Michigan], and another sister stayed in Tennessee, but I don't know how they got here, and I don't know - well, they had some distant relatives also.  He had one who was a doctor, and so it could have been through some of those associations, and he had some half brothers as well, but no, I don't know how he got here.
Speaker 2: So you think it may have been a fact that he was a much older person than she, and there may have been that.
Speaker 1: Who is that?
Speaker 2: Your - her - your father was, you know, fifteen years older than your mother.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting pattern because that's roughly the age difference between me and my present wife, and it's also the age difference between her father and his present wife so, you know, that fifteen, sixteen - I think that's a good spread because it takes us so much longer to grow up, you know, so it kind of evens out.
Speaker 2: That's cute.  That's a cute perspective.
Story_ID: 4301
Speaker 1: Anyway, now what are some of your earliest memories of growing up?  Did you grow up on the West side or the South side?
Speaker 2: South side.  I grew up on the South side.  I spent a year on the West side because my mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] was working over at the tavern, and instead of lugging me home every night, I stayed there.  That was before I started elementary school so I was at nursery school there for a year over on the West side, Miss Parrish's Nursery School, and that's one of my earliest memories, being on the West side and going to nursery school, and I have memories of growing up, being on the West side, very extended family.  I remember the communal bath, you know, warming the tub, running, boiling the water on a potbelly stove and pouring it into the tub and, you know, taking that bath, you know, kind of in the kitchen, I guess, in the kitchen area.  We were on the third floor, a third floor walkup, and I can't tell you how many people must have been living in that apartment which seemed like it was just slightly larger than this area here, and my grandmother.  A friend who just kind of came from somewhere who just stayed there, her name was 'Bebe', a little slight woman, smoked a pipe, and my Aunt Minnie, [Aunt] Ruth, 'Buck'.  These are all, most of them, nicknames.  Aunt Elizabeth, her name was 'Buck' - 'Weebie', whose name was Bernice.  A woman named 'Chook' who was - her name was Lilly Mae Liptrot who was a distant cousin who stayed and kind of helped take care of the place.  My  grandmother, her name was 'Honey'.  Her real name was Lorna, and my Uncle Grady who's still living and my Uncle Emmett, and down the street, we had my Aunt 'Candy'.  Her name was Myrtle, and she had a whole bunch of kids.  She had about ten or eleven kids.  When they first came to Chicago [Illinois], they stayed with 'Honey', my grandmother [Lorna Kendall].  The one memory I have, I remember being in the bed with what I think were about six kids.  I mean, that's just - it was unbelievable.  I was four or five years old, and I can remember - I'll try not to get embarrassed by that, but I can remember in the middle of the night feeling around, and I felt some things that I had never felt before, you know, because it was, you know - it was - I think it was my cousin Willa Mae, you know, but I'm not sure, but I remember that.  I mean, the bed was just loaded with kids, you know, and so I have that memory, and I remember my grandmother cooking a possum and then seeing that for the first time.  That was - that was interesting.  I didn't eat it.
Story_ID: 4302
Speaker 1: I remember being out on the street in front of the house, playing, and some kids, big kids were running down the street and running and knocked me over.  I felt like I was being trampled to death, you know, but it turns out I was okay, but that's a very strong memory that I have, and I remember another time being out on the front stoop and watching my Uncle Emmett come back from the war.  I mean, that was an amazing sight.  You know, I mean it's the classic walking down the street with his uniform and his stuff on his duffel bag and stuff and seeing, you know, he had come back, you know, and that was very vivid in my memory.  That must've taken place back in 1944, I guess, or '45 [1945], '44 [1944], I guess, so those are some early memories.  I have memories even before that of being on my back porch.  On the second floor we had a little icebox out on the back porch.  I remember the icebox, and I also remember across next door there were twins, twin girls, about four years older than I am, and I must have been - I felt like I was three, but I had a huge, major crush on those girls, and I also remember singing a song, 'I Want A Big Fat Mama,' and I'm still trying to locate that song because it was recorded by the Five somebody, you know.  "I want a big fat mama."  "I want a big fat mama."  I don't know.  I heard it, I guess, on the radio, and I didn't know what it meant even, you know, but that was one of my favorite first songs that I learned, 'I Want A Big Fat Mama,' and I also remember it was kind of a magical thing from my Aunt Essie, the one who was kind of spooky.  She gave me a duck, one of those ducks that you - when you pull, it goes like this and goes "quack, quack, quack," you know, and we lived at 59th [Street] and Calumet [Chicago, Illinois] and those buildings - on the sides of the doors they had the cut glass where you could kind of see through, but it was kind of distorted because it was, you know, cut glass, and I remember for some reason I left the duck out on the sidewalk and came inside the vestibule to see if I could see the duck through the cut glass.  I have no idea why I tried do that, why I thought that was an interesting thing to find out, but I couldn't see it, but when I went back out, the duck was gone.  It had been taken.  You know, I don't know how or what happened, but it was like "Wait a minute.  I didn't see anybody go past.  What happened to the duck?"  So I had to break the news to my Aunt Essie that I had lost the duck.
Speaker 2: You know, you have some good memories, really.  You remember back at three.
Speaker 1: I believe I must have been - I can't - yeah, I think I do.
Story_ID: 4303
Speaker 1: What do you think you were like as a young child?  Were you shy?  Okay.  You have a shy demeanor about yourself.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a mess.  I had tremendously low self-esteem.  I was fearful.  Talking about memories, I remember - you know, we used to have sleds, and in the wintertime, you know, you'd run down the street, and you flop on the sled, and I couldn't flop on the sled.  I mean, I was fearful of falling down on the sled, which is what all the kids did, and I remember my father [Thomas J. Burrell], who usually if he had something to say, it was negative.  He opened the window, and he started ridiculing me for being a sissy because I couldn't flop on the sled, but that's kind of the way I grew up.  I mean, I grew up fearful.  I mean, if somebody threw a baseball at me, I'd do like that [Burrell shields his face] or a football [Burrell motions as if he's missed the football], you know, whatever, and the other thing that I certainly remember - the most pronounced thing I remember about my life as a child is that I had no specialty.  You know, I had no - nothing that I did, you know, from the time I grew up in that neighborhood until the time I left.  I mean, there were kids who were great at sports.  There were kids who were very smart academically.  There were kids who collected and knew everything about comic books.  There were kids who knew everything about the radio shows, you know, 'The Lone Ranger' and this and that and the other thing.  I can't remember any passion or any thing that - I can't remember what - my thing is like what was I doing, you know?  I must have been just thinking, you know.  I mean, I wasn't doing anything.  I had no - some kids were really great at flipping bikes.  You know how you flip a bike?  You get on a bike.  I could never kind of get that down, you know, so there was no physical athleticism there.  I wasn't particularly smart, at least not by my performance in school.  I wasn't preoccupied with any reading or, you know.  I don't know.  I guess I was just waiting, I guess, to grow up.  I don't know.  I can't remember any thing that way, but - I mean, there were guys who were gang-bangers, I mean real thugs, you know, I mean underworld almost, you know.  I mean, I lost a couple of friends that way, one in a stolen car when he was fifteen and one had a hot shot, heroin shot, but I mean I wasn't - I wasn't into any of those things so - you know, I was observing, I guess, what was going on around me, but I was pretty out of it.  Oh, some people, of course, were good with girls - zero, you know, so I had a lot of catching up to do on all those fronts.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Story_ID: 4304
Speaker 1: Now you were starting to talk about - well, you were saying that you weren't - you don't know what you were doing at that point in time, you know.  Nothing was really.
Speaker 2: I look back, and I say what was I doing?  I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Do you think you were soaking things in around you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was - I mean, I was an insomniac as a kid.  I mean, I couldn't sleep.  I would sit up nights, and I would think about things.  I would fantasize about being a hero, fantasize about - one that I remember very clearly, we lived in a very urban area, 59th [Street] and Calumet [Chicago, Illinois], went to school at Betsy Ross [elementary school], and I would think about I would really be cool and I'd be accepted if I could really be a cool cowboy, and I would have this vision of my horse, and I think he was a white horse being out in front, and I would put on all my spurs and my things, and, you know, that kind of 'Roy Rogers' [radio program] kind of thing, you know, and my hat, you know, and I'd go "chicka, chicka, chick," you know, out to the front, tip my hat to folks and stuff, get on a horse and be riding through the neighborhood, "chicka, chicka, chick," you know, and ride all the way around to school and get off and tie my horse up at the gate by the fence and walk into school, you know, real cool with my real cool cowboy outfit on.  I remember one night sitting up and thinking about that, but I would - you know, for the most part I didn't know what I was thinking about.  I was thinking about something.  I don't know.  I have no idea.
Story_ID: 4305
Speaker 1: Where do you think that image of a cowboy came from if you weren't - you said you weren't reading at the time.
Speaker 2: Well, I was doing a little bit of comic book stuff, and I was watching - I was listening to the radio.  I would listen to 'Lone Ranger' on radio, and also I'd see 'Cisco Kid' and the other guys at the movie theaters on Saturdays when we could afford the fourteen cents to get in so I grew up really looking at cowboy movies and listening to cowboy stuff on the radio, and that's where it came from - Roy Rogers [actor], Gene Autry [actor].  Who was the guy with the - 'Hopalong Cassidy' [movie].  Those are three that really pop out, you know, at me.  Almost every week we'd see them so I think that's where that came from, you know, horses and guns and good guy and all that kind of stuff.  I think that's where that came from.  I mean, there were no African American images in my head at all during that time.  I mean, all of the things that I got, I got from watching white people or listening to white people.  I mean, the only images I got were the negative ones - 'Beulah' [television program], 'Amos and Andy' [television program] - and certainly there was nothing to emulate there for me, but I would go to a movie.  I remember the other thing I would do is I'd try to look like those guys.  Lawrence Tierney was an actor.  His brother was Scott Brady, and they played tough guys, and they had these mouths, tough guy mouths, and what it was, was kind of a puffy kind of thing up here, and I remember going home and trying to figure out how I could get my mouth to look like that, and one thing I did, I put a toothpick up in my upper thing so it would go like this so I could look tough like them, and later on, maybe at ten or eleven, I was trying to figure out how I could get my hair to be like them, and one of the things I did is I worked at the drug store down at the corner, and I remember buying some hair straightener and taking it home and trying to figure out how to use it.  In those days that stuff was, you know, whoo, you know, and fortunately my mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] caught me before I did it, but that - I mean, those were the images.  We didn't come from a literate kind of a background, and so there were no books really around.  There were no - there was no African American history there.  I didn't know about that.  I mean, the big, black thing that I knew about was Joe Louis [boxer] and Jackie Robinson [baseball player], particularly Joe Louis [boxer].
Story_ID: 4306
Speaker 1: So the block that you lived on [in Chicago, Illinois] or the things that were influencing you, you know, your - you - I mean, I was influenced by those white images too, you know.  I mean, I had the same thing, but were there - I mean, but were - how were you juxtaposing those images with images, you know, of the black community around you also?  Were there people that you looked up to and admired there besides, you know, Joe Louis [boxer], you know, or?
Speaker 2: I can't - I don't have a good recollection of any heroes in that regard in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask just a little bit more about - you know, your mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell], you said, you know, balanced off your father [Thomas J. Burrell], and I was wondering how you would give some examples because you're the oldest.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the interesting - one of the interesting things - I'm not sure if this answers your question, but one of the things that I learned early is - and I didn't know what I was doing at the time - but how to use negative as well as positive forces to my advantage, you know.  It was like, you know - am I allowed to use profanity here?  It was like later on I figured it's, "How do you take shit and turn it into fertilizer?" you know, and what I basically - I was just as highly motivated by my father as I was by my mother because as much as I wanted to prove her right, I wanted to prove him wrong because basically he spent a lot of time basically trying to let me know that I was not - that I was inferior.  I mean, that's basically what he was trying, you know, to get over to me, and so I spent a lot of my energy achieving to prove him wrong as much as I was determined to make my mother proud so that was one thing that - it also, I think, helped me have a healthy attitude about women.  I mean, you know, I basically - I guess deep down I feel that women are superior because of the things that they have to deal with and put up with and how they manage to prevail and even dominate in some sense, despite all of the things working, you know, against them, you know, and I think my mother's probably the model for that, and so I've always had a very high regard for women in that regard, and I think that certainly influenced me and how I deal with women.
Story_ID: 4307
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] handle your father's [Thomas J. Burrell] demeaning behavior towards you?  Did she try to - or say, you know, boost you up and say you're okay and?
Speaker 2: Well, what my mother did with me particularly is she kind of treated me like I was an adult.  I mean, she treated me like I was the man that I - she always gave me the impression that I had to make decisions for myself.  I think she was back there quietly, you know, moving me, but giving me the sense that my life was pretty much in my hands and I had to, you know, make decisions.  I worked from the time I was almost six or seven.  I always did something, so maybe that was my thing, working, you know.  I would deliver papers.  I would - worked in the bowling alley setting pins, shoe shine, drug store.  I remember one night I forced myself into a work situation, stayed out all night.  I must have - by that time I must have been about twelve, stayed out all night on a paper truck working with a guy who went to school with me who actually did that and came back.  They gave me a dollar just because.  I was just there, and I remember that, and she didn't know where I was, and I wound up - before I went home I went and bought a squeegee at the five-and-ten-cent store with that dollar, and I came home and told her, you know, where I was, and of course, she was worried and, you know, going crazy and stuff and I took that squeegee.  I didn't even go to sleep.  I took the squeegee and immediately went out to try to get people to let me wash their windows, I mean, because I always, you know, trying to do stuff.  My aunt worked at Armour-Dial [company], and she could always get soap, you know, soap like Dial soap for days, and I would take that soap and sell it to neighbors two for a quarter or whatever the case.  I mean, I can't remember what it was.  It was some, you know, good bargain price for them, you know, so I was always enterprising, I guess, in that sense, but I think that was part of my motivation is the - this whole thing with my mother and my father.  What she basically did is she basically said "You can do anything that you want to do."  I mean, "You're capable of doing it," you know, "I want you to think," and "I want you to think for yourself and - because I can't be there with you all the time, you know," so, you know, I think that probably contributed greatly to my development.
Story_ID: 4308
Speaker 1: Now was there anything, like, about school, you know, either at Betsy Ross [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] or, you know, Parker High School [later Parker Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois], I mean, that were influential to you?  I mean, do you remember any teacher?  I know you said, "I wasn't a good student," you know, but was there anything that was sort of influencing you as a young person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  There were teachers at Betsy Ross who influenced me, and my thing is I wasn't a bad student.  I was just uneven.  I would have - you know, I'd have a good year, and then I would have a lousy year, a good year and a lousy year, but there were some teachers, especially in elementary school, who had a profound kind of influence on me.  One who is still living, I guess, Mrs. Murray, Louise Murray who taught seventh grade, Miss McCaskey, Miss Howard.  Miss Martin was a white teacher I had in fourth grade, and I started off doing very well with - in her classroom, and for some reason I decided that I was going to be bad.  I just decided that I was not going to be good.  I was going to be bad.  I started acting up, and I just remember her taking me out into the hallway.  I mean, she was livid, and I remember she had this huge nose, you know, and she just shook me.  I mean, today it would have been abuse, and she said "What is the matter with you?"  You know, "Why are you doing this?", you know, because she knew that I could do better, and I really was affected by that.  I really was affected by that.  I mean, it hurt her.  I could see the hurt in her that I was not performing.  I mean, it really hurt her, and she was very upset, and it's like, oh, you know.  It's - maybe it was my looking for that kind of attention, you know, somebody really cares about this, and so that was one teacher I remember very distinctly.  Miss Murray is the teacher who taught me so much about - she was a renaissance person.  I mean, she taught us how to waltz.  She taught us about waltzing, square dancing, black history.
Story_ID: 4309
Speaker 1: I took part in the assembly [at Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and I remember I played a microbe in a health assembly.  I got a black beaver hat from one of the people who - we always had roomers.  I don't know.  In fact, there really were no rooms.  I slept in this - my sister and I slept in the same room as my mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] and father [Thomas J. Burrell] until I was - I don't know - six, seven, eight years old and because all the other rooms were taken by roomers, you know, and there was one family that lived with us all this time, and he was four years old, and he had this black beaver hat so I took his black beaver hat and got some kind of black cape and put it on and played the part of a microbe.  It was one of her [Miss Murray] assemblies, and that was my first kind of performance, you know.  "I'm a dirty little microbe and as mean as I can be.  My favorite trick is to make you sick.  You better watch out for me.  Although you can't see me, I'm always in the air, and I will catch you unaware and make you sick."  That was my part.  That was - that launched my theatrical career, but she - you know, but she taught the 'Waltz of the Flowers,' you know.  I mean, there are very few people who know the lyrics to the 'Waltz of the Flowers,' you know.  "Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah.  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah."  We knew the words, still know the words, you know, I mean, so she basically - and she would come out in the park on Saturday with her Doberman pinscher, her dog, you know, and we didn't have a whole lot of, in the way of pets like that so we got a chance to understand, you know, what it meant to have a devoted pet so those were like two very major influences on me in grammar school.
Story_ID: 4310
Speaker 1: Then what about high school at Parker [Francis W. Parker High School, Chicago, Illinois, South Side]?
Speaker 2: At Parker - well, first - see, first of all, I started at Englewood [high school]
Speaker 1: Oh, you did.
Speaker 2: I went to Englewood for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's - the significant thing about that is that Englewood at that time was a school that was going through changes, and there were a number of negative influences there, and I just.
Speaker 1: This is what year?
Speaker 2: 1953, and I started getting right into it.  I mean, I was like right into - the great thing about my life is that I was always wandering around from one group to another, but the fortunate thing is that nobody ever let me in so I was always on the periphery of these various groups.  I was, you know, on the edges of the negative groups, the gang-bangers, the thugs.  I was on the edge of that group.  The athletes, the jocks - I never could get into that totally because I couldn't flip a bike, you know, and flop on a sled, you know, so - but I was just kind of hanging around the edges of things so that kind of made me the kind of - I was just moving.  It made it easier for me to move out and move to another group so I would be with a group of, I guess, intellects at one point and then with the jocks and with the, you know - I just moved around so I think it's fortunate that I never got sucked up into any of those groups so I kind of thank them for, you know, keeping me out in a way, but Englewood was a school where I basically started to get into trouble.  You know, I joined in throwing the erasers at the teachers.  I mean, there was no real teaching going on.  Latin - there was no Latin going on.  It was just an alcoholic teacher who was just basically trying to keep people in some kind of order for thirty-five, forty minutes.  I mean, there was no - I learned "America es patria mia," and that was about the end of that, you know, something about agricola or something, and that was it, but what happened is after a friend of mine gotten killed in a stolen car running away from the police - they had a crash - I decided on my own that I had to get out and change my whole thing so I transferred to Parker after two years, and because it was considered the 'good boy school.'  I mean, that was my reform - you know, my attempt to reform and get in a more positive environment, and I got there, and I immediately kind of leeched on to people who were kind of like about something - you know, Phil Walker, who wanted to be an attorney and he turned out to be one, David Harris and James Black, a few other people who were, you know, basically doing pretty good so that's who I started hanging out with, still on the periphery but still hanging out with them, you know, and so, I actually did change my whole environment, changed my friends and some of my habits by making that move, and one of the most profound things that happened at Parker was the thing that led to my career in the advertising business.
Story_ID: 4311
Speaker 1: I had a course called Careers which they don't necessarily teach anymore, part of the business curriculum, and the purpose of Careers was to help students determine what they would want to do when they - you know, for a career, and I took an aptitude test, and the aptitude test showed all the predictably low things, you know, low in math, low in science, low in, you know, a number of other, you know, areas, but the strong two areas that popped up - one was called Persuasive and one was called Artistic, and I took that to my teacher [Miss Buland] and asked her what it meant, and she, in almost about fifteen, twenty seconds, said "You ought to think about being an advertising copy writer."  I said "What is that?" and she told me that "It's a person who writes advertising so it's selling, persuading people, but they use their artistic skills to do it," and I said, "That sounds pretty cool."  "I think that sounds like what I'll do."  I went up to the lunchroom after class, told my new friends, relatively new friends, that I was going to be an advertising copy writer, and they said "What's that?"  I mean, even Phil and those guys who were really smart, they didn't know what that was so I was like "Hey, it's a person who writes the advertising.  They use their persuasive skills." And so having said that, I decided that I better go out and find out something about it because if I'm going to be going around telling people I'm going to do something, I better find out what it is, and I did, and I continued on that course for the next almost two years, and so Miss - I've had her name in my head forever, but it'll come to me.  She basically told me that's what you do, and that's what I've been doing since I was seventeen years old, focusing on it.
Story_ID: 4312
Speaker 1: You know, that's pretty impressive.  Do you think she [Miss Buland] had - how did she - was she black or white?
Speaker 2: White.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think she was involved in the - what teacher was she?
Speaker 2: She taught business.
Speaker 1: Business.  That's interesting now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because it's not your typical profession, you know, and you don't expect that to come out of a teacher's mouth.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, exactly right.
Speaker 1: So did you - I'm just trying to understand.  When you made the change, you know, from Englewood [high school] to Parker [Francis W. Parker High School, Chicago, Illinois, South Side], did you make that change yourself or did anyone?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how did you determine Parker?
Speaker 2: Because they're right down the street.  I knew about it.  It was only - Englewood was on 63rd [Street] and Stewart [Avenue], and Parker was on 68th [Street] and Stewart [Avenue].  It was only about five blocks away, but it was a world away, but it was, you know, close enough for me.
Speaker 1: And do you think that this person - you said he stole a car.  Did you say he stole a car?
Speaker 2: No, he was - Ronald Peyton - he was in a stolen car, running away from the police.  It was a convertible, I think, and they had a crash and he died.
Speaker 1: So you think that had such an impact on you that you said it was a wake-up call?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was anyone else saying - was your mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell], your father [Thomas J. Burrell] saying, you know, "Look who you're hanging around with."  You're not, you know, this none of that, that's interesting.  Okay, and so these friends that you met, you know, at Parker, did they become - you went there in your junior year?
Speaker 2: Um hmm [Burrell shakes head "Yes"].
Speaker 1: And so they became your friends for the next two years then?
Speaker 2: More or less - yeah, I kind of wandered around.  I had basically about four or five people there that I considered friends.
Story_ID: 4313
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that is developing within you at that point?  I mean, are you more active in any school activities or are you, you know, not or, you know - when she said "You're going to be an advertising copy writer," did you start sort of looking in that direction?
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely.  That was the only direction I was looking in.  I tried sports.  I didn't do well in sports.  I was a very skinny kid, about 160 pounds, so football was out, and basketball I could never - and, of course, the other thing is, and this is another part of the story.  I am legally blind.  I didn't know that when I was growing up, that I had these visual problems, vision problems, so I'm not sure now.  I tend want to blame my ineptitude on the basketball court on that now, that now that I realize what it was because I was - now I realize when they passed me the ball why I was, you know, fumbling it, you know, and not getting a good handle on it, but - yeah, but I did.  I read about advertising, and when I got to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], I was ready.  I mean, I knew that's what I wanted to do.  I joined all the clubs, you know, the advertising fraternity, and wrote for the newspaper and spent summers working, you know, doing, selling advertising, writing advertising, books even, program books, you know, so yeah, I was focused.  A couple of things that came out of that in terms of lessons that I try to impart to people is starting with the idea of when you make a commitment to something, if you have any pride at all, what you do is tell people that's what you're going to do, and that puts pressure on you to do it.  Tell people what you're going to do.  I'm going around and telling everybody that's what I'm going to be.  I've got to live up to it.  Now I've got to go out and find out about it, learn about it so that I will be knowledgeable about it so that was one thing that I learned, and I try to let people know.  Put it out there that that's what you're going to do, you know, and the other thing I tell them is act like what you want to be, you know, not like what you are.  I mean, pick up all of the - I mean, how do those people who do that - how do they dress, how do they talk, how do they walk?  You know, start living it, you know, and not dealing with the fact that - I mean, I'll give you an example.  When I started my first job, it was in the mailroom at an advertising agency so from - I didn't want to be a mailroom person.  I wanted to be a copy writer so what I did is I dressed like one.  I walked like one.  I talked like one despite the fact that I was collating mail because what I wanted people to do was say "Hmm.  What is he doing, doing that?"  I mean, "It seems like he could be more suited to be over here in this office." you know, so that's what I also tell people is to learn everything about - I mean, get the whole gestalt of what it is that you're doing and start effecting those things, you know.
Story_ID: 4314
Speaker 1: Who are your role models at this point or, you know, what are your looking for?  T.V. [television] is in existence, you know, and there's the commercials and things like that.  Did you know - and there's radio, you know, for people writing commercial copy, but it's just such a - you know, it's just like a - you know, even today if you told someone, you know, a copy writer.
Speaker 2: Um hmm [Burrell shakes head "Yes"].
Speaker 1: You know, people would say, "Well, what's that?"
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: People are still asking me that.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So my question is - okay, you decide this is what you want to be.  I mean, people in the black community probably say, "What the hell is that?"
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so - but you're motivated?
Speaker 2: And I enjoyed that.  I mean, I enjoyed telling them something that they didn't know about, you know.  I enjoyed that "Oh, wow.  You want to do something.  Whoa, what is that?" - you know, as opposed to being a teacher, a doctor, or whatever, you know.
Speaker 1: And this is giving you something you need, too, at this point, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Really a factor?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 4315
Speaker 1: Now when you - how did you decide to go to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] at the time?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story, too.  By this time my mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] and father [Thomas J. Burrell] had been divorced for awhile, about three or four years, and my first thought was to go to Mexico to go to college.  I just happened to see a - I saw a brochure, Mexico City College [later University of the Americas, Puebla, Mexico], and I don't know whether it was Iztaccihuatl or Popocatepetl, near one of those mountains, and they were selling.  I mean, the school was probably, you know, zero, but I thought that was an interesting idea, and I guess I was trying to get away.  We had been - my mother and father had been involved in this really terrible, acrimonious divorce thing, and so I was basically trying to get away, and so I got a job at Continental Airlines [company].  They had a place over on Monroe [Street] where you - the limo took people out to the airport, and I - it was - I went there that summer to get the money to go to college, and my father found out about my having this job.  Now, you - this one - you can figure this out.  I mean, how many stories are you going to hear like this?  He found out I was working there, and he found out that I was trying to go to college so what he did is he went down to the - on my day off he went down to Continental [airline], talked to my boss, told my boss that I was not going to be a permanent employee there because that was one of the conditions.  They didn't know anything about the college thing.  I mean, one of the conditions for my getting the job was that I would be, you know, working there.  They weren't interested in hiring anybody just for the summer.  He told them that I was planning to go to college and that I was not being straight with them and tried to get me fired so I came back and I heard - I learned about that.  Then I developed a scheme.  The scheme was that I was going to take some of the free time that you get from working there and just take a little trip to Mexico, but I wouldn't come back so I was on my way to Mexico City College.  I was going to Mexico.  I forgot where I was going to land - Juarez [Mexico] or somewhere.  I'm not sure exactly - Mexico City, I guess - and I checked my bags, and my mother and I were walking to the plane, and I got stopped at the door of the plane.  Apparently my father tipped them off again, and they turned me back and said, "Hey," you know, "We know what you're up to, and so you need to call Mr. Ferner," who's my boss, and I called him, and he told me that, "I understand what you're up to."  You know, "We checked it out, and so not only are you fired, but you're not going to go to Mexico on us."  That was it.  So what do I do now?
Story_ID: 4316
Speaker 1: This is full-fledged hate at this point with your father [Thomas J. Burrell].
Speaker 2: [Burrell nods head "Yes"]
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) That is something.
Speaker 2: And the other thing about it is he was dying at the time, by the way, you know, so I basically went back and said, "Well, maybe I can get Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] to let me in," and I had to actually implore them to let me in.  My grades were not sterling by any means, and so I got in on a trial basis, and I immediately - not having the slightest idea of what college was and what college really required, I took eighteen hours.  I immediately - I took an additional course over at the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]  - two courses actually, in drawing and photography.  I joined the newspaper as - became the news editor.  I joined A.D.S., the advertising fraternity, Alpha Delta Sigma, that fraternity, and then with the rest of my time I spent down in the lunchroom, you know, bullshitting with the guys, you know, learning stuff, talking about things, you know, being a philosopher and all that kind of stuff (unclear), and in the meantime I'm getting Ds and Ds, and so first semester I went on probation, and second semester I did the same thing.  Now at the same time, I'm - you know, I'm developing reflux, a gastroent [gastrointestinal] - problem, you know, and I got a bald spot on my head about, you know, as big as a quarter just from nerves so second semester I get Ds and Ds, and they asked me to leave, and so that's what happened.  I left for a year and went to work in a paint factory, Sherwin Williams [company], and I would strongly suggest that to anybody who's having trouble with school to take a year and work at a paint factory, and if that doesn't motivate you, then I don't know what will so I begged them to let me back in, and I got back in.  I took twelve hours and cut out a lot of the stuff, extracurricular stuff, and I started getting As and maybe a couple of Bs, and that's the way I spent the rest of, you know, my career except for physical science.  I never got that.  The test that I took in high school was accurate.  I mean, I just did not get science, biology, physics.  I mean, I just had to do whatever I could to just get through it, and I did get a D in that, but it was enough.  Physical science - I couldn't get those planets lined up for anything, you know.  That I had to say, "Okay.  I have to let that one go."
Story_ID: 4317
Speaker 1: Now the question I have for you is this - look, were you aware of the problems with your eyesight?
Speaker 2: Not until I was twenty-seven years old did it get diagnosed.  It's macular degeneration.  It's a macular degeneration that's caused by two recessive genes, you know, so clearly my father [Thomas J. Burrell] and mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] were not meant to be together, you know, so that was just more evidence of that so that's basically what it was, and I discovered it at the age of twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: But even - are you wearing glasses, though, still at this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was wearing glasses, but it had not been diagnosed as macular degeneration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you - what does that mean, though?  Does it mean that you eyesight gets progressively worse?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The macula is the central part of the retina, and what happens with macular degeneration is that the very thing that you're looking at, the most central part of your vision, is the part that you have the toughest time seeing, you know.  The best way for me to see you actually is to look right there.  Now I see your face clearly.  When I do this, then it's a bit of a blur so I'm using peripheral vision now to look at you.  I just know it would be very disconcerting on the camera, but I'm using peripheral vision to see you.  If I try to use central vision, it's not nearly as clear.
Speaker 1: Now how did you even come to determine that?  Was that?
Speaker 2: A doctor.  I finally went to a doctor, and he looked and said, "Wow, what is this?"  And, of course, at that time he didn't know what it was.  I mean, they had me in a hospital doing spinal taps and asking me if I'd seen an eclipse and all kinds of stuff.  They just didn't know what to make of it.  Of course, they have since learned a great deal about it, but that's how it happened and that's how it was diagnosed.
Story_ID: 4318
Speaker 1: So it wasn't - your eyes didn't affect your grades.  It was just really--.
Speaker 2: It's hard to know because I don't think so, but it's hard to know exactly what influence my eyesight had on it.  I do remember sitting at the front of classes and having a hard time seeing what was on the board while people at the back of the class were having no problem at all.  I kind of - you kind of rationalize stuff, and you say, "Well, you know, I must be tired today" or "I'm not interested" and all that kind of stuff, you know.  People do that with their senses, I mean, with their hearing or with their eyesight.  They just say, "Oh, I just didn't hear that.  I wasn't paying attention."  So that's basically what happened.  I have no idea what - I know that it's 20/400 [eyesight measurement] or whatever it is right now, but I don't - and I know it was 20/70 or 20/80 when it was diagnosed, but I have no idea how it had progressed over time.
Speaker 1: Now when you - you know, you start getting As, and in Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] you're an English major, right?
Speaker 2: I started off as a psychology major, but then I was introduced to something called statistics as a requirement, and so I said, "Adios" to psychology, you know.  I just told somebody the only standard deviant I know is some kid in the neighborhood, you know.  That's just business.  That's, you know, mathematics and standard deviations and stuff.  I just said, "Hey, I gotta get out of here."  The whole idea at that time was that there was a book published at the time called 'The Hidden Persuaders'.  A guy named Vance Packard wrote it.  It was a pretty popular book, and it was all about how he used psychology to - skillfully to sell things to people, you know, and that was the idea.  You take the writing skills and psychological skills, and that's how you figure out how to be a great advertising person so I had to really get out of that, and I got out quick so that's how I got to be an English major.
Story_ID: 4319
Speaker 1: Would you say Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] was a good place to prepare you for advertising?
Speaker 2: Um hmm [Burrell nods head "Yes"].
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell me why.
Speaker 2: Well, because there were people there who were very good.  Randall Works and Richard Thane were excellent professors.  One was more into advertising.  One was more into marketing, but they really together made a terrific team and I benefitted a lot from both of them.  I benefitted a lot from being in Chicago, being in the city.  I benefitted a lot from being a part of the fraternity.  There was an advertising fraternity there, A.D.S., Alpha Delta Sigma, and I got a chance to know a lot of people who had the same interests, and so I learned from them so it was - I worked on the newspaper.  That helped with writing skills.  I was the news editor.  I got a lot of help from the editor so yeah, it was a good experience, and I thought they had excellent English professors as well.
Speaker 1: I think people don't understand the Roosevelt of that day.  It was a little - it was a different institution than it is right now.  Can you talk about that just a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Roosevelt University was kind of founded on the whole principal of equal opportunity because it was basically an offshoot of the college down here - I think it was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] College [Central YMCA Community College, Chicago, Illinois] where blacks and Jews were not permitted or enrolled, and so a bunch of teachers walked out and went over and formed Roosevelt University so it was a school of enlightenment, and it was a school of - it was more about liberal arts.  It was more about education.  One of my criticisms of Roosevelt today is that it's become more of a commodity, and it's become more of a trade kind of school.  You know, the marketing strategy is - I guess it's trying to find a place for itself, but you know, I think it's unfortunate that they have to take that kind tack, but it was a school where you had a wide assortment of people, types of people, ages, you know, a lot of veterans coming back, a lot of minorities, blacks, Jews.  Harold Washington went there, Dempsey Travis earlier, you know, and I got a chance.  I mean, I met - I didn't know what a Jew was until I went to college.  I mean, I just like - you know, I'm sitting there with Ed Schneiderman, and he's telling me that he doesn't believe in Jesus Christ.  I said, "What'd you say?" you know.  Then to make it even worse, he told me he was an atheist, and we were sitting in a restaurant down right underneath Roosevelt, and I thought that the roof was going to cave in.  I thought the world was going to - what?  "Don't say that."  "How could you say that?"  "You don't believe in God?"  "Oh, my God!"  You know, "This is terrible."  I just didn't know that kind of thing existed, you know.  I mean, I got an education really late in life.  I mean, I read my first book at - that I can remember - in summer school at Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  It was 'The Moon and Sixpence' by [William] Somerset Maugham, and I read that book.  I stayed up all night reading that book, and it was a fascinating story, you know, roughly based on the life of [Paul] Gauguin [artist], and so - I mean, it was like a whole world opening up for me when I went to college.
Story_ID: 4320
Speaker 1: So you went - you actually - did you go from Parker [Francis W. Parker High School, Chicago, Illinois, South Side] to Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I went from Parker [high school] to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Roosevelt?  But when did you go to Wilson Junior College?
Speaker 2: To summer school to make up some of those grades.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got it.
Speaker 2: Deficiencies, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was there anything else important during those Roosevelt years because I want to get to?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt years.
Speaker 1: Were there other people there that influenced you or people who you were classmates with?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  I met some very interesting people there, and the most important influence on my life during my college period was the fraternity.  I became - that was my first real experience at becoming a leader.  I mean, it was an amazing transformation for me when I became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity [for African American men], and I just - I blossomed.  I became a leader.  I was the president of the chapter.  I mean, I just became a different person.
Speaker 1: I thought when you were saying you had become a member, I always thought you were talking about A.D.S. [Alpha Delta Sigma advertising fraternity]
Speaker 2: Oh, no, this was - I'm talking about the fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, yeah, the African American.
Speaker 1: Right, and did they have a chapter at Roosevelt?
Speaker 2: No.  They had a Chicago chapter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the Theta chapter.  It took in all of the Chicago schools.
Speaker 1: So who were the people that you met at that time that maybe still, you know, you're in touch with or, you know, were a part?
Speaker 2: Odell Hicks, Paul King, Floyd Carroll, J. Herbert King - oh, my God - Bernard Cross, people I pledged with, Bernie Gresham who is no longer with us, Costello Johnson.  Probably - Costello and Odell are probably the people I'm most in contact with.
Story_ID: 4321
Speaker 1: Now this is what I find - okay, so you become part of that chapter.  It changes your life because - what - you're exposed, because you get (unclear).
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Because I am exposed, because I am accepted, and because I am given the opportunity to express and to lead.  You know, I mean, I made a speech before - at a national convention.  You know, I mean, I remember going to a speech writer to help me, you know, put it together.  I mean, I'm writing a - I'm giving a speech to a grand ballroom full of people including the founders of the organization, you know, who were sitting up at the dais [platform].  Not only that, but I'm organizing it.  I'm organizing it, and it's like well, "Where'd this come from?  Where'd this ability come from?"
Speaker 1: But where did it come from because it's sort of amazing when you think of the child who was, you know, introverted?
Speaker 2: It's basically - you know, I guess what I was doing is I was just watching.  I'm a pretty good mimic.  You know, I can watch - I can do almost everything that I can see.  I tell people that about bowling and about playing golf.  I'd say, "You know, I can do that," because I could see how they do it so I spent most of my life watching things, you know, and listening to things, and I--.
Speaker 1: But also you're among this group of black men that are doing things.  This is really the first time.  That's what that also represents, right?
Speaker 2: But I'm around black men who are doing things but also black men who are respecting me as a peer which enhances my image of myself, you know.  You know, if they are looking at me and they're looking at me, across at me and saying, "Hey," you know.  Not only that, but "We want you to lead us."
Speaker 1: You know, but this is the thing.  You were able to step into that.  Some people who have low self-esteem would question and would sort of fumble the opportunity because they were afraid, you know, because the negative messaging, but you stepped right in there.
Speaker 2: Well, you know what it is, it's - fear works in a funny kind of way.  If you've gotta look at the rest of your life and say, "I am afraid of being like this for the rest of my life," then you've got to get out and do it.  I mean, you just say, "I can't live the rest of my life in this kind of fear."  "I've got to - I have to do something about it."
Speaker 1: That is true.
Speaker 2: There is kind of a latent inherent kind of thing.  I mean, everybody's wired differently.  I really believe that and how, you know, different people can react to the same situation in totally different ways, but if you're wired a certain way, there's an innate kind of aspirational thing, a drive that says, "I cannot live in this kind of subordinate kind of a situation so I have no other choice but to get on out there," you know.

Speaker 1: Because the other thing I find a little curious - I mean, were you one of the first people in your family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, first person to graduate.
Speaker 1: First one, okay.  So was there support for - you know, is your mother [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] being supportive of this time?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: She wants to see her son, you know, do well.  Did she ever question the advertising?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: My mother never questioned any of that because she didn't know it, and she deferred to me.  She respected me and my opinion and my thinking.  She basically said, "Hey, you've got to think for yourself."  I mean, she was not aware - she's - I'm still trying to explain to her what I do, you know.  I mean, it's a tough - it's an abstract concept, you know.
Speaker 1: Now when you are a part of A.D.S. [Alpha Delta Sigma advertising fraternity], are you the only black person who was part of it at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what are you thinking are your opportunities at this point?  You know, you're looking - you know, it's now time to get a job.
Speaker 2: You know what I think?  I think it's a form of insanity.  I think that, you know, it's denial, you know.  You just don't.  You think.  You don't think.  You go.  You do.  You feel like, I guess, you're going to be the acceptable exception.  You're going to be the exception and do it.  When I first went to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], I sat down and talked with Randall Works who was the professor of advertising, and he talked to me about the same thing.  He said, "You're talking about going into advertising.  I just want you to understand that there are no black people working in the advertising business in any capacity in the United States."  There was one guy in New York who was almost passing for white, but there was - in Chicago there was not a single black person in an advertising agency in any capacity - secretary, mailroom, anything else, total 'lily white' - so he said, "You know, I just want you to understand that you're talking about getting into a business that up to this point has not embraced or welcomed anybody other than white people."
Speaker 1: And that was fine with you because of this - well (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, my thing was always - I don't know how conscious it was or maybe it was just being dense or thick-headed is that I'm just going to do it, and I've always done that.  Digressing - I mean after I'd been in the business, I went and lived in Europe for a year, and I came - and I wanted to come back so I called people here, and they said, "Well, you know, there's a recession going on," and this and that.  I said, "I need one job," I mean, so I disregarded the statistics.  I said, "All I need is one job.  Don't tell me about, you know, the statistics about how many people are being laid off.  All I need is one spot, one person, one job, do it."  I guess I felt the same way.  I mean, somehow I felt I was going to break through because I've never felt myself to be an extremely intelligent person, but I - and I'll tell you a story about that, too - but I've always felt myself to be extremely determined, you know - not always, but once I kind of get on this - on the track.
Story_ID: 4323
Speaker 1: So now you go - okay, so you go looking for jobs.  Do you have a portfolio?
Speaker 2: I didn't go looking for a job.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: No.  What happened was I kept running my mouth about being in this business, and Costello Johnson, the guy I was pledging with, his brother-in-law worked for 'Ebony' magazine as a sales rep [representative].  Now those are the only black people who ever got into agencies because they were selling space in the magazine.  He had a colleague, Don Brown, who also was a sales rep., and he called on Wade Advertising [Agency].  Don was calling on Wade Advertising for 'Ebony', and somehow the management had decided they wanted to hire a black person for the mailroom.  I don't know what divine intervention came in and said, "Hey, we need to do this."  The only person they knew to ask about it was the 'Ebony' rep, Don Brown.  Don Brown happened to know about me through Ron Sampson, who knew about me through Costello, my fraternity brother, so as soon as that job became available, it got through to me.  I called Ron and then talked to Don and said, "Hey, I want that job."  I went in and got an interview.  I was not what they were looking for.  They were looking for an eighteen-year-old freshman kid who was going to night school because they wanted it to be a long-term process.  I was a twenty-one, twenty-two-year-old kid majoring in marketing - they wanted - majoring in English.  They wanted a marketing major, majoring in English going to day school that was still in college, but there was nobody else applying for that job.  Nobody else had had the Careers course [at Francis W. Parker High School, Chicago, Illinois, South Side].  Nobody else had the teacher to tell them, you know, try advertising.  I mean, they couldn't find anybody else so I got the job by default so that's how I got into the business, working in the mailroom, sorting mail, changing towels in the towel machine in the men's washroom, changing the Cokes [Coca-Cola] in the Coke machine, and so forth.  That's how I got the job.
Story_ID: 4324
Speaker 1: I mean, even though you're working at the mailroom [at Wade Advertising Agency in Chicago, Illinois], this is exciting.
Speaker 2: It's exciting and it's challenging because I was dealing with - you know, I was dealing with racial issues there.  I mean, it wasn't a mean-spirited place, but, you know, institutionalized racism is a tough thing to deal with, but yeah, I was finding it exciting.  I had to be very creative because I had to figure out - fortunately, I had a good relationship with the mailroom supervisor, and I was still in school so I found very interesting times to take lunch, you know, like four o'clock in the afternoon, you know, whenever the course was, the class was, and he would let me go and come back so that was a good thing.  That was part of my persuasive thing as well, you know, but I found it very interesting.  I didn't stay there long.  I was only in the mailroom for about eight months because I was campaigning to get out of there from the time that I got there.
Speaker 1: And so you graduate in what year?
Speaker 2: '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: '62 [1962].  Okay.
Speaker 2: I was supposed to graduate in '61 [1961], but I had - I took a year of study at Sherwin Williams Paint Company.
Speaker 1: So what are you doing between '62 [1962] and '64 [1964] now?
Speaker 2: '62 [1962] and '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: I worked at Wade from '60 [1960] to '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute, so you said you just stayed in the mailroom eight months.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Before I moved into the copy department.
Speaker 1: So were people - were you the only, let's say, college-educated person in the mailroom or not?
Speaker 2: No.  Chuck Bez was - he had gone to college.  Chuck Bez was a white guy from Berwyn [Illinois].  You know, Bzinskas, you know, he was your standard guy with the crewcut and stuff, you know, but he was a good guy.  I often think about him and wonder where he is.
Speaker 1: So how do you get moved out then or how do you move--?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing, first of all, when you're in the mailroom, you're in a wonderful position.  First of all, everything that goes out of there and comes in goes through the mailroom so you're collating memos.  You're mimeographing [photocopying].  You just mimeograph a copy for yourself, and you find out everything that's going on at the company.  I found out that they were having some problems on Alka-Seltzer [antacid] with one of their major brands, and I put together a research proposal.  I went out and did some research at Cabrini-Green [housing project, Chicago, Illinois] and a few other places.  I - so that's one thing that the mailroom gives you.  The other thing that the mailroom gives you is mobility.  I mean, you're constantly running into people in the john [bathroom].  I have the wagon that, you know, you push around delivering mail.  You push it by everybody's office so I work on the project, and here again I'm walking and talking like I should be doing something else, shirt and tie every day, you know, clean, clean as the Board of Health.  You know, moving through - I move through the creative department, see the creative director in his office with nobody else in there.  I go in with my little package, remind him of who I am, tell him that I'm aware of the problem that he's having on the Alka-Seltzer account, and tell him that I've been thinking about it and thinking about solutions, and I talked to him about the solutions.  Then I say you know, "It really doesn't make any sense whatsoever to have me pushing this wagon around when I can be helping you solve your problems."  Voila - next week I'm a copy writer.
Speaker 1: I still say that's somewhat amazing. So you're a copy writer.  How large is Wade - I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Wade, at that time, was the third largest agency in the city [Chicago, Illinois].  They were doing about $34,000,000 and $35,000,000 in billings - at that time, considerable.  I mean, only Leo Burnett [advertising agency] and Foote, Cone, and Belding [advertising agency] were bigger.
Story_ID: 4325
Speaker 1: So you're in the copy writing department [at Wade Advertising Agency, Chicago, Illinois].  Do you get - are you fighting there once you get there in terms of assignments or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You're not?  Huh.
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, I started working on - first of all, I started taking on assignments, you know.  I mean, the thing is if you got a pencil and piece of paper, you can write, you know.  You don't need any equipment, you know.  All you need is access to some information which I already had, but I was assigned the Robin Hood Flour business.  That's up - you know, I was selling, basically selling flour and flour-based products to Appalachian whites up in, you know, Pennsylvania and West Virginia so I basic - that was my first thing at niche marketing and segmented marketing.  I had to learn about that market segment, and I tell people that today.  You know, you come in.  You could be white.  You need to learn about the market that you're trying to reach, you know - immerse yourself in it so that's the first thing I did, and then I started working on Alka-Seltzer [antacid].  I mean, I talked to writers who were working on the business, find out what the assignment is, and just try my hand at it, and I did a commercial after about three weeks there.  I did an Alka-Seltzer commercial about a family at a zoo, and the father had a hangover or something, you know, and the monkey in the cage was mimicking him, you know, the worn-out feeling, you know, tired, dragged, you know, and he was - the monkey was looking like he was feeling - the chimp was feeling - looking like he was feeling, you know, and that was my first commercial.
Story_ID: 4326
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors [at Wade Advertising Agency, Chicago, Illinois]?  No?  I mean, because - okay, I'm just saying that they're pretty hostile environments, those, you know, ad agencies can be, but you had no?
Speaker 2: I had a pretty good bunch of guys once I broke through.  It was - it had some problems, but the creative guys turned out to be pretty - Joe Coulter, Joe Bern.  I mean, they turned out to be pretty, pretty decent guys, and in fact, I even hung out with them a little bit, went to fights, went to the Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] fight with Sonny Liston so - there were problems.  I ran into some real racial problems, you know.  I remember being out with a client, and we were going a restaurant, and we went in two platoons.  They had two cars.  The first group came, went in, and they were seated, and then I came in with the second group, and all of a sudden they came up and said they had run out of food, and so they were embarrassed.  They had to get up and leave with us, you know, because they wouldn't serve me and stuff like that.  You know, the chief financial officer of my first Christmas party came up to me, and it was a talent show, and he said, "You know, I know that you're new here, but next year do you think you can sing us some down-home songs?"  I said, "Down in whose home?"  You know, I mean, and there was a company outing every year.  Dick Riffner who was in charge of the company outing - he called me in and said "Tom, I really have great news for you.  I talked to the people out at Villa Olivia [country club in Bartlett, Illinois], and they said it was okay for you to come."  I said, "Oh, okay, that's interesting," you know, and as I was getting up to leave, he said "But you know there's one thing, that you can't use the pool, that they have a restriction that you can't use the swimming pool."  Needless to say, you know, what I said to him and his company outing and his Villa Olivia and all that other stuff, you know, but I mean those are the kind of things that I kind of had to deal with.  I had to go through watching a secretarial candidate.  They didn't have - I mean, they didn't have anybody else there but me of color, and they actually - the head of the secretaries actually had a meeting with the secretaries to determine if it was okay with them if they tried to hire a black secretary, actually talked and had a meeting with the black secretaries, and then I guess they decided they would give it a try, and this poor woman - I mean, she wasn't prepared.  I mean, it was close to harassment.  It was.  One day she came in and her slip - they was wearing slips in those days - the slip must have been about this much [shows 1/2 inch with his fingers] underneath her - coming up from underneath her skirt.  I mean, you would have thought that she had come in buck naked.  I mean, you know - I mean, it was like - she couldn't take it.  She quit.  She couldn't handle it, but, you know, those were the kind of things that were happening.
Story_ID: 4327
Speaker 1: So how did you move from Wade [advertising agency] to Leo Burnett [advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois]?  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, that happened because I was one of the - I was chosen.  They had just started a thing called the Institute for Advanced Advertising Studies at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] sponsored by the American Association of Advertising Agencies, and I was chosen as one of the two representatives from Wade to go to that class, and during that seven or eight week period, I was kind of discovered by Burnett, and one of the creative directors recruited me.
Speaker 1: Now how were you chosen to participate in this?  Was it just because you were - they were trying to be magnanimous or you were really good?
Speaker 2: An outstanding young talent.
Speaker 1: Now Leo Burnett, that's a different - I mean, you had been hired into a culture that - but you said it wasn't bad at that time.
Speaker 2: Burnett?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Burnett was not good.
Speaker 1: It wasn't.  Okay, because, you know, I was going to say, you know, you had been at least - that, you know, this had been a place that had nurtured you along really in some respects, even with the experience you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Burnett?
Speaker 1: No.  No.
Speaker 2: Oh, Wade.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about Wade.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You had - you know, you had been able to progress with that.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So, but you get to Burnett, and what is that experience like?
Speaker 2: That experience was not particularly good.  I had a pretty repressive group of people around us, around me, who basically didn't approve of a whole of things.  They were not that supportive.  The guy I worked directly for was very supportive, John Clark, but I couldn't - we couldn't get beyond his boss.
Speaker 1: So what did that mean?  Did that mean that you - the copy - you know, the things that you worked on, they were not used?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were not accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what accounts were you working on?
Speaker 2: I was working on Pillsbury [baking products], mostly cake and frosting mixes when I first got there.  I subsequently moved on to Pure Oil, which is gasoline.  I don't know if it still exists or not, and then I got some assignments working on Parliament Cigarettes and some new products, and I think that's about all that I worked - oh, Swanson, Swanson Foods [frozen foods] for awhile.
Story_ID: 4328
Speaker 1: Did you find that with - I mean, were there changes happening in the industry at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The changes that were happening in the industry is that when I came into the business, there were no black people working at all working in it, and then during the '60s [1960s] things started to really heat up, and black people were being hired.  Unfortunately, they were being hired incorrectly and for the wrong reason, and, I mean, they [Leo Burnett advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois] were just pulling bodies in for whatever reason to fulfill whatever quotas or requirements, government requirements.  I don't know, but as a result of that, there was no infrastructure in place to deal with all of the issues that were going on.  There were people being foisted on people who didn't want to have people foisted on, especially people of color, and they just sat there.  I mean, Burnett had people just sitting there, and they didn't - they weren't prepared.  The company wasn't prepared.  When you have black people in groups just sitting there and not being utilized, not being trained, nothing happening, then they start commiserating.  They start commiserating.  Then the next thing you know, they're being dubbed as troublemakers.  They're commiserating because people aren't giving them assignments.  Next thing you know, they're either leaving or being fired - in most cases, just leaving because it wasn't cool to do too much firing so that's basically what happened.  I mean, during the '66 [1966], '67 [1967] period right before I left, I mean, Leo Burnett had a lot of African Americans.
Speaker 1: When you say a lot, how many are you talking about?
Speaker 2: Well, enough for a big party.  I mean, we had - there were - say, at that time Burnett had probably maybe 600 people, and you know, there were two people, three people in research.  There might have been a dozen copy writers and art directors.  There might have been four or five media people, and a couple of producers and people working in the studio.  Yeah, I mean enough for us to form an organization called BAG, Black Advertising Group.  I mean, you know, and yeah, but all those people, very few of those people survived.
Speaker 1: And did.
Speaker 2: One or two.
Story_ID: 4329
Speaker 1: The other -  was this - the change that happened, did it happen after Martin Luther King's [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death?  Is that - I mean.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it happened before Martin Luther King's death.  It happened during the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: The '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: The '60s [1960s].  It did.
Speaker 1: He died in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: He died in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Oh, he died in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I believe that's true.  He and Kennedy, Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy, 1925-1968], I think died the same year.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right, the voting rights act was in 1964.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they're hiring [Leo Burnett advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois] all these people, and people don't really have expertise.  You're sort of to yourself.  BAG [Black Advertising Group] gets started, but BAG - was it called BAG?
Speaker 2: BAG.
Speaker 1: Was that - would you say that that was - it's still in existence, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, it isn't.
Speaker 2: No.  There may be something else in existence somewhere, but.
Speaker 1: But was that - was Leo Burnett - did it have the largest group of hirees at that time?
Speaker 2: Probably because they were so much larger than anybody else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think anything BAG did was important now?
Speaker 2: Well, they just helped to nurture the people and helped to counsel them and try to salvage some, and we did so successfully try to keep people's sanity.
Speaker 1: So you decided this is not the place for you after three years.
Speaker 2: Burnett?  Yes.  Well, actually I came close to deciding that advertising was not the place for me so I left, actually, the business and just took a year off.  I traveled to Paris [France] and just did nothing.
Speaker 1: Was it - I thought - someone had London [England] down there.
Speaker 2: London is where I wound up working.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I went to Paris until I ran out of money, and I couldn't get a job in Paris because of the language problem, and so I went to London where there was no language problem, and I got a couple of job offers, and that's what I did for another eight or nine months.
Speaker 1: Did you find - now that experience was - you say - you know, earlier you said Paris is one of - you know maybe you'd consider it one of your favorite places, and I'm wondering if your love affair started back then when you went to visit.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But what made you even decide to go, you know, to go abroad like that?
Speaker 2: It was a deferred kind of dream thing.  I basically always thought it would be kinda cool to do it.  My problem was I did it about seven years too late because I was hanging out with a bunch of kids, you know, college kids.  It wasn't groovy there.
Story_ID: 4330
Speaker 1: This point is kind of relevant to a point we were making earlier about how you're wired and how different people respond to the same stimulus, I mean, differently, you know.  When I was having trouble, I talked about the - my first year in school, and you know, I guess they didn't really see that I was piling up all this work and hanging out in the cafeteria and stuff.  They sent me to see the school psychologist to see, you know, what was wrong with me, you know, and so I took an I.Q. [intelligence quotient] test.  I guess that's what it turned out to be, and the psychologist met with me to go over the results, and he basically said to me that based on the results of the test, it was unreasonable for me to expect that I would be able to get through college and that I should perhaps think about some other alternatives in terms of my career path and my educational path, but basically what he was telling me is that I was intellectually inadequate to the task of doing coursework.  Now again, talking about that fear factor, I mean fear of being destined to languish as a mentally feeble person, I couldn't accept that.  I mean, I basically was going against science here, you know, at least in my head at that point.  This guy's a psychologist.  He's looking at the results and saying I don't have it.  I did what I usually do in those kinds of situations.  I told him, you know, "Thank you very much" and then went on about the business of trying to prove that that wasn't true, but things like that certainly have a tremendously powerful effect on you in your life. I think I was forty years old before I really realized that I was not just spoofing the public, that I genuinely was smart and accomplished, but up until that time, I mean - pretty much fueled also by my father, and that was the other story.  I mean, I sat with him while he was dying of cancer and getting ready to go to college and told him that I was going to go ahead and do it, and he told me that he thought I was crazy to think that I would be able to go to college.  He said "You'd be lucky if you could get a job at the post office, if you can pass the post office test," so those things kinda happened not too far away from each other, and I can see some other person wired differently could just take that information and just say, "Hey, that's it.  I'm beat," you know.  He said it, reinforced by the school psychologist, but I guess it's just the way that I'm wired is when somebody tells me that - I mean it's like hanging on, climbing up a cliff, and somebody says, "Hey, you know, you can't get up this cliff."  I mean, you're about this far away, but you look down, you know, it's 40,000 feet down, and you know, "I can't fall so I just have to figure out a way to get up there," so that's essentially what motivated me again.  The negative input motivated me again.  I had somebody else to prove wrong, but it took a long time for me to really realize that I wasn't just putting on an act of acting smart and getting over, and, you know, being slick or glib or whatever the case may be, to realize, "Wait a minute," you know.  "I am smart," you know.  "He was wrong," you know, and those are the kinds of things that I think in a kind of cosmic way, I mean, that we all have to deal with all the time, particularly from an African American perspective because I think that we spend a lot of our time being subjected to those kinds of signals every day that basically says that we're not equal.  We're not up to it.
Story_ID: 4331
Speaker 1: There's a thing that I call race-based self esteem deficiency, which I think is a kind of an epidemic, a pervasive kind of disease that we suffer from on all levels, whether we be middle class or poor or, you know, the acceptable exception.  I think there's this underlying thing that basically we continue to deal with on the heels of - it's not the heels of slavery itself but on the heels of the tremendously powerful marketing communications program that this country put together, not to convince us that we were inferior but to convince them that we were inferior in order to cope with the profound contradiction of being in a society where all men are supposed to be created equal, but then - wait a minute - but these people aren't being created equal so what can I do to justify that contradiction?  Well, they're not people.  They're not people in the sense that they're lazy.  They're immoral or amoral.  They're devious.  They're all these things, and now I've said that.  Now what I've got to do is I've got to put together the campaign to convince me and to convince them that it's true so it's got to permeate everything that we have in our society so you've got salt shakers and postcards and later movies and books and all kinds of visual representations, you know.  You've got the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' and later you've got the 'Amos 'n Andy.'  You've got all these different things to try to again make this thing right, and I think that we are - we internalized it, consciously or unconsciously or subconsciously, and we're still trying to deal with that, you know, trying to purge ourselves of that whole notion, and you know, the whole self-hatred thing that's been put on us, and, of course, the paradoxical thing about it is that we were put into it with the help of other people, but if you have the same people who put us into it, have us, pull us out of it, then that doesn't help us.  In fact, that proves the point because if we need people to help us pull out of it, that gives credence to the premise that we're inferior if we can't pull out of it by ourselves so, you know - so we basically have to figure out a way, you know, to do that, but it's a long of way of saying, you know, that whenever anybody tells you that you're not this or you're not that, then there's a natural tendency for you to say, you know, well, maybe there's a point - whether you say it consciously or not, but I think we all get those signals, and we all internalize them so - but in this case, I didn't.  I mean, I could've just dropped out of school.
Speaker 2: Easily.
Speaker 1: Easily.
Speaker 2: Easily.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now I - you decide - you take that year off, and you go to Paris [France], and you go work in London [England].
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: Right?  And you said you worked in London eight months?
Speaker 1: Well, actually, what happened is I got married.
Speaker 2: Oh, you got married.
Speaker 1: What happened is I - my girlfriend [Joli Burrell] here in Chicago [Illinois] - I left and went to Paris with the idea that I would get a job, and then she and her daughter would come over and live in Europe.  I couldn't do it in Paris.  I went to London, got a job, came home, got married, and took her and my stepdaughter to London so that's how that whole thing happened.  Had that not been the case, I might have continued to be in Paris and not work, you know.
Story_ID: 4332
Speaker 1: Now, so you said you went - you got married, and you lived in London [England], and were you working - now who were you working with?
Speaker 2: Foote, Cone and Belding [advertising agency].
Speaker 1: Oh, that was in London, okay.  Okay, it seems.
Speaker 2: Miss Buland, Buland.
Speaker 1: Miss Buland is the one who taught Careers [at Francis W. Parker High School, Chicago, Illinois, South Side].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Buland - B-E-U?
Speaker 2: B-U-L-A-N-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you - okay, so Foote, Cone and Belding - you worked there for eight months.
Speaker 2: About eight months.
Speaker 1: Now what was that experience like because you're in England?
Speaker 2: That experience was overall a good experience.  The worse part of that experience was that I went over there and got a job and was paid on a British wage scale, which was already low, and then experienced two devaluations of the pound [currency] so when it got down to a point where my monthly rent was more than half of my salary, pretty tough.  I remember taking my wife [Joli Burrell] and my - well, essentially taking my stepdaughter to the zoo, got to the zoo on public transportation, and saw that there was an admission fee.  We didn't have it.  It was - she's six years old, and so we're faking it so we go across the street to the playground, and "Oh, yeah, well, here's where we are.  Come on.  Let's play," and she kept kind of like looking over - "Isn't the zoo over there?" you know.  We just basically tried to, you know, play it off, but we didn't have enough money to get into the zoo so it was time to go.
Story_ID: 4333
Speaker 1: So money was tight, but you were - it was a happy period for you, though.  I mean.
Speaker 2: It was an interesting - it had some happy times to it.  I mean, it was cold.  I mean, the thing about London [England] is that unless you're really living well, you freeze to death even though it's thirty-five, forty degrees outside because what happens is the cold just permeates everything.  Their idea of central heat is that if you - is that you have a radiator in the room, and if you sit on it and stay on it for, you know, a long time, you may start to feel a little heat.  That's central heating, you know.  I mean, taking a bath - I mean, that was a huge thing.  I mean, we slept in underwear, long underwear, you know.  It was cold.  It was cold, and unfortunately we were there during that period.  We didn't get a chance to really enjoy a summer in London together.  I had been there alone, but by the time - it was September when we got married [in the United States] and went back so we were there during the coldest time of the year.
Speaker 1: And did you - just one other question about that.  Did you have any exposure to the black or African community or Caribbean community?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had friends, Kofi and his wife, and Chaka was his son.  They were from Nigeria.  He was a doctor.  They were friends of ours, and then there was David Gittens, who was a photographer, a black photographer, living over there.  We were friends with him for awhile but not a lot.  We didn't know a lot of people.  There was one neighbor who was there who was close for awhile.
Story_ID: 4334
Speaker 1: So you come back and you get a job.  Is it.
Speaker 2: Needham, Harper, and Steers.
Speaker 1: Is it DDB Needham now?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's called DDB now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They dropped the Needham.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So has much changed in the [United] States in this, you know, this time period that you've been gone now?  What did places like Barbara Proctor [Proctor Communications Network], and, you know, when did they get started?
Speaker 2: They got started before I did.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: They got started - the first one out of the box was Vince Cullers [Vince Cullers Group].  I mean, he started way before any of us did, and Barbara Proctor started a year or two before I did here in Chicago [Illinois], and there were a couple of New York agencies that started a couple of years before I did - Zebra [Zebra Agency], UniWorld [Uniworld Group, Inc.] which still exists now - and there were a few others that started a little later.
Speaker 1: Now what do you think - so when you're at Needham, is that a better experience or, you know, just the same as Leo Burnett [advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was the best experience for me.  It was really a terrific experience for me.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about - you became copy supervisor there, right?  But what - can you tell me why it was?
Speaker 2: Because they gave me responsibility and gave me authority that was commensurate with that responsibility.  I learned a lot.  I worked for a guy who was - he was a terrible creative director, but he was a terrific marketing strategist, and I learned a lot about strategic positioning of a product working for him.  His name was Jack Friedman, and I got responsibility.  I got a chance to work with good people.  I got a chance to produce.  I got a chance to interface with clients.  I basically learned the agency business there, and it really helped prepare me to go out on my own.
Speaker 1: And you think you got exposure to the agency business because he mentored you or because you were serving as a copy supervisor?
Speaker 2: No.  He didn't mentor me.  He didn't mentor anybody.  He threw us out there and - but the thing is he didn't hold me back, and that's a huge thing.  He paid me.  He treated me like I had an important job and that I was capable of doing it, and he got on me when I failed to do it, you know, so it wasn't any special treatment one way or the other.
Story_ID: 4335
Speaker 1: Now when you - so you're there [at Needham, Harper and Steers advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois] three years, but, I mean, what is starting to percolate inside of you?  Is it because you start - you see others going out on their own?  I mean, what is this desire, you know, to go out and sort of branch out on your own?
Speaker 2: It started to percolate pretty soon after I got back.  I think that I had just kind of an innate aversion to working for other folks.  I also had a feeling that my ability to move forward would be stymied by the system, by the institutionalized racism that just existed everywhere, and I make a distinction between institutionalized racism and racism as it's usually termed.  You know, racism generally has a kind of a mean-spirited kind of implication, you know, involved, you know, by the "I don't like you because you're whatever."  Institutionalized racism - it has to do with habits and mores brought about by custom and practice that's, you know, steeped in history.  You know, it has to do with seemingly almost harmless kinds of attitudes that basically - you know, when a person says, you know, "Well, you're pretty smart" or "I'm surprised," you know, or "We're just alike."  You know, all these have different ways - you know, "You're very smart compared to what I thought you would be since you're black."  "We're all alike," which is another euphemism for saying "You're like me as opposed to I'm like you."  I mean, you know, "You're not as black as I thought."  I mean, you're - you know, I mean, all of these kinds of, you know, things that take place, but I had two things.  One is that I felt that race was going to hold me back, and number two, I felt that the organizational structure, even without that, would be restrictive to me.  I remember one evening walking around to the office of the president of the company and just kind of looking at his office and saying "Even if there were no glass ceilings, I would not fit in here," and I had started to do a lot of freelance work, and as a result of doing some freelance work, like doing ads for a used car dealer every weekend - as a result of doing that, I've discovered two things.  Number one is that you can make a lot of money doing that kind of stuff.  Number two is I enjoyed doing it, you know, working on my own, and from there I started to put together the idea of starting a company, an advertising agency, and I went through - now here again, this inferiority thing is operating again because it never occurred to me that I would do this on my own and by myself.
Story_ID: 4336
Speaker 1: I kept looking for somebody else to do it so in all of my efforts, I went out to look for a president, someone who could be the president, and I looked out for somebody who could be the creative director, you know, and my job would be to kind of back them up and do whatever, you know, what's needed.  That was the whole plan so I put together about two or three different groups before I found one that made sense and out of the three people - what happened is that the guy who was going to be president decided at the very last minute - I mean, the cards were all printed, the name was in the phone book - Mingo, Burrell, McBain - Mingo, Burrell, McBain - Frank Mingo, Emmitt McBain, Tom Burrell.  Frank Mingo pulled out at the eleventh hour and decided to stay at J. Walter Thompson [advertising agency in New York].  He and Emmitt McBain weren't getting along even before they got into business so that's how I became president so I was kind of reluctantly pulled into that.  Okay, I guess I'll have to try to do this.  About seven or eight months later, Emmitt McBain - the pressure of the thing got to him.  Oh, I'm sorry, not seven or eight months, but two, three years later, the pressure got to him.  He pulled out.  That's how I became creative director so by 1974 I had gone from being the third guy to being the only guy, and it was called - that's when it became Burrell Advertising instead of Burrell, McBain, but interestingly '74 [1974] was the point at which I started to attract the people I wanted to attract, started to get the business that I wanted to get, and that's when the agency took off, and so again I started to build up, you know, this confidence, but even with that, of course, you know, you have people saying that you are the best black advertising agency in the country, which again is this whole subcategorization, you know, and that continues today even, you know, and that continues to get to me every time I hear that, best black-owned agency, you know, because are you telling me this subspecies thing is still going on, you know?  It's like saying for a black person, "You're not doing bad" so that's how the whole thing came about with my becoming head of the agency, but it took those people dropping out for me to do that, and even after that, I would continue to look for people who were smarter than I was to do things that I wound up doing better.
Story_ID: 4337
Speaker 1: Now let's look at this because it's one thing - you said "I wanted to decidedly be," you know, "a behind-the-scenes person, and," you know, "here I find myself sort of catapulted to the front," you know, without - "unwillingly."  Now what do you think caused your success in being able to do that as far as, you know?
Speaker 2: To do what?
Speaker 1: To be able to handle - it's one thing to - you know, you have been - you had basically been, you know, a copy writer and then a copy supervisor, which is a whole different thing, even though you said at Needham [Needham, Harper and Steers advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois] you, you know, learned more about running an agency.  You did have experience unlike - well, you had the experience of coming up through, you know, very good agencies that were well run.
Speaker 2: Um hmm [Burrell nods head "Yes"].
Speaker 1: But my - what I'm asking is how do you think you were able to move into - you know, it's one thing to run a certain part of something, but it's another thing to run a business, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about those early days and, you know, some of the lessons you learned along the way, but - you know, but you said that, you know, by the year that your last partner left, you had the most successful year, too, and so.
Speaker 2: That's right because I had the right idea.  I mean, I knew how to pick people.  I picked the right people.  I knew how to attract good people, and I knew how to go out and get clients.  I just basically had discounted my abilities, and unencumbered by any other partner, I mean, it was easier for me to go out and do those things that I could do, but the thing that motivates you is fear and desperation - I mean, you know, fear of failing.  I mean, it can be a mighty powerful driver to move you forward.  I mean, there were many weekends that I stayed at the office [at Burrell McBain Advertising, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, I mean, talking about images, I remember my first child being born or was it my - yeah, my first child being born, and I went and picked my wife [Joli Burrell] up at the hospital and dropped her off on, in front of the house on the other side of the street so I could get back to work, and boy, you know, that's - you know, you're talking about a potent sense memory there.  I mean, it's just like "Whoa, what was I doing?"  I was in a daze, you know.  I mean, I didn't even have enough sense to prepare myself for going into business.  I had saved no money.  I just did it, and, I mean, I went - collected unemployment every week standing in that line.  You know, it was amazing.
Story_ID: 4338
Speaker 1: So tell me who were your early - the clients in your early years [at Burrell McBain Advertising, Chicago, Illinois].  Who were the - and what was your positioning amongst, you know, who you were going after?
Speaker 2: The earliest clients - I mean, the very earliest client was the Edison Theater Group, and they gave us a public relations assignment, and we didn't know anything about public relations, hadn't had a clue, but we knew that they were willing to pay us a thousand dollars a month, and we just basically had to try to figure out something, and they found out about after three months that we didn't know anything about it, and they - but by that time we had three thousand bucks, you know, so they were the earliest, and then we got the Philip Morris business selling Marlboro cigarettes to, you know, black people, you know, which at that time I was smoking.  I guess everybody was smoking.  Of course, now in retrospect, I think it was a terrible thing to do, and then came Jack Daniel's [whiskey], and with Jack Daniel's came Canadian Mist [whiskey], Brown-Forman [company].  They make Canadian Mist.  They own Jack Daniel's, and then the first real serious business that we got was McDonald's [fast food restaurant] in 1972.
Speaker 1: You make this seem very easy, and I'm just wondering, you know.  There's been a - over the years, you know, a lot of - and I'm sure you had to do this, but I'm wondering with the clients you had, had they already identified the black market or were you pitching them saying this is your black market because wasn't a lot of the challenge, you know, the statistics and the - you know?
Speaker 2: It still is, a lot of people.  It varied by account, you know, with regards to the--.
Speaker 1: But let's say take someone like Marlboro.  Had they done - you know, did they know that they specifically should target this?
Speaker 2: Well, we went in and made a presentation to them.  Yeah, I think they, they knew very well.  They knew very well that they should be targeting young African Americans.
Speaker 1: And you found that also with the liquor?  I mean, you did Jack--?
Speaker 2: With Jack Daniel's, we had to basically convince them because that was a hard sale because there was some concern about the impact of a targeted effort on their overall market.
Story_ID: 4339
Speaker 1: And how would you say your market or your niche or client base was different from the others around you, you know, whether it was Vince Cullers [Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] or--?
Speaker 2: Same client niche.
Speaker 1: Same client niche.
Speaker 2: The thing that we did that was different - you take Vince Cullers and take me.  Just - I mean, we probably present the best contrast.  I mean, Vince Cullers got into this business - what - ten, twenty years before I did.  I don't know, something like that.  Vince Cullers got into the business because he was unable to get a job in the business so basically - I mean, this happened with a lot of black people in the formation of a lot of black businesses.  If you couldn't get a job somewhere, you go off and do it yourself.  I mean, Vince was painting the sides of trucks.  I mean, that was how he got started so I give him all the credit in the world that he was able to do what he was able to do without ever having to step foot inside an advertising agency before because they wouldn't let him step in there.  The difference between him and other people like him and me is that I got an opportunity to get behind the doors and find out how it operates, and I spent eleven years studying how it operates so I had the opportunity to go in with a lot more ammunition than some of my other peers at that point.  Barbara Proctor had spent a little while at one agency but, you know, Barbara Proctor had worked as a - in the record business [as public relations chief].  You know, she worked for Vee-Jay [recording company in Chicago], as a matter of fact.  I met her.  I wrote liner notes for some of her releases so that's the benefit I had.  The other - now the other lucky break that we got is that because of the clients that we managed to get first off - McDonald's [Corporation] and then Coca-Cola [Company] - we had the opportunity to do what nobody else had done. and that is to do network television advertising.  That's basically what put us on the map.
Story_ID: 4340
Speaker 1: We had an approach [at Burrell McBain Advertising, Chicago, Illinois] to doing that advertising, but we had the opportunity to get it exposed.  We convinced those clients that that advertising should appear broadly, and we convinced them with the help of some research that by doing so, they would not turn off their white audience.  As a matter of fact, after they did the testing, what they found is that the advertising that we did not only did turn off the white audience, but the white audience liked it, and the black audience loved them, and it was very simple in those days, given the fact that African Americans had hardly ever seen themselves portrayed before in any kind of realistic positive situation but only as caricatures and stereotypes, just the idea of seeing black people on television as families, as normal people, as loving people, as couples, I mean, having a real life, I mean it just knocked people out - you know, kids sitting on the stoop, you know, doo-wopping, family reunion, Double Dutch, jumping Double Dutch rope - I mean, all of those things, a father coming home on a Saturday morning after working all night and playing with his kid.  As a matter of fact, we - Todd Bridges [actor] was our kid in that commercial, about eight years old at the time.  I mean, that was like "Whoa."  We did billboards of people.  We just picked people off the street and had them do billboards - I mean, just real black people, you know.  It was like this is something so we had that kind of opportunity to get that kind of exposure so that's one of the things that put us into that - at least put me on the list of the fifty most influential people in television - I mean, the idea that we introduced African American images in network television.
Speaker 2: Now how were you able to do that?  I mean, I understand that you did it, but how - what do you think the circumstances that sort of convinced them to give it a try?  I mean, it's one thing to say it worked after the fact, you know, but I mean you said we had done some research, you know, that, you know, proved right and they saw it, and I'm just saying there's a lot of fear on the part of corporate America even though, you know, both of those are consumer companies, but--.
Speaker 1: What convinced to do it?
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Persuasiveness.  I mean, it's the primary thing, persuading them to do it, try it, and the circumstances were right.  We had right - good people on our team, good people on our side, good people at the company.  It just - and in the case of McDonald's [Corporation], of course, we had the African American McDonald's operators, you know, who had a certain amount of influence, and we sold them as well as corporate so it's just a matter of selling and following up and living up to what you're going to say you're going to do.
Speaker 2: So those relationships extend until today, right?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Is that typical?  Most agencies don't have relationships that long.
Speaker 1: Well, we're very fortunate.  We have a thirty-year relationship with McDonald's and a twenty-nine-year relationship with Coca-Cola [Company].
Story_ID: 4341
Speaker 1: But can you tell - you know, just talk about some key - what you think are some key things that were milestones along the way?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Or even some anecdotal things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the key - some milestones along the way, of course, are getting the first piece of business was certainly a milestone, the first major piece of business which I'd say is McDonald's [fast food restaurant], the ongoing business.  The second milestone is when Burrell McBain became Burrell Advertising, and that's when I hired Sarah Burrows and Jean Morris and just a whole slew of people coming in here, Anna Morris, Sharon Kimbrough, and that's when we really took off.  We just sailed, and we started winning all the CEBA [Creative Excellence in Business Advertising] awards.  That was an award that was established around that time for excellence in black communications.  In there were some negative milestones, if you will, key points.  We stayed at our 625 space, 625 North Michigan space, up until 1986.  When we moved to this space, we made a major error by counting chickens before they hatched, and we got too much space.  We had hired the wrong people so we've had several purges, if you will, over the past thirty years, and so that happened.  Of course, we're dealing with a milestone right here - I mean, a very significant point, maybe the most significant point, but of course, two years ago we did our deal with Publicis [communications conglomerate, Paris, France], the French-based company, and that was a very important episode when we took on partners, if you will, and we're in the midst of a very difficult kind of thing right now because we're trying to move - I was talking about this whole issue of change, you know, trying to change the company to move into the next level.  That's a very tough proposition.
Story_ID: 4342
Speaker 1: And what do you - now were you bought out by Publicis [communications conglomerate, Paris, France]?
Speaker 2: Well, we haven't been bought out yet, but we've been bought into.
Speaker 1: Into.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But - and they're a large French concern, right?
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you - what are you seeing as - for the next stage?  What would you like to see happen, for it to become a major agency?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we're going to become a major agency.  We are going to become a major agency.  It may not be major in the conventional sense.  One of the things that we have going right now is what we call a Yurban [young urban] thrust, a term that Mickey Williams, one of our key executives here [at Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois], came up with, and what that simply means is urban youth, and we are continuing to focus on the African American consumer, but we're using that knowledge base as a means by which to segue into the market which it segues into, which the black consumer market segues into, and that's the urban youth market because, you know, the African American market and its youth component really drives - culturally drives youth markets throughout the world, starting with the suburbs here where seventy percent of, say, hip-hop music is purchased by white kids, and if you go anywhere else in the world, whether it be to Europe or Australia or Japan, you see its influence everywhere so that's what we're doing now with some of the business.  You know, we started doing that with the Sprite [soft drink] business.  We're hoping to do that with Adidas [sporting goods] or Adidas if you will, and so that's the next frontier for us so in that sense we will be a broader-based agency in the sense that we will be handling whole pieces of businesses rather than doing a black consumer market segment of or rendition of the general market campaign.  We will be doing our own campaigns for a lot of our clients so that's it.  I don't know how huge it sounds, but it is a tremendously difficult challenge to maneuver in terms of the personnel here and trying to keep everybody focused on what we're trying to do.
Story_ID: 4343
Speaker 1: Now does that mean sort of culture changes within the organization [Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: Because, you know, that youth market is a whole different--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Have you found - what are - when you look back over time and you think about, you know, the statistics and, you know, and the trends, the market trends, and everything that you were proposing as it relates to the black market, was that message - did that message pretty much stay the same and it just took time, you know, working, working, working at it or do you think that, you know, the African American market as a whole changed over time?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the answer to that question is "Yes" because there was a time when it stayed the same for a long period of time, and the answer is "Yes, it is changing from that."  I mean, in the earlier years, in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], you know, we were doing so much catching up in terms of getting to that market that through the '70s [1970s] and 80s [1980s] a lot of the dynamics remained the same, but we're now at a place where change is rapidly taking place.  We've lost the connection.  Our young kids have pretty much lost the connection to the whole civil rights movement, and it's just like ancient history to them.  I mean, you know, Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is just - you know, I mean it's an icon that they - just like we grew up, you know, celebrating George Washington's birthday, you know.  It's just one of those kinds of things so it's very daunting to keep up with how things are changing, but it's imperative that you do it, and change is happening much quicker than it happened in the past so we're basically trying to, you know, to do that, to keep up with how things are changing.  The racial dynamic is changing tremendously fast.  In the past there's been more of a racial classification.  Now the classification is becoming more age-related.  The classification is becoming much more age-related, and in some ways, it's becoming class-related.
Story_ID: 4344
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you this.  Why - as someone who's a consumer - we still look at T.V. [television] and our images are still mainly white?  I mean, this is the whole - I mean, in this - do you think the advertising industry, you know, that those images will ever become more, you know, pluralistic?  Do you think that day will come?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what makes you - you think that this urban market is going to make it happen or what's going to make it happen?
Speaker 2: It think what's going to make it happen is an economic imperative.  I think that people who do this for a living have gotta got on the stick and understand that the world is changing and that the general market is not general anymore.  I mean, you know, when you start looking at major metropolitan areas where the white consumer constitutes one-third of the total population and the other two-thirds is comprised of African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, and others, you know, it's a changing dynamic, and if you want to sell to those people, you've got reflect them in the advertising.  That's - I think that the industry is kicking and screaming going into this, but they are going to have to do it.
Speaker 1: Then how is - you know, Leo Burnett [advertising agency, Chicago, Illinois], is still, you know, has its position.  I'm not saying it hasn't lost major clients over the years but still has its position, and you even admitted yourself that, you know, their makeup hasn't - you know, it's worse than when you were there so I'm saying that, you know, these companies - the advertising industry is still very, very white.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And so how do you see that, you know, this imperative - how do you see it really being actualized in an environment that's white and not very diverse?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I have found is that this society is extremely capable - when pushed up against the wall - to make rapid change.  I mean, they can - you know, they have a real talent for it, as a matter of fact, I mean, almost to a point where it's magical and you forget how they felt yesterday.  It's really incredible.  Right now the numbers are very paltry when it comes to African Americans in this industry.  They've been working on it for a long time, but when it comes down to it with increased pressure from the advertisers who have a real stake and a real vested interest in seeing the look of advertising change because it's their business after all.  I mean, it's their soup and it's their bread, figuratively and otherwise.  They can do it if they're motivated to do it.  Right now, the problem is that they're not being properly motivated, sufficiently motivated to do it.  Look, we have an agency that's close to a mid-sized agency at over $200,000,000 in billings - let's forget about billings - at over $25,000,000 in revenue because the billings is really a specious classification.  We somehow manage to have an agency that is comprised probably about sixty-five, seventy percent African American.  Now an agency twice our size somehow can't manage to find two or three [African American staff members] because they say we can't find any qualified or whatever the case may be.  Well, how can we find 100, and they're twice as large and they can't find two or three?  It's because there's no compelling reason being given to do it.
Speaker 1: And you believe that'll change?
Speaker 2: I think it has to change.
Speaker 1: You believe this.
Speaker 2: It has to change.  It has to change because if the consumer is - by the year 2040 or whatever the case is, it's going to be over half minority, which is, of course, ridiculous because you're calling them minorities when they're, in fact, the majority.  The new minority will be the white population so are you going to continue to have white images out there only?  What's going to happen, they're not going to sell the stuff, and they're going to have to do something about it.

Speaker 1: Do you see any trends in the industry that disturb you - period?  I mean, as someone who has been a veteran, do you see any trends in the advertising industry that, you know, concern you like?
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, cable television was viewed as a threat, you know.  The Internet, you know, was viewed as a threat, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are things that disturb me in addition to the whole racial makeup of the advertising agency industry which is far behind almost any other industry, the banking industry, manufacturing, you know, you name it, on both a qualitative and quantitative level.  I mean, it's not just the numbers, but "How many presidents do you have?  How many executive VPs [vice presidents] do you have?  How many CEOs [chief executive officers] do you have?" relative to the marketing side or the marketer's side where you've got a number of companies that are headed by African Americans, you know.  Verizon [telecommunications company] has a couple of presidents.  Avis Rent-A-Car is headed by Maytag [appliance company].  You know, you can go through a whole list - American Express [credit card company] CEO, you know, I mean, so we have nothing like that so that's one problem that I have.  The other problem that I have with the agency business, which is somewhat caused by the clients, is the encroachment on the business by clients - you know, the un-American activity.  I consider it an un-American activity of dictating to a company how much profit they're allowed to make.  If we applied that principle across the board, then we wouldn't have this country, you know.  You should pay me on the basis of the worth of what I am providing for you without getting into my business about how much profit am I going to make.  If you tell me - if I say "I want that tablet, and you tell me that it's going to cost a dollar," I will determine whether or not that tablet is worth a dollar to me or not, and the natural dynamics of economics will determine how you price that because if it's worth considerably less than a dollar, somebody else is going to come along and sell it for less than a dollar, you know, and make their profits on that.
Story_ID: 4346
Speaker 1: I mean, I wouldn't - I couldn't go - just imagine somebody going into McDonald's [fast food company].  You're a customer, going up to the counter and saying "I would like to order a Coke [Coca-Cola], please, but I need your statement telling me how much you paid for the cup, how much you paid for the syrup and the water and the overhead and all that kind of stuff, and then after you give me those numbers then I will add ten percent profit to that for you, and that's what I'll pay for it."  How much would a Coke cost?  The question is "If you're going to charge me $1.50 for a Coke, do I think that that's a fair price based on how bad I want it?"  "If I don't, if I think it's too high, then I won't buy it."  You understand the distinction I'm making?  I mean, for someone to come in that says you know, this is how much money.  "Let me see your books."  "This is how much money we want you to make."  Advertising agencies certainly aren't the only ones who are subjected to that.  I mean, retailers are subjected to the same thing with manufacturers, you know.  They put the squeeze on them that says "Hey, this is what we want you to make."  I got a problem with that fundamentally, you know, so - and that's probably something that I can't go around preaching because, you know, my clients wouldn't like me very much, you know, but that's, you know, that's a problem, you know, that I have.  I - of minor consideration is this whole billings issue.  Advertising agency billings were based on what a company spent on behalf of their clients in media, and that was commissioned at fifteen percent which would give you an indication - if you were billing $100,000,000, you would say "Hey, this company is making about $15,000,000 in revenue."  Billings don't mean anything anymore.  First of all, fifteen percent is not even uniform anymore.  In fact, commissions are not even standard anymore.  Fees are - basically talking about billing is pretty specious, you know.  It really should be about revenues, how much revenue you have.  The only entity that should be talking about billings are media buying companies because they are the ones who work, and even there it's spurious because not all of them are working on a fifteen percent basis.  I mean, you can say I spent a $1,000,000,000 on behalf of this client, but it says absolutely nothing about what your income is so those are just some of the things that - I'm having a little bit of problem, too, and I'm thinking maybe it's age-related.  I'm having a problem with the signals that are being sent out through marketing communications, the - and it's not what most people would expect.  The cynicism is something that really bothers me in advertising, the mean-spirited type of advertising that's being done that demeans people and humiliates people and just basically takes a kind of a cynical, you know, attitude towards things - you know, people being killed in commercials, people being electrocuted in the wires, and you know, "Ha, ha, ha," you know - people doing mean things to each other, you know.  I think that's a period that we're going through, and I wish it would stop because I think that it's damaging, although it seems rather harmless to many people, so I would like to see more feel-good stuff.
Speaker 2: And that's what you've really done is feel-good, and you've painted the black community in a positive level.  I mean, you know, you were primarily - you and [Bill] Cosby [comedian].
Speaker 1: That's wonderful company to be in.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: That's wonderful company to be in.
Speaker 2: Right, it's wonderful company to be in.
Story_ID: 4347
Speaker 1: What - I want to ask you before - and then I have just a few more questions.  Were there any [advertising] campaigns that you were particularly proud of that you did?  You know, anything that, you know?
Speaker 2: I'm particularly proud of what we did for Sprite [soft drink] over the last fifteen, sixteen years.  You know, we basically took that product that was primarily designed as a kind of a mixer for people when they ran out of the other stuff, and we turned it into a kind of urban youth icon so I'm particularly proud of what we've done consistently over the years with that brand.
Speaker 1: Now, when you - the other question I have because there - this company is one that bears your name [Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] and, you know, we're in days where, you know, things are being bought out.  You know, owners like yourself are being bought out by majority concerns [business conglomerates], and there's a sadness in the, you know, a general sort of sense.  I mean, there's a mixed feeling, you know, that people are happy that owners are making, you know, money and being rewarded for their efforts.
Speaker 2: I'm not so sure about people being happy about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they're also upset.  You know, there's also a feeling that we're losing, you know, and that we have so little that is ours, you know, and we're losing it and so.
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to talk about that.  I think that my headline is that black people better get over it because it's a false notion that we're dealing with, the notion of - we're dealing with symbolic kinds of issues here as opposed to substantive kinds of issues.  The fact of the matter is that if we don't make allowances for people who get into business to get out of business, you're going to have fewer and fewer people going into business.  If you can - if you want equal opportunity to get in the business, you should also have equal opportunity to get out of it because if you don't have equal opportunity to get out of it, it's going to be a disincentive for you to get into it because while the rest of the world is engaged in merging and acquisition and building up capital, you know, African American companies either voluntarily or involuntarily are stuck in this place.  "Well, it ain't much, but it's mines," you know, "And I control it," but what you're controlling is a bag of sand with a hole in hit because eventually because of the trend towards conglomeration and the economies of conglomeration, you're going to be buried and left nothing.  I'm talking about leaving some kind of legend, some of kind of dynasty.  It ain't gonna to happen, but the problem is that we confuse control with power, and much of this obsession that we have with control is based on what I would consider to be called functional paranoia.  I call it functional because there's some basis for being paranoid about people taking stuff away from you, but if you don't do something, you're going to lose it anyway because if you're a hair care product and you say "I'm not going to - I'm going to stay black," and in the meantime black people are buying the hell out of Revlon and Avon [cosmetic and personal care products] and every other kind of 'von', you know, and leaving that company basically destitute and discouraging anybody from ever wanting to get into it knowing that that's the way it's going to go.  You know, they feel like they're going to be maligned if they try to get out of it.
Story_ID: 4348
Speaker 1: The key thing about - that people don't think about is the operative word 'sell' because what you do when you sell is you get something.  You get capital.  You get money.  I have two choices over time.  I can continue to run this business as an independent thing.  I'm sixty-two years old.  I can run it until I'm dead, and they'll come in, close down the office, take out the furniture.  My wife [Joli Burrell], my kids - they basically will, you know, take whatever we manage to accumulate, and that's the end of that just like if you go into history, Overton, you know, and all these other businesses that just sort of petered out when they tried to pass it on to, you know, to generations.  Either do that or I can get the best deal that I can, accumulate a lot of money, set up foundations with that to give back to the community.  I can spend time helping other young companies grow both by giving my time and money through angeling, you know, with the money, with the proceeds that I have, and I can continue to live a good life and pass on something to my kids for them to, you know, to continue to develop their things or I can just, you know, let it go.
Story_ID: 4349
Speaker 1: We're dealing in a totally different kind of environment now.  The whole agricultural model, agricultural base model of business development and business perpetuation is dead.  I mean, you start it off.  You develop a farm and, you know, pass it on to your kids.  Well, two things - that just doesn't work anymore.  My kids want to do something else.  You know, my kids want to be lawyers and teachers and barkeeps, and that's what they're doing, and financial people on Wall Street [New York] so that doesn't - that's not happening anymore.  This whole idea of developing a business to pass on to your kids is passé.  The idea of developing a business now, the model is to develop a business, build the business, sell the business.  That's the American model.  In fact, that's the world model.  Now the key thing is are we going to participate in that or not?  If we don't participate in it, then you get the double standard where here's Ted Turner [of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.].  Here's all these other people.  They're just having them a good old time, just buying and selling and buying 2,000 acre ranches and stuff, and here we are.  "No, we can't do that."  "We've got to hold on to this thing."  Never mind the fact that we're being encroached by, in our case, by IPG [Interpublic Group, an advertising conglomerate] and DDB [advertising agency] and Omnicom [advertising conglomerate] and stuff, "But it's mines," you know, it's mine so I think we have to get with it.  We got to get over it and got to get with it and not get hung up on spurious symbolism because that's basically what it's about, you know.  I'm under no delusion that Burrell Communications as a company is going to live on in perpetuity after I'm gone because the only thing that people are buying is me and a few other people around here.  There's no product.  I mean, there's nothing that I - a formula for how to make this thing.  It's gone so that's basically what we got to deal with.  It's tough to let go, but we got to let go.  That's part of the whole change thing that I'm talking about.  You've got to change the way that you look at things.
Story_ID: 4350
Speaker 1: You said, you know, "Seeds were planted," you know, "And then grow into other seeds."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What I - if I am able to get a major company to pay me a whole lot of money over the next four or five years for this business, it will allow me to help ten businesses grow.  It will allow me to help start ten agencies.  I was thirty-one years old when I started it.  I mean, it'll help me help ten twenty-five, thirty-year old people out here to develop their own businesses.  If I don't do it, then they will start one on their own and put me out of business, and then I will have no means by which to do that.  Simple arithmetic - if I get a whole bunch of money, I can set up a million, two million dollar foundation to get started to give money to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and to other institutions.
Speaker 1: The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: What's that?  What's that?
Speaker 1: I said the HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: The HistoryMakers, right.  Exactly, you know, because that's a real abstract - that's high up on the hierarchy of needs.  I mean, that's that real - that's that point, tip of the point, that kind of thing, like the crowns, you know, Steven Spielberg [movie director] coming up with $25,000,000.  I mean, can you image anybody doing that at this point?  We're not there yet.  What - I mean, what the community should be interested in my doing instead of holding onto this thing is trying to figure out ways for me to maximize, to make sure I'm the right kind of person to begin with, you know, because some people ain't giving nothing back.  Make sure that you find the right kind of people to maximize what they can get so that they can give a portion of that back and pass some of that on because it won't make any difference how many names are up there if you've got a negative net worth.  The other people understand that.  Ted Turner [of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.] understands that.  I mean, here's a guy, a billionaire who sells his company.
Story_ID: 4351
Speaker 1: But, you know, it goes back to the whole image, you know, notion of images and legacy and you may be the right person, but there are a lot of others that may not be the right person and so in a community that feels like they have so little, you know, that they've had to sort of hold onto and with pride say, you know, "Look, there's," you know, "Tom Burrell.  Look what he's done, and look at the wealth created.  Look at how many people he's employed."  It's a sense of loss.  That's all.  That's all people are reacting to, but if people are right - I mean, if their heads are right, then okay, but then that brings me to the point of this whole thing of, you know, imaging.  Are you saying that African American - you know, that market forces and corporate America are going to - and the change in the numbers are going to be enough to replace, you know, these companies that are being bought out?  That's all I'm - you know, that's what I hear you saying sort of.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  In fact, I'm saying that it will be even more powerful because the company that's going to buy me out is fifty times bigger than this company and will be imbued with the absolute necessity of being inclusive and being - now keep in mind that the images that I have been portraying through this agency are not the same images that people tomorrow are going to want to see because what people want to see changes, too, and so we can't even hold on to - okay, we've got to keep these same things going.  We've got to give people what it is that they want.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, we keep thinking about well, we got to hold onto these things, and there's some things that people should hold onto and want to hold onto and some things that people should not want to hold onto and don't want to hold onto.
Story_ID: 4352
Speaker 1: What does Tom Burrell at sixty-two - are there things that you haven't done that you want to do in your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God!  Yeah, a whole bunch of stuff.
Speaker 1: Is there one or two things, you mean?
Speaker 2: I've been trying - I've been putting off for the last forty years becoming fluent in a foreign language, primarily French.  I have been regretting for about thirty, forty years not having studied music.  I'm still struggling trying to learn something about the computer.  I have about six books in my head that I would like to write, and they keep adding up, you know, all the time.  I haven't traveled nearly as much as I would like to.  I have new business ideas that I would like to explore beyond this business.  I just have a whole slew of things that I would like to do, and I've got a whole lot of things that I regret, some things that I can do something about and some things I can't.
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes or concerns, you know, for the black community?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that - and this is another thing I really would like to spend more time with.  We have scholars at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] all dealing with the black issue.  I think, for the most part, most respectfully, that they're all off the wall.  I think that a lot of it is self-serving.  It's playing to the audience.  It's selling books, and nobody is dealing with the real issue.  You've got William Julius Wilson [professor, Harvard University, Kennedy School of Government] talking about jobs.  Just give people employment, and everything will be just fine.  You've got other people talking - you know, apologists.  You've got people who are - everything that happens, it's somebody else's fault, and none of this stuff is helping us.  The only problem that exists for African Americans that is of any significance is low race esteem, race esteem deficiency.  It's not the fact that we have been discriminated against historically.  It's how we respond and internalize that that is the problem, how we respond to it.  The fact of the matter as far as I'm concerned is that we do not like ourselves enough, and that is the basis of the problem that we have because until we like ourselves, we're not going to like each other, and until we like each other, we're not going to work with each other and cooperate with each other and help each other.
Story_ID: 4353
Speaker 1: As long as we feel that what those people back in the mid 1800s said about us is a bunch of baloney, until we truly internalize that, we're not going to get over this thing, you know, whether you're talking about drive-by shootings, you know, black people killing each other because whitey's, you know, bugging them or oppressing them so let me go out and shoot my brother or whether you're talking about corporate drive-bys where black people up in, you know, the executive suites are shooting each other down and not helping each other, the same reason, you know.  Who's the highest ranking black here?  You know, as long as we keep buying into that stuff, we're going to be behind the time.  We're going to be way behind our other minorities that are getting it together.  I mean, you look - there's a lot to be learned from the Jewish community.  There's a lot of be learned from the Hispanic community that's coming on very strong, organized, moving right ahead, and we're still denying how damaged we are, how hurt we are by what was inflicted on us 100 years ago and reinforced in many ways along the way and sometimes in the name of helping us out.  I'm reluctant to say there are two people out here who actually have the ability to say what is and have people - at least a certain segment of the population - accept it, and there's two disparate incongruous folks.  One is Chris Rock, and the other one is Louis Farrakhan.  They're the only people I know who can get up and - Louis Farrakhan can say "Hey, we want to get 200,000,000 people here to repent, to come and say we're going to stop screwing up, and we're going to change our ways, and we're going to start dealing with things on our own and deal with our families" and so forth, and you got Chris Rock saying, unfortunately with too many expletives, that, you know, that "White folks ain't got nothing to do with you not cutting your grass," you know, and so, I mean, we basically have people telling people what they want to hear either because they want to get votes or because they want to get contributions or whatever, but somebody needs to tell people - figure out a way to tell people that although somebody else put us into this thing, we're the only ones who can pull ourselves out of it.
Story_ID: 4354
Speaker 1: Do you ever think of your father [Thomas J. Burrell] these days?  I mean.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'm wondering what do you think he would say if he saw you now?  What would be?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure that he would say the right thing.  I think he would say something off the wall, but the thing that I would have liked to have happened, I would like for him to have been around longer for me to figure out.  I mean, you know, he was a case, and I think and I'm still curious as to what the hell was wrong with him, and I would like to have had the opportunity to figure that out because right now I can't figure it out.
Speaker 1: And your mother's [Evelyn Kendall Burrell] never been able to give any insight to that sort of, you know.
Speaker 2: No.  We've had some conversations about it.  I think that she was blindsided, too.  It's like she didn't know exactly what happened.
Speaker 1: But your mother has been to see your success.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're able to.
Speaker 2: What a joy that is.
Speaker 1: To honor her, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're both having a ball on that score.  I mean she has - I have to tell my mom to stop rubbing it in because she loves to rub it in.  You know, she doesn't pull the car around to the side.  She wants to let it out in front of the church, you know, so -  come pick me up, you know, so yeah.  She's having the time of her life, and I'm enjoying it.
Speaker 1: And then you know I have one comment, and maybe it'll lead to a question, just one last question, but, you know, I couldn't help thinking of the image of you as a cowboy, you know, and in many ways you sort of did that.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, I remember that image when you said you came, you got on your horse and what?  Did you come into town?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: I went around to the school.
Speaker 1: Around to the school.
Speaker 2: Around to the school, yeah.  I went down 60th Street over to Wabash [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Don't you think you sort of rode into town on the advertising train?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. "Chicka, chika, chika" [Burrell pretends he's riding a horse].  Yeah.  I remember the first standing ovation I got some years ago, you know.  I mean, it was like that, walking up, you know, to the stage, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do feel that.
Story_ID: 4355
Speaker 1: And the last question is what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I want to be vain enough to think that I would have a legacy.  I think I would like to be thought of as someone who helped a lot of people, who helped a lot of people do what they needed to do on their own, that I motivated some people, and I mean if I feel like if I've done that, I think I'd be okay, that I mean I'm looking for monuments or anything like that.  I would certainly like just for - I'm not even looking to be remembered.  I just would like to think that I got a lot of people started and going and either through hiring them to work here or either getting their companies, helping them get their company started, you know, whether it be in the music business or what have you or helping some kid, you know, get through college.  That's basically it.  I don't care if I'm remembered for that or not.  I would just get some satisfaction out of doing it.  I don't think that the idea of being remembered is reasonable, and I've seen too many people who make gigantic contributions to society, and their biggest value is just being here.  As soon as they leave, you know, they put them in a box, and life goes on, you know, and I think life will go on with all of us gone, you know, so legacy is not even a word that I think I use.  If it happens, fine.  I'm looking for just the inner peace that I get from doing good things.

Speaker 2: It was the year he was free.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this was in Atlanta, Georgia, and a group of Atlanta's black community leaders had this event for him, and I just happened to be able to catch him as he moved from one place to another and had a few words with him, and that was very special to me.  I have been in South Africa a couple of times since then, and I think that he's a remarkable story.
