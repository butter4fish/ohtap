Speaker 1: Okay, and we can go back one more generation, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His father, his name was William Craft, and his mother was Ellen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's begin by talking about William and Ellen Craft.  Do you have any information about them?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, I have a lot of information (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of information?
Speaker 2: --about them.  They were well--well, what I know about them.
Speaker 1: Well tell me what you know about them, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, several books and stories have been written about them.
Story_ID: 571758
Speaker 1: Well, they were both born slaves in Macon, Georgia.  And decided, they were still young, and I believe they were married in Macon, I'm not sure, but anyway, they had decided that they, no I don't think they were married, they wanted to get married and have children, but under the law at that time, the children would be slaves, you see.  So they didn't want their children born as slaves so they decided that they would escape, and Ellen [Ellen Craft] was a seamstress and William [William Craft] was a carpenter and so, and she decided to disguise herself as a white gentleman.  You see, she was very fair and she looked like a white person, so that's what she disguised herself as.  And she had, they bought a top hat, then she had her arm in a sling and wore dark glasses, and then a bandage around her mouth because see she couldn't speak in, you know, good English, and she didn't want to be asked questions you see, so that was the reason for the bandage around the mouth so she would not have to talk.  So they decided and, of course, William to be her slave, and they were supposed to be going, now they told their owners that they were going to visit their relatives and friends on Christmas Day on some nearby plantation.  See, slaves, as I understand it, were permitted to visit relatives and friends on Christmas, so then, so that morning they left and boarded a train, and they ended up in Baltimore [Maryland].  Now Baltimore was the last stop before Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which was, you know, in a free state, so the officials were very careful, you know, about slaves traveling into freed states.  So then they asked for all kind of identification and they almost got caught.  So it was Christmas Eve and they said, somebody told them, they said, "I traveled with them, or with him, this gentleman all the way from Macon, Georgia, and he's all right, it's Christmas Eve, just let them go on," and so that's how they got past the customs in Baltimore, and then they ended up in Philadelphia, and they lived in someone's farmhouse, and then they were taught to read and write, but things were sort of, hot you might say, so to speak, in Philadelphia, so they thought they better move on to Boston [Massachusetts].  So some friends helped them to get to Boston and while in Boston, William opened a carpenter shop or cabinet shop and Ellen continued to sew.
Story_ID: 571759
Speaker 1: They passed the Fugitive Slave Law [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850], and Ellen's [Ellen Craft] master, former master, sent the slave catchers to bring them back to Georgia.  So, I'm omitting some of the things that happened, but the main thing was they decided that they would go to England, and they caught a steamer someplace in Canada.  I forgot now what the city was, and then they stayed in Canada for a few days, and then went to England.  And while in England, he and, they both taught at a school.  I think it was the first I guess you might say, manual training school in London, over in England because they were outside of London, and they both taught in this school, and they were treated very nicely by the people but see they were not in the same class of the people that, you know, they were friends with.  These were English aristocrats, and they were in, I guess, would be middle class people, so they decided that, it was the Civil War was over, but then before that, Ellen or William [William Craft] decided that he wanted to go back to Africa and establish a school.  And then tried to persuade the African chieftains not to take their people into slavery and sell them.  Well that didn't work.  That wasn't too successful, so then he came back to England, and he and Ellen decided to come back to America 'cause after all she left her mother [Maria] here and she wanted to see her, and I think maybe a sister, but I know her mother.  So they came back to America and they landed outside of Savannah [Georgia], going into Savannah and then they went to a place, I can't remember the name of the place, about thirty or forty miles out of Savannah.  And they bought a big, what they called a plantation, but a big farm there.  And they tried to operate this farm and then they built a school also, but I, but the farm wasn't successful, and the person who had the mortgage on it, foreclosed on it, so they had to leave.  Now before he left, Ellen, or William, had given a church there some land to build a church on, and when the wife [Emily Spencer DeCosta] and I went back there to visit the last time, we met the people who went to that church that they had given the land to build the church on.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 1: I don't remember the name of the church now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You don't remember, okay?
Speaker 1: But anyway, so then they lived in Charleston [South Carolina] and when Ellen died she said, no before she died, she said she wanted to be buried on this plantation of a farm that they acquired when they came back to Georgia, so that's where she was buried.  We tried to find it, but we couldn't find the place.  And William was buried in Charleston, a cemetery here.  I can't remember the name of the cemetery, but there's a small tombstone commemorating his place of burial, so we've seen that and we know where that is.
Story_ID: 571760
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you about Ellen's [Ellen Craft] mother.  You said she wanted to come back, and the fact that she was very fair, who was her mother?
Speaker 2: Her mother [Maria], we think that her mother was one of the servants or slaves to her father.  See her father was a very wealthy man in Macon [Georgia], her name was, I think his name was Smith [James P. Smith], but I don't know if he's really, don't know, not sure who her mother is, but we know that this man Smith was her father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so her mother was a Craft though?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Was her mother named Craft?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What was her mother's name?  Was it Smith because it was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The man she married was Craft, but I don't know what her, I've forgotten what her maiden name was.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you believe that her father was a white slave owner?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: In fact, he was probably her master.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: He was her master.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And then too, another interesting story about them.  Her and--Ellen had a half-sister [Eliza Smith Collins] who was married to a white planter [Robert Collins] near Macon, and they had three or four children, and the story goes that there's a book written about them.  I can't think of the name of the book, I'll think about it a little later.  But anyway, and that book tells a story that how he decided to send them to New England to school because his friends used to tease him about his black children, so he decide to send them to New England, and one of them [James Augustine Healy] finished first in his class and he was, became bishop of Maine [sic. Portland, Maine], and his brother [Patrick Francis Healy] became president of Georgetown University in Washington [D.C.].  Now people didn't know who they were.  They were suspicious so they say the story goes that the nuns at Maine would huddle and say, "Holy ghost, the bishop is a nigger."  They wouldn't say that to his face, but wasn't, didn't have too many black people in Maine anyhow, so most of his friends were all white, but anyway they knew who he was, but they just said, since he was the bishop and the bishop was boss, they wouldn't, they couldn't say anything to him.  'Cause he used to travel to Rome [Italy], you know, back and forth to Rome, and the one who was president of Georgetown, I say his name was Healy, that was his name.  There's a Healy Hall at Georgetown, and his brother who was president had been up to raise money, so they tell me that when he leaves some of these rich people's homes, they'd call the school and say, "Who's that man, you said he's the president?"  They said, well he looks, he's a guy, I guess he looked really something like me you see, so they said, "You sure he isn't black," or something, or whatever they called people then?  They said, "You don't know, his brother is the bishop of Maine, and he's got another brother [Alexander Sherwood Healy] who's, was the archbishop [sic.] of Boston [Massachusetts], so we don't know, and we just know that he is doing very well, and that's all we know about him so to speak.  So he noticed when he came back the second time to see these people, they were not as friendly as they were.  Of course, nowadays Georgetown says, they boast that they had a black president, but at that time, they didn't talk about it, 'cause I don't think any black people even went to Georgetown before the Civil War see.  So that's an interesting story about them, about the Healys.
Story_ID: 571761
Speaker 1: The children of William [William Craft] and Ellen [Ellen Craft], they're your grandparents, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Now tell me about Charles [Charles P. Craft] and Emeline [Emeline Kinloch Craft].
Speaker 2: Very well.  See Charles Craft was my [maternal] grandfather and he was an, a railway postal clerk and that was a pretty good job, you know, back in those days, and so he, you know, was on the trains and they had a post office car on the train and he worked on that see.  And he did very well, and, but the thing about it he never told me any stories about his experience in England.  And never told me anything about his early life.  But I think the reason why, that I suspect, is, was his wife, who was Emeline, didn't want to talk about that you see.  So therefore she was telling him, "Just don't be talking about those days," and Mrs. Craft, she wanted to forget about it.  But see I think she was really the one who wanted to forget about it see.
Speaker 1: Well, did you spend any time with them?
Speaker 2: Yes, he lived, yeah, when we got, my mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] and father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] got married, they lived at their house on Smith Street, 118 Smith Street [Charleston, South Carolina], and I was born in their house--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then in later years my father built a large house on Spring Street, 91 Spring, and they all came up there to live.  So they, my grandmother and grandfather lived in my father's house.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your experience, your personal experience with your grandfather and your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was a very kind person and he would take me, I remembered he lived on Smith Street, and he would bring me up to Spring Street to get my hair cut, and the funny part about it, it was across the street from the house that we would eventually live in, but I didn't know that then, and that little shop is still there now.  It's kind of raggedy looking and I don't know what it is.  I think it's a beauty shop or some kind of little shop, but that's where I got my hair cut in that same little place.  But he was in, I say the thing that I never get over, he never told me any stories about his life in England.  Now he got, see one of his brothers stayed in England.  And he married a white girl, and he would send his brother the newspapers, and I enjoyed reading the English comics.  I remember getting the English comics but that's all that I can remember.  And, of course, my grandmother was very strict and all, and she, she didn't, they didn't tell any stories about the time when they were slaves you see 'cause see she came from, let's see, 'cause her father [Benj Kinloch], good Lord, I think he was, I know she was free, but I don't know whether her--now her father might have been free also.  But they came from a plantation in Georgetown [South Carolina], her and I think her grandfather or father, but they were free people and they didn't like, you know, to be talking about the slavery days--
Story_ID: 571762
Speaker 1: Anything else about your [maternal] grandparents [Emeline Kinloch Craft and Charles P. Craft] that you can remember?
Speaker 2: Well, now you see that's my mother's [Julia Craft DeCosta] family.  Now my father's [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] family was the DeCostas, now.
Speaker 1: Wait, we're not ready to go to the DeCostas yet.  Let's wait, let's finish the Craft side of the family first because we haven't talked about your mother.
Speaker 2: Oh, and my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, tell me about your mother.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a very, you know, quiet person.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when she was born?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she, was she born in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me the type of person she was and--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: --the type of person she was and the type of mother she was.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a very fine mother and a very nice person, very refined person.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up in Charleston?
Speaker 2: No, you see, back in those days, the older people didn't talk much around the children.  See, I only had one friend that his mother used to talk a lot around him, and he was the only person.  A lot of people, you just didn't talk about, you know, the early days or their childhood days or anything, see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well then, just tell me about your life with your mother, your relationship with her.
Speaker 2: Well, see I was born on Smith Street, 118 Smith Street, and then we moved from there, you know, to 91 Spring Street.  As I said, she would, her father didn't have much time, you know, to take us around, bother with us, so my mother, I had one sister [Bernice DeCosta Davis], my mother took us, you know, if we had to go to some school program or something that we had to rehearse for, see she was the person that would take us or else we'd walk, kind of wasn't that far, wasn't no more than five blocks.  School [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina] was on Bull Street and we lived on Spring Street, see.  At one time we lived on Smith which was even closer, so it really wasn't that far to the school, so, but she really took charge of us.  My father was busy working and he said, "That's your mother's job to take care of y'all, see."  And then he was a whole lot stricter than she was.  So we was glad not to really be under his direct supervision, see.  Because I'd always get in some trouble, you know, when he was in charge.
Story_ID: 571763
Speaker 1: I wanted to go back a little bit and talk about William [William Craft] and Ellen [Ellen Craft] when they went to England to live.  Is that where they had their children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: How many children did they have?
Speaker 2: Actually, I think it was four or five.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know any of their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, one was Brougham [Brougham Craft].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Brougham, B-R-O-U-G-H-M [sic.], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Brougham, there was William [William Craft] and Charles [Charles P. Craft].
Speaker 1: And you said you think they had a daughter [Ellen Craft Crum]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I don't know what her name was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't think of what her name was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And Charles would ultimately be your grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See he was the oldest one, he was my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And so tell me about your mother's [Julia Craft DeCosta] education.  How much education did she have?
Speaker 2: Well my mother went to Avery High School [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina] here, which was a school that was built--American Missionary Association for the freed slaves right after the war [Civil War].  And she attended that school and which was a private school and funded by American Missionary Association, and upon graduation she went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and she finished Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that was in 1919, I believe.
Speaker 1: Nineteen nineteen [1919]?
Speaker 2: I think she finished in 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And she worked outside of the home?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Your mother worked outside of the home?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a school teacher.  She taught school until I was born because at that time they did not permit married people to teach in the school system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is there anything else you want to tell me about your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I guess, you know, we had a normal sort of family life.  She, well she would take us to school if the weather was bad.  If not we would walk, and since she would take us and different things, we had to go, but other than that, you know, we'd walk ourselves.  And she would take us to peer programs and all that we would be in.
Speaker 1: You said she would take you.  How would she take you if the weather was bad?
Speaker 2: In her, she had a car.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had her car, you see.
Story_ID: 571764
Speaker 1: All right.  We're gonna talk more about your life at your younger years a little bit later.  Excuse me.  Let's talk about your father and his family.  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Herbert Alexander DeCosta, Sr. [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.]
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his father's name?
Speaker 2: Benjamin DeCosta.
Speaker 1: And his mother?
Speaker 2: His what?  His mother's name?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Anna Harringburg [sic. Anna Harrenburg DeCosta].
Speaker 1: Anna?
Speaker 2: Anna, yes.
Speaker 1: And the last name again.
Speaker 2: Harringburg.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: H-A-R, let's see H-A-R-R-I-N-G-B-U-R-G.
Speaker 1: Harringburg, okay.  All right.  And do you know your great-grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Hm, let me see.  Yes, his father's name was, I don't remember, but yeah, I have it on my, on the family tree I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  That's fine.  Did you know both grandparents on your father's side, your grandmother and grandfather, Benjamin and Anna?
Speaker 2: No, I, see I remember that, he died, my grandfather died at an early age, so I never met him, but I knew his wife because she did not die.  She had something like ten children, but she didn't die until later on.  She was a strong person.
Speaker 1: Benjamin DeCosta, your grandfather, what type of work did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a building contractor too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was anything notable about what he might have built in the area.  They were from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandfather?
Speaker 1: Your grandfather Benjamin.
Speaker 2: Yes, he built a large house on Rutledge Avenue.  I think it's numbered 80 Rutledge, and that's, then he built another house on the same street, and then I think he built a bandstand in the parkway for the, see we had a park in Charleston [South Carolina] for a fair, and it was sort of international affair, and different countries had buildings and all, so he built this building, he built the bandstand, but they did have a building for Negroes, as we were called then, a Negro building.  But he didn't do that, I just mentioned that as an interesting part of the fair, but he's the man that constructed this bandstand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Right.  So do you know anything else about your grandfather?  I know you didn't get a chance to meet him.
Speaker 2: No, he did not live very long.
Speaker 1: I know, but I'm just, right, okay.  Well, tell me about your grandmother then.  You said she lived longer and she had ten children.  What do you remember about Anna, your grandmother Anna?
Speaker 2: Anna, let's see.  Very little, but I know my father used to take her on rides on Sunday afternoon.  My mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] told me that when they got married, my father asked her, you know, what did she want, a present, wedding present.  She said, either get her, he said, "Well I could get you some clothes."  I think it was clothes, or I can buy a car.  So she said, "Well I'd rather have the car because you can take your mother for a ride."  See 'cause I don't think she had a car, you know, and her husband had wagons that they used, you know, for construction business, but he died very young so they never had any cars or anything you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they both lived in Charleston also?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 571765
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about your father, Herbert DeCosta, Sr.  Tell me about your father.
Speaker 2: Well, my father was a very, very smart person and a very strict person.  And I went to work in the summers, I think when I was twelve years old.  Of course, I was working at home then, but I got tired of working at home so I told my mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] I was going to work with the men, because see Saturdays the carpenters worked on Saturdays too.  They worked a half a day Saturday, so I would polish brass and pick weeds up and left the grounds alone, so I got on my little bicycle, one of the sidewalk bicycles and I just went to the job and told the foreman to turn me in, I was going to work.  But see my father didn't want me working on the jobs because the things I would hear, you know.  You'd hear men talking about all kinds of things on the job.  They'd be cursing and going on.  He didn't want me to hear all that, but he never told me that, but once I was so determined to go to work then he said okay, see.  So I think I got $1.75 a week.
Speaker 1: To work.
Speaker 2: To work, isn't that something?
Speaker 1: So what kind of man was your father?  You said he was strict--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 1: --but what else about him?
Speaker 2: Well he was tall and a very nice looking man, and he was a good businessman and he did very well 'cause he didn't a chance to go to school see 'cause his father [Benjamin DeCosta] died.  Because he had all these children, you see.  So he did, he was very punctual and he had a reputation for doing good work, and all of his customers greatly admired him, and they thought that he was a great person.
Speaker 1: Where does the name DeCosta, do you know the origination of that name, the origin.
Speaker 2: Portuguese name, but I've never been able to trace, and one time when I wasn't busy, I tried to work on it, but I could not go back any farther than, I think, my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you say that your mother was the disciplinarian, but your father was very strict also?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did he feel about education for his children?
Speaker 2: How do I feel or how did he feel (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did he feel?
Speaker 2: Well, he felt, oh yeah, he felt we should be educated now.  No question about that now.  Yes sir, you better do good work too.
Speaker 1: So how do you think he learned how to design and build buildings (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you see, his father was a builder.  He came up under his father, and then after his father died he worked for someone else you see.
Story_ID: 571766
Speaker 1: As your grandfather [Benjamin DeCosta] had built, he built, like you said, a house on Rutledge Avenue, what were some of the things that your father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] built here in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: My father did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did he build anything?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he did, well his biggest accomplishment as far as new work, he built a large plantation house on James Island [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: On James Island?
Speaker 2: James Island, called Seven Oaks Plantation, and then he did, he renovated a lot of large houses in the historic district, but as far as building, that house had, you know, beautiful paneling and mantle.  He designed all those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a picture of that.  Oh, I made a drawing all right, I can show you that.
Speaker 1: So, tell me when your father started his business.  This was in the early 1900s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father, see, my grandfather started in business in 1899, and then when he died, you know, things stopped.  Then my father went in the [U.S.] Army, World War I [WWI], and he went, and he went in the Army he made enough money in the Army to start the business again.  And so he used, he used to cut hair in the Army, and he said he had a long apron, and he cut the fellows, wiped the blade on his ear, had a bloody ear, but he looked more like a butcher than a barber, and then he was the pay sergeant so he would charge them a big rate of interest, and he didn't gamble see, but he loaned them the money to gamble, so he made money on interests off the loans and cutting hair.  So when he came out of the Army he was ready to go to work and start his own business.  So that's when he started the business again, so that would be right after 19--when was the war over, 1919, something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen nineteen [1919], yes.  Okay, now the original name of the company was H.A. DeCosta Company and Edwards [H.A. DeCosta Company].  Who was Edwards?
Speaker 2: Edwards [Edward Edwards] was a friend of the family's and a friend of my grandfather's, and they started business and they had an office down on Huntington [ph.].  Oh, I can't think of the name of the street downtown, but I don't know of anything, I can't find anything that they did.
Story_ID: 571767
Speaker 1: All right.  So we were talking about your father starting the company again.  So now this is about 1919.  Is there any stories about how your mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] and father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: You know, that's a funny thing.  I never, I never asked them that and then you're the first person that ever asked me that question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to think, that's a good question, but I don't know, I really don't know how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.  Well, we know that they did get married and then you're born in Charleston [South Carolina].  And when you think back, I want you to think about your childhood.  What was, what is your first childhood memory?  What was the first childhood memory that comes to your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you, there's two things.  One thing, the first thing was there was a big mill down at the end of Smith Street, and that mill burned down on Christmas Day and I can remember the fire engines coming down Smith Street, going to the Weatherhorns Mill [ph.] and I know I had an Indian [Native American], I had gotten an Indian suit for Christmas and I wanted to go down there and see that fire so bad, but they were just (laughter), I probably was about three or four years old, my father said, "No sir, you're not going down there."  So I couldn't go and see the fire, but anyway, but that's one of the three.  I remember things, see I, and another thing I remember is when the Cooper River bridge [John P. Grace Memorial Bridge] opened, not the one that's there now, but the first bridge was built, my father took us for a ride over that bridge.  And I remember my sister [Bernice DeCosta Davis] and I going and I think I was about seven or eight years old when that bridge was built.  But I remember going for a ride over that bridge.  I say those two incidents are the things that I can remember, that fire on Christmas Day, and going for a ride over that bridge.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that factory that burned down?
Speaker 2: Weatherhorns Mill.  It was a mill (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Weatherhorns Mill.  It was a mill, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they made, you know, doors and windows and millwork, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Story_ID: 571768
Speaker 1: You lived on Smith Street, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me what the neighborhood was like.  Who were the people that made up the community in which you grew up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it wasn't, it was a sort of mixed neighborhood, you know, as far as race is concerned.
Speaker 1: Yes, tell me who was there.
Speaker 2: Because on the left of me, I mean white people lived on the left of me, and I remember he was the county superintendent of schools.  I've forgotten his name now, but he lived next door on one side and on, there was, let's see--facing the building, that was on the right side, now facing the building on the left side, there was a black person who was a friend of ours, and then next door to them was a white couple who had a grocery store.  I remember that.  Coming back, and on the, after we left the superintendent's house, there was a little alleyway, I think it was called Ogier Court [sic. Ogier Street].  Houses in Ogier Court now sell for probably $600,000.  Back in those days you could buy a house there for $600.  Isn't that something?
Story_ID: 571769
Speaker 1: The mayor of the city [Charleston, South Carolina] lived across the street from us, and half of the block was white and the other half was black.  The side I lived on, it was all mixtures, white and black, so I lived in a sort of mixed neighborhood what you might say.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now thinking at about the neighborhood, what are some of the sounds of the neighborhood, some of the sights and even the smells that take you back to that time when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't have any recollection of the smells because there was no, you know, manufacturing going on, nothing that could produce smells.  It was just an ordinary, I guess, middle class neighborhood you might say.  Now we were not friends with the--we knew who the white people were, but now we didn't play together or socialize together because there were black people on the right side who were good friends of ours, and you cross the street--so we didn't socialize with any of the white people, even play with them as children see.  So, and then one of my best friends lived around the corner.  Go down Smith Street to Calhoun [Street] and then two doors away from the corner, there was a friend of mine, Felder Hutchinson, lived, and we went to the same church.  He'd come by and we'd go to Sunday school together, and now this lady, these people lived way down Smith Street, used to walk from there, and they'd stop by my house and all of us would walk together to church.
Speaker 2: What church did you go to?
Speaker 1: St. Mark's Episcopal Church [Charleston, South Carolina].  But that was only about, I guess about three blocks from our house.
Story_ID: 571770
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the things that you--some of the activities you participated in.
Speaker 2: As a child?
Speaker 1: As a child, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well the things that I remembered mostly were the activities at school.  See I went to Avery Institute [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina], which was this private school I was telling you about, and we had plays and different clubs, and were always having some type of activity, and we would have to go in after school to practice.   And I belonged to, although I couldn't sing, I belonged to the Avery chorus and we would have practice during the day.  See we had a period every day in which we practiced singing or saying programs, so it was that type of activity connected with the school that was, you know, foremost in my mind.  And as I said, we would have programs that we'd be practicing for in the day or the evening, and then we would attend, you know, where they were held later on, see.  So that's the type of thing that really the social life was centered around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when does your family move to Spring Street?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess I was about, let's see, when I finished high school I was around seventeen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh you were already in high school?  You were seventeen when you moved to Spring Street?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was seventeen when I finished school.  But I guess it was about, I was around probably fourteen or fifteen years old, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well let's talk more about Avery, about school.  When you started school, were you five or six?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Were you five or six when you started school?
Speaker 2: I think I was probably six years old.
Speaker 1: Six years old.
Speaker 2: See I went to a Roman Catholic kindergarten or preschool, whatever you call it, see, program.  And I'd been up there for about two years.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: It was Immaculate Conception [Immaculate Conception School, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: And you went there for kindergarten and the first grade, or first (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think so--
Speaker 1: Think so?
Speaker 2: --kindergarten and first grade, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember anything about that school?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing I remember was the nuns were always trying to get me to go to church, like they would have church services every Friday morning, and the nuns would say, "No sir, Herbert [HistoryMaker Herbert DeCosta, Jr.] is not going to church."  Said, "He has his own church so he can just play in the yard or sit in the school."  So about two or three of us just didn't go, that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So I've never been inside that church.  I remember that.
Story_ID: 571771
Speaker 1: So you were saying that you went to the Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic church, school [Immaculate Conception School, Charleston, South Carolina] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --but your mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] wouldn't allow you to go to any of the services there?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.  No sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said some of your friends did leave the Episcopal church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of them did, left St. Mark's [St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] and went to that school.  They did go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now when you finished the first grade, is this when you go the Avery school [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, yeah, around the first grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, first or second grade.  I understand a relative of yours was the principal?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Frank DeCosta [Frank A. DeCosta].  He wasn't principal then though.
Speaker 1: Oh, he wasn't?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Cox [Benjamin F. Cox] was principal then.
Speaker 1: Mr. Cox?
Speaker 2: Yeah, C-O-X, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell--
Speaker 2: His grandson lives right over there.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right across the street.
Speaker 1: So tell me about going to the Avery Institute.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I started naturally when I was just a little fellow, and then through the fifth grade we were in one building, and then after fifth grade we went to the high school building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, I said Benjamin Cox was principal up until I think I got into the ninth grade, and then from the ninth grade to the twelfth grade Frank DeCosta was there then.  Of course, they were both very strict, and I know when I used to have to go to music class, well since everybody said I couldn't sing, I said, well rather than go to music class, I would go downstairs and work in the carpenter shop.  See we had a carpenter shop, manual training, and I liked to do that.  So when the principal found out I wasn't going to music class, he told me, he said, "Listen, if you don't get back in class, I'm gone send you home and tell your father [Herbert Decosta, Sr.]."  I said, "Oh no, I'll," I was scared to do that so I went right back to class 'cause see my father told the principal that if I misbehaved that the principal could whip me, and then send me home and I'd get another whipping, so I didn't want to get in trouble like that so I went back to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Back to music class?
Speaker 2: --music class, that's right.
Speaker 1: So Frank DeCosta, he was your uncle?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That was your father's brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, youngest brother.
Speaker 1: Youngest brother.  Okay, all right.  Now you mentioned that you had a sister.  What is your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Bernice [Bernice DeCosta Davis].
Speaker 1: And she was going to the same school as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about the Avery school.  Do you know much about how it was formed, how it was started?
Speaker 2: Well, it was started, I'd say, by the American Missionary Association, which started several schools, you know, for newly-freed slaves.  You know, they had several colleges.  One was Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama].  There was another college in North Carolina [sic.].  There was another high school.  I can't think of it, but they had, Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] school, Fisk and Talladega, and another.  I think there were three colleges and two or three high schools.
Story_ID: 571772
Speaker 1: This school was named for Reverend Charles Avery?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I've forgotten that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you don't know, okay.
Speaker 2: I see you must have done some research on it, 'cause I--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So tell me more about your days at Avery [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: At Avery?
Speaker 1: Who were the other students that attended?  Because it was a private school, everybody wasn't privy to that education (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No ma'am, you had to pay tuition.  And then, I think the tuition was something like two, three, two dollars and one something, a ridiculous small amount, but you know some people couldn't even pay that.  So I remember they had a scholarship because I remember one fellow, name's (unclear), used to ring the bell to signal the end of class and then he'd ring a bell when I'm supposed to start see, and that was his job, and another thing about it, he had three, or four, or five brothers and sisters and they all went to school there, and their father couldn't afford, you know, spend that much money on going to school, so paying for them to go to school, so I think James [ph.] might have been, well he wasn't the oldest one, but I know he had, that was his job, ringing the bells.  And, of course he thought that was a lot of fun.  But anyway, and then somebody used to close the kids, see the gate closed at let's say 8:30, and if you didn't get there by 8:30, you were locked out, and you were late.  So this other guy was in my class, he used to go down there and lock the gate 'cause he lived at Avery, no he lived in the principal's house 'cause his home was North Charleston [South Carolina], and that was a long ways, you know, to get down there, see.  So that was his job.  I guess, to pay for him staying down there, was to lock the gate, see, and it's a funny thing to see the kids running down the street to get there before he locked that gate, see, and they'd all stand out there and the principal would, sometimes he'd take them home and sometimes he'd just take them in and get a little lecture see.  But the funny thing about his sons 'cause sometimes he would be downtown, see, the principal would be, and he'd see the kids, you know, and he'd say, "Good morning Mary, how are you?"  He wouldn't say anything to 'em being out of school see, and he'd jump in his car and go back to school and then see he'd catch them for being late, see.  But that was funny, I'm telling you.  So anyway that was one of the things about the school, I guess you never heard of that, being locked out of school, but that's what you used to do, and then we had a Christmas program and Thanksgiving program, which we rehearsed these songs, and then we used to practice.  Oh, that was something.  We used to go to the church because see the school wasn't large enough to hold graduation exercises, so we'd go to this church and practice marching in there.  Can you imagine that?  'Cause I remember when I went to school, when I was getting ready to graduate, they told me, said, "You be at a certain place at a certain time, that's that," and then you walked in see, but we must have practiced at least four or five times going to this church and practiced marching.  I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 571773
Speaker 1: --That was one of the peculiarities as I look back on it now, see it's practicing marching, and then, I say, then we'd have to sing the songs 'cause see the whole school sang.  So it was divided into, you know, sopranos, altos, tenors and basses, see.  So whenever you practice at our house, see we had him one period in the morning for, to practice music selections and all that, and so when time came for graduation, oh, I guess for two months before we'd do nothing but practice the songs we were gonna sing, see.  I remember one thing that we sang every time and that was, we would sing the 'Hallelujah Chorus' from the 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel].  I remember singing that.  And then we sang, we had a lot of semi-classical songs.  I remember we used to sing 'Te Deum Laudamus,' and we sang it in Latin at school [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina], but see at church [St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] that was part of the Mass see, and then we sang another one.  We sang about three religious anthems that we would practice you see.  And then we'd sing spirituals, and so we had rich people that would kind of visit the school see and they would come during that time and then we would gather and sing.  They thought we was so good, but that was one of the things that, I guess, was different.  Then another thing that was interesting.  We had a teacher who liked opera, and, as you know, right now it still does, the Texaco oil company [The Texas Company; Texaco, Inc.] presented the Metropolitan Opera [New York, New York] on Saturdays, so we had to listen to the opera on Saturdays and then on Monday--well Friday he would tell us what operas was coming on.  We wouldn't have any class Friday, in opera season 'cause he would tell us what opera was coming on Friday.  And he said, "Y'all be sure to listen to the opera on Saturday."  Then Monday, he would ask us questions about the opera, and he would tell us things about it.  So that's how I really became interested in the opera.
Speaker 2: What was this teacher's name?
Speaker 1: Horsey, Alphonso Hoursey [Alphonso H. Hoursey].  So I really never forgot that.
Speaker 2: So you said you didn't have class on Fridays?
Speaker 1: And Mondays (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You did not have class.
Speaker 1: Class then.
Speaker 2: On Friday and Monday?
Speaker 1: In his class, see he taught--
Speaker 2: Oh, his class, okay.
Speaker 1: --in his class 'cause he taught French, so we didn't have any French, but that was only during opera season.  But one thing it done really taught me is I appreciate operas, and I know when I was growing up, when I'd go to New York [New York], I'd always go to the Metropolitan Opera.  When we were married, I would take the children and we would go to the Met.
Story_ID: 571774
Speaker 1: So now besides going to school, are you still working with your father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] building on the weekend?
Speaker 2: Not now, I'm supposed to be retired.
Speaker 1: Oh no, I'm talking about--
Speaker 2: When I was in high school?
Speaker 1: --when you were in high school.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I would work, oh, I was working on Saturdays then, but I didn't learn anything about the business you see.  I was just working in the field, working with the carpenters, I was doing carpentry work, you see.
Speaker 1: And at that time you were saying that you made $1.75 a week?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, a week (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.  So what else happens at Avery [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina]?  Were you involved in sports at all?
Speaker 2: In what?
Speaker 1: Sports.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to play on the basketball team.  I couldn't play football.   My mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] wouldn't let me play.  I went to one football class and she heard that and she told, called the principal, I mean, football coach and told him, said I was not supposed to be taking football, you know, going up for the team, so that was the end of that.  I went to one class and that ended my football.  'Cause you see, let me tell you, we didn't have any decent field to play on.  We had a clay court.  We couldn't afford uniforms.  Some of the fellows had helmets, some didn't.  Some had, you know, shoulder pads, some didn't.  Same thing with me, all that stuff, so it's a wonder we didn't get hurt, you know, getting banged around on the ground like that, see.  But now basketball was different, so I used to play basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the people that attended Avery during the time that you were there?  Who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the fellows lives right next door.  That's Judge Fields, Richard Fields.  And then, let me see, was anybody else around here.  Nobody else lived in this little neighborhood.  Laura Hoffman [ph.] went to school there, but, you know, she went to the Catholic school and her husband is not from Charleston [South Carolina].  And, but no other people in this neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I was just--was the Avery school a school for affluent African Americans, even though they had people who were not so affluent, but was it that kind of school?
Speaker 2: A kind of funny, let me tell you the funny thing about it, see, Avery was supposed to be a school for the newly-freed slaves who didn't, couldn't read nor write, but when A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] came, here comes all these people, half of the people there had already been, they'd been going to school and they were sons and daughters of free people, so you know, they didn't realize that.  So we had, so that's why you might say well, the people were affluent, was that the people were not slaves, and you know they were barbers and carpenters and they owned small businesses and all.  So they had a little money, and, you know, they had little schools that they used to go to.  So they were not that bad off like they thought see.  And then we had some who couldn't, I guess, read or write, so we had some of both you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduate in 1940?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Those last years you say your uncle, Frank DeCosta [Frank A. DeCosta]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was the principal?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you get a hard time because he was the principal?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although he never showed us any favoritism, but you know, don't nobody really saw too much of that.  That wasn't anything.
Speaker 1: All right.  Were there any teachers at the school that influenced you or made an impact on your life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I said one thing, Mr. Hoursey [Alphonso H. Hoursey], the fellow--
Speaker 1: Right, with the opera.
Speaker 2: --with the opera, yeah, I'd say he had a great influence.
Story_ID: 571775
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about towards college?  When did you start thinking about going to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you, the reason I went to school when I did was because this fellow, James Frazier [ph.], had been to Iowa State [Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa], and so I went around and talked to him, and he really persuaded me to go.  Because my father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] said I couldn't go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] 'cause he figured I would just play and not study.  So he said, "No, you can go to any school you want to go except Howard."  See I wanted to study architecture and building construction, so there wasn't any place for me to go.  So wasn't anything left and he told me about Iowa State see.  But I really, I wanted to go to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and then I, in fact I applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] but I didn't have enough work to get in, high school work, to get in.
Speaker 1: What do you mean you didn't have enough high school work?
Speaker 2: I mean I didn't have enough work.  You know, you were supposed to have so many hours of this and so many hours of that and I didn't have it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you decided to go to Iowa State.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Who paid for you to go to school?
Speaker 2: I mean, who paid, (laughter) my father paid for me to go to school.
Speaker 1: Well I mean you could have worked, you could have got a scholarship.
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you what, I wanted to work.  It was very funny 'cause so those were tough times back in those days, so I went to school.  In fact, I was the only black student and you know 'cause all of the black students lived in houses out with, you know, different families, so I had a trunk because I thought that's what you had when you go to school.  I came with a trunk full of clothes.  Most of the fellows, black guys, came with a suitcase full of clothes.  They didn't have any money, so they were all looking for jobs.  So I want to work too, I said, "I want to work along with y'all."  They said no, no, they wouldn't let me come to work. They said, "You don't need to work," said, "you'll be taking our jobs," but I was--see they used to wait tables in the frat houses, at the white fraternity houses and they'd do little things and that, but I wanted to go work along with them see, but I never did that.  They wouldn't let me work so I didn't do any work.
Speaker 1: Well, let me, let me ask you about that.  Growing up, you lived through the Depression [Great Depression].  During that time did you know there was a depression?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I heard my father talking about it 'cause I remember the times that workmen and carpenters would be cutting grass, you know, they'd only work like two, three days a week, that's all.  And he paid 'em to cut lawns, cut his grass, so I knew it was bad times, but I never really said that I didn't have enough to eat or, you know, many clothes.  We always had enough clothes to wear and enough to eat, so I really, I knew it was on, but I really never--it really never affected me like that you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 571776
Speaker 1: You get to college, and you also had to live off campus, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I lived off campus.
Speaker 1: Who did you live with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I couldn't live on the campus.
Speaker 1: Well, was there, there was a law that if you were a black student you could live on campus if you had another black student that could live with you, but since there was always one at a time graduating, there was never two together (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, but they didn't have any law like that.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I did it.  They just said no, you can't stay in the dormitory, that's it child.
Speaker 1: They just said no, huh?
Speaker 2: So when I went to school and I didn't know that, see they didn't tell me that.  See I didn't apply to Iowa State [Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa] until late.  So they just told me all the dormitories were full, which was the truth.  So I didn't know that I couldn't stay there, regardless of whether it was full or not.  I got so mad at the school.  So I stayed at the hotel downtown see.
Speaker 1: So you stayed at the hotel?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't even live with a family?
Speaker 2: Well wait a minute now, that's when I first got there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And they told me to go to the YMCA on the campus [Ames/Iowa State University Young Men's Christian Association, Ames, Iowa] and they would direct you to someone.  You see the school, they already knew who I was see, before I got there, so the lady says, "I'll tell you what," she said, "now I'm gonna give you some places out near the campus."  I said, "Well that's where I'd rather live."  She said, "But I think you'd like this house downtown the best."  She said, "This woman and her husband take students."  She didn't say black students, she said take students: "And I think that you would like that better."  So I met with this guy, he took me and showed me a place up in the attic see, an apartment house.  Then he showed me a place down in the basement.  So we did that about twice and then he took me to a place, I'll never forget this, behind a barbershop, but that's kind of raggedy looking room and these two black fellows sitting up there talking and it was a big pile of potatoes in the corner.  I was so mad that I got outside, I said, "Listen here, let me tell you something."  I said, "Where do you think I'm accustomed to living?"  I said, "I live in a large house," I said, and my mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] had two servants.  I said, "I ain't never lived like this."  I said, "I can afford to live in the student union," which was the, you know, just like the student hotel see, but I don't want to be over there by myself.
Story_ID: 571777
Speaker 1: He said, you go to this place downtown, which I didn't wanna go 'cause you had to ride the bus, so I took the bus down there, and this was a black woman and her husband who took black students.  Of course I was so mad, I was ready to leave, so I talked to one family and one guy who was working on his doctorate, so he says, "DeCosta [HistoryMaker Herbert DeCosta, Jr.], you come on down here with us."  He said, "I'll help you with your work since you studying, you'll be taking math and I'm working on my Ph.D. in math and I taught at Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama]," or some other schools, and then he said, "You would like it down here," so that's when I ended up moving down there.
Speaker 2: Who was this that told you that?
Speaker 1: This was, the fellow I talked to's name was Walter Daniels [ph.].  He's dead now.  He used to teach at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  He taught at Howard when he finished at Iowa [Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa], but anyway, that was some more, so anyway, so I said "Well," I say, "I'll stay here one year or one quarter or something," but then war broke out and he couldn't leave, well because of I had to go into the [U.S.] Army you see.  So I said, "I better stick it out," so I stayed there for four years, but it wasn't any, you know, social life or nothing, and then after, I was getting ready to go, and I'll never forget this then, the first night I was there I was getting dressed to go to the, they had a freshman mixer see, so one of the follows said, "Herbert, where you going?"  I said, "I'm going to the student mixer."  He said, "You can't go to that."  I said, "What?"  He says, he said, "They don't permit black students to even come to the social affairs."  Now can you imagine?  I said, "I could just as soon stay in South Carolina.  I would have been better off there."  So I didn't go.  But later on, we used to have things on our own.  But anyhow, it was some experience.
Speaker 2: Was the couple who were allowing students to stay in their home, was that Archie [Archie Martin] and Nancy Martin?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.  Where did you read about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did a little research.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I said, we did a little research.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I don't--they have, I mean I sent some money from the pall that they had for them, erected for them.
Speaker 2: So what type of people were they?
Speaker 1: They were very nice.  They were older, now I, the pictures they showed and I never knew them looking like that, 'cause they were older people see and they used to go to bed early.  I'd say like seven o'clock, and they'd bank the furnace, so by nine o'clock it was cold in that house.  And if you had to study you had to put your overcoat on to study, and gloves, and hat because that was cold as the devil, see.  So that was the only complaint I had.
Story_ID: 571778
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you had servants, I wanted to just go back a little bit.  You had servants when you were coming up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you said, what did you say (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I was saying on Saturdays I had to polish brass.  See, we had eight fireplaces in that house.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Fireplaces?
Speaker 2: Four upstairs and four downstairs.  All of the fireplaces upstairs didn't have any brass andirons, but the ones downstairs had brass andirons, and so I had to take these things on the porch, and I'd put paper down and polish this damn brass, and then I had to wax the floors.  Now I don't know why and what these ladies could see 'cause she [DeCosta's mother, Julia Craft DeCosta] had two ladies working there.  One used to cook and the other used to do something else, but I know there were two people she had working there.  Now I can't imagine what they were doing, how come they didn't do that?  But anyway, but later on she had a man who would polish the floors after I stopped, and they used to polish the silver and all, but I had, used to do that brass until I quit and went to work.
Speaker 1: So that's what made you quit because you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had me picking weeds off the yard.  That was a hard thing.  You know that's a devil picking those leaves off the, you ever tried to do that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Shoot, that's a heck of a job.
Speaker 1: So how much did, you were saying that the servants, you made $1.75 for working on Saturdays, you only worked one day a week right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: When I made $1.75 that's when I worked the whole week--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for $1.75.  Oh and I worked, just like that one day, I don't guess I got anything for working.  That was a Saturday.  No, no.
Speaker 1: All right.  So how much were, you were saying it's a shame that the servants got paid.
Speaker 2: I think about $3.00 a week, something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause the laborers made $5.00 a week.  They made a dollar a day, I remember that.
Speaker 1: So, so you did grow up a little privileged if you had servants.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: I said you did grow up privileged if you had servants (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the man made me, we lived in this big house and had me living in the back of--I was furious man, you know, back in the shack.  I said that was terrible.
Story_ID: 571779
Speaker 1: You saw the potatoes in the corner, really made you mad, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But oh, let me tell you something.  You know what?  One of those fellows that was back there was working on his doctorate [at Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa], in agriculture, and you know later on he lived in an apartment with me, and he was my daughter's godfather.  One of those same fellows I saw back in that place, and we became very good friends later on.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: It was Alonzo Myster [Alonzo M. Myster].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Myster.
Speaker 1: Dr. Myster.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we used to tease him.  Let me tell you, has he got the--is it on now?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you some other true stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know in the afternoon, you wouldn't imagine us, we was downtown living in this little house and, oh and the house wasn't that little and it wasn't that large either.  It was under, it was an average-sized house.  You couldn't get to the campus.  You had to take the bus.  It was too far to walk and we didn't have a car, so you know what we used to do for recreation?  We'd go and go to the back yard and we could see the trains going by, you know, the express trains going to California, and I never forget that, and they had the City of Los Angeles and then they had the City of San Francisco, and they had these dome cars.  See I'd never seen a dome car before.  Dome cars, they come flying through here boy.  They'd slow down to about sixty miles an hour, but they was running about eighty miles an hour you see, so that's what we used to do.  And then, but we didn't, it really wasn't much, much to do there, so later on I used to, then I met some Haitian students.  So they belonged to a club called the foreign students' club, so I used to go to that club with them.  They said, "Herb [HistoryMaker Herbert DeCosta, Jr.] why don't you come to the dances?"  I said, "How am I supposed to go to the dances?"  He said, "Well say you're one of us, you're one of the foreign students," and I can remember when I would go to the dances, the chaperones' eyes was just watching me.  They didn't say anything, but they just followed me around the room see, because they weren't so sure, you know, that I was a black student, or whether I was a foreign student see.  But that was something.  Then one time I went to make a talk and they wanted to know what country I was from.  I said I was from South Carolina.  And everybody fell out laughing (laughter).  Oh, we used to have some times.  But anyway.
Speaker 1: Well, were there any teachers, professors there that might have been, impressed you, encouraged you, or anyone that gave you some help?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, one or two, you know, I, but most of the fellows were all right, you know.  We all got along okay.  And then, but I didn't say, get a whole lot of help, you know what I mean?  But it was okay.  We had to work at night and they would come back to help us at night see.  So, but, you know, but it's not a place that I had picked to go to school, you know, I mean if I had known all these things, you know, beforehand see.
Speaker 1: So you get your degree in what?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What did you major in?
Speaker 2: Architectural engineering (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Architecture.
Speaker 2: Engineering.
Speaker 1: Engineering.  And you got your degree in 1944?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 571780
Speaker 1: Tell me what happens after you graduate [from Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa] in 1944?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I went to (pause)--
Speaker 1: You came back home?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I got a job with the government because none of the private industries would hire me, you see.  So I got this job at the NACA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics; National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and so I went to Cleveland [Ohio] first, and then I found out I could do better going to Langley Field [Langley Air Force Base, Virginia], I could work on the buildings, you know, support, you know, the aircraft personnel and all, so that's how I happened to go down to Hampton [Virginia].  So I went to Hampton.  Didn't know where I was gonna live or nothing, just went.  So my mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] knew I was going to Hampton, so she told me to call this person when I got to Hampton.  So I got off the train, I called this number and come to find out the person had died, it was some friend of hers.  I said, this lady, I said, "What am I gonna do now?"  Here I am in this little town and got a job and don't know, and just then my cousin George Hunterwalt [ph.], and I'd forgotten that he was teaching at Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], which was not too far from where I was gonna work.  My mother forgot to tell me about George, but she called him in the meantime and so, and they're saying, well he can live at our house 'cause we got a spare room here.  So he--and so then I, just as I turned around, trying to think of what to do next, he walked in.  So he took me to his house, and that's where I stayed when I worked at Langley Field.  So anyway, so it was an interesting time.  And we made a dollar an hour then.  Can you imagine that?  And I had to work on Saturdays, so we got paid a dollar an hour for working on, no extra money for Saturday.  Got eight dollars a day for working on Saturday.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: Well, and George was, had his master's [degree] in chemistry and he wasn't making any more than I was making.  And he had a family to support.
Speaker 1: So what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, then I got married and--
Speaker 1: How did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: Well, you see how I met her, this fellow Myster [Alonzo M. Myster], who I was telling you about, he taught at Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]. He got a job over there.  So I went up to see him and he introduced me to Emily [Emily Spencer DeCosta].  So that's how I met her. And so we got married and then we moved in an apartment in Hampton, and we had to paint the place.  Well, we painted one room.  And I remember I gave her, she wanted to paint the windows and the doors so I bought a little brush, but I painted the walls and the ceilings with a roller see.  And shoot, I'd roll those walls and ceilings, and she hadn't even finished two windows 'cause it's so much harder doing that see.  But I really helped her finish the windows.  She'd be painting now see.  So anyway, and then we stayed there until the war [World War II] was over.
Speaker 1: How come you weren't drafted?
Speaker 2: Well, 'cause I was working for the government.  And then my father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is when you were working for NACA.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: You were still working for NACA?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you see too my father, now if I had registered in Ames [Iowa], I'd have been gone.  But he told me to register in Charleston [South Carolina] when I came home.  So I registered here and see he, they had segregated draft boards there, and he knew the fellow who was head of the black draft board, and nobody else was studying engineering so he said well we can defer you for engineering.  See everybody at Ames was studying engineering.  That wasn't anything.  So that's why I kept out of the [U.S.] Army, the whole time.
Speaker 1: All right.  So actually you met her in Virginia, got married?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This was 1946, and y'all lived there, and then you came back to Charleston the next year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As soon as the war was over, we packed up and left (laughter).  Didn't stay there two minutes.
Story_ID: 571781
Speaker 1: What did you do then?
Speaker 2: Then that's when I came and went in business with my father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.].  And then we had a--so I lived in one of his apartments, and so my mother [Julia Craft DeCosta] didn't want him to charge us any rent.  He said, "Oh yeah, they should pay rent."  You know how much rent we paid?  Fifty-five dollars a month, or fifty dollars a month, and it had four bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen and bath.  And you know what it rents for now?  I think it's $1400 a month.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So tell me about how your father's business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't have a brother, I have a sister [Bernice DeCosta Davis].
Speaker 1: No, your father, I'm sorry, I need to talk a little louder.  Your father's business until this time has become pretty successful.  Tell me--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was successful.
Speaker 1: Right.  Tell me how much property your family owned by that time.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess he had probably, you know, probably about eight or ten houses, something like that.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  So what was some of the projects that you worked on when you started working with your father's company [H.A. DeCosta Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  I got to list them.  Can you cut that off for a minute and let me get my--
Speaker 1: We'll just step back just back to, I wanted to step back before we talk about you coming to work for your dad.  And as an engineer, you said at Langley Field [Langley Air Force Base, Virginia] working for the government, you were working for what is now called NASA [National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics; National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me what did you do there?  What projects did you work on?
Speaker 2: What I did, I worked on the buildings that housed the people who worked for, and say, support systems for the aircraft industry, you know.  Say now, for instance, I worked on, I remember a building that was to be built on Waties Island [South Carolina], you see, a dormitory where the men were going to stay over there.  And then we worked on, I worked on a building that was, had a movable door that they would slide the missiles in and out.  These were very crude things.  See, this was the very beginning of the missile system.  They hadn't even said anything about that.  The public didn't know that's what we were working on.  Things like that, see, but they had to have buildings to house these people who did that work, so that's what we worked on.  See knowing that, we had wind tunnels at Langley Field.  They had about four or five wind tunnels, and each wind tunnel had an office building connecting with the wind tunnel. So we had to work on those office buildings.  And on the wind tunnels themselves, and that need repairs and stuff like that.  So see Langley Field was just a series of wind tunnels.  They have the small tunnel, that's the part of the tunnel with the highest speed, then the larger part was the lower speed, see.  But then as it got down to the smaller part, the speed picked up see, and that was Gay-Lussac's [Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac] law if you ever studied physics, that's, that was that, that's why we worked on that you see, and things like that.
Story_ID: 571782
Speaker 1: You had some information about buildings that you worked on early on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  It was my early days here [at H.A. DeCosta Company].  One, we built the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company] building, corner of Coming [Street] and Cannon Street.  I designed that and built that.  And that was designed to take care of adding a second story if they wanted to, but they, the Clemmons [ph.] family just sold it the other day, I see, and the father died, and the two boys inherited, of course they're not boys, they are grown men, and they decided to sell the building 'cause they got a good price for it so they sold that.  And then rebuilt an educational building on Johns Island [South Carolina] for the Methodist church.  See Johns Island back in those days was really kind of rural see.  There wasn't any Kiawah [Kiawah Island Golf Resort, Kiawah Island, South Carolina] down there, or one on the other end, and nothing like that.  It was just a sort of rural country place, and they built this building to take care of the people so they'd have some place to go up for recreation, and you know, have meetings and programs and things of that type.  So that's what we built. And then we also remodeled the Carolina Savings Bank, and that was one of the banks, one of the big banks in Charleston [South Carolina].  We remodeled that.  Put in new counters, a new safety deposit vault, and did things, that type of thing.  Then I remember I did the drawings for the vault and then also built a parish house for our church.  One of the first things we did.
Speaker 1: And this was St. Mark's Church [St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you worked with your father [Herbert DeCosta, Sr.] and you become president in what year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960]?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].  I think that's what it was.
Speaker 1: And tell me what happened after that.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Did you become more into undertaking more major renovation projects?
Speaker 2: Well, we did major renovations, you know, when he was, that was the main thing that he was interested in, you see.  See then, I'm looking at this little sheet that had--(pause) we did a lot of work for a storage house and foundation.  See that's the foremost preservation society in the city, and we knew a lot of people who were members of that. So when they organized about sixty years ago, we did a lot of their work.  See we did 61 Laurens Street, 82 Anson Street.  These were all houses that we did before the foundation and then we also did a house at 25 East Battery [Street], and that was the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Drayton [Emily Beatty Drayton and Charles H. Drayton, Jr.]. He was a very wealthy northerner, who married a Charleston girl, and we, they had this big house that we renovated for them.  Course it used to be a planter's townhouse and he had a house in the country and then they had beautiful townhouses.  It was a beautiful townhouse that he lived in, and we, and it was someplace and we restored this, and then they also had in the back a place for servants or guests 'cause that was a two-story residence.  And whether they used that, I mean, 'cause I didn't see any other places on the property that slaves could live 'cause this was, they built this place just before the Civil War see.  So that must have been their house but that was a nice house, and then there was a little land, we restored a small kitchen building.  It was behind that house you see.
Story_ID: 571783
Speaker 1: And then the garden, a famous landscape architect whose name was Ed Ochanti [ph.], he was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He came and drew the plans for landscaping, and since that time, of course, they have died and the house has been sold, but then they put a new fence around it.  That was some house.  It used to be the library for the City of Charleston [South Carolina], and then when the city built its own library and put this house on the market, he bought the house.  So that was an interesting project.  Then we did the president's home [Reverend Robert Smith House, Charleston, South Carolina] on Glebe Street, and I designed the Georgian doorway for that house.  And put in all new windows, and restored the interior steps and took off an addition they had at the back, took that off and then channeled the renovation and restoration of that house.  That was quite a job.  And we did 4 Green Street [sic. 4 Green Way].  That was another house at the College of Charleston [Charleston, South Carolina] and then we did 36 Mary Street, and start shouting about (unclear).  Now that was a house in a black neighborhood, well it was black and one time it wasn't black, it's black now.  Now it's changing back, been from white to black, and now it's going back to white and we restored this house and a black person moved in, and that was quite a restoration job.  We had to change the porch columns.  They were done wrong.  We had to put in the new columns at the correct size and all, and they took off the entrance door and threw that away.  We had to put a new entrance doorframe on, and that was quite a nice job.  And then we did a job at 12 Wentworth Street.  That was a house we took because the porches were falling off the front, a three-story porch.  If we took them all off today, they wouldn't permit us to do that, but yet we did it for the foundation, which was, I said Premier Restoration Group [ph.], see, and they wouldn't have wanted it done, but they wanted it taken off, and then we put a balcony across the front and we reused some parts from another balcony that we'd taken off a house that they owned, and made that into a new balcony for the first floor.  And then we just, they had French doors to the porch, so we just closed the French doors and used wrought iron panels at the bottom of those so nobody could walk out.  You could open the doors and let the sun and light in, but you couldn't walk in.  And then we did some other work.  We added a nice entrance wrought iron gate and all, done that you see.  That was for the Historic Charleston Foundation.  Then we did one of the first houses in Anson, our 71 Anson Street that we did.  See the Historic Charleston Foundation decided that they were going to restore Ansonborough [Charleston, South Carolina], which went from white to black and now they've gone back to white.  And this house was bought by a person who was the owner of the city newspaper, Peter Manigault, and we restored that house for him, he and his wife [Landine Legendre Manigault].
Story_ID: 571784
Speaker 1: --So you were telling me about that Peter Manigault, did the house at 71--what was the name of the street (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anson Street.
Speaker 1: Anson Street.  And you were saying that his--okay--
Speaker 2: I said his wife's mother was named Legendre [Gertrude Sanford Legendre] and they owned a large plantation here that we did some work for, and they owned, I can't think of the name, some big house in New York, but she was a big game hunter, and she used to travel all over Africa hunting wild animals, and she came back here and built a huge room, trophy room, and had all these things up.  I think it was about twenty feet tall.  She was, and she looked at me, I mean she was just acting just like a man, she was, and you know I went up to get a contribution from her for Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina], and you know all the money she has, you know how much I got?  Five dollars.  It wasn't even worth going up there, but I didn't say anything 'cause you know I had made money off her working and that and her husband [Sidney J. Legendre], her son-in-law was one of my best customers so I couldn't afford to make her mad and she'd go tell him that I insulted her or something.  In fact, see those side lights, those brackets?  That came from her plantation house.  She didn't want them so I took 'em, and that's where they came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  [HistoryMaker] Philip Simmons who does the iron--
Speaker 2: Yeah, wrought iron work (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) wrought iron work.  Have you worked with him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I said these two railings were done by Philip Simmons.  These right there and then I have a vase, a wrought iron vase that he did.  It's on the porch.  I think he did something else too.  And then he did work on several of those houses on Anson Street that I'm talking about and then he did the house on the--gates on a house on East Bay Street.  So there are a number of houses that he's worked on for us.
Story_ID: 571785
Speaker 1: Your work was not limited to Charleston [South Carolina].  You did restoration work outside of Charleston (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but I mostly worked, was in Charleston.  Now I did--
Speaker 1: What about the Herndon Home in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Herndon Home in Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that was quite a project.  I was a project manager on that house and we got another contractor to do it, but, but he hired, but he really did the carpentry work, but I hired the painter, the electrician and the heating people along, see, and that was some house.  Have you ever seen his house?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So anyway, but I had a time with this guy because he, well anyway, when we were doing the steps to the attic, he had the treads hanging over risers of about two inches.  I told him I'd never seen steps like that.  But you fall down going up steps like that, but he said that's the way they done them.  So I made him change it because we couldn't do anything like that in that house.  So anyhow, but he was a pretty nice fellow though, but I had a kind of rough time because I was here and he was there you see, and I had to go there at least once a week.
Speaker 1: Anything else you want to talk about as far as the work that you have done, your company has done?
Speaker 2: What, for [HistoryMaker] Philip Simmons you mean?
Speaker 1: No, you know, working as far as the DeCosta [H.A. DeCosta Company]--
Speaker 2: You mean the Herndon house?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well that was the only thing we did in Atlanta, was the Herndon house.  We had to put new balustrades around the roof and then we had to work on the porte-cochere on the side.  See they had porte-cocheres on the side, and then he had a garage, a three-car garage, and then his chauffeur lived up over the garage, lived upstairs over the garage see.  So we worked on that.  And he had quite, as you can see, that's quite a house.  That's some place.
Speaker 1: So tell me what else your company accomplished here in Charleston then, 'cause you said most of the work was done here in Charleston, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  That's why I was reading some of these things here.  See unless you have something to see, and so boring and, you know, (unclear) but 94 Rutledge [Avenue], now see that's, that was a nice job, but unless you could see it, you know, and then 60 Anson Street, that was an interesting job we did for Robert Hitt, who used to be, he was editor of The Evening Post [The Post and Courier], and we joined two houses together see.  That was just a wreck.  These two houses, and we made the first floor a main house.  It was not a large house by any means.  It used to be a little shop.  So we put in windows on the ground floor to match the windows on the second floor, and then we took a building that was separated from it and tied it together, and made it one nice building, and that has a courtyard and all and we built a fence, a high fence, about eight feet high, where you couldn't see in, but I did put a panel in the gate, it was a wooden gate that you could look through this panel and see the courtyard.  But that was really an interesting house because I never seen steps built the way those steps were built.  I can't describe 'em, but anyway, it stood very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, since the owner finished that house, I've never been back.  I pass there, I guess, on average of two, three times a month.  I say, I wanna stop and go inside but I say, oh, I'll do it the next time and never, never got inside.
Story_ID: 571786
Speaker 1: All right.  Well let me ask you about other things that were going on in the country.  It's 1960 when you take over the business [H.A. DeCosta Company], and this is right at the civil rights, you know, it's in the middle of civil rights.  Were you involved in the Civil Rights Movement at all?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, at that time, see most of the people that made any money were white people.  Black people didn't make a lot of money in those days, and so most of our business was white.  But yet, being the black person I knew I had to do something to help with the movement.  So I went and talked to Esau Jenkins.  Have you ever heard of him?
Speaker 1: Yes, I have.
Speaker 2: Of course, he's dead.  But I said--and he was one of the leaders in the movement.  I said, "Mr. Jenkins, what do you think that I ought to do, you know, to help?"  Of course, I could get out and demonstrate and all.  He said, "Mr. DeCosta [HistoryMaker Herbert DeCosta, Jr.], I don't think you ought to, need to be doing that."  He said, "But we need money, and then, so you can give money to the movement, and then we're gonna have a committee."  So I was on the committee, what they called the communications committee [sic. Citizens Committee of Charleston County].  Now when the students would demonstrate or march up and down King Street, and the merchants all got upset because they figured they would be losing business, then they would call me see, because I had done a lot of work on King Street.  You know I had remodeled several stores and they all knew me, see.  So they would call me and I remember Bob Ellis, not Bob, Morris Kalinsky.  He used to stutter, he'd say, "Herb, what am I gonna do?"  I said, "Listen all you have to do is just hire a black person."  He said, "But I have a small business."  I said, "Look Morris," I said, "now you can find somebody."  I said, "But you got to do something to show that, you know, that you're trying to help."  So then he said, "Well, I know what I'll do."  He had a fellow who used to work in the store, but he did something else, but he said that that guy really knows shoes.  He says, "I'm gonna put him up front as a shoe salesman."  I said, "Now that'll take the heat off you."  I said, "That's all you have to do," 'cause he was very worrisome.  We built his house for him and all.  And then we restored his store too.  So anyway so that's what he did, see.  And some of the other people would call and be all upset.  So that was the main thing is for them to hire black people, and then that's what most of 'em did see.  But they knew me you see and they didn't know these people who were marching out in the street.  They didn't know who they were, you see.  But they didn't know that we were all working together, see 'cause we would meet at night and plan what we gone do the next day, but they didn't know that I knew what was going on.  And then I knew, and only one person used to sort of mess us up and that was Reverend Glover [B.J. Glover], and he'd come out and make statements in the paper, you know, that we didn't even know anything about.  We'd work at night saying what we're gonna do the next day and Reverend would come and do something else you see.  And that would just kind of make everybody upset see.  So anyway, but he meant well, because he had a tough time see.  He was thrown off a train once, beaten up once, so he really, you know, he, I could see how he would be, you know, upset about this whole racial thing see.  But one thing, we never had any fires in Charleston [South Carolina] or anything like that.  And see the head of the newspaper was a friend of mine.  I knew him too.  So I went off and talked to him, and then we formed a committee, white and blacks, you know, to talk to people and try to keep things settled down, but we never really accomplished anything, but at least we kept things kind of quiet and, you know, until everything was over, see.
Story_ID: 571787
Speaker 1: The committee that you were on with Esau Jennings [sic. Esau Jenkins], was that a part of, you said the Communications Committee [sic. Citizens Committee of Charleston County], what organization was that with?
Speaker 2: Well that wasn't any organization (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It wasn't an organization.  It was just a group--
Speaker 2: It's a group that we got together, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever belong to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was, in fact, I lost a job on account of that.
Speaker 1: What happened?  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you what.  This one architect, who was a good friend of mine, wanted me to bid on a church, this Methodist church, in Mount Pleasant [South Carolina].  So he said, "They want to know if you belong to the NAACP."  So I said, "Well, I'll ask him."  So I told him, I said, "Yes, I belong to the NAACP."  So they wouldn't give me the job.  And you know what?  Today they got a black minister.  Now I told the minister that story.  And I said, "They didn't even want me to bid on this church and now here you are," I cannot believe it when I walked into that church and there was this black man was a minister.  Show you how, it was a Methodist church, show you how things have changed.  I would never believe that now, that's something he didn't have to do.  But shows you how things have changed.
Story_ID: 571788
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about all the other things that was going on around the country in the '60s [1960s]?  We had the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] March on Washington, President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is assassinated.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't go to the March on Washington, but I sent one of the young members of my firm [H.A. DeCosta Company].  In fact, he was the vice president of my company, Billy Clement [sic. William Clement].  So I said, "Billy," I said, "now I know you wanna go, so you go on," and I paid for him to go.  So he went on the march.
Speaker 1: So what were your thoughts about other things that were going on, all the different assassinations, you know, from Medgar Evers, Emmett Till and then Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were your thoughts about all of those things that were going on?
Speaker 2: Well, that was just terrible.  I mean there's no question about it.  Everybody was, you know, upset about that.  But you know, the funny thing about it, is people, I remember the day after, I think Martin Luther King was assassinated, I walked in this old minister's house and I thought I would wait and see what he would say, you know, about it.  I said, I'm not going to say anything to see what he says.  He didn't say a word about it.  Didn't, they would not, they would never discuss those things with me, you know.  We'd go on just like nothing had ever happened.  Isn't that something?  Now some of them, the Jewish young lawyers, you know, would talk about it see, 'cause I remember when the kids would get locked up see.  You had to have someone to sign a bond, so, Matthew Perry and one of the other fellows named, I could see him right now, and Joe Brown, walked in my office, I used to work at night then, this night.  And they asked me would I sign the bond, see because they knew that I was in a risky business because see one of these people that I worked for were white people see, but they were people with money and, you know, they knew, they had good sense, so I said, "Sure I'll do that."  So he said, then one of the white lawyers said next day, you know, said they were talking on Broad Street what Herbert DeCosta [HistoryMaker Herbert DeCosta, Jr.] said.  They said he signed the bonds for those children.  So one of the lawyers said, "What did you think he was gonna do?"  He said, "Those are his people," he said, "you expect him to do that."  So they just kind of laughed, you know.  But you know what Joe Brown told me when he was traveling with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?  He said that there were some black people that were afraid to talk to him on the street because he was head of the NAACP.  Because we was standing on Broad Street, Broad and Bay [Street] talking one time, and he was telling me that some black people were afraid they were going to lose their job or something like that.  I said, "I hadn't even gave it a thought."  Can you imagine that they would fire somebody 'cause they were talking to the president of the NAACP?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was something wasn't it?
Speaker 1: That was.
Story_ID: 571789
Speaker 1: So anything that we have not talked about so far that you wanna talk about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean I've said lots of houses, course I think you have, I sent you a list--
Speaker 1: Yes, we have that, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --of all these places.  There is Prince George Winyah Episcopal Church in Georgetown [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Well then tell me about the organizations, other organizations that you belonged to, that you work with.
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I belong to the, as far as civic groups, I belong to the housing initiative.  That's a group that we approved giving city money, you know, to restore and rebuild and sometimes build new houses for poor people, and, you know, they can't afford us, so we give them like $200,000, you know, the ones building the house.  And then I belong to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  We just started, last two years, we have one organization now, one black and white organization, one organization.  So that's doing all right, and we got a branch on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], they're doing fine, so that's doing okay.  And I belong to several social clubs, you know.  I belong to the Athenians [Athenians Club].  That's an old men's club.  I guess that's--how old is that?  That club is (unclear) ninety years old.  And then I belong to the Owl's Club [Owl's Whist Club].  That's an old man's club, and then I belong to Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].
Speaker 1: When did you pledge Alpha Phi Alpha?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: When did you pledge?
Speaker 2: I pledged at Iowa State [Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa].  We had a group at Iowa State, yeah, and then Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity.
Speaker 1: That's the Boule?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Boule.
Speaker 1: And which chapter you belong to?
Speaker 2: Hm?  Which?  Of the Boule?
Speaker 1: Um-um.
Speaker 2: I can't even think of that name right now.
Speaker 1: Can't think of it.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Too tired to even think of that name.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, talking about Alpha when you pledged, so they had enough people, black, you know, men there to have a fraternity at that time.
Speaker 2: Where was that, Iowa State?
Speaker 1: In Iowa State.
Speaker 2: Well, it was really for Iowa State and Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Was there any stories about you pledging (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But we still didn't have that many.
Speaker 1: Was there any stories about when you pledged?
Speaker 2: No, it was--
Speaker 1: It wasn't like it is now?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't like how you might think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now you were on the board of directors for Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Oh yeah, that's right.  I know, I'm an emeritus member.  I wasn't thinking about it when I was on board, made me emeritus. I'd been there so long nobody knew how long, everybody died.  I was the only one left.  So they tried to make up when I was there.  I said, "Mr. Boyd [ph.] is dead now."  I said, "He was here."  So I think my wife [Emily Spencer DeCosta] knew. She got a great memory.  She told him that I started going down there, see.  But I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You worked there for about, you worked on that board for about thirty years right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at least thirty years.  And then I belonged to another group.  What's that, the national, the South Carolina association of--it's a black heritage group, South Carolina Black Heritage Association or commission [sic. South Carolina African American Heritage Commission].  And then I belonged to a white group, I forgot what that's called, but I remember that too.  That's a restoration, you know, historic restoration association.  And, in fact, I got from them a lifetime award for preservation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) All of those things are on that sheet that I gave you.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Story_ID: 571790
Speaker 1: Tell me about your children.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Tell me about your children?
Speaker 2: How many, well, I have two daughters, Gail [Gail DeCosta] and Margaret [Margaret DeCosta].
Speaker 1: Let me hold that for you.  Let me hold it.   Tell me about your daughters.
Speaker 2: Well, my oldest daughter Gail finished Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] and she has a master's [degree] from Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia], and now she's a, works for a black firm in Atlanta [Georgia].  I can't think of what the firm's name is.  What was this guy, this guy just died about two, three years ago.  What was--that was her father--I'm trying to think what his name was.  But anyway, but she's worked, she teaches computer lessons and plans and things of the like.  She's taught at Albany, New York, and Minnesota and Atlanta, and she's done very well and she and her husband have this shop [Pambili African Artwords, Decatur, Georgia] where they sell African artifacts, you know, vases and statuary and different things like that.
Speaker 1: You were telling me a very interesting story about her husband.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is his name?
Speaker 2: Sipo Mzimela.
Speaker 1: And who is he?
Speaker 2: He was from Durban, South Africa.  He left--you know when they had the time when Mandela [Nelson Mandela] got locked up, he escaped and he went, he went to live in someplace, I can't remember now.  He went to Germany, and then he finally came to the United States and he got his master's and doctorate from a seminary, New York seminary [General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church, New York, New York], and then he was entering priesthood at a church in Atlanta.  And that's when Gail met him.  And then she and her first husband separated, or divorced anyway, and that's when she met him, and then they eventually got married.  And then when the struggle in South Africa was over, and Mandela appointed a new cabinet, he was one of the members of the cabinet.  And then he was, see he was a friend then, and he was with Buthelezi [Mangosuthu Buthelezi] then, so I ran over four times when they were in South Africa, visited with them.  He, but he's very straight.  Sipo was a, he's a hard worker, but he's doing all right now.  I hope they're gonna be successful and that's the thing I'm a little concerned about.  But I think they're gonna do all right.
Speaker 1: And your other daughter?
Speaker 2: My other daughter Margaret is about to retire now.  She works for the federal government.  She does like computer work too.  She's going to work with someone else in Atlanta and she's only fifty something, mid-fifties.
Story_ID: 571791
Speaker 1: Tell me about your wife [Emily Spencer DeCosta].
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  She finished Virginia State College [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University] in Petersburg [Virginia] I think when she was eighteen, nineteen, something like that.  And then she got her master's [degree] from Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I guess she was something like twenty years, about twenty years old.  But she's really very, she's very smart.  I think she finished first in the class, so then she taught there for a while and that's when I met her and then we came to Charleston [South Carolina], and she worked in my business [H.A. DeCosta Company] for a number of years, until she retired from the business.  And during that time she helped raise children [Gail DeCosta and Margaret DeCosta], and that was her main responsibility.  I didn't have much time, I was working night and day, so, but she took care of them, and she did very well with the children.  And she belongs to several bridge clubs and Mahjong group and she was upset, not upset, because they meet on Friday afternoon, and we all come in the afternoon.  I told her she had to be here, and she said, "I'm gonna miss the group, the meeting."  I said, "Well, you have to miss it," but anyway, so she still goes to Mahjong meetings this afternoon, but she was very active in the church.  She's very religious and takes, you know, religion very seriously.  So that is, I guess, maybe it's some other things that she takes part in, but I can't think of all of 'em (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's fine.
Story_ID: 571792
Speaker 1: So in 1990 you actually sell the business [H.A. DeCosta Company].  What inspired you to do that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, the thing is, I'm trying to think, two things that happened, and one is Bill Clement [William Clement] had gone.  You know he left.
Speaker 1: Who is that?
Speaker 2: Bill Clement.  The two fellows I had I don't think they, they were still here, but anyway we were very busy, right after the war.  Yeah, there was a war or hurricane or something, but we were very, very busy and my attorney said he thought it was best for me to just, you know, to get out of it.  And so he said that, that I should sell the business to the two of them, you know the two partners that were left.  So that's what I did.  And then I worked with them for a couple of years as a consultant, and then they finally just stopped working and things didn't seem to go too well with them, and so they stopped and that was the end of that.  That was, a lot of times I'd ride around and see all the things that I used to work on, and I'm, you know, think about what might have been, but that's the way it is sometimes.  So anyway, I'm lucky that everything worked out all right for me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I still do consulting work, and do a little work now even, but I can't do too much because, you know, on account of my health.
Story_ID: 571793
Speaker 1: When you think back over your life, what do you think you might have changed?  Would you have done anything differently?
Speaker 2: Any differently?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I've often thought about that.  But to tell you the truth, I really don't know.  I mean that.  I really don't know.  So I just, I might have, but it's just hard to say, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because this interview is going to be used for research and for information for future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Why would you ask me that, what would I tell?  Well, I think that in order to be successful in any business or any type of venture, first thing anybody should do, you have to work hard.  I think of, I think of my granddaughter.  Ellen [Ellen Smith] works very hard and I'm sure she's going to do all right.  You see, but you have to work hard, even take advantage of the opportunities and then you should be sensible, you know, just don't, I know some people don't make a lot of money, they spend a lot of money, and they're never gonna get but so far.  And that's all they think about, see, is how much they can spend and what they can buy, they don't think of saving, but you should, you know, save something and, you know, if you want to have anything, or create something for your children or your family, or others, that's what you have to do.  It's just as simple as that.
Story_ID: 571794
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, just as a person who has worked hard and that's what I've done.  I've never had it easy, but like I say, right now, I don't get up until nine or ten o'clock in the mornings, but when I was really active, it was seven o'clock then, so I know a friend of mine now that I've called him and he's up walking the dog.  See that's nine o'clock in the morning.  See now he doesn't get up before ten, and he's young, he's young enough to be my son.  Now he's not gonna have an (unclear) so far.  See, you can't do well starting out that time of morning.  But I talk to a lot of people, they tell me they start at seven o'clock, six thirty in the morning, just like I used to do.  But you can't start out your work day past ten o'clock unless you got a big organization and you have, you know, people who can do things for you, then you can afford to come in like that.  Then they don't, people don't really need you, but when you have a small business, you got to do it yourself.
Speaker 1: So you want people to say that you were a hard worker?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, we'd like to thank you for taking the time to tell your story.  It's been inspiring and the information is invaluable, so we thank you so much for your, for your time.
