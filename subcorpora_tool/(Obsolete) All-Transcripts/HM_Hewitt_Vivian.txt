Speaker 2: We're at, at my home in Manhattan on the Upper West Side, New York City.
Story_ID: 90458
Speaker 1: All right, thank you.  Before we get into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish-type questions we always ask, and they just require a brief answer.  The first one is: Ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, I, I guess chicken and all of its varieties (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, but I prefer wearing white, which isn't a color, and black.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like springtime.  It's very--you feel very upbeat and very full of joie de vivre in the spring.  It's very uplifting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except this year (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now do, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't really have a favorite destination.  But for many, many years in the wintertime my husband [John Hewitt] and I took ourselves to the Caribbean like homing pigeons.  In Europe my favorite country was Italy, and I loved Paris [France].  I could live in Paris.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--you know you're making me think so hard.  Well, that's absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, now--
Speaker 2: Good you're not asking me my favorite swear word or what I use (unclear).
Story_ID: 90459
Speaker 1: I don't know if we can use (unclear)--but let me ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: I'm very fortunate and very blessed because we trace our family back to Guinea, back to Sylvie, who was supposedly, as they say, a, a princess, an African princess brought over to Virginia.  And then she was one--and then to (unclear) to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: This is all written down.
Speaker 1: Can, can, can you spell her name for us?
Speaker 2: Sylvie, S-Y-L-V-I-E, from Guinea
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: G-U-I-N-E-A.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: And she--
Speaker 1: --about what year would she have come over?
Speaker 2: Oh, that would be I guess in the, in the 17--late 1700s, early 1800s.  And she was one of seven sisters who were reared on the same plantation.  Two of the sisters married brothers.  And my family reunion has been taking place in Charlotte, North Carolina, unbroken for 94--95 years.  It would take place the first weekend in August in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I think it's the 95th reunion.  And it was started by my grandfather, my maternal grandfather and his two first cousins.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Wesley Mauney, M-A-U-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: This is your grandfather or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, Wesley Mauney.
Speaker 2: Whom I knew very well.
Speaker 1: That's M--what--
Speaker 2: M-A-U-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: M-A-U-N-E-Y, Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He was born in slavery, but was never sold because I think slavery ended when he was 10 years old, about 10 years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories handed down through the family about all these ancestors and some of their hardships and struggles or (unclear) or--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yes.  We have this written down.  I have my family history.  Because when my grandfather was 80-some years old, though illiterate, he couldn't read or write, but one of his cousins was educated, and he dictated his autobiography to, to his cousin, Cousin John Roberts, who was also an educator and a minister.  And grandpa managed the farm for several widowed or spinster white women.  And he amassed as a young man, a young married man, 600 acres of land.  That was a lot of land at that time.  And, and he gave land for, for churches and, and, and, and for schools in, in that area.  And one of my aunts taught at a one-room schoolhouse on land that, that grandpa had given to his son.  And it was called the Mooney [Mauney] School; they pronounce it "Moon-ey" there.  And they're, they're--and anybody who knows anything about slavery and about the South knows that there are relatives on both sides of the family, white relatives and blacks relatives.  And if you go to Kings Mountain, North Carolina, now, the public library is called the, the Mauney Public Library [sic, Mauney Memorial Library].  But my grandfather was very, very respected.
Story_ID: 90460
Speaker 1: And though I was, was born and reared in, in Pennsylvania, my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] took--there were five of us children, and we spent every summer for a period of 10 years or so on my granddad [Wesley Mauney]'s farm.  She was one of 12 children who had from no children to 10 children.  So, when we would go to grandpa's farm, most of my aunts and uncles lived around there, and we got to know all of our cousins very well.  And grandpa had 75 grandchildren; 73 who lived to adulthood.  And now of my generation of his grandchildren I think there are 15 of us living, ranging in age from about 72 to 90--90-some.  And, and one of his great-grandsons is Melvin [L.] Watt [HM], the United States Congressman from the 12th district in, in North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we interviewed Melvin Watt.  We interviewed Melvin Watt.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, he, he's the son of my first cousin.  But at one of the family reunions our children decided that out of respect for the elders--that's my generation--that they would call us aunt and uncle.  So, to make it easy, I just refer to him as my--all, all these second cousins refer to them as nieces and nephews, and they're scattered all over the U.S. and abroad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And due to this technological world--it's, it's wonderful--we have a family directory of, of, of our kids and about 10--15 years ago--of the, my generation of grandpa's great-grandkids we counted 102 at that time.  Well, it's, it's multiplied, you know, and the--so, you, you know, it's a huge family, and, and many of us know each other.  And my, my aunt, for whom I'm named, was the historian in the family and the networker.  And I know when I was doing a lot of traveling, one time I was going to Denmark for an international meeting, and she said oh, you have a cousin who lives in Denmark.  And it was a first cousin's child, and I wrote and I met her.  She lived on a beautiful farm in a place about an hour's train ride from Copenhagen.  And then another time I was going to Guadalajara, Mexico, and she said oh, you have a cousin there.  So, it, it's kind of fun.  We do have a big family scattered everywhere, and many of us know each other very well.  You probably know some of them.
Speaker 2: I probably--
Speaker 1: Karen [Grigsby] Bates, who was a journalist, wrote for "People" magazine, and her, her husband, the photographer [Bruce W. Talamon], so.
Story_ID: 90461
Speaker 1: Okay, could you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Arthur Robert Davidson, A-R-T-H-U-R, Robert, R-O-B-E-R-T, Davidson, D-A-V-I-D-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Statesville, North Carolina.  And I think his date of birth was about 1883 or thereabouts.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us about him.  What was he like and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was very handsome.  He was one of five children.  You know, I don't have as much detail about his family history as I do about my maternal family history, although we visited.  I knew my grandma, my Grandma Jane, who was Jane Cooper.  She was very Indian-looking.  And I knew my uncles.  And my father didn't have an immediate large family.  Their grandma only had I think one, two, five, six, about eight grandkids, but we knew each other.  As a young man, my father went to Biddle Academy [Biddle Institute], which late--and I don't know whether he finished or not, and that later became Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: But early on he enlisted in the [U.S.] Army, and he was that second generation of soldiers who were known as the Buffalo Soldiers.  When World War II came along, he knew all of those places, Guadalcanal [Solomon Islands], Mindanao [Phillipines] and everything, because he, he had trained I think at Fort Huachuca [Arizona] and I think at [Fort] Leavenworth, Kansas.  I think that he was with the 25th Infantry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty-fifth Infantry.  And that was one of the Buffalo Soldier infantries.  And he was with the Army of Occupation in the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this was in 1890s when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, this, this was in the early 1900s, 19--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I would say about 1908, 1910, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was right after the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right after the Spanish American--
Speaker 1: About 10 years after the Spanish--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --American War.
Speaker 2: It was the Army of Occupation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  They said some of them, some of the black soldiers were stationed in Cuba and some, some in the Philippines, right, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was in the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a, it, it was a very segregated Army.  And I would hear him tell that they weren't allowed to fraternize with the, with the Filipino people at all.  His courtship of my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] was very interesting; it was by postcard from the Philippines.  And he would write and, and show some of the Philippine natives, you know.  These are, are the tough-looking people who live in the mountains; you know, it was that kind of thing.  I, I had some of them, but unfortunately they got waterlogged and disintegrated, you know.  I'm, I, I regret that very much.  But when he came out of the Army, he married my mother on April 24th, 1912, I believe at my grandpa's home.  And then they went to Asheville, North Carolina, to live, and my mother loved living in Asheville, North Carolina.  And that was the time when they were building Biltmore [Estate].  My father was one of the waiters at Asheville School for Boys, and that was a very posh academy where the super-rich people sent their boys to school.
Story_ID: 90462
Speaker 1: Now, now tell me about Biltmore [Estate].  I vaguely remember hearing about it.  There's some--is (unclear) a rich estate built by one of the--
Speaker 2: That (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --millionaires--
Speaker 2: --one, what--by one of the Vanderbilts.
Speaker 1: Vanderbilts.
Speaker 2: And they built a whole town around, in, in the, in central part of town, downtown; it's a village.  They built houses for workmen, and they built their own church, the Episcopal Church.  They built at--they had a railroad station.  And I would hear my father say that when the people came in these--this was before travel was egalitarian.  It was for the super-rich.  And I would hear him tell stories about when the super-rich had their own private railway cars, and they would come in.  And how we got to Pennsylvania was two of the boys at the school liked my father very much.  They were from New Castle, Pennsylvania.  And one of--the boys were first cousins.  And one of the boys' father at the time was the United States Senator.  I think it was U.S. Senator, because they always referred to him when my father worked for him as Senator [William M.] Brown.  And he later became lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania.  And they needed a butler, and they, they asked my father if he would interview for the job, and he, he did, and he got the job.  And that's, that's when he moved his family to, to Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an interesting story.  So, and, and you were born in New Castle as a result.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what was your father like?  What, what kind of personality did he have?
Speaker 2: Well, he was an [U.S.] Army man, and he was the strictest disciplinarian.  But he was also--his family meant a lot to him.  He was a very--he didn't show much emotion.  But I was the first of the children that he was around for any, any length of time because he--after--sometime between New Castle and there, I don't know, or before he, he had, was a waiter, you know, and they did the seasons at the hotels like the Royal Poinciana [Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida] and the Greenbrier [Hotel, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia] and places like that.  I have a wonderful picture of him and all the waiters.  Those were really the good jobs, you know, the men had, and they dressed immaculately and everything.  And he built a home for my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] near his family.  And so my three older siblings grew up next to, near his, his mother [Jane Cooper Davidson].  And then when I came along, and when we were in New Castle, I was the first baby that he was around because he was making the seasons, you know, and just visiting them (unclear).  They, they saw him as an absentee father.  But he would come bringing toys and things like that, so it was always a welcomed visit.  But because I--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --was the first child that he was--baby that he was around and saw grow, I, I was the favorite child, and I knew it, and my siblings knew it.  But they didn't resent it because my older siblings, if they wanted to do something, they would say, Viv, you ask pop if we can do this.  And I could always wheedle him into saying (laughter) yes.  So, so it, it was a kind of fun situation.
Speaker 1: Are you, are you the youngest girl in the family or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There were two girls.  My sister [Dorothy Davidson Catlin] was seven years older than I.  I have two brothers and a sister; there were three, and then there was a four-year--four to seven--four, seven, ten-year difference between us, then I came along, and then my brother.  So we were spoiled brats; we really were, we really were.
Story_ID: 90463
Speaker 1: All right, so, yeah, you being a girl, you, you had to be daddy's favorite, so.  Well, tell, tell us about your mother.  Can you give us her, her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother was Lela Luvada Mauney Davidson.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Lela?
Speaker 2: L-E-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Luvada, L-U-V-A-D-A, Mauney, M-A-U-N-E-Y--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --Davidson.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when was she born and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in, in Kings Mountain.
Speaker 1: Okay, Kings Mountain, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And about what, what, what year did you--
Speaker 2: Eighteen eighty-eight [1888].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1888.  Now, what, what was her growing like in Kings Mountain?
Speaker 2: Well, they were, they were on a farm, you know.  And they, they helped in, in, in the fields, you know, hauling and this and that.  And they went to, to private schools.  You know, the American Missionary Society [sic, American Missionary Association] went South and founded all of these private schools for blacks.  And there was Lincoln Academy.  Members of my family were connected with that school from the time that it was founded until it closed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Douglas Academy, Doug--D-O-U-G-L-A-S, Academy.  And my mother went to Douglas Academy.
Speaker 1: Now this--was this one named for Frederick Douglass or Stephen Douglas?
Speaker 2: I don't know; I, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: But it had one "s" on the end?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's (unclear).
Speaker 2: You'd have to go back and do some history on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so they--okay, so--
Speaker 2: But, but, but, but the--my, my aunts and uncles went to, to, to these schools.  They were boarding schools.  As soon as they were old enough to go away to, to school they--that's where they went.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she had a chance to get an education?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  So--
Speaker 2: And you know at the--you could--my mother taught school be--somewhere in South Carolina.  I'm not sure.  But you know, you could teach school at the end of the, the eleventh grade or something like that, but she was a schoolteacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until she married.
Speaker 1: Did she go to college at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 90464
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how she [Lela Mauney Davidson] met your father [Arthur Davidson]?
Speaker 2: There was a commencement exercise at Douglas (ph.) Academy, where she was attending school, and he was there.  He had really come to see I think one of the teachers whom he knew.  But I guess their eyes met, and they took each other's fancy, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they met prior to him going to the Philippines?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, so, you know, his postcard campaign from the Philippines was--
Speaker 2: That was their courtship.
Speaker 1: All right.  You have to keep those postcards--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And when were they married again?
Speaker 2: They were--I told you they were married April 24th I think, 1912--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in, in Kings Mountain [North Carolina].
Story_ID: 90465
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And now, what, what, what kind of person was your mother [Lela Mauney Davidson]?  What was she like?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was beautiful, very avant-garde.  She was way ahead of her time.
Speaker 1: In what sense?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'll tell you.  For example, my mother believed in divorce when, when people just didn't divorce.  And my mother would always say to me: I want to tell you--and this is one time I was an early teenager and all--if you marry and you find out that you've made a mistake, you don't stay in it; you just get out of it, you divorce.  And then, then when I started a college, you know, I, I'm a Depression kid and a, and a, and a World War II kid, and you know, there weren't many of us who, who went to college during that time.  It was what, what [W.E.B.] Du Bois called "the talented tenth."  And the people made great sacrifices and all to go to college.  But people in my hometown would say why are you sending Vivian to school?  You know that as soon as she finishes she'll marry.  And my mother would rise up to her full five feet five inches and say I don't care if she gets married the day after she graduates from college.  I'm sending her to school so that she will be able to support herself whether she's widowed or divorced.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was something.
Speaker 2: She was way--and my--and not only that, my mother drove the automobile.  We had an Auburn, an Auburn touring car. Gorgeous.
Speaker 1: Is that a brand name, Auburn?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, A-U-B-U-R-N.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--all right.
Speaker 2: And that's--and my mother drove that car.  And that one--we went South.  We went as soon as school closed with an older cousin who lived with us.  She would pile the five of us in the car and away we'd go to North Carolina to spend the summer with my, with my aunts, and uncles, and my granddad [Wesley Mauney].  And then we'd come back to start school right after Labor Day.  But she drove the car.  And she, she dressed beautifully.  She never worked outside the home.  She was the, the house, housewife.  And she had a routine Monday was the laundry, Tuesday ironing, Wednesday this, and Thursday that, you know, and she never deviated from that routine.  I can remember that, that she would do her housework.  She would take a nap in the afternoon, take a bath, and get dressed and fully made up, and she would be sitting on the front porch when my father came home from work.  She would draw his bath for him, scrub his back, you know, have his meals ready.  She, she was a good mother, very avant-garde.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very avant-garde.  She always said to me: now, Vivian, I want to tell you, when you work, when you do, get all the traveling out of your system because once you get married and start having babies that may curtail you from traveling, but just travel.  And the other thing she said--we had a neighbor girl who, who incidentally went to Dayton, Ohio, to, to live.  And she came home on her first vacation, and my mother looked out of the window across the street.  She said here comes Ann, and she's just wearing the same old coat that she left here with.  She said I want to tell you something: when you come back, even if you have to borrow money, you come back looking prosperous (laughter).  And she said, and the first thing you get when you, when you can afford it, you know, get yourself a nice fur piece.  She was, she was something else, very, very positive, a very strong woman.
Story_ID: 89804
Speaker 1: Now, can you reflect back on growing up and give us an idea of some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Pennsylvania?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: New Castle [Pennsylvania] was a steel town, a mill town, and they had a pottery that was world famous for making wonderful pottery.  I can remember as a little girl they did a set of, of china for Haile Selassie.  In fine ho--fine china in hotels throughout the world you had pottery from New Castle, Pennsylvania.  It's a, it was a Republican town, very WASP-y [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant], but the first generation, and very Italian, a lot of Italian immigrants there, and they worked in the mills and in service.  They were the low man on the totem pole at the time.  I think there were never more--at its height when there were 50,000 people--there were never more than 5,000 black people who lived there.  But the black people lived modest lives, and, and as comfortable as possible, and, and were churchgoing people.  There were about five or six churches for blacks in the town - Union Baptist, St. Paul Baptist, Second Baptist, St. Luke A.M.E. Zion, and Bethel A.M.E. Church.  And I was reared as an A.M.E. church--in the A.M.E. church for the first 17 years of my life, although my--through my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] we had strong Episcopalian leanings from, from her time and living in Statesville, North Carolina.  So when I went to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to go to school, I attended Holy Cross Episcopal Church.  And later when I married, I became Episcopalian; other sights, as I remembered the town, Victorian houses, a pretty little town.  When I go back now I'm very sad because they're highways and fastfu--fast food joints, and it's a geriatric town.  There's nothing there to keep the young people, both white and black.  One thing that I can remember about the town, we got wonderful, wonderful educations.  It was academically superior educations, and the teachers were dedicated teachers and were nondiscriminatory in their teaching towards black children, at least through the first six grades.  And when kids reached puberty and went to junior high school then it was self-segregation, you know, because kids are starting to date, you know, and parties, things like that.  But for the most part, we, we had fine relationships, good relationships.  We had one, one black doctor, one black dentist who made good livings.  What else do I remember about the town--had a good public library.
Speaker 1: Was it Carnegie library?
Speaker 2: No, because the town wouldn't accept a Carnegie library, although ironically there had been a Carnegie steel mill there for a while.
Speaker 1: That's strange 'cause every black community in the country just about has a Carnegie library, even Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio].  My hometown has a Carnegie library.
Speaker 2: No, New Castle, Pennsylvania--remember the reput--it was Republican, and the, there were about 12 extremely wealthy families--maybe a dozen or more--who owned the mills and, and the pottery.  And they were the establishment.  They lived elegantly and very well, and remember, my father worked for one of the, one of those families.
Story_ID: 89805
Speaker 1: When the Depression came, and they reduced their staffs, then my cousin became the chauffer-butler for the same family.  And my father [Arthur Davidson] worked in a, in the Lawrence Club, the private club and then later became a skilled laborer in one of the mills and--because by this time he had bought his home, reared his family, and didn't want to uproot them to, to move.  And Depression was on, but those rich families lived very, very well.  And of course they networked with other rich families from Ohio, from Cleveland, Ohio, from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  One family had a square block for their two homes, and they gave that, their homes to the city of New Castle [Pennsylvania], and now they are the arts and cultural center.  And I went up some years ago to, to a mu--to see an art show there.  They had a ballroom.  They, they just had everything.  They had about an acre of land where they had a gar--a full-time gardener who grew their vegetables, their flowers.  But there were, there were a number of families like that.  But the town--oh, and then the Italian people over the years got educated and came into the ascendency and became politically savvy, so there was an Italian mayor at least 30, 40 years ago.  But the Jewish population had shrunk.  They used to have two synagogues; they only have one.  And for many years my optometrist was a Jewish man originally from New York who, who was also a personal friend, and, and I see him when I go home.  And they, their, their two sons have, have left because there's not much to keep them there.  And New Castle has actually become a bedroom community for Pittsburgh, which is just 50 miles away.  The highways are very good.  You can tool down the highway in, in an hour.  And Pittsburgh is thriving.  And Pittsburgh, which used to be steel and mill--the mills and everything--is now high tech.  Education is the hu--biggest employer, and then the hospitals, and then technology.  Those are the three main industries, so a lot of the people from New Castle, many of them, commute to, to, to Pittsburgh to work.
Speaker 2: Now, when, when you were a little girl growing up in New Castle, was there--was the black community separate?  Was it a separate black community, or were people scattered around, and, and were, were, were the steel mills close by?  Could you smell the mills and all--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, we, we didn't live near the mills.  They--you had to--'cause my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] would drive the men to, to, to work.  No, we didn't live near them.  Some people did, some who would come up from, from Alabama and Georgia.  But the black people lived--there was a heavier concentration in First Ward and, and the Sixth Ward, but they were--there were some families who were scattered about on the south side and the east side, and even a few on the north side, which was the posh section of the city.  I go back now and they live anywhere they got the money, you know.
Speaker 2: So did your family live near the family that your, that, that, that, that, that your father worked for, or did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: We lived, we lived about a mile away, and we lived on the, on the same street.  We all knew each other.  We had fun growing up.  It was a mixed neighborhood.  I grew up in a neighborhood of African Americans, Italian Protestants, and Irish Catholic.  And we were all friendly, and we were in and out of each other's homes.  And the Italian family across the street, if my mother was sick, Mrs. Perilla (ph.) would, would make Italian soup and spaghetti and bring over to us.  And she baked bread in an outdoor oven, and it smelled heavenly.  And the Irish Catholic family who lived down the street took her--they had the same doctor, country doctor, and they would drive to--we were very, very friendly.  So we, we--and that was true with the, with all of my--all of us who lived on, on, on the street, on the hill.  We were just about five doors from the church too, so we spent Sundays in church.

Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me about school.  What grade school did you attend and how'd you like it?
Speaker 2: Excuse me [coughing].  I attended Martin Gantz School.
Speaker 1: Mark?
Speaker 2: Martin, M-A-R--
Speaker 1: Oh, Martin.
Speaker 2: --T-I-N, Gantz, G-A-N-T-Z.  And I guess he was a prominent educator from the first through the fourth grade.  And then that school was condemned and torn down, and then we went to North Street School.
Speaker 1: Okay, how, so how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had good teachers.  We had good teachers, and, and I was an honor student.
Speaker 1: Now this is an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that's unusual for those days in most towns, even in the North, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, our school was always integrated.  I, I, I have never had a black teacher.  The only black teacher that I ever had in my life were, were my Sunday school teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's throughout your whole--
Speaker 2: Throughout my whole life I never, never, ever had a black teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: I liked English and geography.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hated math, was never good at math, never good at math.  And I think it was in ways they taught, you know.   And, and the teaching methods are so different now, that you had fear.  I just didn't--
Story_ID: 89807
Speaker 1: Now did you have--did you dream about places to travel to when you were young?  Did you think about that a lot?
Speaker 2: No, not when I was a real, real young kid.  But I'll tell you, as a librarian, you know, sometimes people ask you: what book influenced you?  When I was in eighth grade, in junior high school we had to give book reports, and I read John W. Vandercook's book "Black Majesty."  And-
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --it was the story of Henri Christophe of Haiti, and I loved it.  And of course, my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] was somewhat of a Francophile I think.  She--and, and I liked it because it was a French country, you know, and these were black people.  And, and Henri Christophe's army outsmarted Napoleon's army.  It was--that book influenced me so much so that when I met my husband [John Hewitt] in Atlanta [Georgia], and I said to my parents: what you say if we got married here at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in Sisters Chapel with Dr. [Benjamin] Mays and Dr. Clement-Marion (ph.)?  And I said and then we would honeymoon in Haiti, see.  And she said, your father [Arthur Davidson] said for you to come home to be married, you know, so that took care of that, but 10 years later we went to Haiti.  But, but I always had a strong desire to visit Haiti from that time, so it did influence me, yes, I can point definitely to that.  And we collected Haitian art for, for 15, 20 years, and we became firmly entrenched in the Haitian art community.  We went to Haiti every year from 1960 to ni--every other year from 1960 to 1965, so, travel, yes.  And my mother would say to me--I never will forget.  Now remember, she's the one who said get--do the traveling before you marry, you know.  And, and one time she said to me--now at that time--remember, this is World War II, right after that, and people aren't doing much traveling.  It was only after World War II that people began to, to travel abroad very much or anything like that.  So--but I did a lot of traveling, vacationing in the U.S.  And what you did then was you visited friends, you know, and weekend guests or houseguests, something like that, 'cause we didn't stay in hotels.  So, my mother said, Vivian, if you had one-tenth of Barbara Hutton's money, we would never be able to find you (laughter).  I never will forget her saying that.  That was fun.
Story_ID: 89808
Speaker 1: Now, back to grade school, though, from--in grade school were there any particular teachers that were--that you thought were mentors or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I was a teacher's pet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What, what were their names?  Can, can you remember the names of the teachers?
Speaker 2: Sure, I remember Elizabeth Owens (ph.).  She was the music teacher.  Oh, and, and even from grade school through junior high school, we had music appreciation; we had art classes.  It, it was--we had gym, you know.  It was, it was wonderful.  We had all the extracurricular activities.  And so, Helen Lyle (ph.), Helen Lyle I remember and--but I remember it was--I was six years old in first grade, and they were planning the Christmas play.  And so they--Ms. Lyle and Ms. Owens thought, hmm, this will be it.  I was the New Year, little Miss New Year.  There was a song, and I remember it too.  And Ms. Lyle brought her an old evening dress, white chiffon evening dress.  And they stood me up on a big windowsill, and they cut and made this little, little costume for me.  And I had a big band with gold ribbons across it like a beauty pageant saying 1927.  And they taught me this song and dance: "I am the little New Year.  Ho, ho, here I come tripping over the snow, shaking my bells with a merry din.  So open your door and let me in."  And, and I remember that my hair when I was young was golden, you know, and very fine.  And Ms. Owens sat me on her desk in, in, in my costume, and she curled my hair, you know, a la Shirley Temple I guess, and wrapped me in her coat until it was time for me to do my little act.  So I liked her very much.  And then when I got to junior high, who did I like?
Speaker 1: Now, now where, now where did you attend junior high?
Speaker 2: George Washington Junior High [School].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, it was a relatively new building with swimming pool, all the nice facilities.  It was a nice school.  And who did I like most in junior high--Rose Uhl, U-H-L, who was my French teacher, so I started taking French when I was in, in the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 89809
Speaker 1: And when we were in junior high, they had the, the honor society.  You, you took a--and the Latin students competed, took a test to be, become members of Senatas Romanus (ph.) which was the Latin Honorary Society.  I think you, you did that when you were in, in eighth grade, then, you know, when you went to ninth grade, you know, first year of high, then you got into Senatas Romanus.  And we took the test on a Saturday.  And it made headlines in the local newspaper because the first--four out of the first five places were taken by black girls, and I was one of them, and that really shook the town.  We made headlines.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause you're the minority in the (unclear)--you--now who chose the, the--I mean, well, you, you all--
Speaker 1: We competed.
Speaker 2: --just competed.  They had to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they graded, you know, in this--and according to the scores.  Four out of, out of the five top places were black.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's--
Speaker 1: We were smart.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And when, when I graduated from high school, I went to New Castle [Junior/Senior] High School.  The largest number of black students to graduate at one time--we weren't called black then; we were called Negros--where--was 12.  There were 12 in my class.
Speaker 2: Okay, did, did you--were, were you an honor student then?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--okay, 12 graduates, and you were an honor student.  Are there any teachers at New Castle High that you remember that, particularly that were good and took an interest in you?
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, yes, the history teacher, Olivia Griffith, so much so till one of my classmates said, "Vivian, are you related to Ms. Griffith?"
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She came to my wedding.  And she had taught everyone in my family.  She was a wonderful, wonderful woman, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now how was your, your social life in high school?  Did you--were you involved in various clubs and activities, or did you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, for the, for the clubs it, it, it was Senatas Romanus and--but your social life was not a mixed social life.  It was a separate social life, where I went to my, to my prom, but no big deal.  I didn't have a date.  We all went to the prom, but proms in those days weren't like the proms are today.  It was a dinner dance.  We had dinner and--at, at the, at the hotel and--
Speaker 2: So the emphasis wasn't on having a big date or anything?
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The big thing in my hometown was everybody had season tickets for the football games on Friday night.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a big football town.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--yeah, football then dominated the--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --entertainment.
Speaker 1: Do you know Massillon, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, that was the big, big game, you know, if you could beat Massillon 'cause they were a powerhouse team, you know, so.
Story_ID: 89810
Speaker 1: Right, okay, so what, what happened the rest of the year after football season and what--
Speaker 2: Well, I--well, you know, my social life evolved around the church.  And we didn't belong--we weren't invited or--in, in the drama club, or asked to be in the high school plays or anything like that, although I, when I took speaking I, I was very good in that.  And the teacher would, would, would, would invite some of us to speak--give our same speech at the women's club, you know, when they'd have their meetings.  So, I was invited to do that.  But as far as acting and drama, we didn't do that, got that through the church.  And my church had a, a very active pastor's wife who produced the plays, and, and that's where we got our, our poi--developed our poise and speaking in front of people and crowds like that.  The Sunday school and the church meant a lot in my development and my social life.  We'd go to the Sunday school conventions, and all up and down the Western Pennsylvania these A.M.E. churches, you know, we would meet people.  I have lifelong friends from that time.  None of--a few of them still remain there.  Some have been--one particularly has been extremely successful here in New York City and--but that's where our social life evolved.
Speaker 1: Now the, the A.M.E. Church is very strong in Western Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: I know that.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You had Bishop [Benjamin Tucker] Tanner at one time who was a big--one of the great bishops at A.M.E. Church in Western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Do you remember any of the--
Speaker 2: The bishops I remember two bishops, and I was very impressed.  The first bishop that I remember because he visited our church was Bishop Heard (ph.), with his chauffeur-driven Cadillac, yeah.  And then the next bishop I remember, Bishop [Richard Robert] Wright [Jr.], you know, connected with Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], you know, and--oh no, the A.M.E. church provided my social life.  And then, of course, New Castle [Pennsylvania], was just 10 miles from the border of Youngstown, Ohio.  So my teenage boyfriends and girlfriends and social life were in Youngstown, Ohio, and they had a very active social life, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so I, I would go to the dances and things like that, mm-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 89811
Speaker 1: Now, now that puts it in kind of a modern day perspective for me in some ways because Youngstown [Ohio] has, you know, steel, steel mills, and it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --also is the home of some of the richest Italian businessmen in the United States.
Speaker 2: The mafia, little mafia is--operates.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's for real too.  That is for real.  They're not kiddin'.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, yeah.  I'm--yeah, a strong Italian enclave (unclear), wow, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 10 miles from Youngstown and A.M.E. church.  When you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you know where you wanted to go to school--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --and what you wanted to do for a career?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  My mother [Lela Mauney Davidson]'s uncle, my great uncle lived in Beaver, Pennsylvania, a beautiful town about 35 miles from New Castle [Pennsylvania].  And we would visit him, and we would drive down on a Sunday afternoon sometime, and we would pass Geneva College [Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania].  And my mother--remember, this is a strong woman, and she decided early on that that is where she would like her children to go to college, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: Even though I wanted to go to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] or Cornell [Ithaca, New York], you know, or something like that.  But as it turned out, I was going with--I would--I was--I started dating very, very early.
Story_ID: 91420
Speaker 1: Okay, Geneva College [Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania].  Now tell us about Geneva College, and where is it, and, and why did your mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] want you to go to Geneva College (laughter)?
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was near (laughter).  Geneva College is a reformed Presbyterian school, a Christian college.  The reformed Presbyterians left Scotland because of religious persecution, and first settled in Ohio, and then in the 1800s they settled in Beaver Falls [Pennsylvania].  And at the time that I went to school, they limited the enrollment to 500 students because the chapel seated 500 students.  This is the story they tell.  And, and we had compulsory chapel attendance.  They checked the roll, and you were only allowed three cuts a semester, you know.  We had to take two years of Bible study, Old Testament and New Testament.  And when I was in school it was 90 percent commuters from those small towns around there.  These are first and second generation of immigrants.  And this is Depression, recession.
Speaker 1: So this is 1939 when you started--
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-seven [1937].
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven [1937].
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty--thirty-seven [1937].  And my, my brother had started in, in 1936 to Geneva College.  I started in 1937.  And 90 percent of the students were commuters, and only 10 percent lived in the dormitories.  They had one dormitory for women and one for men.  And they were always liberal racially.  There may have been some prejudiced people on faculty, but they didn't last long.  And the way, way we--besides my mother wanting us to go there, the way it started for us going there, I thought I was really the cat's pajamas, or the cat's meow, or whatever the expression of the day was.  I was a junior in high school, 16 years old, and I met Clarence Farmer, who was a senior--a junior at Geneva College and co-captain of the track team, and we started going together.  He was my first serious boyfriend.  And when--and my, my--and the dates then were parlor dates, you know, and you'd sit and hold hands, you know (laughter).  God, and this one, it hardly seems--it seems so way in the past, but I am in the past.  But anyhow, Clarence would come up by train every Sunday or every other Sunday, and we'd sit there and, and talk, you know, and everything.  So, he saw my brother coming down the stairs and he says, what's he doing?  And I said well, he's working at odd jobs trying to save money to go to college.  He said well, I'm gonna get him in college, gonna get him in Geneva.  And one thing about Clarence Farmer, too, is (unclear)--anything that he said he was going to do he did.  So, as it happened there were only two black students at the college.  And the president called Clarence in and said, Clarence, don't you know, some fine, upstanding young black man, young Negro man, who you could interest in coming to Geneva?  We can give them a work scholarship.  And he said yes, I do.  So he told Lonnie and also arranged for him to commute with a, a fellow who was commuting from New Castle, and my brother got a work scholarship and commuted to college, and that was that.  He finished his freshmen year, and then it was time for me to go.  And I knew the ropes.  We knew how to get in, so--
Speaker 1: Now this is your older brother or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, my older brother.
Story_ID: 91421
Speaker 1: And so then I started that fall.  And at that time the train service was very good-often and very good.  So I would get the 7:20 train every morning to get off at the college station, walk up the hill, do my classes, you know, and--and I was--I work scholarship student, and I worked in the college library the whole four years that I was there.  That had a lot to do with my becoming a librarian.  And Geneva College [Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania], as I say, was very, very liberal.  They didn't shout to the rooftops about it.  And when I went there were, there were six black students on campus, and one of them was my brother, and one of them from New Castle [Pennsylvania], who had won the Latin Prize, you know, and another from New Castle - two from New Castle, me and, and another from New Brighton, Pennsylvania.  And we, we remain friends to this day, you know, if they're still living.  So that was the story on that.  And I had a wonderful time at Geneva College.  We did have the, have a, a rather bigoted music, head of the music department.  I don't think he was bigoted.  I think you have to consider the times.  Two of the girls auditioned for the glee club, and the glee club traveled every spring.  And he said, you know, they wouldn't be able to stay in hotels.  It was that time, you know.  He said well, I'll, I'll form a trio for you, and you can sing locally and everything.  And some of the students heard about, and they were really incensed.  They were really incensed.  He didn't last too long.  I think the word got around to the president and the trustees or something like that.  But he didn't--he wasn't there the next year, you know, very quietly--later on, some years later, when my niece went to Geneva, she lived in the, in the dormitory.  But before she was assigned, somebody in the administration office called Dr. Sefus (ph.), a friend of ours, and said don't you know some fine Negro family where she could live?  And Dr. Sefus says what, what's the matter with her living on campus?  And he got furious, so he called the president, you know.  And Joy stayed on campus, but that was somebody in the administration office who was I think kind of bigoted, you know.  But on, on the most part, they were very good.  To tell you, the head of the chemistry department was a young black man years ago, before they were hiring black people.  The head of the humanities department for 30 years was a black woman, whom they're honoring this Saturday night with a, with a dinner.  She is professor emeritus--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In their--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --[Elizabeth] "Betty" Asche Douglas.  So the college has had a good, good, good record.  And, and I've known all of the college presidents, and I'm, I'm active in the alumni association.  I have very--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, and my--several of my cousins went there.  They, they didn't graduate, but they, they attended there, but, but I graduated.
Story_ID: 91422
Speaker 1: And my son [John Hewitt, III], like all kids, he wanted to get as far away from his parents' schools, where he didn't want to have anything to do with any school we had anything to do with.  So he rejected out of hand, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Geneva, Atlanta [University, now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], New York U [New York University, New York], you know, and all of those, and he went to Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts].  Well, in his junior year he thought he fell in, he fell in love, and his gran--he went from the Dean's List down to here.  So I said okay, you did it your way.  You're gonna do it my way.  We're gonna pull you out, and so we transferred him to Geneva College.  And when I called the president he said there's no question that there's a place for your son here.  He cannot come under an academic cloud though.  So we rescued some of his credits for him, a semester's credit.  And to tell you how academically high the standards are, when I was in school, our premeds got into the best medical schools without having to take exams.  My son did his junior year there.  And at the end of his junior year, he had early admission to Howard University Medical School [Washington, D.C.], so--and the, the classes were small, 20 or so.  The student body is up to about 2,000 now, but it's a very, very fine, academically superior school, Christian education, nice.
Story_ID: 91423
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when did you graduate from Geneva [College, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, remember I told you it was Depression, and there were two of us in school at the same time?  So, since I was only 17, 18, I dropped out while my brother finished, and then, then I went back and took some postgraduate work.  I took secretarial work and some botany and chemistry and stuff like that.  And then when he graduated I went back, and I graduated in 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, now, when, when you graduate were you pretty sure you wanted to be a librarian then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had--when I graduated, I had already been accepted in the Carnegie library school at Carnegie Institute of Technology [now Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell me about that, and how was that?  Was it a master's program or?
Speaker 2: Well, Carnegie Institute of Technology, here again, it's one of those academically superior schools.  And it was very expensive to attend by comparison to the other schools in Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And those schools, like Geneva, were commuter colleges, very few dormitories.  They were local schools.  And the African American or Negro community in Pittsburgh felt that they really weren't wanted at Carnegie Institute of Technology.  The school did nothing to recruit; there was no such thing as recruitment.  This was a perception they had.  But in the first place you had to be smart to get in, and the second place, it cost a lot of money by comparison to get in.  So those were two things that mitted--mitigated against people selecting Carnegie Tech to go to.  When I went down for my interview--and World War II was on then--I was interviewed--I was accepted pending a personal interview with the director of the library school.  Now in the catalog that didn't have anything about personal interviews for anyone else.  And I never will forget, I learned later on they admitted two Jewish girls.  When I came out of from the interview one of them was sitting there, but I didn't know it.  And she told me, she said, Vivi, when you came out from your interview I was sitting there waiting to go in.  She said, if there weren't a war on, I'm sure that neither of us would be admitted to the library school, 'cause there, there was a shortage of librarians anyhow.  But anyhow, I never will forget that interview.  Because you have to consider the times, and I think he was being very paternalistic, and I think that he thought he was saying the right thing.  He said--Ralph Munn was the director, and he said to me: we've been waiting for someone like you to come along for a long time.  We want to start at the highest level.  They didn't have a clerk.  They didn't have--maybe they had a janitor.  They didn't have an assistant that no one--the only person who had graduated from the library school was a native Pittsburgher who had graduated in 1924, 20 years before I did, but she was not employed in the city of Pittsburgh.  So anyhow, after he said that we've been waiting for someone like you to come along--but to cap it he said, I'm sorry you don't look more like a Negro than you do so that when people come into the library, they'll know exactly what you are.
Speaker 1: Well, that's--
Speaker 2: How do you like them apples?
Story_ID: 91424
Speaker 1: Well, at any rate, you, you were able to start, right?
Speaker 2: And at the time, since there was a shortage of librarians, my job was assured for me.  I worked at Wiley Avenue branch library in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is the Negro section.  My, my job was assured.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And so under ordinary circumstances, library school students devoted all their time to their studies and not to work, but, but they recruited each of us whose grades could stand to work 15 hours a week in local libraries.  So I worked 15 hours a week at Wiley Avenue branch be--when, starting when I--from 1943, and you know, for the people to get used to me.  And the funny thing was, you know, I, I had some people in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] that I knew who would come into the library, and they thought I was passing, and they would ignore me.  I never in my wildest dream thought that I was anything but what I am, you know; I never tried to be anything else, you know.  But, you know, but it was, the concept was so.  So I was the first African-American librarian hired in the City of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Now at the time you said you had--your hair was kind of a golden color, or was it--
Speaker 2: Was it--it had--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --gotten darker--
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: --had gotten darker as I got older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were, we were told in library school how to dress, you know, and that you wore little white gloves, and you wore shoes, and you wore a hat, you know, how dress--
Speaker 1: In, in, in the library (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The library school.  We were, were told how, how to go out on interviews, very, very (laughter), very different today, and--but I loved my job.  And I had no role models, no black role models.  But because I had worked for, for, during my whole school year at Wiley Avenue branch library, where I was going to be fully employed once I graduated, when it came time to do my practice work, to work in another library situation, I came to New York and did my practice work in New York City at the 135th Street Branch Library under Dorothy Homer under the New York Public Library, but based at 135th Street.  So I spent some time at the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture], sometime in the children's room with Augusta Baker, and I went all over the city to the, up, up in the Bronx, and to the Nathan Straus Library.  And, and I had a good, good work exp--practi--practicum.
Story_ID: 91425
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna go back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] for a minute now.  When you were, when you were working in the Hill District in the, in the libraries of Pittsburgh, did you ever come across any of the people associated with the Pittsburgh Courier (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, because I was the first one, the pioneer, I had such support of the community.  My, my best friends and, and mentors were the social workers.  And the library in the Hill District serviced 85 percent of the social work agencies in the city.  And we were really as much a social agency as a library.  And we had everything from the illiterate person to someone who was working on their doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh.  I knew that depending on me depended on whether anybody else would be admitted to the li--any black person--Negro would be admitted to the library school.  I knew whether, depending on my performance and all, I knew that if anyone were hired, it would be on the basis of what I had done.  I paved the way for acceptance of others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of those Pittsburgh Courier people, did you actually know 'em?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Because--[clearing throat]--excuse me [cough]--Harris.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --by the "Pittsburgh Courier" people.
Speaker 2: Now can you say that again.  (Unclear)--okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew many of the Pittsburgh Courier people.  And Toki Schalk Johnson was the "Women's Society" editor, and it, it was quite a, a thing to be listed in her society column, although I was reluctant to, to, to have that kind of portrayal, as a socialite.  I, I, I was very aware of the--that I had to be professional at all the time--all the time.  And mine was a 24-hour--there was a very slim demarcation line between my social private life and my professional life.  I was active, and, and I was really trained to be a part of the community.  The librarians were very, very well respected.  Eugenia Bruno (ph.) was, was the librarian, and before her, had been Enid Boli (ph.), who worked very closely with the Pittsburgh Urban League.  And Ms. Bruno was on committees with the, the YMCA, the YWCA, Irene Kaufmann Settlement, the Visiting Nurses Association, Kay Boys' Club.  So, the first year that I worked, I learned and bolstered all of the administrative procedures so that I could act in charge when she wasn't there.  I got advanced very fast from junior assistant to senior assistant librarian, and I was specifically trained in administrative work.  And after that, Ms. Bruno would give up some of her committee work, and I would be assigned to some of it.  I got to know Sherman Harman very well, who was a boy's works secretary at Center Avenue YMCA.  And Sherman would bring in a famous people for speakers for Sunday afternoon forums.  And so I would--I met Pearl Buck and--
Speaker 2: Pearl Buck.
Speaker 1: --people like that.  And then they had the Wednesday luncheons at the, at the YMCA, and Ms. Bruno asked me to be on that committee.
Speaker 2: Now can, can, can you talk about Pearl Buck some, Pearl S. Buck (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Not, not really because--
Speaker 2: --get a chance to meet her.
Speaker 1: --she--I, I just, you know, when you go down to the receiving line and meet somebody, but Sherman would have this series of Sunday afternoon speakers, you know, about five or six of them come.  But the, the luncheon series were, were very nice.  And he was a wonderful person who later became a YMCA executive in Philadelphia.  But he really brought culture to the Hill.  He brought Jacob Lawrence's paintings, The Migration Series to the Center Avenue YMCA, and that was in, in the nine--early 1940s--mid 1940s.
Story_ID: 91426
Speaker 1: Now did you ever meet J. A. Rogers by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, I never met him, but I'll tell you, growing up, we were nourished on the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Defender.  So, through my parents we had a great sense of identity of our heritage, of who we were.  We were always proud of our, our heritage and never had any inferiority complex or hang-ups about that.  When I got to Pittsburg, the Courier people I met, Mrs. Van, Mrs. Robert L. Vann was an honorary member of AKA, Alpha Kappa Alpha, my sorority.  I got to know her very well; Wendell Smith, who was a sportswriter.  I think he's in the Sportswriters Hall of Fame.  You know he traveled with Jackie Robinson, and, and I got to know Wendell very well; Chester Washington, who was a sportswriter; Hazel Garland, who later became the women's editor.  I knew her daughter when she was a kid, and now she's a tenured professor at the school of journalism at Columbia University [New York City, New York].  So I knew, knew all of--many, many of the Courier people real well.  On Sundays we went to church.  There were three churches in that vicinity.  There was the Pittsburgh Courier, and next door, or nearby, was Warren Methodist Church, catty-corner was Wesley Center A.M.E. Zion Church, and down the street was Holy Cross Episcopal Church.  So after church, the young people would all gather at Center Avenue YMCA, you know, for lunch and to talk and to socialize.  So you didn't miss going to church on Sundays.  It was kind of fun, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was really nice.
Speaker 1: --social life around the church--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --and the Y.
Speaker 2: --(unclear).  And your sororities and fraternity dances were the things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the Pittsburgh community was very supportive of me.  All of the professions--they wanted me to be successful.  Carnegie Library wanted me to be successful.  I was their spook who sat by the door, you know.  And as such, I was showcased to the hilt - radio appearances; I gave book talks to women's clubs, Jewish, Negro, you name it, high school appearances, book talks to high school students.  Any time they, the hierarchy of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, could showcase me, they did and I knew it.
Story_ID: 91427
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now you went to Harlem [New York City, New York] in what year?  What was it that, that you--
Speaker 2: That I came up to Harlem?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--yeah.
Speaker 2: That was, that was 1944, the spring of 1944.
Speaker 1: Now you weren't married yet (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1944, spring.  Now you were assigned out to the 135th Street Branch Library--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that what they called the, now the County (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Schomburg Center [for Research in Black Culture].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that was a, a real active place in those days.  I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, because they had the little theater there, and it was very active.  And I met all of those people.  And those librarians, I stayed in touch with them.  They became friends of mine.  I was offered a job in New York City, but I wouldn't take it because I felt an obligation to, to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and I, and I wasn't ready for the big time.  You know, I had, had lived a very protected life and--but Pittsburgh prepared me for, for New York; it really did.  You know, you didn't have to make choices.  You had one Nixon Theater, one symphony, one ballet, one opera.  That was it, you know, one baseball team, one football team (laughter), that, that was it, and one symphony orchestra.  And so I, I loved Pittsburgh with--but at the same time I suffered so from sinus trouble, and Pittsburgh was the "smoky city" then.  And I can--I would call it snirt, smog and, and dirt, you know, and, and--
Speaker 1: Smirt--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --the, the, the snow and, and, and dirt, snirt.  At noontime it, the fog would be so thick, and it would be acrid, you know, and they'd have to have the streetlights on.  And I remember visiting my aunt in North Carolina, and she was--she wouldn't even hang my, my things out on the line to dry because the slips and things were tattletale gray.  You know, it, it was just--
Speaker 1: Just permeated everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But my mother [Lela Maundey Davidson] said to me, she said, you'll never do any good as long as you live in this city.  You have to leave, because I suffered so from sinus.  So, I wrote a letter to Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], to Atlanta [University, now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], the craziest letter you ever saw, not at, not even a, a resume (laughter), but a letter, and never--oh, the one I got back from Howard, the, the application--now mind I had seven years under the belt in a major public library system in the United States.  And the, the things that they were requiring of their librarians at Howard University I looked at it, and I said I'll never meet these qualifications.  I tore it up and put it in the wastebasket.
Story_ID: 91428
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were in Harlem [New York City, New York] for how long?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just about three weeks, you know.  It, it was--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --intensive, intensive practicum that you do.
Speaker 1: Is there a highlight from that Harlem stage, 'cause that, that, that place was so active and so many things going on in that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, your, your exposure is superficial, you know, because you, you're really just getting an introduction to it.  The highlight was to, to have been offered the job by Ms.--Ms., Ms. Dorothy Homer wanted me to come back, but as I said, I felt obligated to, to Pittsburg [Pennsylvania] because I already had my job waiting for me when I got back.  And one of the reasons they sent me to New York was they weren't going to send me to another branch library in Pittsburgh to do any practice work, you know.  It was just not the time.  Since Wiley Avenue was in the heart of the black community in the Hill District, that was phenomena enough.  But to, to have a black librarian go to do--service white people--in a, in another area just wasn't going to happen at that time, so that's why I came to New York.  I had a good time.  That was my first times in New York.  And the, the librarians were so nice, you know, so--and Harlem was, really swinging.  And my friend, who was my best friend, lived--we lived at the same house, a private family, because remember, they had no dormitories as such at Carnegie Institute [of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And so she introduced me to her aunt and a couple of other people.  So what do you do at night?  You work all day.  What do you do at night (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Have a good time.
Speaker 2: Have a good time, like dance at the Savoy [Ballroom](laughter).  And we went to--had lunch at Small's Paradise, and I-[Bill] Bojangles [Robinson] was there.  And I can remember Bojangles being very anti-Negro--Negroes going into the, the white baseball leagues, very anti.  He was very--I remember overhearing that conversation.  He was strictly (unclear).  And what else do I do?  I went to--heard Josh White at the Cafe Society (laughter) downtown.  I had a good time.  I did some intellectual things (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Josh White was a famous folk singer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Bill "Bojangles" Robinson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --dancing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and the librarians, as I say, Maude Watkins, Bernice Lipscomb (ph.), Augusta Baker, I kept in contact with them, you know.  It, it was--I had a charmed, charmed career, really.  It wasn't all peaches and cream, 'cause you know if you're the first one and the only one it's tough.  I'd always look calmed on the outside, but sometimes I would just be churning in the inside.
Speaker 1: Now, now in those days, I take it that you're saying that they're weren't very many black people in top positions in libraries in all the country.
Speaker 2: No, anywhere--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --anywhere.
Speaker 1: Now even at the Harlem branch was the top librarian there white when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, she was black.  It was Dorothy Homer who was black.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The 135th Street branch was all black.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause I know before that, there was Mrs. Rose who was--
Speaker 2: Ernestine Rose.
Speaker 1: --yeah--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) director--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --right out of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --who was a very liberal woman, very liberal.
Story_ID: 91429
Speaker 1: And you know, there used to be a differentiation in pay between the black librarians and the white librarians.  I had friends who had done research on her, and she [Ernestine Rose] did a lot to eliminate that.  Yes, oh, come on, what we've had to go through in this country, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not shocking, but it's, it's, it is interesting to hear that, you know--
Speaker 1: Oh, it's, it's, it--
Speaker 2: --in, in that--(unclear)--there is a fight about it.  And--
Speaker 1: I know one of the interviews, radio interviews programs that they gave in showcasing me in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] was to be aired on the station, KDKA, I believe, which was a main radio.
Speaker 2: That was the first radio station in the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the, the man who came out to interview me and my classmate, who was a Jewish refugee from Vienna [Austria], and who had the equivalent of a doctorate from University in Vienna was very, very close to me.  She was older and, and was very protective of me.  So the interview was to be on, focus on them.  I guess we would call it the cultural diversity in libraries, what we're doing.  But Kate and I were interviewed at--and that they, they printed the interview for distribution.  But anyhow, when he was doing the interview, such as you are doing here now, and he's writing down--we talked to him, and then he did it, and then we saw it--he referred to me as a Negress, and that's a derogatory term to use.  And we--Kate was, was adamant that he eliminate that.  How dare he.  And he was Jewish, you know, very insensitive--
Speaker 2: I know how--
Speaker 1: --very insen--
Speaker 2: --how--
Speaker 1: --insensitive.
Speaker 2: --and since the Jews are in--Jewish women are referred to as Jewess.
Speaker 1: Jewess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As is if that's your profession or something or you're--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --another species, and--
Speaker 1: --yeah, you know, very in, in, insensitive.
Speaker 2: There were, there were incidents like that, but not many because I was living in a completely, well, black world, black world.  My social life--well, but I had good rapport with, with my white colleagues.  They were very friendly, and I stayed friendly with them.  And, and the children's librarian [Augusta Baker] and was, was absolutely wonderful.  She was a Bohemian who would--lived in New York, and she wrote a poem for me.  I had fun.  I had fun, a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 91430
Speaker 1: And Ms. [Eugenia] Bruno (ph.), I kept in contact with her until, till she died.  And I'd go back from, from New York.  I'd--when I'd go to Pitts-Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] I'd have lunch with her at her, at her home.  So I, I had good, good contacts.  And then, then to her credit, Homewood area [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was beginning to change.  That's when the, the, the master plan for the rede--redevelopment of the triangle area, downtown area of Pittsburgh was to take place.  And they displaced many of the people in the Hill [District] because they leveled a lot of those homes.  People had to go someplace, so they went out to Homewood, which was a middle, upper middle class neighborhood where the better class of black people lived.  And so with the, with the geographics changing and with the community changing, the library felt that they had to change too.  So they were transferring Ms. Bruno out to the Homewood branch library because the community was being, becoming more black.  And she said, I will accept the transfer provided I can take Ms. Davidson and Mrs. Howell with me.  And Gladys Howell was the second black that they had hired as a clerical assistant, and she worked for the library for 40 years, you know, very attractive woman whose husband was the director of the Kay, Kay Boys' Club.  But she--they didn't give her Mrs. Howell right away, but they did give her me, so we went out to Homewood to, to try to do the same thing in that changing neighborhood that we had been doing, and--at Wiley Avenue, you know, hooking up with the community organizations with the churches, so forth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, Homewood is that in approximated to Homestead [Pennsylvania]?  I know there's a neighbor--there's a--
Speaker 1: Homestead is, is a suburb which is some distance beyond Homewood.  Homewood is a section of the city.  It's about nine miles from the center of town, but it's a second where, as I say, where the better class Negroes lived, and it's also spawned some good writers.  What's his--he's a very--he's, he's done a lot of books writing about Homewood.  Can't think of his name right now, but I've, I have all of his books, and I've read them.  But August Wilson self-educated himself in Wiley Avenue branch library.  He was just a kid, you know, a little boy when I was there.  I never met him or saw him, but that was the library that he used.  And I go to see every one of his plays because I know what is actually true and what is fictionalized because I--that was my territory where I worked.  I know all of those streets, everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he writes about the Hill District and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Hill District, yes.
Speaker 2: --and the historical period--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, I know all of that.  The jitneys where, where you couldn't get a Yellow Cab, but you could call a jitney number and get--oh yes, yes.  And ironically, I think his very best play was the first he ever wrote, called "Jitney."  It was very, very powerful.
Speaker 2: Right, that was Jessica Dukes recently (unclear) I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --over the last few years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't like the last one so much, "King Hedley II," too long, three hours long.  It needs to be shortened, and it was too preachy.  But I met him in Seattle.  He lives in Seattle, Washington.  And the Hewitt Collection [of African American Art] was at the Bank of America Gallery in Seattle, and he came opening night and spoke.  And we were photographed together in front of the Homage to Mary Lou, which was the inspiration for his play, The Piano--"[The] Piano Lesson."
Speaker 2: "Piano Lesson?"
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Story_ID: 91431
Speaker 1: Okay, let--we're gonna get to more of that later, but I wanna--I should go on and talk about this letter to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and we'll talk about that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, the, the qualifications were so demanding and such, I said I'll never meet those, so I tore it up and threw it in the wastebasket.  And I met Joseph Friesen (ph.) about five years later, and I told him that I, I, I was teaching then at, at, at, at Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I said, yeah, I got an application from Howard.  I said, but the qualifications looked so high that I couldn't meet them, so I threw it in the wastebasket.  And he said oh, oh (laughter), you know.  But, but I was vacationing, and I'd taken my little niece to North Carolina, to Davidson, North Carolina.  We were vacationing, and I got this SOS call from, from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Vivian, Atlanta, Atlanta University is, is calling.  They--it's urgent.  They want you to call them right away.  So I called, and they wanted me--they had a vacancy on the faculty, and they needed a librarian for the library school.  So they asked if I would come down for the interview.  And I had to make a decision real quick.  I couldn't, couldn't depend--I couldn't consult, couldn't advise or anything.  And I know that it's proper.  I had--I was on vacation, so you have a month's vacation, and that's--as your--if you're a professional, that's the, the time that you should give for if you're going to resign or take another position.  But here I'm in the middle, you know, and I'm offered the job at Atlanta, and remembering what my mother said then, you know, suffering from sinus, I (unclear) the warner--warmer climate and everything, and I liked what I saw, so I said yes, I'll take the job.  And then I sent a letter of resignation.  Well, Ralph Munn wrote and said your letter isn't being accepted.  It's being merely tabled, you know, for you to come back here and earn the right to it, blah, blah, blah.  'Cause in the meantime, I was being transferred from Homewood [Branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh] to another library.  It was apparent that I wasn't going to go vertical, but would get lateral positions, and they weren't ready for me to become a branch librarian anywhere.  So I didn't really truly want to go to that other library in another section of the city.  So everything just happened to mesh at the same time, so there was nothing for me to do but send the letter of resignation, and that was it, was it.  It was the best decision I ever made in my life.
Story_ID: 91432
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Loved it.  Atlanta was a segregated city.  But you know, I always referred to, to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and to everything Way Down South up North, because Dr. Lawrence Reddick and I had been refused drinks at the bar in the Astor Hotel [Astor House] on Broadway in 1944, you know, so come on--Way Down South up North, but I loved Atlanta.  We lived a self-contained life 'cause everything was there on the campus.  You know, there were the four schools: Spelman [College], Atlanta [University, now Clark Atlanta University], Clark [now Clark Atlanta University], Morehouse [College].  And the first day that, that I was being interviewed by the dean of the library school, sitting on her front porch, she turned to her husband and said, you know, don't you think Ms. Davidson and that nice red-headed man from New York would make a nice couple?  He says yes, Virginia, I do (laughter).  So, so I got to Atlanta on the 7th--16th of September, and I'm down in the, in the library school getting ready for the library reserve books ready for the students, you know, and doing my thing, and I get a telephone from the dean: Ms. Davidson, will you come up here please?  And I went to her office.  Who's standing there but John Hewitt.  So she said, Ms. Davidson, Mr. Hewitt, you know--he says I've met Ms. Davidson.  I had met him the night before because he had, had a date with somebody who was living in the (unclear) in the same dormitory as--so I, I had a faculty suite.  So I said okay, bully for you, you know.  So then we gave a tea for the library.  'Cause he was giving some classes in the library.  He was on the faculty at Morehouse, and he had been in Atlanta for a couple of years before, before I got there.  And then he invited me to go to a dance at the high school faculty (unclear)--was giving.  So we hit it off, you know.  I don't think it was love at first sight.  I think we just started talking, and we found out that our families were--we had almost identical family background.  We discovered after we married that our mothers were born the same year, the same month, two days apart.  And I always said to him, the only difference between my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] and your mother is that my mother--your mother has an iron fist and a velvet glove.  My mother just has an iron fist (laughter), and we would laugh about that.  So, I think both of us were, were ready to be married, but I, I, I was going with somebody had--whom my family thought that I would eventually marry, and so that I--a, a lawyer from, from Akron, Ohio, but, you know.  It was customary for the new faculty to be introduced at the Founders Day Dinner, which was a black tie affair, and for each new faculty member to respond.  So I gave little--a wine and cheese party in my suite before we went up to the dining room for the dinner.  And you know there's such a thing as a white lie and a white, white, whiter lie.  And the dean was very antsy.  She want--she really wanted to know what I was going to say, and I wouldn't tell her my, what my response would be.  And so--but I said to John Hewitt, I said, what would say--and I'm batting the eyes you know--said what would (laughter) you say if I got up and announced our engagement?  And he said, I dare you.  So I considered we were engaged (laughter).  He never really formally asked me to marry him.  So, the way he just took it from there, he called his mother and his sisters.  And I called my best friend, and, and my aunt, and my mother, and another friend.  I called five people.  He just called his family.  And we decided that we would marry at Christmastime because we had that vacation, so we married the 26th of December.
Speaker 1: What, what, what year was it?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went, met him on September 17th, and Thanksgiving Day--and October 17th I said, what would you say if I announced our engagement?  And he said I dare you, so I figured we were engaged.  And then the formal engagement was at Thanksgiving Day at the dean's home, where he asked the English department and I asked the library school people to, to what--that was formal, but they all knew it was going to, to be.
Story_ID: 91433
Speaker 1: And then the Atlanta Daily World had a great big column on it, you know, and that was the paper.  And then we married on the, on the [December] 26th [1949].  And [Charles] "Teenie" Harris, who is the, is to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] what [James] Van Der Zee was to New York.  Teenie was the photographer for the Pittsburgh Courier, took my wedding pictures, and he's, he's Teenie "One-Shot" Harris.  I knew him--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Teenie.
Speaker 1: --so very well.
Speaker 2: --"One-Shot" Harris.
Speaker 1: Teenie "One-Shot" Harris.  And that--all of those wedding pictures that you see, one shot, that's all, one shot.  And I la--the one I like best is throwing the bouquet.  You know, he--one shot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a great picture of the--(unclear) so we're gonna shoot it later, (unclear) later.
Speaker 1: Teenie "One-Shot" Harris.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his first name?  T-E-E-N-I-E?
Speaker 1: Well, his name--first name is Charles--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Charles, and Teenie was his nickname, T-E-E-N-I-E.
Speaker 2: Now why do they call him Teenie, because he's little or--
Speaker 1: He is a little guy, a little guy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I knew him very well.
Story_ID: 91434
Speaker 1: And at the time the Pittsburgh--Pittsburgh Courier was a national paper--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --pretty much.
Speaker 2: Very influential.  And the, the other person that I got to know so well in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], she's a legend in her own, own time--you should really do an interview of her--Evelyn Cunningham [HM].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the first woman, Negro woman, I knew who had a fur wardrobe, and she, she commuted.  She worked for the Courier, and she would--she was married to Chick Cunningham (ph.), who was a numbers banker.  And he was well--wealthy, well-to-do, and he per--he took care of her very well, you know, Cadillac car and mink coat.  She had mink, and sheared beaver, and broadtail and everything.  She was fabulous, and commuted to Pittsburgh.  You know, she would be in Pittsburgh for the week and then come to New York on the weekend.
Story_ID: 91435
Speaker 1: Now, I heard, I've heard now--maybe tell me what you know about this now.  It's so long after the fact, but I heard, I've that the numbers were printed in the Pittsburgh Courier.  Everybody'd wait for the Courier to see the number, you know, you know.
Speaker 2: That, that's, that's--
Speaker 1: --pretty much.
Speaker 2: --that's true, you know.  Yeah, the, the Courier, everybody thrived on the Courier, (laughter) you know.  It was a big business.  And Teenie [Charles "Teenie" Harris]'s brother was a big numbers banker, Woogie [William "Woogie" Harris].
Speaker 1: Woogie?
Speaker 2: Woogie Harris.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) had Teenie and Woogie.
Speaker 2: Teenie and Woogie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Woogie had a, had a chauffeur and a, and a Duesenberg.
Speaker 1: What else about not--how did (unclear), how did--where did the number appear in the paper?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't really know because I wasn't into it, you know, but-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  It was the horse racing results.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Okay, we have a voice from, from the pastor that say it was horse racing results; it was in the horse racing results, the number would come up.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, it was the horse racing.  They would take which, what horse came in in this race, and what came into this race, what horse came in, and that would constitute the number--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the day.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 91436
Speaker 1: The baseball teams, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays.
Speaker 2: You had two in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] at the same time.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and they were good.  And I used to go to ballgames.
Speaker 2: And those were the better--two, two of the better teams on the Negro Leagues too.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What were some of the best players (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Josh Gibson, and Satchel Paige.  And you know, as I get older, my memory dims.  I can't think of some of the names of some of the players.  The Allen Brothers and one of the daughters [Mae Louise Allen] of one of the Allens is married to Willie Mays.  And it seems to be a natural because she grew up knowing baseball, with her father and her uncles were professional baseball players.  And I don't know which team they played for, one or the other.
Speaker 2: It's been said that Josh Gib--Gibson was perhaps the greatest baseball player of all time.
Speaker 1: Catcher, he was a catcher.  I went to--when I was traveling, and the Hewitt Collection just closed in Kansas City, Missouri, and it was at the Jazz Museum and the Negro League Ba[seball]--Museum--is a wonderful museum.  They have a replica of a baseball field, and, and full-size statues of the men, you know.  It's, it's really, really nice, really nice.
Story_ID: 91437
Speaker 1: Okay, well, after you got married, what happened next?  Did you--you taught, you taught in Atlanta [Georgia at Atlanta University, now Clark Atlanta University] for--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was teaching in the library school.  I taught two courses.  I taught basic reference and public libraries, and then was in charge of the, of the library, school library.  And we had good students.  All of our students became imminently successful when they, after they graduated.  One of them even became a librarian for the City of Atlanta some years later.  And the other was her deputy.  They were, they, they were good students.  I had a good time in Atlanta.  I liked it very much.  Atlanta was a good city, and you were respected if you were faculty members.  And I know why you used your initials.  Because you didn't want to be called by your first name by the, the white people.  But when John and I would go shopping at Rich's or Davidson's, the clerks would sort of kind of gather around us because we had Northern accents (laughter), you know, and they would like to listen to us.  But you got good treatment in, in the, in the stores.  And--
Speaker 1: I never knew that about--I never knew anything about, about the initials.  But if you use initials, you--they couldn't call you by your first name.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: May this be a reason why there are some black people that went to school with folks in my generation--I'm over 50--and have, you know, been in--
Speaker 2: Who's names are initials--
Speaker 1: R.O.N. then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: E.J., E.A.
Speaker 1: O.S., O--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was it because the minute you, you--the men, especially the men, they'd call you by your first name, you know.
Speaker 1: It's hard to abbreviate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --diminish it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, we, we met everybody who was somebody in the black world who, who (unclear)--who came to Atlanta at that time.  We met Ralph Bunche, and Ira Reed, and--who's, who's the mystic?
Speaker 1: Howard Thurman?
Speaker 2: Thurman, yeah, all, all of them.
Speaker 1: Was Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois in the--in those days?
Speaker 2: That was before my time.  And Langston [Hughes] had been there.  That was before my time.  But--and just shortly before our time was Hale Woodruff.  But we've got to know Hale Woodruff very well when we came to New York.  We came especially close to him, especially my husband [John Hewitt], who wrote about him for several publications.
Speaker 1: How long were you in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: I was there two and half years, and John was there for four.
Speaker 1: Okay, so up until the I guess early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: John was there from '48 [1948] to '52 [1952], and I was there from '49 [1949] to '50 [1950]--to the beginning of '52 [1952].  And, and we, we resigned and, and came--he came back home to New York.  His mother had died and his sisters were living in a, in the family home brownstone.  And he wanted to come back and be with them.  And when we left, we had a lot of our friends that--gee, we wish we had the courage to do what you're doing.  We wish we had resigned early on and changed places, you know.  But I went home and stayed four months with my parents, and John came to New York to ready our apartment and the family home on Sugar Hill for us.  My son was born in New Castle [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 91456
Speaker 1: Okay, so you say your son [John Hewitt, III] was born in New Castle [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And--all right.
Speaker 2: And we came to New York when he was four months old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I didn't work.  I stayed home till he was at-toilet-trained and talking.  And then I had made up my mind that when I went back to work that I was going to be (unclear), working a special library situation.  And my inspiration for knowing about special libraries was one of my classmates at Carnegie Library School at Carnegie Tech [Carnegie Institute of Technology].  She was a Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] debutante society girl from one of the very wealthy families there, and she was a graduate of Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts], much more sophisticated than, than any of us.  And she knew about Special Libraries Association [SLA].  That was the first I'd ever heard of it.  She said and what they-they're based in New York, and these are libraries in museums, and in hospitals, and law offices, and in the corporate world, in banks.  And they have a, an association, and they have an executive director, and they will match you up with, with jobs if you belong to it.  So that seed was planted very early on.  And all the, the years that I worked in Pittsburgh, I worked two shifts, nine to six or one to nine.  And we had to work two or three nights a week.  And I--there's something about working at night that just seems longer.  But the thing that I disliked most was having to work on Saturday, because I'm going to work and everybody else--my friends are going to the football games.  So--and then we did have a few married librarians.  And if their kids got sick or if their husbands were traveling, you know, they'd take a time off, and you'd have to adjust your schedule to accommodate them.  So I had made up my mind that if I ever went back to work, I was gonna work in special libraries five days a week, nine to five.  And in Atlanta [Georgia] I had made a--at the library school when I was teaching I had made a good contact with a woman who was an editor of library literature, who worked for one of the big library publishers, H. W. Wilson Company.  So I said to Dorothy [Cole], I said, if I ever come to New York to work, and if I'm looking for a job, will you give me a reference.  And she said I'd be delighted to, and she did.  Well, I stayed home until, till my son was toilet trained and talking.  And as it happened, my father [Arthur Davidson] became very ill, and I didn't think it-that--I was professionally trained, had a career, and I didn't think it was fair to ask my husband [John Hewitt] to contribute to the welfare or to help out with, with, with my family in any way, especially since I was able to work and could so if needs be.  So that--and besides, I was tired of sitting on the park bench talking with, with mothers and watching kids in kiddy cars and everything like that.  I was sort of champing to get back to work.
Story_ID: 91457
Speaker 1: So I called Dorothy Cole and said I'm going to start looking for work.  And as it happened, my son [John Hewitt, III] was going to a nursery school which was near the Special Libraries Association [SLA] office.  And I went in and became a member.  And membership was only 10 dollars, and I became member.  And then we had a--there was a very wonderful, wonderful executive director, Kathleen Stebbins.  And what she would do, these companies would send in that they needed a librarian, and she would match up your qualifications with theirs.  That happened a little later on.  I'm, I'm about two years ahead of my story.  I called Dorothy Cole, and she sent me up to Columbia University [New York City, New York] because the placement officer, Dean, was a tall, long, lean, lank Texan, whom I called an emancipated Southerner.  And because I was a friend of Dorothy Cole's, he had--he, he said I'm gonna send you out on some job interviews.  He had no obligation to me because I wasn't a Columbia graduate.  But he said, I'm going to send you on these interviews, Mrs. Hewitt, and I want you to report back to me to tell me what kind of reception you received.  Now mind, this New York City, okay, liberal--Way Down South up North.  Okay, so he sent me to ABC, NBC, CBS, to several other places.  And you know, I was looked at and you know, with askance, and they would call out the clerical workers.  You know, and here I am, a professional person with a good many years of, of library experience and teaching in, in an accredited library school, you know.  And these people are looking you over, you know, so it's subtle racism that still exists, you know.  So I reported back to him. Excuse me--[cough].  And that was that.  But one of the jobs he sent me to was Crowell-Collier Publishing Company at 540 5th Avenue, 5th Avenue and 51st Street.  The form--the head of the research reference department for the encyclopedia.  Collier's Encyclopedia had been a former executive at American Library Association [ALA] in Chicago [Illinois] and was a friend to Dorothy Cole.  He interviewed me, and before I got home on the subway he had called and wanted to know when I could come to work, was hired right away.  I never worked so hard in all my life as I did there with nine to five, five days a week.  It toughened me.  I could take on being a reference librarian anywhere, anywhere.  Because what the salesmen would do, they would sell the encyclopedia, and they'd say now if there's a question that you can't answer or find in the encyclopedia, we have a staff of experts in New York City.  And you just send one of these coupons--they got fifty coupons--and that book--and ask your question, and our experts in New York City will answer your question for you.  That's what we did.  We sat there typing out the answers nine to--
Speaker 2: So you were the experts--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were the--
Speaker 2: --in that--
Speaker 1: --experts.
Speaker 2: You were--
Speaker 1: --experts. And-
Speaker 2: How many of you were there?
Speaker 1: I think there were about a dozen of us.  Some were, had, were formally trained as librarians, and some weren't.  And, and our desk were just, you know, was this huge room with desks spread (laughter) out, you know.  And, and well, it was like being in a union.  You know, you didn't cov--uncover your typewriter until 9:00, start typing, you know, twelve o'clock on the (laughter), one o'clock, five o'clock, stampede out the door.  But it was interesting.  I really, really became an expert librarian.  And because my bus passed on the New York Academy of Medicine, I got all these questions that could be--that had to do with medical things that we were--legally we--there were--we were constrained by the types of answers, the things that we could do.  But, but I would get these write outs, okay, and I would spend a week at the New York Academy of Medicine using their facilities.  I got to know all the librarians there, got to know how to use Index Medicus and all those things.  It was a wonderful job.
Story_ID: 91458
Speaker 1: I needed two years of good solid work experience to get into a really legitimate kind of special library.  So, now, that's where my story comes in.  My son [John Hewitt, III] by this time was in a nursery school that was next to the Special Libraries Association [SLA] office.  And I went and joined and got--then Ms. [Kathleen] Stebbins start sending the fliers out.  So, one of the fliers that, that she sent to me was for an opening at Rockefeller Foundation at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.  Now I'm at 5th Avenue and 51st Street, so I could run over for the interview on my lunch hour.  And here, again, pioneering--for all of their liberalism and everything, there's a lot of slippage between top and the middle and the bottom, you know.  The interviewer personnel interviewed, and I filled out the resume and everything, gave my references.  And my references were Rufus Clement and the dean of the library school.  Well, you know, they check very thoroughly into the references.  And Rockefeller Foundation had given a grant to the library school, and they knew--and what's more important, Lindsey Kimball with the administrative vice president of the foundation, and at that time, very high in the establishment of the United Negro College Fund, so he knew all of the black college presidents.  He knew Benny Mays [Benjamin Mays], Rufus Clement.  He was like that.  Lindsey Kimball was the designated overseer of one of the Rockefeller Brothers, whose interest was the Urban League United Negro College Fund, anything to do with blacks, you know.  So, when my references were Rufus Clement, you know, and all--I guess they talked about it--I got the job.  And I was the first African-American woman professional on that staff and the first professional on that staff.  Now, there were black men who were in--who were messengers and in the mailroom and two or three who were in the treasurer's office, but I was the first woman and first professional, no secretaries, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Story_ID: 91459
Speaker 1: Dean Rusk was president.
Speaker 2: Dean Rusk, who became Secretary of State?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So when I went in--was taken in by the woman who was my boss to meet him, I said to him, Mr. Rusk, I think that we know someone in common.  I said, my uncle is Hood Norton.  And he said, yes, Hood has given me many a haircut.  Dean Rusk graduated from Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, where my uncle's barbershop was the main barbershop in that college town for a century.  So that was really very good.  And, and Uncle Hood always said that Dean Rusk was a poor Georgia boy who was in Davidson College on a football scholarship, and--but he was very nice.  And, and Dean Rusk said to me, he said, yes, I know Hood very well.  And when he became Secretary of State, he always went to the barbershop for Uncle Hood to give him a haircut.  So, so I got off to a good start on that level at Rockefeller Foundation.  But there had been a, a almost--it was a very small staff.  There were only three people on the library staff, and the former librarian, and the personnel person, and some of--they were on the outs.  And, and the former librarian had her devotees and people who were loyal to her.  So I was looked on somewhat apprehensively, although there were two people who were very friendly to me.  One of the older women was, was extremely nice.  And at that time, Rockefeller Foundation hired girls from the social register who had graduated from the Seven Sisters Schools.  And one of them had just started to work a few weeks before I did.  And she befriended me, and our friendship lasted almost 50 years.  We were, my husband [John Hewitt] and I, were with her for every important event in her, her life.  And we were very, very close friends, so there were some good things that came out of it, you know.  And then I had been there two, two years, and Mr. [Lindsey] Kimball called me into his office to have coffee with him.  And you know, this, this was may--maybe made for some jealous pangs, you know, and I was aware of that.  And, and I knew when an officer had his secretary call the library to have a question answered, you know, you could take your time all right.  But if an officer himself called, you knew that you had to get off your duff and get it done pronto.  And Dean Rusk would come in sometimes himself to, to ask things like that, and--
Story_ID: 91460
Speaker 1: So I had been there two years, and Mr. [Lindsey] Kimball called me in for coffee, but to show me all these letters that he had gotten from every black college president when he was lea--when he was leaving as executive or whatever it was at United Negro College Fund.  We sat there and talked.  And then a few, few days later I got a call from him, and he said, you've been here long enough for you to entertain.  There, again, I was being showcased, and I knew it.  And he said, call all the librarians, make up your list, and call the people who have been helpful to you on interlibrary loan, and we'll have a luncheon--you'll, you'll have them for a luncheon.  Dean [Rusk] will be there, and I'll be there, and so make up your list.  And when I made up the list for the private dining room, there were too many people for one sitting.  He says that's no problem.  You'll give two luncheons; you'll give one one day and one the next day.  So that's what we did.  And to that time I had been a telephone voice to all these librarians.  Were they ever shocked when they came in, you know.  They were, they were shocked, and it was, it was, it was a learning experience for them, and--
Speaker 2: Like a coming out party.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And this, these were librarians from the National Geographic Society, New York University Law School, Council on Foreign Relations, the Rockefeller Brothers Library, Rockefeller University Library, Columbia University Library, Hunter College Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, anyone who had--you know, that I had used their facilities for.  And so that, that was very interesting and then--
Story_ID: 91461
Speaker 1: I guess about a year later Mr. [Dean] Rusk, and Mr. [Lindsey] Kimball, and their wives were in Mexico City [Mexico] on a visit to our office in Mexico City.  At that time we had five offices throughout the world, one in India, one in the Caribbean, one in London [England], one in Mexico City, and I forget where the--oh, and one in, in Columbia, South America, five offices.  And when they made grants, the officers made site visits to every place where a grant was being made.  And Mr. Kimball, and Mr. Rusk, and their wives were in Mexico.  The librarian-bibliographer was going to make a trip to South American on foundation business to oversee some libraries, and she said, when I'm gone my work will just pile up so, and I don't have any--and, and I just, just dread coming back to all this work.  So Mr. Rusk said, how would you like some help from the New York office?  And she said, oh, I wouldn't dare ask Mrs. Hewitt.  She's married and has a child.  He said, that's not for us to decide.  We'll ask Mrs. Hewitt.  So when they came back, Mr. Kimball said, we'd like for you to go to Mexico City to run the agricultural library for the summer.  You are our best ambassador.  If you don't go, no one will go.  And my assistant deferred her vacation to run the library.  And what we did was, each sister-in-law took two weeks of vacation, two, four, six.  My husband [John Hewitt] took his two weeks of vacation, two, four, six eight.  That's two months, and then my mother [Lela Mauney Davidson] came up for the third month.  So I had three months in Mexico City.  And the foundation believed that their staff and their officers should get to know the local people and not hang out in the American colony per se.  I did go to the Episcopal Church the first Sunday that I was there, but after that, I was with the--my Mexican colleagues.  And then Langston Hughes arranged for me to meet Elizabeth Catlett [HM].  He also arranged for me to meet a Mexican lawyer friend of his, Manuela Gonzalez (ph.), who is a lawyer-journalist.  And I never could manage the pesos and the expense account and everything, so the office manager managed that for me.  She said, Mrs. Hewitt, you're on per diem.  You have to eat, and you have to stay someplace.  What difference does it make whether it's in Mexico City or Acapulco [Mexico]?  I said, but I'm alone.  I don't--she says we'll make the arrangements for you.  So they hired a car and a (laughter) driver, made hotel arrangements, and I went to Acapulco.  And I'm sitting there having breakfast alone and this Mexican family with their kids and everything.  That was the first time I got a little homesick 'cause the little boy was acting like my son would act.  He was saying to the maid, manzana.  You know, he wanted an apple, and they didn't have apples or something like that.  But anyhow, they invited me to have my meals with them, and they were from Cuernavaca [Mexico].  And so they said, when you come to Cuernavaca this is our address, telephone number.  Please get in touch with us.  It happened that he was a veterinarian and the non-playing captain of the Mexican Davis Cup team.  So, one weekend I was with Manuela and Itza (ph.), his wife, who was a photographer.  The next weekend I was with Leo and Rosemary and their family and like that.  And I went to the International Tennis Ball, you know, and I had, I had a good time.  And one of the officers from the [Rockefeller] Foundation was there honeymooning with his second wife, and their little 10-year-old daughter was along.  The first week that I was there I had a difficulty adjusting to the altitude.  I fainted the first day in the office.  So I said I have to slow down.  I said, Ken, I'll babysit for you while you and Caroline go, go about your business.  He said, well, Vivian I was gonna ask you to do that (unclear).  But anyhow, I acclimated.  And then they, they had a car and driver for the officers, and they took me to the places where they went, to Puebla, you know, so I had a wonderful time.  I went to Oaxaca [Mexico], to, to the Yucatan [Mexico], was with one family or the other on the weekends.
Story_ID: 91462
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to see some of the, the African cultural sites down there, the black cul--cultural sites in, in Mexico?
Speaker 2: Later, some years later.  And I had a good friend who decided to become an expatriate, and she lived in Veracruz [Mexico].  And was a an--became anthropologist, and I got to visit Veracruz, yeah.
Speaker 1: The site of the Olmec heads and--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Yanga (unclear).
Speaker 2: And if you worked at Rockefeller [Foundations]--well, I was the first of the people who had overseas experience of, of the middle level.  And then they made it possible for some of the secretaries to, to go to London [England], you know, to work for several weeks and like that, so it was nice, was nice, was nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long were in Mexico?
Speaker 2: Three months.
Speaker 1: Oh, tell us about your visit with Elizabeth Catlett [HM].  Did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I watched her work in her studio.  I knew the boys when they were 10, 12, 14, when they were little boys.  And now they're all grown men, you know, and all very successful.  She could have been on the Goodnight Club singer because when she would work, you know, she'd put her visor on, you know, and, and she's working in her studio, and she'd have Bessie Smith records playing, very good.  Her mother was alive and living with them then.  And Poncho [Francisco Mora], her husband, was, was very nice, very good graphic artist.  And I went to Mexico eight times, but I haven't been there for years and have no desire to go back because all the close friends that I knew are gone.  You know, their kids are grown.  And then Mexico City [Mexico] is one of the most polluted cities in the world, you know.  Last time I was here the pollution was just so heavy, you know, so I have no desire to go back.  But I, I--the one place that I would like to have visit was San Miguel de Allende [Mexico], but I never got there.  That's the artist colony. But--
Story_ID: 89837
Speaker 1: So we're wrapping up the trip to Mexico.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so what happened--what was the highlight in the trip to Mexico you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, getting to see the Mexican artists.  You know, when, when John [Hewitt] and I married in 1949 we got some money as wedding presents, and we honeymooned here in New York.  And remember I told you we had a faculty suite, so we went to the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], to the Carnegie.  And we brought good prints, and we took them back to Atlanta [Georgia], had them framed, and hung them in our suite.  We wanted it decorated as, as, as cozy and as nice as possible.  But we were always on the same wavelength as far as art was concerned.  And the paintings that we bought, we bought Orozco's "Zapatistas".  And we bought a Picasso still life, and a Brach still life, and (unclear)--(unclear).  But I like the Mexican paintings.  And in Mexico, I got to see in, in Cuernavaca, the murals that Diego Rivera had done-- was very privileged because our experi--agricultural experimental station for the Rockefeller foundation was at Chapingo, which was a little suburb from Mexico City.  And in the chapel at Chapingo, Orozco had done beautiful, beautiful murals.  And this is off the tourist beat, so I had--was privileged to see those.  But everywhere I went I saw wonderful paintings.  And then this journalist-lawyer friend of Langston Hughes introduced me to some of his friends.  And one of them was--depending on to whom you talked, she was either the greatest patron of the arts or the greatest courtesan in Mexico City.  Her father had been a general under Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution.  And she was married to one of Manuel's classmates, another lawyer, who was much younger than she.  And they lived in El Pedregal, which was a very rich, very lovely section of Mexico City.  And Manuel took me out to her home, and she was living in the little cottage while the big house was being built.  And then a couple of years later I went back and it was--she had been sculpted and painted by every one of the famous painters in Mexico City by Tamayo, by Siqueiros, by Orozco, by all of them.  And all of these paintings were there, so I said to her, I said, do you mind?  She said oh, Vivian, this is just a small house.  There are only two bedrooms.  But what a house.  The guest house was their library.  So I said do you mind if I take pictures?  She said oh, take all you want.  So I said, (unclear) where are you going to leave your paintings?  She left them to the Mexican government (unclear), and the books, she left to the library in Oaxaca.  But her name was Maria Asunsolo [Dolores del Rio].  So that was one of the highlights of--a really true highlight of my Mexican experience.  And she was very close friends to Nelson Rockefeller and his first wife [Mary Rockefeller].  And--but she thought that because I worked at Rockefeller Foundation that, that maybe I was one of them, ha--had news for her (laughter).  But she had a lovely, lovely place in El Pedregal.  What else did I like in Mexico?  I liked--this is 1958.  This is a Spanish country, and women do not go about alone, okay.  But I had to eat, so I made it a habit to take my main meal of the day in a Mexican restaurant.  And Manuel wanted to improve his English, and I wanted to learn a little bit of cocktail Spanish.  So he would come and accompany me most times to a restaurant with his dictionary, and we would sit there and eat, you know.  So I ate in all the really good restaurants.  I was living in the Zona Rosa.  Then occasionally friends would be visiting in Mexico, and I would have dinner out with them.  Other times, I just stayed at the, at the hotel, 'cause I was just a block or two from the, from the office.  But I, I had a wonderful time.  I appreciated Mexican culture, mainly Mexican art, loved it.
Story_ID: 89838
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mexican artists had an influence in some of the African-American artists, Diego Rivera particularly.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Inspired Charles White and to some extent, I think John Beard's even (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I never met any of them.  Betty knew them.  Elizabeth Catlett [HM] knew them.  But one of the things--much later on when John [Hewitt] and I began collecting African-American art, I was in Hawaii sitting in the coffee shop, and I saw a mural that caught my fancy.  And I liked it very much, and it re--and I went up to the gift shop and found out who the artist was.  It was Jean Charlot, who was head of the art department at the University of Hawaii.  But that painting spoke to me 'cause there was a lot of Mexican influence, and I found that he had lived in Mexico.  It was Hawaiian influence.  There was French influence.  It was really, really very nice.  So all of these things combined and brought back those, those memories.  But we'd better get back to--get out of Mexico and get to, to, to New York.  Let's see--get me out of Rockefeller Foundation.
Story_ID: 89839
Speaker 1: Well, I worked there [the Rockefeller Foundation] seven or eight years, and I am a--I had worked in public library, and I'm a people-oriented person.  The Rockefeller Foundation was exclusively for staff use only.  I think there were a 150 people on staff.  And among this, we had five programs: biological and medical sciences where there were medical doctors on staff; social sciences; arts and humanities; agricultural sciences; and there was another one.  So I was a broad-based--excuse me [cough]--broad-based generalist.  You know, I knew a little bat--little bit about a lot of things.  And--but I was sort of kind of champing at the bit.  I wanted the broader experience.  And I'm still getting notices from special libraries, and I happened to get notice that Carnegie Endowment was looking for a librarian, and I knew the librarian over there very well from Interlibrary loan.  So I thought--one of the qualifications was you had to have a reading knowledge of French and be able to speak a little French.  So I thought, well, this'll be a chance for me to, to get back in the French groove a little bit.  I'm not bilingual, but at one time I was pretty, pretty good, you know.  So I applied for--[cough]--excuse me--I applied for it and got the job.  And we were in the Carnegie Endowment building at 46th Street and 1st Avenue.  And in that building were all international organizations.  And this specialized library and international organization, international organizations was open to all of those international organizations in that building.  Also, we had NGO, non-government organization status with the United Nations.  We were diagonally across the street from the United Nations.  And I had privileged access to the United Nations' library, in that I could go behind the stacks.  I knew all of my counterparts over there.  The only other library in the city that had access to the United Nations library was New York Public Library on a formal arrangement that they had with them.  But their staff members, as, as far as I know, never went behind the stacks or anything like that.  But I, I, I had that kind of ac--access.

Speaker 1: Rockefeller Foundation was--let's see, was it grant-making foundation?  Carnegie Endowment was an operating foundation.  They could accept grants from other foundations.  Dean Rusk was very visionary.  And African countries, developing countries were becoming independent.  This was 19--the 1960s.  And in 1960 Rockefeller Foundation had already sent men to Africa for exploration.  I went to Carnegie Endowment in 1963.  Rockefeller Foundation had already instituted a couple of years earlier by giving to Carnegie Endowment to administer the program called Programs in the Diplomacy, whereby potential diplomats from developing countries would come here to the United States for a year of training at Columbia University [New York City, New York] and the United Nations, the English-speaking ones.  The French-speaking ones would go to our office in Geneva, Switzerland, to train for a year at the Institut de Hautes Etudes.  And that program, financed by the Rockefeller Foundation for 10 years to the tune of a million dollars, operated for, for 10 years.  And those young men and women coming from these developing countries, from Ghana, from Nigeria, from Botswana, from Lesotho, from all of these countries, from Zaire, would be as green as grass, you know.  But with, within a year's time they would--they, they really were finished, were, were--became quite polished.  In many of these countries they didn't have very sophisticated libraries, you know.  Columbia University overwhelmed them.  Our library was open stacks and specific, and they felt very comfortable.  And I gave them personalized attention, and they used it.  So over a period of 10 years I got to know many, many of the, of the diplomats from these countries.  And when they would go back to their country after a year of training here, they would be posted to the United Nations or to another country.  So, as a result, whenever my husband [John Hewitt] and I traveled abroad, whatever country we were in, there would be a Carnegie fellow, and we would know them.  On Kenya, we--in, in, in Hungary, in the Philippines we would meet a Carnegie fellow, so it was very, very nice.  And we--I always worked with a very, very high academic--in an academic (unclear) because these were men and women who were doctorate, doctoral candidates, you know.  And for many, many years they would say that Carnegie Endowment and the Council on Foreign Relations were the, the refugees--refuge--were, were, were--housed the, the party and who was out of power--there was other state department.  So I would meet all of these people at some level, not intimately, you know, or, or do service for them.

Speaker 1: I met and got to know him rather well, Brian Urquhart, Sir Brian Urquhart, who was deputy to, to Ralph Bunche.  'Cause his book was written on, on Dag Hammarskjold, was written up in one of the carrels in my library.  And his secretary come--he would come on his lunch hour and dictate broadly, and she would write, and then we would use our references to verify things that he had said.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) wrote a book on, about Hammarskjold.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He died in the Congo--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Secretary General--
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: --in a plane crash, a mysterious plane crash.  Did you ever discuss the mystery of Hammarskjold's death?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: No.  And one of our, our fellows in residence, one of our academics in residence was Sir Robert Rhodes James, who was a member of--who later became a member of Parliament, and who was the official biographer for Winston Churchill.  He was very nice, got to know him very well.  And I, I met a lot of these people.  The only one I didn't meet was Henry Kissinger, and I didn't care for him, and that was no great loss.
Story_ID: 89842
Speaker 1: Then, then when our office closed, when the trustees decided to close the, the New York office and consolidate everything in Washington, D.C., I accepted early retirement.  But we had an office in, in Geneva, Switzerland, and I went over several times to advise and to consult with our library there, with our little library there.  And then, then Mr. Johnson, who was president when I became librarian, asked if I would do a consulting job for the Atlantic Council in Paris [France].  And I did a consulting job for them in Paris.  And what else did I do?
Speaker 2: Now, now, now when did you retire from--
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: --Carnegie Foundation [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace].
Speaker 1: --eighty-three [1983].  And then I stayed home for a year because my husband [John Hewitt] was recovering from a near fatal surgery, and my sister-in-law was terminal in cancer, so I stayed home for a year to help out.  And then I never had to look for a job because friends would call.  And a friend called and said, would you do this job?  And, and I said I don't--you know.  Only you can do it.  It was a consulting job at Katharine Gibbs School.  It was completely out of my line, you know, and everything, but was fun, and I stayed there for two years.  After I did the consulting, they asked if I would stay on and implement what I had consulted, so I stayed for two years.  And I was working with the faculty and, and developing their audio-visual library.  This was the top secretarial school in New York City.  And they had secretarial schools up and down the East Coast, but this was--if you were a Katharine Gibbs graduate, you know, that was--most of the, the graduates from Katharine Gibbs were college graduates and took their secretarial work and everything.  It was really top drawer, and I was there still at the tail end of when they were still top drawer, you know.  So I, I developed--got them geared up for their reaccreditation by this business school assessments, you know.  And, and I worked with the faculty, and we got management films and things like that.  So it was interesting.  And then, then I said ah, I don't, I don't wanna work anymore, so I came home.  Then I got an SOS from the Council on Foreign Relations--you can work as many hours as you want, whatever days you want.  So, so I worked 20 hours a week at the Council on Foreign Relations, and that was very interesting.  Now they do refer to that as the other state department, you know, so that is the really, really, really shakers and movers of the United States government who belonged to that.  So was on the, on the staff there for two and a half years part time.  It was nice.
Story_ID: 89843
Speaker 1: Now how did you, you develop that collection.  I mean how, how long did it take to develop this--
Speaker 2: What collection?
Speaker 1: The Hewitt Collection, the art collection.
Speaker 2: When we married, 1949, when we bought those good prints.  And then we came to New York, and my sister-in-law [Adele Glasgow] had the gallery, the Marketplace Gallery on 7th Avenue and 135th Street.  And she knew--she worked at the Amsterdam News.  And she was a cultural intellectual.  She knew everybody who was somebody.  She gave Paul Robeson's 65th birthday party at, at the family house.  And the, the, those Amsterdam News" people were like the Pittsburgh Courier" people, you know.  And Adele had this art gallery, and she knew--introduced us to Ernie Crichlow [Ernest Crichlow] and other people.  And the--so, then I segued into a, a post--you know, another career as a library--as a, as an art person.  I, I'm out of the library loop now, out of the library loop.  But I have to go back to tell you a little bit more about the library work before we leave that.  Since I had decided to become a special librarian, and I guess there is a sort of a missionary feeling in my life that, that I feel that I must make inroads for other people to follow me.  I feel very strongly about that.  I've never been satisfied being the first and the only and having that record stand. I, I want--have always wanted to pave the way for others.  And so I became active in Special Libraries Association [SLA].  And you become active at the tract--chapter level, and New York had the largest chapter in the United States.  And, and I, I took on jobs as program chairman this and this, and, and I advanced and got to be known.  And then, as my son [John Hewitt, III] got older and, and less dependent on me, that freed me up for making meetings, things like that.  So I was encouraged by the chief librarian, Kirk Cabeen, at the Engineering Societies to become president of the New York chapter.  And so I became president of the New York chapter and then was active in the going to conventions.  And always on my jobs, built into it was the perk of going to conventions.  So I went to the conventions and got to know special librarians all over the country.  And they're not many black librarians throughout the United States in special libraries.  And they're more now than there, there were.  The first conference I went to was 1958 in Boston [Massachusetts].  There were five of us there: one, an [U.S.] Army librarian, Dayton, Ohio-Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio; Johnson Publications librarian; one from a library in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I don't know whether it was a U.S. Forest Library or not.  I think it was--myself and another from a medical school library, five you know.  So we made it our business to try to, at the chapter level, grassroots level, to encourage other librarians to transfer from public or a school library to go into special libraries work and build up.  So gradually, and I don't wanna just be a member of anything.  I want to always position myself to be in a policymaking position, very quiet about it.  I, I like to work behind the scenes too.  But anyhow, I encouraged others to join, got to know more librarians across the United States, got to be known throughout.
Story_ID: 89844
Speaker 1: And then if you become president of the New York chapter, that put you in a good position to be elected a national president.  The year I ran for national president, the next strongest chapter was California.  And the chief librarian from Hewlett-Packard was, was running against me, and I lost by eight votes.  And the most disappointed person was my husband [John Hewitt].  I thought it was a cliffhanger 'cause the (unclear) would tell me they were going crazy counting, you know, and I lost by eight votes.  And I said that's all right.  I wouldn't be comfortable being national president of an organization with a margin of only eight.  I want a definite margin, so I wouldn't run the, the next two times.  But the next time I ran, I won by a very, very wide, wide margin and became national president when we were having our first international meeting, over which I presided in Hawaii.  But I had a tumultuous year.  I was incoming president.  And as incoming president, you make chapter visits throughout the United States and Canada.  And also the executive director at that time was very much in my corner.  He very much wanted me to be president.  And he had appointed me as the representative for the whole association to the International Federation of Libraries and Associations [International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, IFLA], which met yearly, mostly in Europe.  So, I was, was active in that and tried to encourage and persuade other librarians to become active on an international basis.  We were just beginning, we were just beginning to get internationally minded in this, in the early '70s [1970s], okay.  So for 10 years I represented the Special Libraries Association [SLA] at IFLA at these meetings.  And then I was also representative to the United Nations for the association for a while.  Then they asked me to represent the association at the first conference on information, White House confirmation on information, and that was in the early '60's [1960s].  So I, I operated at the national and international level, and it, it was--my year as national president was--would--was very, very frustrating, in that I had a divided board; half of them were with me, and half of them were against me.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 89845
Speaker 1: And just that spring of '78 [1978] we--with the executive director [Frank McKenna] and I had been to IFLA [International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions] in (unclear) in the High Tatras in Czechoslovakia.  And he was very obese and not very well.  And one of the things that I was going to do was to insist that he take all of his vacation, all of his accumulated vacation, and let the assistant executive operate.  I was going to insist that he check himself into Duke University Hospital and lose about 150 pounds.  I was going to insist that he take elective surgery and get it over with and then come back, you know.  And I, I was adamant on that, but I was doing the chapter visit in Atlanta, Georgia, and I got a phone call--message button ringing--this is Richard Griffin.  And I had a student whose name was Richard Griffin, and I thought it was my Atlanta student calling.  No, it was the assistant director.  Vivian, I have bad news for you.  Frank was found dead this morning.  So I went to my meeting that night, didn't tell anybody.  And I, I was to stay over with Virginia, the, the--Jones, the dean of the library school.  And I said I have to fly back in the morning.  It's an emergency.  And I called two people in New York from the New York chapter whom I trusted very much.  And, and confidentially I said meet me at the office at 10:00, and, and--'cause Frank died intestate.
Story_ID: 91445
Speaker 1: Where were we?
Speaker 2: From the death of--
Speaker 1: Oh, Frank [McKenna]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Frank died.  So, my two friends, whom I trusted, met me at the office.  And, and I had to notify his next of kin.  Now, he is--when I was president, he insisted that he know whom to notify, you know, and all, all the information, emergency information about me.  I regret--we were sitting at--having beer at, at an outdoor place in, in Amsterdam, Holland.  And while he was asking me for my information, it was very unlike me not to ask him for his information, but I didn't because he was a very secretive, very private person.  So, no one knew anything about his business or anything.  And I had to sit there, and fortunately he had his bank books in his desk.  And as president of the organization, I went through them and I found the name of his cousin in Santa Fe, New Mexico, called, sent for him to come, but also authorized Ron Copland (ph.), who was then president of the New York chapter, to go to his apartment and see what was what.  Because, you know, in New York the cops go in and they help themselves, you know, first of all and everything.  And then Jean, Jean Doyce (ph.) had managed the funeral for another friend of ours who died alone, so I asked her to help with the funeral arrangements.  So the three of us did until his cousin came, and I delivered the eulogy.  I didn't know that he was Roman Catholic until he died.  So I, I asked the priest if I could, could deliver the, the eulogy, and he--the priest didn't know, and so he said yes.  And so the men from the office were the pallbearers, and it, it was at a very historic Catholic church, you know.  And at the time another national organization was meeting here.  But Frank was a controversial executive director.  And anytime you're executive director or president of a membership organization, you have controversy or people who like you or don't like you or anything like that.  But I happened to like him very well, and I understood him.  And he suffered fools.  You know, he, he was a brilliant guy, and he had no patience with, with (unclear)--dummies or dumber people.  And people liked--there, there were some people who--I was determined that no one was going to malign him.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION BY MALE VOICE):  Excuse me.
Speaker 1: I was insistent that no one was going to malign him, either in life or death.  He was a closet gay, but he was very--and, and my feeling towards gays or lesbians is, as long as they perform their work and do their job well, their private life, as so long as it doesn't interfere with their job performance, has no business intruding on that.  And that, that was how I felt.  But I wanted to honor him for all of the substantive work that he had done for the organization.  So I sat here in my kitchen at the kitchen table the night before his funeral and wrote the eulogy and insisted that it be published in full in our special libraries magazine so that everybody throughout the United States, and Canada, and Europe could read it and read what I had to say about him.
Story_ID: 91446
Speaker 1: Then I had to appoint a search committee, and I appointed a top drawer search committee.  And I, I want to tell you, I was being wined and dined by people because that was a plum job, you know, for, for librarians to aspire to.  And I appointed a good search committee, and they brought me in a short list, two people we interviewed, one person in the morning.  And I was kind of shaken.  I said the person who interviews in the afternoon has to go some to, to beat this one.  But the--I, I was very fortunate in, in being influential and very pivotal in tipping the scale to hire David Bender as executive director, and that, I consider, was my legacy to Special Libraries Association [SLA] because he stayed 21 years in the job.  And he brought us from a nondescript organization into a first class, the second largest information organization in the United States, second to American Library Association [ALA].  We bought our own building in Washington, D.C., got into publishing, just top drawer, just top drawer in every way; member increased; services to members increased.  So, I felt very proud of having hired him.  And yet there were some people who said, why'd you hire him?  He's a school librarian.  Well, heck, if you've trained as a librarian you can trans--make the transition from one discipline to another.  You can go to school, you know, and everything.  David was wonderful, wonderful.
Story_ID: 91447
Speaker 1: And I had a good time traveling and speaking to different chapters throughout the United States and Canada.  So it was--and I made my mark.  And then a couple of years later I was chairman of the nominating committee.  And I was determined, absolutely determined that there was going to be a black person succeed me or run or have a chance to become president.  And the person I wanted had been, been a manager-librarian for Xerox Corporation, then living in Hawaii, but couldn't for family reasons.  So then I got a very wonderful person from Rand Corporation in California who ran for office and became national president.  So since then, there have been--
Speaker 2: What was the person's name (unclear)?
Speaker 1: The person was Vivian Arterbery, from--where's she from--from Los Angeles [California].  Is, is Rand Corporation Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Los Angeles.  Vivian Arterbery, A-R-T-E-R-B-U-R-Y [sic, A-R-T-E-R-B-E-R-Y].  And then, then a few year later, another African-American woman, Emily Mobley, M-O-B-L-E-Y, became president, and then another year, Sylvia Pigott, P-I-G-I-O-T-T [sic, P-I-G-O-T-T], from Canada became president.  But there were, there were--at the same time, there were one or two African Americans on the board, which was the policymaking arm of the association [Special Libraries Association].  So I felt very proud of my stint and what I did and the encouragement that gave to others to become special librarians and to become active in the association.
Story_ID: 91448
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now is it time to talk about art (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, when I finished up the library world, my husband [John Hewitt]'s health be--began to deteriorate.  For the five, last five years of his life it wasn't--the quality of life wasn't very good.  And so we decided, even though we had wills, that we'd better do estate planning.  So we went to our lawyer, and we listed what the assets were, you know, and the art collection.  Our lawyer looked at it.  He said, what are you gonna do with this art?  And we said well, we'd like to keep it together, you know.  And, and he suggested that we keep it together, try to, to market it to an African American or, or to a small or medium-size museum or college museum or something.  So we had two brokers in the art world.  It was on the market five years, so it was pretty generally known that the Hewitt Collection was up for sale.  And then John began to get impatient because his health was deteriorating, and things weren't moving fast enough for him.  But having come from the foundation world and from where you deal with committees and boards and everything, the wheels rotate smoo--slowly, so I said just be patient.  But anyhow, the Bank of America, through the art world underground, heard about the Hewitt Collection.  It was Nations Bank then in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Hugh McColl, the visionary who has transformed Charlotte almost single-handedly had given in excess of seven million dollars to the Mint Museum [of Art] to transform Montaldo's [department school], which had been a very chic women's store in downtown Charlotte, to transform that store into the arts and crafts museum of the Mint Museum.  But in that museum there would be a ground floor gallery, Nations Bank Gallery, which would be free to the public.  And he, Mr. McColl, wanted the first exhibit to be African American.  The curator of American art at the Mint Museum knew about the Hewitt Collection.  And he and the president of the Bank of America Foundation, who happened to be Laura Fox, a black woman, flew up to New York to look it over.  They played it close to the vest.  They looked at all of it, and we had it listed, you know.  And Laura said to me, Mrs. Hewitt, when we move, we move fast.  They went back to Charlotte, and I got a call within a few days.  And she said, Mrs. Hewitt, we will take all of the paintings that you are offering for sale.  And their lawyers and our lawyers, and we agreed that we would not give the--we would not tell the sale, what the sale was.  They took it in total as a promised gift to the African-American Cultural Center [Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts + Culture] in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 91449
Speaker 1: In the meantime, while the African-American Cultural Center, which is housed in an A.M.E. Zion Church, raises money to build a wing to house it at--the Hewitt Collection as a permanent collection.  The Hewitt Collection is touring as a public relations venture as much as anything to Bank of America facilities.  They bought it in 1998, and that August it became--they merged with Bank of America, so it's Bank of America.  My husband [John Hewitt] was able to attend the opening of the Bank of America Gallery in Charlotte [North Carolina].  He wasn't well, but all of the--a number of the living artists attended, Al Hollingsworth [Alvin Hollingsworth], Dr. Eugene Grigsby [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, HM].  I forget who else.  They expected 200 people and 400 came.  Mr. [Hugh] McColl was there, and it was, it was just very exciting.  And, and the bank went all out.  I must say they went all out for posters, for, for the catalog--is scholarly top drawer.  A black company in Indianapolis, Indiana, did the catalog.  A young Ph.D. candidates in art history or young faculty members interviewed or did the--interviewed the living artists for the biographies that appear or did the research on the ones who were deceased.  And it's just been a huge success everywhere, and so successful has it been until it's gone into its second printing.  And the tour has been extended for two years.  It will travel till 2005, winding up I believe in San Francisco [California] at the new Museum of the African Diaspora, which is in downtown San Francisco, three floors of a five-star hotel.  So, and I have been invited to go to the bank's open reception in each city.  The first venue was Memphis, Tennessee, at the [National] Civil Rights Museum.  And one of the things that, that John and I wanted is to have these artists have exposure, broad-based exposure.  The icons are known, Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Henry Ossawa Tanner.  But we also collected mid-range artists who ran the ascendancy, James Denmark, Ann Tanksley, Virginia Smith, Jonathan Green [HM].  We wanted them to have exposure, and they're getting it coast to coast.
Speaker 2: Now the, the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, that's the Lorraine Motel?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, that was the first--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --venue.  And at the same time, there was a big football game that was taking place--
Speaker 2: Oh, the black college football?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they were expecting fifty to a hundred thousand people there.  And they were having the reception there, so those people would, would see the collection.  And also the Church of God in Christ headquarters are there, and they were having their annual convention there.
Speaker 2: That's huge.
Speaker 1: And they were expecting a hundred thousand people to see, so it's gotten very wide exposure.  And I think this is so satisfying to Hugh McColl, who is a visionary, and who, a Southern gentleman and a banking icon, right along with David Rockefeller or any--Charlotte is the second highest finan--largest financial region in the United States, second to New York City.  And he believes in diversity.  And it's been very satisfying to me to go to these various cities to see that you have a vice president, or a president, or this, women and blacks operating at every level.  He, he believes in this.
Story_ID: 91450
Speaker 1: Now where is the collection now?
Speaker 2: It just completed its tour in, at the Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.  And it's being packed, and it will open--I think it's scheduled to open mid-August in Asheville, North Carolina.  And I don't know the venues from there on, but I do know that Little Rock, Arkansas, wants it.  Phoenix, Arizona, wants it.  I don't know if it'll get to Detroit [Michigan].  It probably won't.  And--
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Chica--it's been to Chicago.  It was at the DuSable [Museum of African American History] in Chicago.  That was a very nice one.  It's been to Jacksonville, Florida, Naples, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, Howard University at Washington, D.C.; that was wonderful--St. Louis, Missouri.  I'm trying to think where else it's been.
Speaker 1: Well, it's been, been around.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Los Angeles, California.  It, it's been around.
Speaker 1: Do you have--
Speaker 2: Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale.
Story_ID: 91451
Speaker 1: Do you have--do you think--now this is a question that was asked a lot in the 1960s and '70s [1970s], but do you think there's some--there's such a thing as a black aesthetic in, in art?
Speaker 2: You know, my answer to that question is that these artists--there may be.  Some people may say yes, there is, but I don't.  I say that fine art and good art is good art no matter what, and in, in our collection, and in the Cosby Collection, and in the collection of the doctor and his wife, the Harmon Collection from San Antonio, Texas.  They're, they're wonderful artists, and its good art that can hold its own anywhere, but the artists just happened to be African American.  Now, some artists, some would say yes, there's a black aesthetic.
Speaker 1: Is there a purpose of putting them all in a collection?  I mean do they tell a particular story in their collective--
Speaker 2: Some people focus and want it.  Some focus and want it to, to tell--they're more social, socially-minded or more politically-oriented and things.  I wanted art that we could live with and that we felt comfortable with in our home.  And so, and I, I didn't realize it until it was all put together and being shown, that we concentrated mostly on families, on, on the stability of the family.  And, and artists were not our artists or boxed into one specific genre or one specific media.  They were abstract; expressionist; they were cubist; they were portraitist; they were realist, the whole spectrum of the art world--in media, different media, oil, acrylics, watercolor, collage.  It was art that we could live with in our home.  Now, I have some artist friends that I know who have done very powerful things, powerful.  And they impact on you, and you never forget them.  Benny Andrews' The Boxer, if you see that picture, you'll never, ever forget it.  It's a boxer who's hang--sitting in this chair, hanging over, his face all bloated.  And you know, it's, it's, it's the worst kind of beating that anyone could take, and it's kind of three-dimensional.  That is so powerful it belongs in a museum.  I wouldn't want to live with it in my home, but it's powerful.  Ernie Chrichlow [Ernest Chrichlow] has done some of the same things.  They're very powerful.  The little black girl like an angel with a rope around her neck and some golden slippers on--gives a message.  But--
Speaker 1: It's not the thing you want in your home.
Speaker 2: It's not the thing I want to live with, not the thing I want to live with.  Jonathan Green's [HM] things are so dignified and so wonderful.  He went back to his roots from, from the islands, the, the Sea Islands from South Carolina, the Gullah [Geechee] background.  And, and his paintings are full of joie de vivre, full of dignity, full of color.  That, that's what I like to live with.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do, do you have a favorite artist, mostly, artist?
Speaker 2: I like them all.  They're like your children.  Yeah, they're like your children.  You're not going to single out anyone.  Since I'm asked that question, I have a good answer for it.  Yes, I do have--they say do you have a favorite painting.  I said yes, I have four favorite paintings, none of which is in the collection.  They're hanging in my den, in my study, and in my bedroom.  Two are finger paints done by my son [John Hewitt, III] when he was in kindergarten.  One is a pastel when he was done in first grade, and one is a linoleum block print when he was in second grade, yes.

Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm of the generation where we were pioneers, and we paved the way for a lot of people, and I've seen a lot of progress being made.  And I, I hope that we can make more and just not tokenism.  I'm think I'm one of the few people who frankly admits that I think we're treadmill-ing, in my profession alone.  We're still the first African-American library and to head up a big city library--Carla Hayden at, at, in Baltimore [Maryland].  I mean, I hope we would get beyond that point.  The first African-American surgeon to head up this (unclear)--hospital, the first this, the first that.  And as long as you have to stick first in front of your name, I don't think we've made much progress, and it's miniscule comparatively speaking.  I, I think we--yes, I, I think we've made a lot of progress, but we've got a long, long way to go.  It won't happen in my lifetime, and it may not happen in this century, but I hope we would have an equal playing field.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, you alluded to it earlier, but what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  That I tried to be not conscientiously a role model, but tried to mentor young people to say yes, you can, and to, to develop a tough skin, a tough hide; and in, in face of adversity, to let it toughen you, and to say yes, I am going to succeed in spite of this.  And you can, you can.

Speaker 1: Okay, and finally, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, how would I like to be remembered?  Oh, oh, that's a hard one.  Oh, that I helped, tried to help other people, and tried to, to do the best that I could while on earth, and tried to make a contribution, no matter how small, to society, tried to be an example for some young people, hope, hope that I have influenced some, been some influence for the good on somebody.

Speaker 1: And as a librarian, what are your thoughts about the, the importance of a project like this that, that we're engaged in right now?
Speaker 2: The importance of what?
Speaker 1: Of the project that we're engaged in right now, in terms of interviewing you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's so important.  You, you--it, it's tremendously important.  I'm a great believer in oral history, and I'm remiss.  And I had given myself, I gave myself two years, through 1985, to number one, downsize this house, that is to sort through professional papers and things, to give--my professional papers or archives are on file at North Carolina Central University Graduate Library School in Durham, and I want to give--my husband [John Hewitt]'s are at the Schomburg.  And he died February 25th, 2000, and I'm just now emotionally and physically ready to, to deal with his things.  And I'm sending things to the Schomburg, where his papers are deposited.  And I'm sending some things to the Western Pennsylvania Historical Society because, simply because I was the first African-American librarian there, so I'm sending things there.  So I'm doing that.  I'm going through personal papers and things.  The hardest thing that I find is getting rid of books, hard copy books, you know, and furniture, but I'm managing to do that too gradually.  And what else?  What was the other question?  I, I rambled.
Speaker 1: No, that was just--I just asked you what you thought of this--
Speaker 2: Oh, of this--
Speaker 1: --project--
Speaker 2: --program.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's so--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, that brings me around--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --to I rambled around (unclear)--(unclear) to get around with this two-year time frame, delayed a couple of months because I fractured my, my wrist, but I'm all right now.  But my son [John Hewitt, III] is interested in family history.  And every time he comes up, he says, mom, tell me a story, like tell me a story.  And he just gets such a charge out of me telling him stories about what happened when I was a librarian or when I was traveling, and they're wonderful stories.  So I had promised that I am going to do it the old-fashioned way or the new way.  I haven't come (unclear).  I have, on my computer I have the, the voice recognition thing, but I had to do some more practicing on that.  But I said, you know, I think I'm gonna just tape record, you know.  And I think when I go on vacation my plans are I plan to spend a couple of weeks in Barbados and reading, and maybe taking some tapes and just talking into the tape, sitting on the beach under an umbrella, talking into a tape, and taping, taping, taping, and then have it transcribed.

That picture was taken by [Charles] "Teenie" Harris, who was the official photographer for the Pittsburgh Courier, and who was known as Teenie "One-Shot" Harris.  He did all of the wedding pictures and all the weddings, and all the social events in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and vicinity.

Speaker 2: You know, I don't really know.  Oh, that top picture is another one of Teenie "One-Shot" Harris's pictures.  That's me throwing my wedding bouquet to, to the girls who were in my wedding December 26th, 1949.
Speaker 1: They're all trying to catch it; they're all ready.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Women get ruthless over catching the bouquet.
Speaker 2: The right. That is me as a baby, and I guess I'm about six months old.
Speaker 1: And the middle one is our son [John Hewitt, III] when he was about two months old maybe, maybe that not old.
Speaker 2: And then the third one is my husband when he was about six months old.  All the babies look alike.  We all look alike.  I think we're very lucky to have pictures like that.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  It's good y'all were cute too.
Speaker 2: That--I, I'm with a couple of Chinese colleagues when I'm in China, 1980.
Speaker 1: --husband and I liked to travel a lot, and we are in Greece, and that was about 1986 I guess.
Speaker 2: --in my office.  My office was a corner office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza on the 55th floor--very good about giving me ethnic jewelry, so.

Speaker 1: And a different hairdo--that was taken in my office, certainly in the summertime.  And I think that was about 1963, 60 [1960]--
Speaker 2: A different hairdo--19, about 1965, '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: That's a picture that was taken in the, in the, about 1989 or so at the Schomburg Center [for Research in Black Culture].  And that's with Dorothy Porter, the famed librarian at the [Moorland-]Spingarn Collection at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Dorothy Porter Wesley, whom I've known for many--who I knew for many, many years.
Speaker 2: She's married to Charles Wesley.
Speaker 1: Yeah, married to Charles Wesley.
Speaker 2: And there again, I'm giving a, a lecture on art.  This was at an exhibit of our paintings at the Delta Arts Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  I guess that was sometimes in the '80s [1980s], in the mid-'80s.

Speaker 2: This is Hillary Clinton and my husband and me at the White House for the ceremony and reception given on the occasion of the unveiling the purchase of the first painting by an African American to be purchased for the White House, Henry Ossawa Tanner.  And I think that was 1980.

Speaker 2: They purchased a landscape.
Speaker 1: That was when I was in college.  That was my graduation picture 1943 from Geneva College [Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania].
