Jessica Wilkerson: This is Jessie Wilkerson, and I&#8217;m here with Marsha Uselton.  It&#8217;s May 22, 2010.  Marsha, can you just say your name and maybe your address?
Marsha Uselton: Hello, I&#8217;m Marsha, [speaking unclearly]
[Testing talk for the following two minutes]
JW: Okay.  So.  Let&#8217;s begin with your childhood.
MU: Okay.
JW: If you can tell me what that experience was like.
MU: Okay.  Well, I was born in Kentucky, and raised in Virginia, then we moved to Tennessee when I was in eighth grade.  My father was a minister, and my mother was a very, a traditional minister&#8217;s wife, and raised five children.  But she had--before she got married, she had majored in math and chemistry, and after she raised us, she went back to school at age sixty and got her masters and started a career.  Alright.
Okay.  So let&#8217;s see. I grew up in southern states, but my father was from the Pacific Northwest, so he didn&#8217;t have the Southern regional things you might think of.  And Mom was from Northern Kentucky.  So even though I grew up in the South, I didn&#8217;t have--I felt like they were very open-minded, educated, and very compassionate, rational, people.  Which is good.  And a little zany around the edges.
So when we moved to Nashville, I went to high school there, (and went to the prom with my husband, forty-five years ago this month).  Then I went back to Kentucky to go to college, where Brenda had gone, and he went to another college, and we married after college.  But&#8212;
JW: So you went to Berea?
MU: Transylvania College, in Lexington.  It&#8217;s where my parents had gone to school.  They later moved back to Lexington.  But they lived in Nashville.
While we were at Transy, Bren had an African American roommate.  She came down to visit and it was kind of a little trauma, because [Lula] came to church and the church, in 1966, almost split.  It seems ludicrous now, but to have a friend come to church and stay in our home, who&#8217;s African American, was very catastrophic for some people in the church [and community].
I have heard some people say that [someone] burned a cross in [our] yard; Mom and Dad have vowed they didn&#8217;t.  But they did call.  Someone called and said they would throw acid in our eyes.  So that&#8217;s [fourty-four] years ago.  During those years, the late [19]60s, we were beginning to think through what things were wrong with society, and that being one of the very foremost ones.  There was ferment going on, even though Transy was a little isolated island; it wasn&#8217;t nearly as forward-thinking as Berkeley [University of CA] and the Northeast.
During those times, I do remember I majored in history and political science.  But I wanted to be a teacher.  [I was] in classes with all guys who were going to be lawyers, and I was very proud of the fact that they wanted to borrow my notes.  So I signed up to take the LSAT, just to show them that I could make a better score than they could.  My professor looked at the list when it came back to him, and he said, &#8220;Miss Bell, I&#8217;ve never heard of a woman lawyer.&#8221;  It&#8217;s true.  1969.  And what did I know?  So I erased my name; I didn&#8217;t want to be a lawyer anyway, I just wanted to take the test.
In high school I&#8217;d had to go home sick when I had to debate one day; I just physically got ill.  I couldn&#8217;t stand up and debate somebody in public.  So I knew being a lawyer was not a good idea for me.  I look back on that now, and it&#8217;s like, oh my gosh, how could he possibly say that?  But it didn&#8217;t bother me at the time.
I finished school and was getting married, and I remember it was very--.  I wanted to wear something blue, somewhere on my white wedding gown.  That was how daring I was. [Laughter] [And I even let Mom talk me out of that.]  So I was not real daring back then, obviously.
But within the next few years, Brenda, my sister, was more politically involved.  And her friends became my friends, and so I joined a consciousness-raising group, and Lucy [Henighan] was in that. We would sit around and talk and sew at the same time.  So it was a combination of a feminine activity and a feminist endeavor.
I do remember, maybe two weeks after I got married, I said to my husband: &#8220;I&#8217;m not ironing your shirts.  You know, we both are working full time, and we&#8217;re splitting this housework down the middle.&#8221;  So through the next few years, I remember having a household contract I had him sign.  That I was doing half, and he was doing half.  And then I would do--I don&#8217;t even remember now, I don&#8217;t think I ever changed oil--but I tried to do some &#8220;manly&#8221; things, in exchange for him doing housework.
I got my masters at Peabody, and became a teacher.  We moved to Memphis, and he got his masters then after mine.  We had a child in Memphis, a little boy [Nathan], and I remember thinking I&#8217;m going to raise him without gender roles; he&#8217;s going to be--.  So I do remember that my consciousness had been raised.  I remember his first stocking had pink on it, [not just blue].
From the word go, I was trying to raise my children and live my life in a way that was non-[oriented], that was different from the traditional way I had been raised.  Meanwhile, through those years, I remember Mom, when we&#8217;d go visit, had a new poster on her wall in the kitchen that said: &#8220;You can fly, but that cocoon has got to go.&#8221;  It was a picture of a butterfly.  So Mom was beginning to think about spreading her wings too.  She had gone back to school.  And now she&#8217;s a world-renowned leader in Alzheimer&#8217;s care.  She&#8217;s gone all over the world and trained people in [her program].  So that&#8217;s exciting, to see our mom venture out of staying at home and raising five kids, to doing that.
JW: What do you think inspired your mom to do that?  Do you remember that process of her doing it, or was it just something that one day she seemed to be doing?
MU: Well I think she had--.  Mom is a go-getter from the word go.  And even though she was doing traditional things&#8212;being a minister&#8217;s wife and raising kids&#8212;she had a lot of oomph.  When the last one was going to med school, she just decided she was going to go back to school, too.  I think it was to fill some empty hours, and the fact that she had--.  I think she was realizing that, probably from Brenda and me, that she&#8217;d been playing second fiddle to Dad all these years, and been the wind beneath his wings, and now it was going to be her turn.
JW: Do you remember having conversations with her about what you (12:00) were learning and doing?
MU: That&#8217;s a good question.  I think she was aware. Yeah, I&#8217;m sure we did but I can&#8217;t remember specifically.  She was supportive of things and listened.  And Dad was supportive.  I remember realizing that in conversation with Dad, that he was not threatened by women achieving.  As the years went by, (he was a minister) he became head of a seminary.  And more and more women were going to seminary.  I remember through those years him being supportive and not threatened by either Mom or us.  Or the women in the seminary.  So it was a neat thing, I thought.
Let&#8217;s see, you wanted to focus a little bit on the years when I was in Nashville before we moved to Memphis.  Alright, we--Terry, you know, when we married--lived close to Peabody and Scarritt and Vanderbilt, right there.  And [Motive Magazine] was in that same block.
JW: Ohh.
MU: Okay?  Bren would come, and she worked there for a while, and we would meet her friends. And it was all right in there together, and the Vanderbilt Divinity House was there.  So it was a fun couple of years that we lived right close.  And then they lived in the 22nd [Ave.] House, in a communal kind of thing.
Also Terry&#8217;s father was Assistant Chief of Police at that time.  And this was right before we got married.  We had taken Terry&#8217;s father&#8217;s car to a community meeting in that area.  His father then gave us a call and said, &#8220;Why did you have my car at that communist meeting?&#8221; [Laughter] I remember that.  So I guess we were doing some political things, but I can&#8217;t even remember what that meeting was about.
JW: Obviously a revolution.  [Laughter]
MU: Revolution!  I think it had to do with (14:44) Vanderbilt overtaking some houses in the neighborhood [Laughter]; it didn&#8217;t have a thing to do with communism.
Alright.  So as I say, I was tangential to Bren and her friends that lived in that house, and just was kind of the sister who was beginning to become politicized.  But they were the real carriers of the torch.  Alright, so then we moved to Memphis for [six years].
JW: [Interruption]
MU: Yeah, yeah.
JW: Can I first ask you about the meeting?
MU: Yeah.  Okay.
JW: The consciousness-raising group?  Can you describe what those were like, or tell me what you remember about them?
MU: Yeah.  That&#8217;s a lot of years ago, but I do remember there was one person there who was Jewish, from New York.  I remember her saying that her husband left her right after she delivered twins.  And we all got up and gave her a hug.  And that was the first time I really had hugged anybody. Isn&#8217;t that funny now?  I mean I hug everybody.  But it was like we were talking about marital relationships in public, I mean in this group.  All the way through college, you just didn&#8217;t.  I don&#8217;t know.  It was a new level, and it sounds funny now because people do it all the time, of course.  To go give her a hug of support, that was the first time we&#8217;d ever done that.
JW: It sounds like a powerful moment.
MU: It was, it was.  And of course now, we would all form a posse and go after him.  [Laughter]
JW: [Laughter]
MU: And whether we read books, or just talked about--.  I do remember we were all doing a little handwork as we talked about what it was like to become empowered a little bit.
JW: So you and Terry were married already, by that point?
MU: Mmm-hmm.
JW: Did he know you were going, and--.
MU: I just remembered something else.  And yeah, he was fine.  Bren and I were taking women&#8217;s self defense about that time, to become more empowered.  And [Terry] would hide behind a pillow when I&#8217;d come home, because I wanted to practice on him.  So no, he was, he was supportive.  He came from a very traditional Southern family, Freewill Baptist.  His dad did the barbeque, but nothing else around the house.
But his mom had played women&#8217;s basketball, and she won the--what do you call it, the rolling pin toss?  And she did bowling.  She was active, and so kind of a role model.  She wasn&#8217;t subservient to her husband, in other words.  So [Terry] was prepared for me to do whatever I was going to do, and he still is.  He&#8217;s pretty tolerant of what I do.  And you see my tradition, even though Mom did these traditional things, she was the disciplinarian of us.  She could say &#8220;You see this hand?&#8221; And we all shaped up.  Dad was off doing his thing, being a minister, but she ran the household, and paid the bills and [managed] the big half-acre garden and everything.  Terry and I both came from strong mothers.
JW: And you said you were trying to do some things that were more masculine, or--and you&#8217;re the second person I&#8217;ve heard say that, and I wonder what your thinking was with that, and was it a conscious thing to go out and do--.
MU: It was, it was--.
JW: (19:58) sort of painting house or something.
MU: It was. If I&#8217;m going to ask him to do housework, then I need to be prepared to do some manly things.  I don&#8217;t think I ever changed the oil, but that was one of the things that I remembered that I was going to learn to do. (I did rewire a lamp, I recall, and Terry gave me my own took kit.)
But when we&#8217;d take a trip, for example, Dad always did the driving.  Mom never did the driving.  But when Terry and I started going out West, I&#8217;d learned to drive the stick shift. That was a neat, empowering thing for me to do.  We had a VW Bus, and we would go out West about every summer.  I&#8217;d make a point of trying to drive close to as much as he did.  He did the overnight time.
It was our &#8220;hippiedom,&#8221; you know, the early seventies.  So I would wear a bra when I&#8217;d go to work, but I would take it off when I got home.  You know, jeans and long hair, and just a relaxed view of life.  And with the idea that the males and females in our group were all equal, and not doing role-ish things.  A lot of my friends through this period were going back to school and becoming lawyers.  Going back to school and becoming engineers.  And I have said over the years, I&#8217;m kind of the vestige of the last teaching generation.  That wanted to teach and stayed there.  But at the same time, when I grew up there wasn&#8217;t much of a choice.
I remember when we were leaving sixth grade, my teacher wrote in my little autograph book: &#8220;To Marsha Bell, now who can tell, whether she&#8217;ll teach, or nurse, or just keep house well.&#8221; That was kind of the parameters that--.  That was my little mindset growing up.  There I am in a little organza dress--we&#8217;d wear our little organza dresses and sit, with our little white gloves, and sit in the pew, and it was very--.  I guess it&#8217;s hard for your generation to think what it would be like to be told you can teach, or nurse, or keep house well.  Or I guess you could be a secretary, but that was about it.
I remember there was a riddle.  I was in my twenties when somebody told this riddle at a party, but we could not get it.  But it had to do with a son whose father died, and then the surgeon said, &#8220;That was my son,&#8221; and we couldn&#8217;t figure out how the surgeon could say that&#8217;s my son when the father had died. The answer was [the surgeon] was his mother!  [Pause] That doesn&#8217;t make sense, because I don&#8217;t remember the whole riddle.
JW: [Laughter]
MU: There&#8217;s an airplane crash, something like that, and the son survived, and the surgeon said that&#8217;s my son, but the son&#8217;s father had died.  Anyway, we couldn&#8217;t get it, because to think that a woman could be a surgeon just didn&#8217;t compute in our minds.  Does that make sense?
JW: Yeah.
MU: Okay.  That was after I was in my twenties.  So that all changed, from the time in [19]69 when the professor said--that was in Kentucky, and that was an elderly professor: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of a woman lawyer.&#8221; And by the mid-seventies, lots of women in my generation--not lots, but some--were saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going out of the traditional female box and [start] another kind of career.&#8221;  I always wanted to be a teacher, so I stayed in that box.  But I think a big part of what I&#8217;ve done is empower students (of course half of them being females) with visual impairments.  That&#8217;s been my niche, to empower them to be all they can be.
JW: How did that affect how you raised your children?  You have two children?
MU: Two.  A boy and a girl, and I tried to get him--. I remember being totally nonplussed, that even though I didn&#8217;t stress boy things, anything with wheels he just had to have, had to play with.  And he could make a gun out of a stick.  I&#8217;m going &#8220;Oh my gosh.&#8221; [Laughter]
And my daughter, from the word go, I was empowering her.  To be whatever, and there&#8217;s a little song I would sing to them.  Which I won&#8217;t sing, but it&#8217;s--.  I made up a song, and every night I&#8217;d play it on their piano on their back and it had to do with &#8220;you can be anything.&#8221;
JW: Can you say the lyrics?  I would love it if you could sing it, but I understand if you don&#8217;t want to.
MU: Okay.  My husband&#8217;s coming in the driveway.
[Singing] &#8220;Elizabeth Kendall Uselton, what do you hope to be?&#8221; And then I&#8217;d just rattle off &#8220;a doctor, a lawyer, a candlestick maker, or maybe a bumblebee.&#8221; And you know, every time I&#8217;d sing it I&#8217;d think of different things, just to give her--. [crying]
JW: [Laughter] No, it&#8217;s lovely!
MU: But it was to give her, they both had to hear what the world has open to them.
JW: And it&#8217;s so similar to the rhyme your teacher gave you.
MU: [Sniffling] Mmm-hmm.
JW: Giving them more options.
MU: Right, yeah, I never thought about that, yeah.  Anyway, so.  [Laughter] I don't know why.  [Sniffling]
JW: Those are powerful memories.
MU: Hmm?
JW: Those are powerful memories.
MU: Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.  Let&#8217;s take a break.  [Laughter]
[Break in interview]

JW: Okay.  So we&#8217;re back.
MU: Okay.  Yeah, we had a little diversion of catching up on family.
JW: Yes.
MU: So I was just saying, and I want to read it into the record, that my two sisters have been very empowered.  In different ways.  Laura was a sheepherder; we left her on a mountain top.  She joined that world of men, and she lived by herself in a sheep wagon with a shotgun and a dog and twenty-two hundred sheep. And would be out on her own for a week at a time without seeing anybody.  So that&#8217;s pretty unusual.
JW: Empowering.
MU: Empowering, yes.  So we&#8217;d leave her, and she could build a corral by herself. So she&#8217;s very strong physically.
JW: Do you want to say something about your relationship with your sisters?
MU: Oh, okay.  Well, Brenda, my older sister, who was really the--.  She&#8217;s been a political activist for as long as I can remember, and we shared a bedroom.  We were just two years apart.  So we were closer, and Laura was seven years younger than I was.  Brenda and I were really closer in age and proximity, because we were in the same bedroom.  But we had very different personalities.  She would wear Dungarees when she was little, and I wanted to wear jewelry.  [Laughter] She would say I was the girlie-girl.  We have different takes on life.  We&#8217;ve been close in a way that I think is one reason that we moved from Memphis.  We also had friends moving here, but it was to join this community of liberal folks that were here.
JW: And before we get to the Highlander and (29:15) and those folks, I wanted to ask you a little more about what you remember about the civil rights movement.  Because you mentioned that very important experience in your life about Brenda bringing her friend--.
MU: Mmm-hmm.  Lula.  Who now has her Ph.D in psychology and is this wonderfully educated person, that to think of people being upset by that totally blows anybody&#8217;s mind.  That same spring break, meanwhile, I had two friends who were from Japan that came by to pick us up in their car, so we had two Caucasians, two Asians, and an African American going back to school, and we just thought we were cutting edge, buddy.  You know, &#8220;Look at us, we&#8217;re diverse.&#8221; [Laughter]
JW: Well you were!
MU: And we were.  So that was the spring of my freshman year, and then by my senior year, Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated, and Chicago Democratic Convention and then that summer [of 1968] things were just exploding. And it was a very scary, unsettling time.  As a [junior] in a political science seminar, we were to go door to door; it was an election year, and we had a questionnaire to ask people who were they voting for.  I remember one lady said, &#8220;Well I was gonna vote for Bobby Kennedy, but since he was killed I&#8217;m gonna vote for--&#8221;  Oh, what was his name?  From Georgia, that was the flip-opposite, total racist--.
JW: Wallace?
MU: Yes.  George Wallace.
JW: What?
MU: Yeah, and we were going &#8220;Okay?&#8221;  I just remember that little vignette of that spring, doing that going door to door, asking about the election.  Then [in 1969 Terry and I] got married, like the week after Woodstock.  And that wasn&#8217;t even on my radar screen. And [the astronauts] walked on the moon.  I was enmeshed in wedding stuff that summer and being in love.
But in those early years of the seventies, there were, well--.  I&#8217;m trying to think.  In Nashville, I don&#8217;t really remember race coming up.
But when we moved to Memphis in [19]72, I asked for an inner-city school.  I had tutored in college--a little African American boy.  We had Taylortown Tutors, it&#8217;s coming back to me.  I would walk about a mile back into the projects and tutor this cute little guy.  So when we moved to Memphis, I thought I would really like to do that and be an inner-city teacher.  And what they said was &#8220;That&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got, inner-city, in Memphis.&#8221;
That was Memphis in &#8217;72, four years after Martin Luther King was killed there.  I remember feeling more comfortable in the black community than I did with the white racists, in Memphis.  We lived in Midtown Memphis, [among] older neighbors, and they were just racist.  So I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable with the white people that I knew there, and felt more comfortable with my black kids and teachers.
Had rocks thrown through the window of my class the first day I taught.  And I don&#8217;t really remember being frightened from that; I was puzzled about who would throw rocks.  I still don&#8217;t know whether it was my kids that--.  It was after school.  I don't know, but I loved my little kids down there.  I had &#8220;slow learners.&#8221;  They were kids that were not catching on in the regular classrooms.  I didn&#8217;t know how to teach elementary school kids; that&#8217;s where they put me.  [I was certified in] high school history, and political science, and economics, and sociology.  But I had a great time with those kids.  They were alive.
So my experience with civil rights was being on the front line and teaching kids that nobody else had much success teaching.  So I&#8217;d make materials; I had one class, nine desks, nine kids.  Period.  No materials.  Every night for three hours, I&#8217;d be making games and materials.
JW: Why weren&#8217;t there any materials?
MU: They showed me the book room.  Well, they showed me a list of books and said &#8220;Which books do you want?&#8221; and it didn&#8217;t--.  I did get some readers, but this was inner-city, there weren&#8217;t.
JW: So the schools were segregated?
MU: That&#8217;s a very good question.  There&#8217;re miles and miles and miles of very low-income black neighborhoods, at least at that time, thirty-some years ago.  But yeah, there were only African American kiddos in that school.  Several white teachers.  I still have artwork from those kiddos, and little cards [they made].  In fact one, Georgia Mae, stayed in touch with us for years, and actually came to visit after we moved here, and would send Christmas cards and call for many, many years.  Those were very alive, fun kiddos.  I enjoyed that.
JW: So you said that you felt more comfortable in the black community (36:30) with kids.
MU: Mmm-hmm.
JW: It was pretty clear that there were white racists around you.  Did you have a sense of what they felt about a white teacher going in and teaching black children?  Or how they felt about you in general?
MU: No, it was like these neighbors assumed that I was a racist, too.  That they could talk about oh how, you know--.  They would say things like, &#8220;These blacks think they want everything now.&#8221; And complaining about so much crime and stuff.  I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable being part of those kinds of conversations.  We did have other friends in school, who were mostly psych students, and we had some good parties.  We had young friends [who were] open-minded.
JW: So you moved to Knoxville from Memphis.
MU: Mmm-hmm.  Taught in Memphis six years--inner-city, and then moved into the Vision Program.  Moved out a little bit, and then became itinerant.  So I had an assortment of different kinds of teaching venues in Memphis, but then we moved.  I was days pregnant with Beth when I got the job [in East Tennessee].  Terry, meanwhile, had gotten his masters and student-taught at a black high school down there, Manassas. I think what had happened down there is that many of the whites on the edge of Memphis had gone to the county or had gone to private schools when there was integration.  So it was virtually [segregated].  The law was that it not be segregated.  But it virtually was.
I was days pregnant when I had the job, didn&#8217;t know I was pregnant when we moved here.  Polly [and Todd], and Bren, maybe Fran and Jim--a bunch of people--were helping us unload and move into an upstairs apartment.  I remember being really tired and laughing to Polly,&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m pregnant!&#8221; And she reminds me of that now, &#8220;How could you move on your job and be pregnant?&#8221;  So she thinks that was very empowering, but I didn&#8217;t know I was pregnant.  [Laughter]
So that year I taught and Terry found a job.  He actually helped build/renovate houses for a year, and then got a teaching job the next year.  But our [credit] was cut off.  We&#8217;d had a Visa in Memphis, and we moved here, and we couldn&#8217;t get a Visa here through the bank.  Because he didn&#8217;t have a job.  And I remember just--.
JW: Because you had a job.
MU: I&#8217;m a person, I have a job.  But couldn&#8217;t get that Visa [until he landed a job].
JW: And that was in the late seventies?
MU: That was in [19]78.  Since then, I&#8217;ve made a point of getting a credit card, building credit in my name.  So AAA&#8217;s in my name, credit cards are in my name.  He&#8217;s got his credit card in his name.  That was real important to me.  Now to this day, occasionally, we&#8217;ll get a--.  Like the phone bill for a long time had just his name on it, and we&#8217;d have to pay to get it put in both of our names.  I would really squawk.  It&#8217;s just important.  To be a person.
My grandmother, who taught and worked in an office, didn&#8217;t marry until she was almost thirty.  But once she married, she signed the check &#8220;Harry Marsh, by wife.&#8221; So she couldn&#8217;t sign a check with her name on it.  [She] never learned how to drive.  But she was a suffragist.  [She] worked for women&#8217;s right to vote, and [always] voted, even though she lived out in the country.  Voted every single election, through her whole life.  So we&#8217;ve got that kind of heritage.
JW: Yeah.
MU: Yeah.  I&#8217;m jumping around, but it&#8217;s fun to tell these old stories.  And then my grandfather Harry&#8217;s mom was a midwife, and had an organ [in her home] way out in the country.  They bought this house up on a hill, and they would tell the story that Sally, was her name, would take a yoke, and they hadn&#8217;t dug the well. So she would go down the hill with her yoke and get water twice a day, and carry those buckets up the hill.  So I don&#8217;t come from shrinking violets, really.  [Laughter]
JW: I don't know how long they lived, but did they live long enough to see you and your sisters achieve some of the things that you did?
MU: I remember my first job before I became a teacher.  After I married, that first year, I was with the historical society.  I was the assistant librarian.  I had this big office that was totally as big as this living room, if not bigger, with stained glass.  It wasn&#8217;t much income, but I had this wonderful office.  They took a picture of me for a newsletter, sitting at my desk [with] my hair up in a bun. My grandmother kept that [framed] on top of her piano, like &#8220;Look at this professional granddaughter I have.&#8221; That was fun.  They lived on a farm, but they put [six] girls through college.
JW: (43:51) your grandparents.
MU: Mmm-hmm.  My little grandmother.
JW: And your mother and her sister--.
MU: And her siblings through.  And the son, Jack, stayed out there and farmed.  But all [six] girls were valedictorian at the little rural--.  My grandmother had gone to nursing school.  So she was educated.  She wanted her girls to be educated, so they were all.  They&#8217;re hysterical. We [affectionately] call them the Q-Tips, [for their round white hair].  One taught nursing, one taught&#8212;of course, they&#8217;re all retired now--one taught nursing, one had a medical lab that she owned, one was a biology teacher, one was an English teacher, and one was an elementary school teacher.
JW: So did you have the sense that all of them were--?
MU: And Mom taught chemistry before she got married.  So they were all [professionals].
JW: And it was their mother who was the suffragist?
MU: Mmm-hmm.  And she went to nursing school.  She did drop out right before she finished, to marry my grandfather.  We&#8217;re thinking that was during World War One, to maybe keep him from getting drafted.  We don&#8217;t know why she would drop out right there at the end.  But she was close to thirty, and I don't know.  Maybe she just wanted to get married.  [Laughter]
JW: What school did they send the daughters to?
MU: Most went to Transylvania.  That&#8217;s where Mom and Dad met.
JW: Was it a women&#8217;s school?
MU: No, it was a small liberal arts college.  It was connected at that time with the Christian church.  Well, it&#8217;s still connected, but it wasn&#8217;t like a Bible school or anything like that.
JW: It&#8217;s incredible that they all went to college.
MU: Yeah.
JW: For the time.
MU: They are still a pretty amazing lot.  And we get together.  I should&#8217;ve brought that picture over there, like eighty of us.  Eighty to a hundred, we get together for a week every summer. There were seven of them.  Six girls and a boy.  And then all of their progeny. We all get together and it&#8217;s a pretty hysterical time.  We&#8217;ve got real close bonds now to our cousins, and my children and grandchildren.  I have three grandchildren.  I have three grandchildren. (Read that into the record!)
JW: So you have a long line of women who are strong, and--.
MU: And professional.
JW: And good role models.
MU: Yeah.  This is true.  Several of them married ministers, so it&#8217;s a funny blend.  We&#8217;ve got teachers and ministers and doctors, nurses.  So it&#8217;s heavy on the helping professions.
JW: Once you came back to Knoxville, did you get--do you want to tell me how you got involved with Highlander?  And I&#8217;m also interested in the Mother&#8217;s Club, but I&#8217;m not sure if you were part of that.
MU: Yeah.  And now I do a breast cancer support group; I&#8217;ll tell you about that too.  So in &#8217;78, moved here.  We had good friends in Memphis, actually, since high school. But she lived across the street from us in Memphis, and we decided to move over here.  For that reason, and because we knew so many friends of Bren&#8217;s.  &#8217;78 to &#8217;79, I had Beth and taught.  When Beth was five, many of that group that had been involved at Highlander, and I&#8217;m not so much so.
That spring, we met here and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do a children&#8217;s camp,&#8221; because we have kids that we want to raise with some values of social justice and diversity, and values of having open minds.  So it began right here!  Lucy was the director, and because Beth was five, I said I will stay there [at Highlander].  So I was a counselor that first year, and then I did it for about seven years, and [I] became kind of co-director with Lucy [and later Linda Anderson].
And we would have a great time; we had kids from inner-city, we had kids from the Cherokee community, Native Americans, we had a deaf student, one of my vision students.  We tried to be as diverse as possible.  Racially and disability-wise, and culturally.  And each year the theme would be--probably Lucy&#8217;s shared all this with you--something having to do with social justice.  [One] year we got in trouble with the parents: the theme was &#8220;That&#8217;s Unfair, Let&#8217;s Work It Out.&#8221; [Laughter] So when the parents came to pick them up, [the kids] had their litany of telling the parents &#8220;That&#8217;s unfair!&#8221; That was funny.
I [helped with] the newspaper, each time.  [Guy and Candie Carawan would be around for music.] And Heather Carawan did pottery, and people would come in and do drama.  We [built] a community out of mud.  We&#8217;d play games where you&#8217;d have so many Oreos, and you could either hoard your Oreos or you could share with people that didn&#8217;t have any Oreos.  It was all kinds of games and [activities], to stretch these little minds on seeing the world from a different perspective than white upper-class.
JW: Did you make these things up as you went?  Or were there, I don't know, other social justice camps that you were in contact with?  I don't know any, but--.
MU: If anybody was getting curriculum from anywhere, I don&#8217;t know about it.  We would brainstorm.  And it was a great way--.  Each parent involved had to spend some time organizing, and come out and help.  And these were creative, great people, so they would, it would all just fall into place.  &#8220;I know such-and-such that can do drama.&#8221; Linda Paris Bailey was active--do you know Linda?  She&#8217;s from the African American Carpetbag Theater.  Okay, and Linda Upton Hill, and Eldora Dupree.  All of those are great, wonderful African American drama people that would come out and work with the kids.
We could go get photo albums and that would jog my memory of more things that we did.  We had great fun. We&#8217;d have this slide down the hill.  I wonder.  (52:26) Slip and slide.  [Laughter] And we&#8217;d go to the Carter Pool.  We mixed fun, of course, with some life lessons about how you get along without thinking your race is the center of the world, and how you get along in the world.
I guess that&#8217;s been the other theme of my career--diversity of cultures.  We&#8217;ve had French exchange students that&#8217;ve come and stayed with us.  And these Japanese friends I was talking about have come back, and we stayed in touch with them.  That&#8217;s always been a big theme of my life: people all over the world getting along.
JW: Were there ever any challenges to running the camp at Highlander, and making sure that you were achieving those goals you set out to meet?
MU: My biggest challenge was when I decided I couldn&#8217;t--.  I could do kids by day, but not by night.  So that&#8217;s why I said I&#8217;ll be co-director, but somebody younger stay in the room with the kids that want to stay up and talk all night.  [Laughter] That was really a challenge.  [Pause] You have kiddos with different activity levels.  And I always do better with the calmer ones.  No, I think it was just the heat of Highlander; nothing was air-conditioned out there, that was probably the biggest challenge.
It was wonderful fun, to teach the kids how to make applesauce, and teach them how to get along in the world.  It&#8217;s a big, great week every year.  I still have some of those newsletters, the little newspaper that, if you want them, I can dig them out for you.  Then after that, there was a backpacking camp, when the kids graduated from the children&#8217;s camp.  Did you know that the children&#8217;s camp is still going on?
JW: Lucy said it was.
MU: Yeah, it is.  For a while, there were three of us that co-directed that, and then Linda&#8217;s still doing it.  I talked to her the other night and it&#8217;s coming up in June.  So fun.  But when my kids aged out of that, I started doing a camp for low-vision kiddos, and did that for about seven years.  Not an overnight camp, but a day camp [in town].
JW: So were you a part of the mothers--?
MU: Okay, the mothers, yes.  Yes.  [Laughter] We would get together, leave the kids with the dads, and we&#8217;d get together. I want to say some Sunday mornings, because nobody was really churchy back then.  We&#8217;d get together and talk, have a good time.  Whether that was once a month, I don't know.  Can&#8217;t remember.  But it was a support group, and it&#8217;s been a real important part of my life throughout my life.  &#8216;Course I had two sisters, and all these aunts.  My life has been estrogen-heavy.
But I had that consciousness-raising group.  In Memphis, not so much, it was more coed, group of friends.  I can&#8217;t think that they were just female friends who got together.  Moving back here, we had that mothers&#8217; group.
Then, as children got older and you were ferrying them there and here, everybody was too tired to do that kind of--.  So that faded out.  That was a very isolating time in my life.  This friend that had moved over here with us moved away, and the four of us did very many things together.  And the mothers&#8217; group, everybody was busy with work and with their own kids&#8217; schedule.  I remember that being a hard time, because I didn&#8217;t have this time to just let your hair down with girlfriends, you know, women friends.
Then, eight years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  And Jamie helped me through that.  Fran helped me through that.  Then I decided, after four surgeries, I was going to help anybody else that had to go through it.  So we now have this email support group.  I don't know if anybody has shared that with you?
JW: No, no.  I think it&#8217;s a really important part.
MU: So after--.  Jamie and I, and Fran, in the beginning.  Brenda&#8217;s been through breast cancer, Carol Nickle, [Peggy, Nina,] a bunch of these same friends.  So we will get together.  It&#8217;s faded off a little bit.  But we would get together every three months, sometimes every month.  It was to support each other, of course, but kind of to find laughter through it.  So that&#8217;s been a source of, again, to be surrounded by estrogen, although none of us have a whole lot of that left.  But women friends, who laugh and drink wine together.  So now we&#8217;re in this new book group; did anybody say book group to you?
JW: No.
MU: This is the latest incarnation of a few friends.  So we&#8217;re reading novels that have some kind of social impact.
JW: Uh-huh.  Did you read The Help?
MU: No, we haven&#8217;t done that yet, but that&#8217;s a good one to do.
JW: (1:00:07) mentioned that book, but I didn&#8217;t know if that was a--.
MU: We&#8217;re reading [The] Lacuna, by Barbara Kingsolver right now.  So I&#8217;m always ready to get together with women, and a little wine, and have a good time.  Talking about ideas, and laughing.
JW: So my last question, and then I&#8217;ll open it up to you and let you add anything, is, as I said, our project is about documenting a women&#8217;s movement in the South, and trying to figure out what that experience looked like for women.  I&#8217;m wondering if you could say a little bit about what the women&#8217;s movement meant for you, and maybe even how you defined it in your own life.
MU: Well, I think it&#8217;s probably just what I&#8217;ve said, that for me it was a natural extension of the women in my family that were outspoken.  Not always.  Ha!  I don't know.  The women in my family could be very traditional, &#8216;cause they had to be, back in the fifties, but they always had oomph and ideas, and were very verbal about them.  So I had that background that evolved from that.
To me, the women&#8217;s movement has been about women networking together, and sharing the trials and joys of life together.  In two weeks, there are eight high school friends, that--.  We found each other again when we turned fifty.  And we&#8217;ve been having sleepovers every year.  And they&#8217;re scattered.  There&#8217;s Boston and Minneapolis, and Atlanta and Connecticut, and we all get together for three or four nights.  Several teachers, an engineer.  Not, no lawyers, no [Laughter] high-powered, and they haven&#8217;t climbed the corporate ladder.  Because as I say, I&#8217;m the first year of the baby boomers, born in [19]47, so we&#8217;re on the cusp.
But we&#8217;ve seen a lot of change, and we&#8217;ve seen our daughters break through glass ceilings.  So the women&#8217;s movement for me, I&#8217;m not good at summarizing things, has been to watch how women have had more doors opened for them.
JW: Because it&#8217;s an interesting point that you make, that it wasn&#8217;t the women themselves that--.  Like they always had the ability, and you saw that in your family, but there was something outside of them that was shifting, that you and your daughter and others do different things.
MU: Right.  But everybody&#8217;s on the shoulders of who came before, so if there hadn&#8217;t been Betty Friedan, if there hadn&#8217;t been all these people to get it started, then we wouldn&#8217;t have, you know, raised our children the way we did, to get--.
JW: Or your grandmother.  Sending her daughters to college.
MU: Yeah.  It&#8217;s been a long process.  [Phone ringing]
When you get to be sixty-three, thoughts kind of just whisk through if you don&#8217;t catch them.  Shoot.  Well that was going to be a good thought, too.
JW: You were saying something about standing on the shoulders of foremothers.
MU: Yeah.
JW: [Laughter]
MU: Aw, it was a good thought.  It might whisk back through.  [Laughter]
JW: Was there anything in particular about being in the South and experiencing the women&#8217;s movement, that you think sets it apart from what other women in the country experienced?
MU: Well, I have a friend now who--I think she&#8217;s probably still a Southern Baptist.  She&#8217;s certainly a member of a community that believes that a man is the head of the family.  Her daughter got married, and they did say &#8220;obey&#8221; in the vows.  I remember making a casual comment about that, and she said, &#8220;Well you know, the man is the head of the household, but the woman is the neck and turns the head.&#8221;
And that was probably the way women in the fifties in my family, you know.  They deferred to their husband, they didn&#8217;t try to wear the pants in the family, but they were the neck that turned the head.  They were in charge of the family.
I think I and my group of friends have gotten away from that.  I don't know if you know about the Baha&#8217;i faith, but they have this wonderful analogy about a marriage being like a bird.  There&#8217;s a male wing and a female wing, and it takes both wings equally to make the bird go.  And I feel like that&#8217;s what this wonderful group of women have--the ones that have marriages are more equal.  It baffles me, frankly, it baffles me, this return to fundamentalism in general, and return to a woman&#8217;s place being subservient to a man.  It totally baffles me, why they would feel the need to do that.
JW: That reminds me of another question that I had.
MU: Okay.
JW: I&#8217;m wondering if there was much religious influence in your life.  From an early age that influenced you later, or something that&#8217;s been continuous throughout your life.
MU: Well, with my father a minister, and his father--my grandfather was a minister--and five uncles were ministers.  And three organists thrown in there.  I was really churched.  But by age seventeen, I [began to question].
I believe in the values of love and forgiveness, and I have a Christian core, but I don&#8217;t believe [in things literally]. I didn&#8217;t do church during college, and then for [some] years thereafter.  When we lived in Memphis I would go. Sometimes just to get away from being &#8220;Mommy&#8221; every moment, I&#8217;d go sit down at the Unitarian church on the river, in Memphis.  This wonderful big, open, glass [sanctuary].  You just commune with the river, and I would go to church there occasionally, just to sit and commune.
So when we moved here, our son in kindergarten couldn&#8217;t line up first if he hadn&#8217;t been to church the day before.  On Monday, they let the kids go to line up for lunch.  So instead of making a squawk about that in school, I found a church we could go to.  Which was the [Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist] church here.
We have been very active members of that ever since.  It&#8217;s a place where I can go and sing my little heart out, and enjoy the people who believe in the same values of community and.

That&#8217;s been hard for me, because I grew up wanting to please, wanting to be the good daughter.  [But I had to find my own place. Let&#8217;s just be in awe of the interconnected web of life, play nice, and just get on with being active in the world to make it a better place.]
So my family&#8217;s been real tolerant of me.  I have another cousin who&#8217;s a Unitarian, and now Brenda&#8217;s daughter is becoming a UU--she&#8217;s graduating from seminary to be a UU minister.  Today!  Today they&#8217;re out there.  So that&#8217;s been my place.
I just want to share one more event, before we finish, that had to do with the church.  Six days before my daughter&#8217;s wedding [in 2008], our granddaughter was in a play at church.  And a deranged person opened fire.  We were all lined up [in the pew] there: Terry was on the end, and Nathan, [my son], our grandson [Dagon], who was twelve at the time, my daughter-in-law with one of the twins, Kaden was on her lap, and me.  So I was farthest in.  And [this guy] opened fire, and Terry [and others] took out after him, and our grandson went right behind Terry. [Two people died, and many wounded.]  We&#8217;re lucky to be alive, to make a long story short.  Our son helped one of the wounded, and [the mother of a young woman] says he saved her life.  He whipped off his shirt and stopped her bleeding.
So that was a traumatic event.  And one thing he said in his little letter, the shooter, was that he wanted to kill people who were too liberal. And you know, those were not his words.  He was more graphic.  We had become a welcoming congregation, which means we accept gay, lesbian, transgender people, and this happened right after we had put out the flag plaque.
So I&#8217;m not big on standing on the street corner, although I did [against] the war over in Iraq.  I&#8217;ve stood on a few street corners.  But I consider myself an activist in kind of a quiet way.  I don&#8217;t know why, I don't know where these tears are coming from!  I&#8217;m getting choked up.  But over the years, I will write letters, and I will kind of quietly live my life in a way that&#8217;s trying to make some change.  Okay, I&#8217;m done!  [Laughter]
JW: Thank you.
