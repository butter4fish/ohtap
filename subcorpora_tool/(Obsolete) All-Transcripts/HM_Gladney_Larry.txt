Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at 1900 South Michigan in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation just briefly?
Speaker 2: I'm a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania.  But I call myself a--experimental particle physicist.
Story_ID: 29474
Speaker 1: All right.  Now before we go into depth, there are five light weight "People Magazine"--ish type questions that they compel me to ask everybody.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I like fried chicken.  That's good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well spring, spring time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Sort of mid-spring, just after the winter is broken.
Speaker 2: Now a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: No.  I've been so many places and they're all terrific so I don't think I can pick a favorite.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Nope, I don't actually.
Story_ID: 29475
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to ask about your ancestors and your mother and your father.  And we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Annie Lee Gladney, A-N-N-I-E, L-E-E, G-L-A-D-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was her maiden name?  Was it--?
Speaker 2: That is her maiden name, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: She was never married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well she was born April 26, 1935 in Ruleville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them and--?
Speaker 2: Really all the way to my grandparents.  They--my grandfather died when I was fairly young, about 13 or 14.  And we never after moving north--I, I came north with my mother when I was two months old from Mississippi and so I don't really have any memories of the place where I was born where she grew up.  You know I heard some things about her being on the farm and some descriptions of relatives that I'd met maybe perhaps once in my life.  But I don't know a whole lot about her side of the family or my father's side of the family for that matter, beyond my grandparents.
Story_ID: 29476
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as far as you know your ancestors on your mother's side were farmers and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah sharecroppers, sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  These names almost sound biblical almost now, Ruleville, Mississippi.   You know when you study the history of the Civil Rights Movement, all the activity that took place in all those Mississippi towns.  Are there any stories from those days that have passed down through the family?
Speaker 2: Well no.  The stories that came from that time actually were I thought contrary to what people in my generation would have thought in that time and that.  My mother always described the races mixing pretty easily without any sort of conflicts or any anger on the part of the people who were going there.  And I realized as I got older that the primary reason was that everybody was in the same depressed economic status.  And so there was a lot of sharing.  There was a lot of kids from different families mingling and playing together.  But there wasn't a lot of economic disparity in the places where she grew up so consequently there wasn't as much racial anything--conflict or misunderstandings.  People had all grown up there.  They were all steeped in the same culture independent of whether they were black or white.  And so in her growing up there really wasn't a Civil Rights need until she moved north actually.  It was hard to get work and it was hard to go to school.  So actually most of the issues of conflicting with understanding what it means to be Black in America actually started after she left Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did she go?  She went to East St. Louis?
Speaker 2: She went to East St. Louis, yeah.
Speaker 1: It really was, in Chicago we consider East St. Louis south.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear, laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, the first point that you can call north and that's where about half the family left the farm in Mississippi and stopped in East St. Louis and the other half actually came up to Chicago.
Story_ID: 29477
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--well did your mother have a chance to go to school in Cleveland or Ruleville [Mississippi] or--?
Speaker 2: In Ruleville, no.  She had completed high school but--and she wanted to go to college.  That was just impossible. And she came north and then she had me as one baby and then my sister four and a half years later.  And it was just too hard to earn enough money and to provide a home and also try and pay for an education.  Although she did take college classes pretty much as long as she was able to.  About 20 years she studied basic sciences, biology, chemistry and actually did get up to the point of taking some advanced courses in nursing.  But she was never able to put together a block of time where she could just complete college.  And so she obviously had a love for higher education and she displayed that by continuing you know having to stop, but after a few years picking up, coming back again.
Speaker 1: But it--did she ever talk about who inspired her in high school you know with the love of science and that sort of thing and you know--?
Speaker 2: Well I think she was more interested in helping people.  So it wasn't that it was a love of science per se.  It was just the aspect that when she grew up it was the tradition for people to try and be as helpful to other people as you can.  You shared everything.  You shared food in times when you know times were hard and there wasn't a whole lot to share.  You shared shelter and it didn't really matter whether it was family or friends.  Anybody could come and even though we lived in a four room house they could stay with us.  And when we came up to Chicago to visit relatives you know you just stayed on the floor in the basement, wherever.  People just opened their houses.  And I think it was more her belief that if you really want to help anybody you have to be able to have some skill that you can apply that's relevant for strangers, people who aren't just your friends and family.  So I think that was more of the motivator for her than say specifically trying to learn material because you have an academic interest in say physics or chemistry or biology or bac--you know bacteriology.  I remember hearing her talk about a course that she took in identifying the different kind--different strains of bacteria.  And it was fascinating because she was about as interested in the people in the class and how they interacted with learning about science, a lot of them for the first time under the same conditions that she was as she was in describing the strains of bacteria.  So for her I think science was much more a people oriented occupation.  I mean for me it's sort of the opposite.  It's love of the subject matter and getting deep into it.  It's a very personal and kind of independent quest that I'm on as compared to her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was really trying--studying to become a nurse and be able to--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: With the purpose of helping people?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 29478
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did she ever talk about the high school that she--I mean (unclear) in Ruleville [Mississippi], what was it like?
Speaker 2: She did. It was a pretty simple rustic schoolhouse.  It had you know maybe three or four classrooms, one story out in the field.  I don't think there was--again in her time I don't think there was any understanding that there could be more or that people in big cities did it very differently.  It was more this is, this is what everybody does, right.  This is what my parents did.  You know they didn't finish high school.  My grandfather actually never finished I think the eighth grade.  But if you went on to high school that is kind of the best you could expect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it a segregated high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories that she would tell about growing up in Ruleville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Well she tells family stories and the stories that are kind of hard for me to relate to.  A lot of them deal with supernatural aspects, kind of those stories.  There are monster stories.  She's told a story of once seeing what she had never thought as a devil running through a corn filed lifting up the stalks as it went on and always with some really interesting detail.  So for example for the devil she remembers vividly the red skin.  That it was wearing a white coat.  I'm like why a devil wants to wear a white coat I don't know.  But she had very vivid memories and she would describe things like a giant snake that was as big across as a log that she sat on once and it started moving.  And she would think--very often have these details that should have been shared with other members of the family.  They don't quite remember it the same way but she remembers it as though she knows every detail of it.  And there were stories of course about the family and the contrast between peoples outside behavior and their inner beliefs.  So for example in the case of my aunt she tells a story about how her family were sanctified and so they were not supposed to dance or drink or smoke or go out on dates with boys or even wear fancy shoes like patent leather shoes.  And so she would tell the story of my aunt who was my--going to be my future aunt.  She was going to marry my mother's brother--sort of making this scheme with her where my mother would bring the shoes and the skirts out of--after getting out of sight of parents my aunt would change out of her long skirts and now the shoes and go in something much more stylish to go to school and would occasionally dance at school and so forth.  And so those were the stories that she liked to relate because they gave you more insight again into people in kind of a more natural state I guess you could say as opposed to the public persona they put on.
Story_ID: 29479
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's name is Lucius Green Walker, L-U-C-I-U-S, G-R-E-E-N, W-A-L-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: And do you know his date of birth and/or place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yes.  August 18, 1911.  I'm not sure of the exact place of birth.  He was born just outside Memphis, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1911?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was quite a bit older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's true.  That's true.  So what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well again I didn't meet a lot of them.  They were quite an educated bunch.  He was the only one of his siblings who did not go to college and get an advanced degree.  He had a great aunt who had started a teacher's college, actually started and ran a teacher's college during Reconstruction.  And so his side of the family was much more in tune with higher education.  And he was married I guess probably 20 years or so before he had got divorced and met my mother.  And so his--I have two half-sisters, both of who have Ph.D.s. So the tradition there was much more strongly in terms of education for advancement and being part of commercial enterprises.  I mean they owned farms.  They had you know houses which in the 1960s it was a big deal to have color television sets so they would have a lot of material goods in comparison to my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Where was he--I mean where did he grow up and where did he live?
Speaker 2: Well he grew up as I said just outside of Memphis, Tennessee and came to, also to East St. Louis [Missouri].  I guess stopped in St. Louis first and then moved to East St. Louis probably just after the war, some time late 1940s, early 1950s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are they--do they have a tradition of associating with a particular college or--?
Speaker 2: No they went to all different places.  So they were much more adventurous.  We would study in California or east coast colleges.  They were I think much more attune to what we can--tend to think now of as the norm for people which is that you go away to go to college.  And so they didn't have a tradition of going to you know historically black colleges like Morehouse or Howard.  They took whatever opportunities they thought were sort of best at the time and got their degrees and moved on into professions.
Speaker 1: Well that is kind of odd for those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah it is very odd.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 29480
Speaker 1: Are there--what's--do you have any idea how the family got in position to acquire so much property and you know living at a prejudice state like Mississippi and how were they able to--?
Speaker 2: You mean in Tennessee?
Speaker 1: Yeah in Tennessee and that--even in Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Well not really.  I mean they--well I can only relate my mother's side of it is that they were in her view kind of snotty and stuck up.  And so we didn't have very much interaction at all with him.  I, I essentially never met my grandparents I think past the age of three.  But I think it was more just an aggressive attitude that they had it in their mind that they were really destined for, from what my father says that they were really destined to do great things.  And they strived to achieve based on the belief that that's what they were meant for.  So that he's the unusual one in that he didn't have a lot of ambition in terms of career or education.  And kind of--he's kind of the black sheep of the family in that sense cause he didn't have that same adventurous spirit.  He was happy to stay near his parents for his whole life, for as long as they lived.  And when they died he was still in the same house where they were and he kept the house for a long time, just stayed in the same neighborhood basically until his 80s.
Speaker 1: So what part of Tennessee?  This is outside of Memphis you say--?
Speaker 2: Well this is--after he came to East St. Louis [Missouri], his parents came right after him.  Right, so he was the mama's boy.  They couldn't do without him.  He couldn't do without them.  So they came--my grandparents came to East St. Louis, bought a store and were store owners in St. Louis for well decades with a house that was two blocks away from the store.  And so they--all three of them stayed in that house together and he helped out at the store occasionally when he could.  And as I say they stayed there till they died and after they died he just kept on right in the same house in the same neighborhood until he actually got married again in the '70s [1970s] and only after that did he move out of the house and moved to Cahokia, Illinois.
Speaker 1: I--that's down there were the mounds are.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Cahokia, yeah.  Close by St.--East St. Louis, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 29481
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well there wasn't very much opportunity for jobs in those days even in the north.  So people tended to go to the same places for work once there was the word getting around that you know they're hiring here.  Most people would go you know if you were black you go to where the jobs were cause there wasn't going to likely be any other opportunities coming your way.  So I guess at the time in the mid-1950s, the U.S. Post Office was hiring, had a big operation in St. Louis, Missouri.  So my father went to work there and then a little bit later my mother also went to work there and that's where they met.  And she didn't like the work so eventually quit but you know after they had sort of gotten together.  And my father--
Speaker 1: So she didn't continue--?
Speaker 2: She didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she went back to Mississippi for a while and that's where you were born?
Speaker 2: Right, she went back to Mississippi to have me and then came back north again as soon as she was able.
Story_ID: 29482
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So did they ever get back together or did they stay apart or--?
Speaker 2: Well they stayed apart.  I mean I think it was from my point of view you know a mismatch in terms of almost everything, certainly in terms of families.  I don't think there was ever any idea that they were going to have the families merge together.  But also they were just different people.  My mother had this real caring streak but she was also fiercely independent whereas my father was very much dependent on family and having to keep just a few people very, very close.  So they had really very different personalities and also I think probably because of the age difference very different spots in their life.  My mother really I think had things that she still wanted to do, ambitions that--like becoming a nurse eventually that despite the difficulty she had it in her mind that she wanted to have that happen.  She couldn't see how it could happen but she still wanted to do that.  Whereas my father was very content to be a postal clerk and work in the store from time to time and never move sort of beyond that.
Speaker 1: A post office job in those days was considered a good job those days.
Speaker 2: Was good.  It was a steady job.  It paid pretty well and so yeah it was, yeah for black people in those days it was a good job.
Speaker 1: And a lot of college graduates were working in the post office doing the same thing in those days.  And did you have much interaction with your father as you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not much.  There were times he'd sort of come back into our lives for a while and then disappear back again.  But since you were--you know we're all in East St. Louis, it was never very far, maybe 12 or 15 blocks away.  But as his parents got older and were in poor health he had to spend quite a bit of time sort of taking care of them, driving them around, doctor's appointments.  And then also when he wasn't working taking care of the store.  So I don't remember you know spending huge chunks of time with him.  It would be things like birthdays and occasions.  And then as we got older we would take vacations.  We would drive--he would do the driving and we would go to California or Florida or Canada or someplace like that so we would have family vacations.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So who do you think you take after the most, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: Well I have, sort of have my mother's personality and my looks are completely my father's.
Story_ID: 29483
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  A very interesting one but it's one that's well dated.  I was 18 months old and sitting in a high chair and I remember my mother frying donuts on an old stove in the--in you know one of those wood stoves that people used to have for cooking in the kitchen.  And the reason why it's well dated is cause she only did that once in her life so it's the one thing that I remember that from a real, really early age that can be accurately dated and she confirmed later on that yeah that's right I did it once and you were sitting in the high chair right behind me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 29484
Speaker 1: Right.  Now what was your neighborhood called in East St. Louis?  Or did it have a name or--?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't have a name.  We lived for pretty much all of my life along Bond Avenue except for times when--my mother had several really serious illnesses and so there was a time when I lived with my grandparents, my mother's grandparent--my mother's parents.  But pretty much we spent all of our childhood growing up in one small little neighborhood on Bond Avenue which doesn't exist anymore.  The avenue is still there but the houses are gone.  But we didn't--yeah we didn't move around a lot and there was no real sense--East St. Louis is a place that has a lot of history but there was no sense in the people who lived in that neighborhood of a history of East St. Louis.  Their history was all in Mississippi.  Everybody was from that state and so that's what they sort of remember.  And you know there was no identification of this place as having something that contributed to who we are.  Most people had their identities forged in the south.  And as you say in Chicago you still consider East St. Louis as the south cause the accents are still there.  But for them, the people living there, it was really the north and all of their identity and every kind of aspect of how you relate to other people, how you relate to your neighbors was all sought from the time that they grew up and lived in the south.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But East St. Louis is--I guess where you grew up it was still--it was a predominantly black--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah so 97% black.  But it was known for a few things.  It had--for a time it was the largest place for hog slaughtering and producing pork, one of the largest in the world.  And for a long time it was one of the largest certainly in this country.  And it had been profoundly different back in the '30s [1930s].  I think there was a kind of vibrant culture where there were night clubs there for entertainment but there was also a tradition of education.  You still hear about it.  When I was growing up in the 60s [1960s] people could remember that there was a lot of intellectual foment around and--as well as economic prosperity which by the mid-60s was all, almost all gone.  Corning Glass which had a huge factory there was continually shutting down.  There was a lot of car manufacturing and metal plating and things like that, businesses.  There was a big metal plating factory across the street from where I lived and that sort of just slowly retrenched with a period of shutting jobs over maybe 10, 15, 20 years.  So it became a very economically depressed place but really before I think the mid-50s it was actually quite vibrant and as I said had a history with quite a few white residents.  And so it was one of those places where at least from the south whites and blacks were still mixing until I guess whatever sort of sociology intrudes eventually started to make a--the separation really stark and then you have of course the white flight with people moving out.  And then the people who were left as the jobs go away starts to concentrate poverty.
Story_ID: 29485
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well sights were basically the things that were part of the neighborhood.  And so it was the idea that you would meet people and they would be strangers to you but they were all very familiar because everybody spoke with the same accent.  Everybody sort of had the same likes and dislikes about essentially everything, food, television shows.  I mean it was very, very uniform and yet I certainly remember thinking there's--there was no particular reason for it to be frankly.  I mean people had grown up in different parts of the south and had come there but they always seemed to have this very, very uniform culture.  So what I remember is everybody having the same styles and the same likes and the same dislikes about everything.  And in particular there was a real, I think--I don't know exactly how to describe it.  But they were willing to hold onto traditions of the south they had grown up with.  So for my family and for my neighbors it was always a big deal to go out and pick your own food, right.  So I distinctly remember going out to farms where you were allowed to pick apples or pick greens or get vegetables and that was considered for my parents and for all of the adults at her age whether they were relatives or friends, a necessary thing.  You had to maintain that connection with your roots.  And I grew up wanting to be very clean so getting your hands in the dirt was for me a stark memory.  Like that--this isn't the way I think I was meant to grow up.  But those sights and sounds were--there were sights and sounds of the farm you know so growing up in dirt, being around animals.  My aunt kept chickens, she kept goats at one time and so you go and visit her house and out back there'd be this pen of--with all these animals and smells that barn yard animals have.  So things I remember cause they were so stark contrast to what I expected from growing up in a city.  At that time East St. Louis was probably 70, 80 thousand people so I considered it a big city, obviously dwarfed by St. Louis.  But still it had the, I think for me the attraction of being a place which wasn't on the farm and which wasn't on the south.  So the memories that strike me are the ones that were these constant contrast where you're taken out of the city, you didn't have to go very far.  It was only a few miles but you're back into exactly what you saw in the South I think.
Story_ID: 29486
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  Tell us about the Buckminster Fuller Plan for East St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Well it was a plan--he was invited in to come up with a plan that will be flashy I think and something that would be noteworthy, history making that would bring the city back from the sort of downward trends that it was going in after the mid-1950s.  And I don't think they had in mind how radical he could be.  So his proposal was to put a dome over the city that would protect it from the elements, prevent it from having to worry about flooding and would be kind of a marvel on the level of the pyramids of Egypt right, something that people could see.  From his opinion they should be able to see it from 10, 20 miles away they should see this dome rising up.  And so the (unclear) is very flat plain and it would have all the urban necessities inside of it.  So the dome was set so that all of the things like stores and banks and all of that were arranged so that they could be reached from central points, which is where people would live by coming along the spokes and so forth.  So it was meant to be a completely planned community that you could have a very modern view of the city where people could get to anything they needed very quickly, without ever having to worry about going out into the rain or the snow and worrying about the elements.  So you could walk everywhere and you wouldn't need to have cars and so forth. So it was a very radical plan but of course the expense of it and the whole idea of people thinking about being inside a structure having to live there day in and day out I think sort of kind of threw them for a loop.  But Mr. Fuller I think thought of it as one of his most creative ideas.
Speaker 1: Now this was done when you were no longer living there.  You had--?
Speaker 2: Well I was quite young when this came out.  But I learned about it much later and--
Speaker 1: So you were younger and living in St. Louis when he came up with the idea but you didn't understand it at the time?
Speaker 2: I didn't under--couldn't have understood it at the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when did he propose it?
Speaker 2: It was late 1950s so it would have been between sort of 1958 I think and 1962 or something like that.  So at that time as I said when people in the city could see the city going downhill and wanted something that would be kind of monumental, something you could look at.  And later of course in 1964, the gateway arch started construction in St. Louis again I think for very much the same reason that there would be something that would be a landmark that would be famous throughout the country and maybe throughout the world.  And East St. Louis kind of had the same ambitions because the arch had been discussed I think from--again about the same time period about the nine, mid-1950s or so.  So it was a, I think for me a realization that you could have these great ideas and of course that as far as I knew growing up was always rooted in the south and rooted around relatively simple ways of living that not everybody thinks that way.  I mean there are adventurers that you can imagine and that could happen here, this place where you're going now.  So it was for me a story I remembered because of that.
Story_ID: 29487
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  Are there any other sights and sounds and smells that you--?
Speaker 2: Well you know the sounds again are very much attuned to nature.  So I remember these huge willow trees that used to grow as a particular sight because I have never really seen they anywhere else.  I assume they grow throughout the south perhaps.  But I've never seen these huge willow trees that would have a swaying motion whenever they--the wind would go by and they were--they are home to bats.  So in the summer after--just as sun--the sun was going down the bats would emerge out of these huge willow trees and dart around.  And for me that was I guess sort of as close as you get to an appreciation of nature because it was something so vastly out of the ordinary for me to think about having such huge numbers of creatures that you never see until they all sort of emerge at once.  And the idea of smells, well you remember the usual childhood smells of your mother's cooking and my aunt's cooking but I think none that kind of shaped or molded me or gave me a sense of a personal identity or things that familiar that remind you of home.
Story_ID: 29488
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now for what--what were you like growing up?  I mean how would you describe yourself in retrospect?  What kind of a kid were you?
Speaker 2: Well very weird kid.  As soon as I could learn to read that's pretty much all I did.  So my relatives all have these memories of me successively going to their houses and going through their encyclopedias.  So I would literally pick up an encyclopedia or dictionary and start and I would go all afternoon reading.  And so I had always had this image of myself as being very different than other kids that I was growing up with and also very different I think from my parents.  And they supported my wanting to learn and also bought encyclopedias for me to read, sets and sets of them.  But I think maybe never had quite the understanding of why I was sort of different.  I didn't want to go out and play.  I didn't want to hang out on the corner with other kids, and had this very--I also had this sort of very narrow view of the world as being something that you learned about through books and I don't know where that came from.  So it was only later as I got into my teens that I learned that you learn a lot more by interacting with people than you do by reading about things in books no matter the fact that books can tell you a universe of things that you would find hard to learn just by talking with people. But my memories of myself was always being apart, being different because I had this intense desire to learn but in this very solitary style, not sort of sharing, more or less just having these personal adventures, very much living inside my head.
Speaker 1: Now did you have much interaction with television or radio in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Oh no, I didn't have much television.  But again sort of the jumping off point, I would watch shows and they would be the starting point for, oh I got to read about that.  Or I'd hear a word and I'd immediately go race to the dictionary and look it up, try and find out what it was.  So I certainly watched a lot of--times and I'm not of the opinion that it ruins kids.  I think I turned out okay intellectually despite watching TV shows.  But they were again the kinds of shows that I don't think were incredibly popular.  I was very excited when Star Trek came along.  I remember it very vividly in 1966 seeing this show for the first time thinking, that's what I want to watch.  You know I wish we had a lot more of this.  So anything that had to do with science, science fiction, not so much fantasy but things that were--walked around imagination and sort of reaching out sort of beyond where people normally had their concerns.  So I wasn't that interested in dramas or in movies per se, except for horror movies.  But really all those things that sort of had the aspect of getting outside of where you are and being someplace very different where the--whether it's TV, books, magazines, they were all very fascinating for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now did you have any friends growing up?
Speaker 2: Very few.  I had some that I kept for quite a long time through high school.  And the idea of friends for me was always problematic because you have to have a share of interests and sitting and reading encyclopedias is not something that a lot of people are going to share with you.  So--
Speaker 1: It's hard to do it together (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah it looks a little strange and you sort of realize even if you both like doing that, that that's strange that you're doing it together.  So while I didn't have a lot of--I mean I did have friends but they are friends that were friends while I was in school and as soon as I'm away from school, I'm getting back into the solitary kind of explorations again.
Story_ID: 29489
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started when I was six years old.  I went to Alta Sita School, again it doesn't exist anymore.
Speaker 1: Alta--? Alta Sita Elementary School.
Speaker 2: A-L-T-A--?
Speaker 1: A-L-T-A, S-I-T-A.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: That was the name of that neighborhood.
Speaker 2: --actually.
Speaker 1: Alta Sita.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Does it have a particular meaning or something or what's--?
Speaker 1: Well it's Latin.  It means high sight.  But basically you couldn't tell that.  I mean it's Illinois.  So if you're six inches higher than anyplace else that's the high sight.
Speaker 2: That's right, Illinois is flat.  So, okay Alta Sita Elementary School.  What was--what were the demographics of the school?  Was it all you know was it all black or--?
Speaker 1: There were a few white students and not very many white teachers but there were a few.  So it was mostly an all black experience, again sort of 95% and both I think in terms of the students and also in terms of the teachers.
Story_ID: 29490
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite teacher in school?
Speaker 2: Well I certainly had a teacher who became a favorite.  But it's actually very discouraging to talk about elementary school.  It was a real shock of horrors.  I mean I think people now would be very shocked to realize what went on in those days.  My teachers were in my opinion looking back on it, they were sadists, they were very much steeped in a culture that didn't have children and children of, were of the--supposed to be of the seen not heard variety.  But they were also just I think intentionally very cruel.  There was a lot of physical violence against students who were not up to snuff for some reason in terms of behavior or inability to learn as quickly as the other kids.  And also because of my push for us of reading and being independent, I don't know whether I was singled out but there were--my memory of teachers is that they hated me, not uniformly but pretty close to that.  And I mean to the other way they would say that, I detest you, right, to a kid who's 12 or--you know I guess 11 or 12.  So it was not a happy time.  I mean school was not--I mean I liked learning but school was not a pleasant experience.  It was very frightening for the most part and it was kind of something to be endured because you would be able to advance and get on to something (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: This is disturbing to hear you know 'cause we've heard a lot of stories and usually teachers try to help a good--a bright student who wants to read and that sort of thing.  And (unclear) understand, what was their problem you think with that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, you know.  It's the kind of thing that you hear about it now and you think why weren't these people arrested?  But I certainly remember in classrooms where friends of mine were at the blackboard and they couldn't get it.  And in fourth grade we had a teacher who literally took a black leather strap and slapped his head against the blackboard.  You would have teachers who would get a switch out of the yard and whip people.  They would threaten the students.  They would say if you said anything you know I, I'm going to know about it if you tell your parents because they're going to call the principal and the principal's going to tell me and you're going to get it.  So that's what I remember about it.  I'm sure there were good things too but of course the bad things are the ones that stand out because those are the ones that really sort of influence you most.  And this idea of living in fear I think that was part of my conviction that still holds today that nobody wants to live in fear.  And so you have to be strong enough as an individual to say I'm not going to be afraid.  And so when things like 9/11 [September 11, 2001] happened, I was very much in the mold that this is not going to change the way I live. I'm not going to move to the suburbs because I think crime is too bad in the inner city and Philadelphia and things like that.  And I think certainly a good part of it was molded in that time in that even as a kid there was a time when I got tired of being afraid of like teachers.  And having to always walk a tight rope because you never know exactly how they're going to--
Story_ID: 29491
Speaker 1: Now do you have any stories about teachers attacking you physically or--?
Speaker 2: Well they didn't attack me physically.  I'm not sure exactly why that happened.  But for example, when I was in fourth grade my fourth grade teacher wanted to flunk me because my handwriting wasn't up to par.  And so she couldn't do that because by the time I was in fourth grade in East St. Louis they were already doing standardized testing.  So you would take the California Achievement Test.  So by that time I was reading at a 12th grade level so it was impossible to--well I guess it was sorry, 10th grade level.  So, it was impossible to flunk me on the base--cause that's what she taught was reading and writing--to flunk me on that. But she insisted that I had to come to school on Saturday because I was such a subpar student.  So for half the year I had to come in with all of the other kids who were in academic trouble on every Saturday morning for three hours.  In fifth grade we--I had a--the same teacher I had in third grade, Mr. Claiborne (ph.) who eventually also became my high school counselor.  And he was the one person that I always remember as being helpful.  I mean he would set the bar very high in terms of performance for the kids and he exacted corporal punishment when he felt that kids weren't respectful enough.  But he never did that to me.  And he also had it in mind that he had to challenge me maybe a little more than some of the other kids.  But in a way that I always took it as being something that was positive.  It was meant to, in his view, get me out of the solitary confinement or the way I was learning and try and branch out by maybe interacting a little more with people.  But in sixth grade, again I got a teacher who did flunk me.  And by that time I was reading at an introductory college level and so she would just put "F" on my papers.  And--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) English papers or--?
Speaker 2: And I would never know why.  And she told me once because the kids who in the sort of top 30 were supposed to put on a Christmas play and she saw me hanging out with my friend Randy at the time who was my best friend.  And she saw us running around in the back behind the stage and she stopped us both and said I can't believe Randy that you're hanging out with somebody like this you know.  I just detest this kid.  You should do much better with your friends.  And then somewhere around January things got better.  I stopped flunking and I hadn't realized what had happened until years later when my mother said well I went down and had a talk with her and basically threatened to beat her head in, in the parking lot if she abused me.  And after that things got a lot better.  She wouldn't talk to me.  The teacher still wouldn't interact with me at all but she stopped putting an "F" on everything and then I wound up graduating with the highest grades for the elementary school.  But still it's a traumatic thing when a teacher says, I detest you.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's really, I mean that's almost--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just can't even--
Speaker 2: So I presumed that you know I had the ability to inspire cause it seems for adults especially the ones who are around kids all the time, pretty extreme no matter how you think about it.  But I don't remember doing anything in particular that would inspire--I mean I didn't mouth off in class.  I didn't talk or behave badly or anything that at least I can recall, that would bring on a response from adults who did want respect and they did want I think, a little bit of fear in all their students.  And so it may be that you know my responses were not quite what they wanted and they thought that you could mold kids by depressing them in some way whether it was either physical violence or some other matters.  But you know things would happen all the time.  You would have teachers who'd throw chalk at students.  I had chalk thrown at my head a couple of times.  Erasers sometimes, well that's much better and you survive it, you get through it.  And then I went to middle school and things were much better there of course because I think that's a little different.
Story_ID: 29492
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the middle school?
Speaker 2: It was Clark and I guess they call it--you call it junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (unclear) at the time so it was Clark Junior High School, but it was all the way across the city literally.  It's down the way about as far away from where we lived as you could get.  But my mother insisted that I had to go there to get out of the local high schools, local junior high schools and also to make it easier for me to get into East St. Louis Senior High School which was also on the other side of the city.  So I think her experience of watching me go through elementary school and all the things she had to deal with, with both herself and my sister who in some ways my sister had worse.  She literally did not talk all the way through second grade cause she was so traumatized and fearful of the teacher.  But she just insisted that we had to go to school once we could get out of that elementary school system someplace that was very different.  And it was.  It was much different.  It was more I think, more academically rigorous.  I don't have the comparison of the experience of what it would have been like to go to school on the south side.  But sort of being on the north side of the city you meet a whole different set of students and you I think have the adventure for me of having to take two buses to go basically almost into St. Louis and then come back into East St. Louis on the north side of the city.  So there was that whole aspect of school being something that you have to work to get to.  You couldn't just walk there and walk home.
Story_ID: 29493
Speaker 1: So I bet it was worth it though in terms of the way you were treated I guess in East St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Yeah there were lots of opportunities.  I think they probably exist in small parts still but there were, there was a lot of progressiveness in the '70s [1970s], probably mostly in response to the Civil Rights Movement.  But I got to take college level classes in 11th grade.  I got to actually go to college in the summer after I finished my 11th year and see what it's like to compete against kids who are you know taking physics and literature classes.  It was at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville.  But still, just the idea that you were with a bunch of again, the same people that I had gone to elementary school with.  Their parents had all made the same decision about moving them out of the south side schools and into the north.  And so when we would be together it was the same group of kids from first grade all the way up through 12th grade.  The same small set.  So we would be on college campuses together and that made it a lot easier to kind of again think about having this adventure where we have to travel 35 miles to get to the college campus and here you are a high school student in the midst of all these--the big college kids but with this idea that we had an identity I think.  And that this was something that you needed to treasure because it's an opportunity that didn't come to very many people in this school.
Speaker 1: It was like an upward bound program I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know that it had a particular name per se and it was really very exclusive.  So I graduated with 695 students.  Only the top 30 had really any chance of going to college.  And then of that top 30, maybe six to ten had opportunities to do these classes and to take a chance you know you would go to Edwardsville [Illinois] and your tuition is paid and all of that.  You would sit in the real college classes.  There was transportation there and transportation back from the campus.  So it was very exclusive.  It wasn't the talented tenth it was the talented you know hundredth.
Speaker 1: Wow!  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: East St. Louis Senior High School.
Speaker 1: East St. Louis--
Speaker 2: We called it East Side.
Story_ID: 29494
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's really a frightening statis--695 students, out of 695 only 30 were expected to go to college?  Only 30 were college material?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, for myself college wouldn't have been even a remote possibility without an Illinois State Scholarship, plus financial aide.  And to get the kind of financial aide that would make it really feasible, you would have to go to a very, you know a very good school, a competitive school.  So, that in my case with the scholarship you know to only University of Illinois or Northwestern [University] or University of Chicago.  I wound up going to Northwestern [University] because it had a big observatory sitting in on the lake.  So there wasn't a whole lot of opportunity and then of course you had to deal with the transition as well that you were either planning for success I think in having the college experience if you were in this top group.  But everybody else who were trying to go would immediately find themselves if you've ever been to the University of Illinois campus amidst this sea of people.  Either you go from a place that's 95% African American to one that's, I don't know what it was, but 90% certainly plus exactly the opposite.  And you take buses to classes.  It's very huge, impersonal and very, very different.  And the accents there are different.  The experiences of people are all different.  Then you got the people who certainly in my experience I guess it would have been the same at University of Illinois, really there were kids coming to college who had never actually met, physically met a black person in their life.  They come from upper Wisconsin and they know about blacks but only what they've seen on TV, right, or heard from their parents.  So that made for very interesting and you know if you didn't have a strong constitution, very dismaying interactions from time to time just out of ignorance not very--I think even out of malice.  And you had to be able to handle that.  And so I think the statistics were such that it would have been great if you could go beyond this top 30, but in real retrospective fashion of looking back on it, it's not clear how many people could have made it if they didn't have this sort of cultural I guess transition where you are used to being challenged on any number of educational and sociological fronts and have to learn how to deal with it and come out of it with the idea that you still have your self identity in tact, but that your ambitions are going to be met by virtue of going through college, right.  Cause there was--and it's certainly true of my cousins who in Chicago, they had to grow up with this identity that says well if what you're interested in is material wealth then there's are lots of places to do it.  You don't have to go to college.  And so I can work my way to be successful in life and having a house and cars and all this, all those kinds of things.  So I think you also had to have, to make it you also had to have this aspect that says, well there really is only one path and that path has to go through college.  There is no choice.  You can't turn back.
Story_ID: 29495
Speaker 1: Okay. I mean what were your science experiences like in high school?  And did you--what were you interested in, in terms of--what questions were you interested in solving in high school?
Speaker 2: Well high school I had already been set on the path of being a physicist.  So my uncle tells me I said I wanted to be a scientist at age three, but what I remember most about my early experiences with science is that I hate this.  You know it was chemistry, it was biology, it was drawing pictures of flowers with you know labeling the parts and I thought this is terrible.  So I was in a real existential crisis until I went to junior high school because I loved science but for whatever reason all the science they were teaching included looking through microscopes or chemistry sets and all those kinds of things I just didn't find very interesting.  But again because of the sort of solitary approach, I would come in on the bus that would get me to school on time and it would be a half an hour before classes.  So I would just go to the library and that's where at age thirteen I discovered physics.  And as soon as I read my first book about what physicists do, I was hooked, right.  Those were all the things I wanted to study, the nature of the universe, relativity, quantum mechanics, all these things I just looked at and I immediately felt at home and thought this is what I've been waiting for.  It was, literally for me it was a--exactly like a religious epiphany.  So I came everyday to the library reading everything I could about physics and made up my mind in seventh grade that I was going to get a Ph.D. in physics and I was going to be a researcher.  So back in Ruleville [Mississippi], all the way through eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth grade it was always very clear to me that this is my destiny and there's not going to be anything else that's going to satisfy.  So--
Story_ID: 29496
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now reliving the epiphany, I just thought about how traditional East St. Louis is and I know there are quite a number of churches there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: The old time religion type stuff is really strong in East St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So I mean how--did you attend church a lot as you were growing up or--?
Speaker 2: I did tell you that again, about the same time and up to age twelve.  My mother was very religious, was up until the point she died.  She made it a point to read all the way through the bible, page one to page whatever till the end and then do it again to go through it.  She was on her second time around when she passed away.  And she insisted that my sister and I had to have the same exposure to religion but she was also the mind that I think she understood that I was pretty strong willed.  And so if I wasn't going to accept it, there was no way she was going to impose it.  And so she would leave a lot of decisions up to me at an early age.  So I think after I was maybe eight or nine years old for example, she would say to me, you set your bedtime.  I determine when you get up.  You can go to bed whenever you want but you have to be up by 8:30 [A.M.] or 9:00 [A.M.] on the weekends and of course you got to be up earlier, 7:30 [A.M.] in order to get ready for school.  And that was the way she kind of brought me up is that you make your own decisions but you got to live through the consequences no matter what it is.
Story_ID: 29497
Speaker 1: Okay. So basically at age twelve you kind of had--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had been the whole gamut.  So I had been baptized, had been saved and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal lord and savior.  And I was fine with Jesus, but all of the other people who were professing to believe in it, I just couldn't take.  And I also couldn't stand that the nature of the way the church worked in where you couldn't ask certain questions.  And so you know questions you did ask you wouldn't get a sufficient answer back.  And to me that seemed like it has to be wrong, right?  I mean if you're really studying religion for the kinds of things that people need religion for, you have to be able to at least ask the questions and have some satisfaction come from considering the answer.  But people were very much in the vein that well you can read about it in the bible and you can hear the pastor say it and that's all anybody should want to know.
Speaker 1: Did that seem kind of odd to you in those days that--I mean I guess coming to that realization, here you are a student who's interested in the origins of matter and universe and you go to church and it's all--they quote you a passage and--
Speaker 2: And it's supposed to satisfy, yeah.  So you know I think my nature was to be very quiet, not say very much but if you ask me, it would be provocative to sort of say well why do you believe?  What is it that you get out of believing that you couldn't have gotten by just saying I want to be a good person and I want to live in society and get along with people?  And that would throw the adults who were very steeped in the church.  And I never challenged my mother with those kinds of questions.  I never asked her about it.  And my father it never came up because he had also grown up in this very religious tradition with his family but as I said he was the black sheep.  So he was always the one who no matter what the rest of the family found acceptable he was going to be different.  And so he studied the (unclear) and all kind of--you know Egyptian religions and so forth.  So from him I would only get this idea that you got to shop around.  I mean some religions may satisfy certain needs and others may satisfy different needs.  But it's not an issue of finding ultimate truth.  It's a question of what you need at the time that you haven't got with what you know so far.  But you need to explore and you need to examine but you always have this idea that there's a religion somewhere, it's just a question of not, it not being the one that is very popular at the time. And it was not Muslim, it's not Baptist.  But for another and again for anybody else, it was only one way.  It was all one uniform custom, it was Missionary Baptist, which meant that at some point you were expected to go on a mission and to save souls.  And most of my family, including the ones who are coming to hear me talk tomorrow are still like that.  So my provocative nature now is to explain to them that I'm not and one of the reasons they're coming is cause I said here's where you get to see what I find important and how I satisfy my questions about what the nature of the universe is, what the meaning is, what it is that human beings have as a place in the world.  And so it's not going to be proselytizing, it's going to be just an expression of what satisfies me about science from a philosophical point of view.  What is it that I think other people might be able to draw from it in somewhat the same ways as they draw comfort from religion and that it is able to give you meaning and it's able to give you some idea of what your place in reality is?  What is it that you have to add personally?  What is it that human beings have to add in the grand scheme of things?  And I certainly understand and agree that people will have religious points of view and that I'm not intending to challenge this.  But my--and my wife's personal experience was that by age 12 you're kind of going past the answers that you get and they weren't going to be any other answers forthcoming.  Now it's hard for her cause her father was the Methodist minister in a small town so she still had to look the look and walk the walk despite not having the belief anymore.  But for me it was when my mother says it's your choice, then I decided no I'm not going to go.  I'll go to church occasionally because you do love things about other people there that I won't you know--I'm not going to invest in this belief system anymore.  She said well that's your choice, right.  You have to make it and you have to live with it.  But I think the aspect of religion that scares me most now is that just this whole aspect of accepting is becoming more popular with people, certainly young people.  At college age we see it all over the place that bible study and church services in classrooms are the norm at a place like (unclear) at other campuses and there's not enough questioning.  I mean you can accept it but if you have for the right reasons found what is satisfying about it and understand that when you explore there's going to be ways in which you might learn more, that would be perfectly fine to me.  But it's disturbing to me that people are making choices that maybe close off where they ought to be expanding.
Story_ID: 29498
Speaker 1: Hmm, yeah.  Okay, now when you graduated, did you graduate with honors and such or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I graduated third in my class, .05 I guess out of eight behind the number one and number two.  We were basically all tied and I got two "Bs".  The person who was number two got one "B" and the person who was number one had all "As".  And so it was very, very, very close.  But as far as I know I'm the only one of the group to go through and get a Ph.D.  There were people who graduated again in that top thirty who eventually got medical degrees.  There were people who became quite famous and again got advanced degrees. (Unclear) that was a classmate of mine.  So--
Speaker 1: A black football player?
Speaker 2: Football player yeah.  So after he--
Speaker 1: He was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was tight end (unclear) football history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, we used to play chess all the time and so I took his spot on the chess team when football discovered him.  And then he eventually went on to get his J.D.  So there were people who certainly went on and sort of maybe later on in life found their way and went on to get advanced degrees.  But as far as I know I'm the only one to stay in the academy as a profession.
Story_ID: 29499
Speaker 1: Okay. So you went to Northwestern [University] primarily because they had a telescope, a good telescope?
Speaker 2: Well there were really two reasons.  That was certainly a good one.  But of course in order to discover that, they had to invite me to campus.  So growing up in East St. Louis, the idea of going to a Harvard [University] or a [University of California] Berkley or Stanford [University] or Princeton [University] or Penn [State University], those things were just, they were not even--it wasn't a thought I could think.  The language was saying that you could go.  I mean I knew about these places but the language was saying that you could go to one of these places just to exist.  So part of the reason that I went to Northwestern [University] was that I was invited to come.  And so I thought that this is unusual in that they would express you know any kind of interest where they would say come up, see the place.  And then I, when I came to the campus, my only experience up to that time had been at the University of Illinois campus which was in Champaign Urbana, it was a very small town and it was surrounded by farms.  And I'm not sure but I think we went up in the spring time and there's definitely a scent that you would remember there, fertilizer all--permeated the entire place. And I just knew that this is not the place for me.  I'm not going to go here.  And then the contrast of that with Northwestern [University] was this beautiful campus right on the lake and this great observatory that sort of sticks in the landfill that actually puts you (unclear) to the lake, you know seemed to me like a place that was full of adventure and it was far enough away from home.  The University of Illinois was still too close I think for me.  You could go home every weekend and I really wanted someplace where you'd have to be there, you'd have to commit and you're never going to go back except for you know holidays and maybe during the summers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did you find it?  I mean was it a good place for you?
Speaker 2: I did.  I learned a lot of lessons there that probably--I mean it--it's possible-- I could have learned elsewhere but I'm not sure.  Certainly I learned a lot about how to be a physicist there.  Again I had all these experiences of reading books as the only way of experiencing or gaining the experience of what it's like to do something or be something.  And there I really had to work with people who were doing physics for the first time.  And the lessons were almost immediate.  So I get to campus, there's no room at the dorm so I have to stay in a fraternity, of course an all-white fraternity.
Story_ID: 29500
Speaker 1: You had to stay with a fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And even though you weren't a member, is that what--?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right. But again you got to learn to live with it and I was absolutely devoted, there's no turning back.  This is the school I'm going to and I'm going to graduate and going to do well.  And so again I met people who had varying problems with black people but you work it out and you learn to live with it.  And eventually I did join a fraternity and wound up directing a lot of the activities.  But I learned that --
Speaker 1: That same one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that same one.  Learning how to deal with people and get their respect you know.  So I've always been sort of the shape I am now.  But you're dealing with jocks who are 250 pounds and they're on the football team and you join the fraternity and you have to learn to get their attention first and you have to learn to make them respect you.  And so I had to learn all those things and I think that boded well for being able to sort of go on to deal with people in any number of (unclear).  But they also--I think as a place Northwestern had this aspect to it that meant that you had to be independent, you had to find your own way to stand out.  And I specifically remember that of course I was on full financial aid.  My family couldn't contribute anything to my going to school.  And part of that was the work study program.  I went through the list of jobs and there was nothing that I thought was interest--you know it was checking books at the library or working at the cafeteria and that didn't seem interesting.  And there was this one position which was working with the physics department on an energy physics experiment.  You would be a technician working with the electrical engineers and I thought well that's great right?  What luck!  And of course I go there and there's students who were already there before me and I'm thinking well there's no reason they're going to pick me, I'm a freshman.  And so I talked to the guy there who, Bill Phillips, who eventually left and started his own company which actually is quite a big company.  But at that time he was the person in charge of building all the electronics and he was very unimpressed with me I think.  I mean just a freshman who comes in, don't know anything, have never--don't have any skills, don't know anything about how to build electronics, had never done any of that kind of work.  He just said well I'll call you.  I thought all right, well that's it.  Just, don't call us we'll call you kind of feeling to it.  And after a week of course he hadn't called and I was thinking that I didn't get this job and it's the only job I really want as a work study student and I'll have to do something I really don't have any interest in.  But as I thought about it more and more I just realized I was really angry that he said he was going to call, so he's got to have the bravery to tell me to my face that I didn't get the job, that he hired somebody else.  So I screw up every ounce of courage I had and I went back to his office and poked my head in the door and he says, oh it's you.  So I guess you're here for the job?  And I said well you never called me.  And he says I never call anybody.  Every year I pick the person for the job by whoever comes back.  Usually there's only one person who's brave enough to come back a second time and that's the person I know is going to work hard enough to actually be worth the time and effort.  So that was the first lesson which is you got to be persistent and you got to keep coming back.  And that's the culture of physicists is that they don't give up on things.  And every point after that was just another test or another you know how far can you go?  So my first job was to assemble planer drift chambers which people don't know what those are.  But they're a carbon detector which consists of aluminum frame with a gas bag around it and you put in ethane which is just common cooking gas and then very, very fine wires in the gas so that when a subatomic particle that has an electric charge goes through it, it ionizes it and if the wires are under voltage, the charge will drift to the wire and you can sense that with very--well you need very sensitive electronics.  But if you've designed the electronics right you can pick that up and you can actually put a set of these through and track the path of a subatomic particle.  But of course again I'm just starting as a freshman.  I haven't had more than one college level physics course, no calculus.  I don't know anything.  And so my first job is I'm going to build these chambers which I don't have any idea what any of the words he just--were.  But the professor who was in charge of the project said here, I'll show you how to start.  And he took me to a garage behind the physics building and it was a room about the size of this when it was filled floor to ceiling with 20 foot steel beams and bails of this copper plate wire and tanks of gas.  And he literally said to me, some assembly required and he left.  And I didn't see him again for weeks.  So I was just left with this task, you either sink or swim.  And luckily a graduate student--well he wasn't a graduate student at the time but he was a technician who eventually became a graduate student said, well you know if you have a question you should just ask.  So I said I have no idea how to start.  And he said well look, you got to make the chambers of a design that's going to be about 20 feet x 6 feet and so you got to learn how to cut steel beams.  And so you know you ask, right?  You don't know how to cut steel?  Well there are people in the shop who do.  You go ask them.  You don't know how to weld?  Well you go to the shop and you ask people there how to weld.  They all know how to weld.  You don't know electronics?  Well there's--the guy you work for is the electrical engineer and you go, you ask him how to do things.  But you have to be able to find out what it is you don't know, ask people how to do it to get help and if they don't know how to do it, then you got to figure it out.  So all four years were basically experiences like that where I really learned how it is that people put together collaborations of hundreds of people and build these detectors that are literally three and now five stories high and about four stories wide.  And it's not that anybody knows how to do these things but they just have the attitude that they're going to figure it out.  And so that part of my freshman's experience for me was excellent.  I don't--I didn't see how I could have gotten that by just picking a random college like the University of Illinois and trying to wind my way through.  But Northwestern was small enough that you could find the right people and they would guide you on the way.
Story_ID: 29501
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a story.  Are there any particular instructors there that were mentors to you at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were people that I worked with.  They were all energy physicists and that's--I originally intended to go into astrophysics so I'm just now getting back to that after 20 years.  But high energy physics was where all of the action was in those days in the mid to late '70s [1970s] and it was also the group that I was working for.  So I got a lot of very practical experience about how to do things and also got to know the people pretty well so that it was a community that was familiar to me so that when I took classes with these very same instructors who were now the professor for the class, not the professor who you're working with side by side in the laboratory I got to see a whole other side of them right, cause now they're doing the role where there's some distance, there's some separation.  But as soon as class is over and it's the afternoon and we're all sitting there shoulder to shoulder you know welding or soldering or putting components together, everybody is equal.  You're on a first name basis, right?  So you're professor here, Professor X in the classroom but outside the classroom everybody's on a first name basis.  And it was again learning to navigate that that those are my fondest memories of particular professors that I had there simply because again it's a model for how to grow up, how to behave as a person who is an adult as opposed to a student.  And that was being at some distance away from the authorities.
Story_ID: 29502
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there any--is there any other--are there any other experiences at Northwestern [University] that stand out other than the science ones?  You said you were president--you became the head of this fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well because I could make sensible decisions about things you don't do.  I knew enough physics to say it's a bad idea to put mattresses at the bottom of a third floor stairwell and jump.  I knew better than to think that you could get away with repainting the house by stripping the paint with a blow torch.  So there were a lot of sensible decisions that I was kind of known for making for people who otherwise I think make really incredibly stupid choices.  So it was more being a counselor as opposed to be the teacher or ruler of anything.  So there were people who would do anything, they would rip up the floor with their jackhammer, concrete floor because they decided there was a leak and they wanted to change the pipe.  And there were aspects of that that were good but a lot of aspects of that which could be disastrous.  So, you know, my leadership was basically being one of the people we could depend on to make a good decision as to whether this is a sensible thing to do.  You know it's really hard and nobody knows how to do it or we probably shouldn't attempt to do this.  And it was a business.  At that time running a fraternity with--which had thirty members in it, was a hundred thousand dollar a year business.  So I acted as the treasurer and was responsible for allocating the money.  In the summers I would--was basically, well not basically, I was the landlord.  So when the--whenever college students would leave college students who were taking classes on campus would stay in the fraternity house.  And so I had to be the landlord, collect the rent, figure out who were the good tenants, who were the bad tenants, fix things when they need to be fixed, clean the house and so forth.  So there was a lot of responsibility in just being in charge for that time when all the members were doing other things.  But then also when they'd come back, have them be organized, get them a place you know repaired and also dealing with the adults in the organization.  I won't mention specific names but Chicago's a rough place in some ways.  So there are things that were proposed that well, were not only immoral but illegal so you couldn't do them.  And kind of navigating with adults who ought to be more responsible and not make those choices was again another thing that I learned to deal with, right?  So when we had to install fire alarms because they were changing code you know had to say no, that we're not going to put in fake ones that just had lights blinking to fool the inspector.  We have to you know pay the money, find a way to pay the money.  When the accountant who was handling taxes was found to be embezzling you have to deal with that.  I explained to people who had paid their money to live in that fraternity why we don't have money to do things and whether or not we're going to get this back and also just sort of I think being you know cogniscent enough to say that this is going to happen, right?  You're going to run into people who embezzle.  You're going to run into people who wouldn't mind putting your life at risk by putting in fake fire alarms.  And it's scary that people like that exist and that they own property and do pretty well in life but that's part of life and you sort of have to roll with the punches and figure out how to get past it and you know not have it be a crisis.  Not have it be something that really gets you exercised or depressed or somehow think that you know something you've done is wrong or blame yourself or you think that you can't trust people because you've met a few bad ones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the name of the fraternity.
Speaker 2: It was Theta Xi.
Speaker 1: Theta Xi, okay.  I confess, I don't know any--the name of any (unclear) except the black ones.  That's the only ones I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 29503
Speaker 1: Theta Xi, okay, all right.  So did you graduate from Northwestern [University] with honors?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I just missed honors, I forget by how much but something very clear to the tenth of a point or something.  But at that time I also wasn't really focused on grades per se as much as maybe I could have been if I wanted to try and have a higher GPA.  I think the cut off was at 3.5 or something, I was 3.4 something.  But I was really focused on higher things.  The grades didn't matter.  The experiences that I had did and also just this aspect of getting into graduate schools which were the top graduate schools.  That's really what the focus of the last two years that I was at Northwestern [University] in terms of how am I going to go on to the next step?  I mean I need to get the Ph.D., but I want it to be a Ph.D. from a top ranked institution so I want to do the things in terms of taking courses, in terms of working lots of hours past my work study funding, working in the summer to actually go and visit experiments and work with them.  Those were the things that really occupied most of my--well not most, all of my time and effort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: In '79 [1979], yeah.
Story_ID: 29504
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so where did you go on to grad school?
Speaker 2: I went to Stanford [University].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got into every graduate school I applied to.  And again Stanford [University] was the one where somebody called up and said we really want you to come here and so that was the deciding point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was Stanford like for you?  Had you ever been--well you had been to California before, right?
Speaker 2: I had been to Southern California.  I had a really terrific math teacher in high school who he was just, again he was one of those people that is kind of similar in your life without you realizing it until later just because he set the standard, but also he had it in his mind that again you could just do whatever you set your mind to.  And so he had it in his mind that he was going to take us to Florida to see Cape Canaveral and I guess it was Cape Kennedy in those days and that we were going to pay for this somehow right, by earning money in the math club.  The math club's not exactly something you expect to be a money making venture, but he pulled it off.  And then the next year he had us go to San Diego and Los Angeles and across the border into Mexico again with only like four or five kids who could manage to stay through all the stuff that you needed to do through the whole year in order to be able to make the trip happen.  But the idea that you know California was a very different place than I had grown up even despite the fact that I was in Northwestern [University], it was still Illinois.  And again I just had the, I think belief that well you make it work out.  So I took a Greyhound [bus] from Chicago to San Francisco, a public bus from San Francisco down to Stanford [University]'s campus and walked across the campus carrying my two huge suitcases and what looked like the most incredible resort you've ever seen.  So it really gave me away that there were places like this with streets lined with palm trees and elaborate marble mausoleums and buildings and churches.  So again I was just in this culture--I thought I was prepared but I just wasn't really in a sense because, a place like Stanford in terms of its external appearance but you know you learn to make it through.  And yeah it was a really good experience.  Again, I got to work with a Nobel laureate and his group and so there was a lot of very positives experiences about being there and you know not too many negative ones.  I mean a couple that you know stand out.  You have to deal with prejudice everywhere and certainly Stanford [University]'s no different.
Story_ID: 29505
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you talk about the negative experiences or whatever?
Speaker 2: Well since I was working at the laboratory I started learning (unclear) [Stanford Linear] Accelerator Center which is about a mile and a half from campus.  I had to--I couldn't afford a car so I had to ride my bike back and forth and I would work pretty late.  So I would be coming home at night and maybe several times I'm on this lonely stretch of road that goes down from the lab into and through the campus and people would yell nigger out of the car.  And of course all it takes is a little bit of a swerve and they literally, these roads were deserted at the time I was coming home at night so you could disappear, be hit and nobody would ever know.  But that's, again it's the kind of thing that you either had to say well I'm going to change the way I live or you learn how to not worry about it.
Story_ID: 29506
Speaker 1: Okay. Stanford University now did you have any mentors at Stanford or any key teachers that really stuck out or any experiences that you want to--?
Speaker 2: Well I had two mentors and it was not going to be a place where you were going to find African Americans.  So you had to be cognisant of you know learning what you could from the people who really wanted you to succeed and liked you, you know as a person.  And in my case it was you know advisors who I think as with any beginning graduate student you always have to take a chance on them.  I mean you're paying their tuition and their stipend and all of that out of your grant but you don't really know whether they're good at research, whether they have problems finishing things.  And it's a real, it is a real risk.  The smartest person in the, you know class that I came in with never got his Ph.D. because he could never finish anything.  He would start on something, get to a certain level, realize how much more there is to do and then do something else that's more interesting.  So it was always a risk that when you take somebody on, if you don't know from some prior experience that they're really good at what they're going to be doing, that they may not work out.  And so in my case I was working with an advisor who at that time had things going on in his life that kind of led him away from the kind of research that I said I wanted to do for my Ph.D. thesis and one thing I really respect about him is that he immediately said okay well there's someone else who's doing just what you want.  And so he literally turned me over to this second advisor who guided me all the way through making the measurements I eventually wound up completing my Ph.D. thesis with.  But also it was--this first advisor was such a kind guy that it's hard to describe that when you meet people and you know that they've achieved a certain level of respect within their field.  And they don't have any particular reason to know or respect you when you're just seeing them for the first time and coming to them with the requests that I want to work with you.  I want to--to have them make this huge investment in me.  And from the very first he was just really open oh it's great to have you, right?  This is something that you're going to enjoy and it's going to be a lot of fun to have a project that you agree with, that you make progress on and that is going to transition you to be a physicist as opposed to being a student who studies physics.  So that eventually when I went to Penn, I actually helped recruit him from Stanford to Penn so he's now a physics professor there as well.  But it was just that whole idea that people can have a lot of achievement and yet still be--they can be people that you just talk to, right?  That are interested in talking to you whatever it is that you're interested in, whether it's a particular interest of theirs or not.  And so I was linked with a group that was very much composed of people like this.  They had been a very famous group in the early '70s [1970s], well really later on, mid-1970s, the leader of the group as I said was a Nobel laureate, he had won the Nobel prize for a discovery made in 1974.
Story_ID: 29507
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: This is Burton Richter [Nobel Prize in Physics, 1971].  And the same group of people who had all been on this project had all made individual contributions themselves that have gotten them a lot of scientific fame.  And as I said from the beginning my advisor Bob Holbeck (ph.) took me in and said well here's Larry, he's going to be part of us now.  He's going to be part of the team and everybody just said well that's great.  If you're okay with that then we're okay with that so just pitch in and start helping.  Here are the challenges that we have for today.  These are the ones that you can pick and choose from.  So it was really very different than what I would have expected going into a laboratory environment where again nobody really knows who you are until you prove yourself.  Here it was a very different situation where you've already proven yourself, right?  So you're going to be part of the team without having to go through any kind of initiation as I did with Northwestern [University] where you get a set of tests and if you pass them you can do the next one.  Here was, it was just you're one, right?  So you're sitting right next to a Nobel laureate who's debating with you a question about physics even though I'm you know just a second year graduate student.  And that again was the kind of experience that the maturity that you get out of that is that you first of all understand that an issue that I think a lot of black people wrestled with in my age group--it's a different question now.  But the question they wrestled with in my age group was do you have to act white in order to succeed, right?  Do you have to give up your self-identity in order to be part of somebody else's identity just to make the grade?  And I think I still have relatives who probably believe to some extent that that's true, right?  That you have to stop being you and you have to act white and you have to be this different person when you're with them and then you can revert to being whoever you really are when you're with your folks.  And so this was an example for me to sort of see no, I mean I don't have to change who I am.  I don't feel like I talk any differently with my black friends on campus than I do with people here.  We're interested--we're all interested in physics, that's what we do.  So there's different branches of physics but still the interests are the same.  And we talk about you know the issues in the world, debate politics and all of that in exactly the same way even though the guy next to me you know has a Nobel prize medal that he can show me and is a very senior physicist.  He's designed and built the accelerator that I'm doing my thesis research on.  But he is, in his mind is the guy who married his boss' secretary which is what kind of helped solidify his position at the lab and was instrumental in him getting sort of the extra oomph to get the project funded when again they had to take a risk on some guy who had come in, was smart but hadn't been proven as somebody who could make these really landmark projects actually succeed.  So that aspect of it really influenced me a lot, more so than I think I can probably say in words because a lot of it was a personal experience of if you haven't gone through something like that where you have to realize what people have given up from their past in order to develop for themselves who they want to be, right.  So when I went back to East St. Louis, for the friends I knew in high school there, they're still there in East St. Louis in every possible way, right.  They've never ventured more than a few miles from home or perhaps gone on a few vacations.  But literally they haven't been to Paris.  They haven't been to Switzerland.  They haven't been to Japan and worked with other people in those places.  Not just visiting them but actually have to have them be part of your team, right, just in the way that I was taught.  This is what you do.  People who are at a certain level have proven themselves and what you have to do is figure out how best to work with them and how best they can work with you.  And when you do that with people from all over the world as I've had to do, you kind of realize that when you say that all people are the same it's a phrase that doesn't really have the personal meaning to a lot of us that I think it does to people have gone through this experience of having to actually work with people from very different circumstances, very different areas, South America, South Africa.  You know I can barely imagine what their experiences were in terms of developing as people.  But when we're working together we're all physicists and we've all had the same kind of training, we've all had the same kind of experiences like the ones I related earlier about these you know sets of tests that you have to go through to prove that you can get through the next one.  Everybody's had to do that.
Story_ID: 29508
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Well let me make a lot of sense.  I measured the life time of the charm quark which--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the charm quark was the quark that was discovered by this group that I worked with in 1974 and it's what Burton Richter got the Nobel Prize for or shared the Nobel Prize for.  But there wasn't a whole lot that was known about it so at the time I was doing these measurements the existence of this quark had only been known for ten years.  And there had been measurements made by other people in different places and Fermi Lab was one of them and also other groups at Stanford and they disagreed by a large margin for scientists, a large margin.  It's a factor of three as to what the answer was.  So I had a taste of what it's like to have a scientifically interesting result because it was the kind of thing where people want to know what the answer is and your version will be the deciding one that says that Professor X is right or Professor Y is right.  And there had been a lot of bitter acrimony at--and what goes for bitter acrimony in my field is when people write in public journals that we don't think they did their analysis correctly, right.  We have problems with it.  So that's the height of an insult is to say they don't understand their--we don't think they understand all the data.  And so this had actually occurred.  So the idea that's--the spotlight is on you was made really clear in that the person who was head of my group as I said, the Nobel laureate, by this time was director of the lab and directed all the computers on the lab had to be diverted to the analysis that I was working on.  So nobody else, none of the  other graduate students or post-docs could get their computer jobs done for almost a month until I had gotten my result which didn't make me all that popular at the time with graduate students.  But they understood if you work for the big tuna then occasionally things will happen like that. So it was a big deal at the time because it was, as it turns out the answer was right in the middle.  Both the groups had not gotten it right.  But it was more or less the experience of having to go through I think what this--other people in this group had gone through ten years earlier with having all this attention I mean not at their level cause they were more famous for this, but having this attention focused on the quality of your work and have you doing everything the way it needs to be done to make sure you understand the result and that your understanding is the correct one.  So that aspect of the thesis was I think a lot more important than the number that came out at the end cause I think it was that experience that helped get me the cache to be recruited to Penn and also I think more or less to be in that atmosphere where you really feel as though now you've made a contribution and so there's something that's notable.  So you're working with people on a team in which they've accepted you but then you kind of feel as though we all are equals now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We've all made this level or grade where we've proven that we can get a scientifically interesting result out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Forgive me but I have to ask you what is a charm quark?
Speaker 2: Charm quark.  Well the universe is made of atoms, right and the nucleus of the atom is composed of protons and neutrons.  And the protons and neutrons are made of quark.  So there are just two kinds of quark that make up everything in this room.  They happen to be called up and down because particle physicists are not very imaginative and they have this very quirky sense of humor.  So they name very serious things names like truth and beauty and charm and strange and up and down.  And so the charm quark is a heavier version of the up and down quark that make up all normal matter.  And so it's a, it's a good question to ask, well what sis it, because it doesn't have as far as we can see, a purpose right?  I mean the up and down make up everything we see.  So you can say the reason for their existence is we wouldn't be here to ask the question if they didn't exist.  Charm quark is some heavier version of those.  It has its own peculiar set of physical properties which make it unique and yet we don't have a purpose for it.  We don't have a reason why the universe could not be as we see it if the charm quark didn't exist.  And it could only be made in very energetic accelerators.  It was undoubtedly made at the beginning of the universe, very quickly disappeared.  So when we make it what's interesting about it is we're recreating something that has not lived for 13 billion years, more than 13 billion years.  And if we weren't making it or some other intelligent beings weren't making it, it wouldn't exist at all.  There would be no knowledge that it had ever existed.  (Unclear) --
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in terms of phenomenon this wouldn't happen without your experiments, you're saying?  It wouldn't even--?
Speaker 2: That's right.  It couldn't exist.  You'd never come across it.  There's no place that you could just discover the charm quark without having made it.  But for us, for physicists the reason why it's important is this question of why does it exist at all?  Why does nature allow it if it doesn't have a role?  And therefore studying it might give you because this has happened historically, might give you some insight into something deeper, something that's more fundamental.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nature in general is pretty parsimonious so it doesn't create things unless there's a real rationale for why they have to be that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So have you continued to try to track this down over the years?
Speaker 2: Well over time I have moved on to the bottom quark which is the next quark up from the charm. In 1995, I was on the experiment that discovered the top quark which we think is the last of the quarks.  And then I decided to try and move closer to astrophysics.  It was a situation in which I had been doing particle physics because it is what I had learned as an undergraduate.  And again you feel very comfortable in the community in which you think you know some of the people and you work in the same way and have the same experiences.  But I really still had this idea in mind that I was more interested in the birth of the universe and the fate of the universe so I started moving back closer and closer to that so that now as of the last three years I've been working with a design for a new space telescope.  So it's a very different thing than I've done before.  And not so far outside of the experience of particle physicists in the sense that a lot of the people I'm working with are the same people I worked with on these quark experiments.  They've decided to also move over for that--for the same reasons I did.  They just found it intrinsically very interesting.
Story_ID: 29509
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got your Ph.D. when in '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: In '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: '85 [1985].  '85 [1985], okay, all right.  And you were out--now what else was going on?  I'm trying to think what else is going on out there in Stanford [University] when you were--was Condoleezza Rice [former US Secretary of State] there?
Speaker 2: Condoleezza Rice was there, that's right.  She was just starting as an assistant professor in those days in Russian and Russian history and worked her way up.  And I had gone to Penn [State University] and had left working at Slack [Inc., healthcare] for I suppose ten years and then came back in 1996 to work there again.  And by that time she had worked her way up to full professor and a few years later became provost.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  I was wondering if you--now was it the kind of memory where all the black people would know each other there or--?
Speaker 2: Well not very much and she was known because of her role as the provost to a lot of the same people that I knew who were--some of them had been quite famous physicists at Stanford for many years.  But they didn't have a whole lot of respect for her intellect.  They related to me that you know she's not the kind of person that you're really going to enjoy knowing or meeting or whatever.  So she did come to Slack a couple of times and I did see her but never tried to--I never intentionally tried to strike up a conversation with her just because people had been so negative about aspects of her psyche in terms of being very sure of herself but not necessarily with all the right information.  So they related that to me back in the 1990s and you know I got to realize that the culture whether you're black or white or yellow or whatever in physics is that you cannot say things unless you're really sure that they're right, right.  You couch almost everything and as far as I know or as you know it's to my belief or whatever.  You don't really make declarative statements without a lot of pressure.  So--
Story_ID: 29510
Speaker 1: It's hard to spin a fact in physics.
Speaker 2: It's hard to spin a fact in physics and it's just the, it's the culture so that you know the people that I knew were at the tail end of the generation that created the atom bomb.  And in fact some of the people had worked on the Manhattan Project.  So their idea about what you know and what you can do with what you know was married to this very essential fact that you can destroy the world with the right facts, right, if you actually understand way enough what you claim to understand.  You can build remarkable things and you can also build really terrible things.  But from the experience of having done it right.  I'm listening to one of the senior physicists there Dr. Gnosky (ph.) who had been the original director of the lab and hearing his stories about going to Hiroshima many years after dropping the bomb there and seeing the museum in which they had enshrined a part of the trigger for the first A bomb which he designed and built.  So he's looking in this, you know among the shadows flashed into stone walls and so forth of here's the real aspect of your work and what happens and how it can be used if you understand the physics part of it but don't understand necessarily how it might be used once its out in the open.  And he tells the story to students like me about that as a way of saying that you have to forge a very strong, again this whole idea that you have to forge identity that says that you're not going to live in fear of what's to come.  Because these decisions have to be made right, and you have the knowledge, you're going to learn more and you have to be able to depend on yourself to able to make the right decisions about how to use it.  And he said I'll tell you a story about one aspect of where later in life in the 1960s when they were thinking about funding the Stanford Nuclear Accelerator Center that it was known that he was going to be the director.  So he was the scientific leader.  He was the smartest guy.  Everybody came to him with the questions that they couldn't answer or the problems they couldn't do.  And so he was more than just the (unclear) leader or the political leader.  He was the spokesperson but he was also the intellectual driving force.  But when it came time to sign on the dotted line for congress to agree to fund this project, they put another sheet of paper in front of him and said there's the equivalent of now $300 million on the table on the left and on the right our loyalty oaths which we want you to guarantee to us that you will have every physicist sign before they're allowed to work at the laboratory.  And so he said right then and there I've got the $300 million sitting there on the table ready to go with this dream I have in mind to build and here's the other thing which is absolutely unacceptable.  And so it takes about half a second for me to make the decision, take the money back. I will not have scientists sign loyalty oaths.  And they were of course pretty surprised and taken aback by that, the Office of the Navy and the congressmen who were there.  But eventually he won out on it.  So he got to get the money and he did not have to force people to sign loyalty oaths before they were able to work at the laboratory.  So that tradition again stays with you that he wants the students coming through there to understand exactly why you need to have these experiences in which you're questioned and why it seems so cruel sometimes that people are pushing you very hard in peer review.  That's one of the hardest things to go through as graduate students is that people absolutely insist that you must be sure.  And it's because when a time comes to make decisions whether they've got to do with physics or not, you've got to be sure you're making the right ones.  And doubt is one of those things that you reserve it for cases where you don't make the statement, you don't make the decision.  So if you're not sure then you say exactly that.  You don't gloss it over.  You don't guess at it you know or take a shot.  And that culture as I say started back even before the Manhattan Project [to develop the atomic bomb] I think, but certainly solidified in the minds of that generation of people.  So you're shaking the hands of the person, shook the hands of the people who are making the foundations of physics and that's a culture that comes down from them.
Story_ID: 29511
Speaker 1: This is--when you mention the Manhattan Project, I was surprised, I read on the--there's a site on the internet.  I met a couple of them myself of black people who had been instrumental on the Manhattan Project.  Dr. Samuel Massey was one.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: And you know it seems like--what struck me as profound about you know just knowing him and knowing that he worked on that project is that here is somebody that came out of the hills of Arkansas who (unclear) someplace in a--raised in a cabin who you know was able to learn physics and was drafted basically by the Manhattan Project in a time when black people who were professionals weren't drafted in any other aspect of life--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 29512
Speaker 1: --you know to work on--you know he was drafted because of what he knew.  And I suppose that the society of people in physics is so small and so--I mean the--I don't know.  Do you all think of yourselves as elite?  I mean you almost have to in some way wouldn't you?  If you--the material that physicists are dealing with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is so--I mean like a, I mean an atomic bomb I mean what else might a physicist uncover about how the world works that might--that could either be a big boom or a big disaster, you know?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I think, I mean certainly the perception outside of the field is that we're egotistical and for particle physicists, the worst of the egotistical.  But again I don't think we think of ourselves as elite.  We think of ourselves as being apart, not because we're smarter or better but because we're trained in this culture that says you can do these incredible things.  So when someone says to me you have to write a program that tells us what the size, the aperture of the space telescope is going to be?  Well I've never, I've, you know I've only looked through three telescopes in my life.  I've never built one, never designed one and this is a project that's going to cost upwards of $500 million.  An important part of the answer as to how much it's going to cost is what size is it going to be?  Well that's my job, right.  That's--it will be verified by many people but it's my job to lead the effort to say it's got to be 2 meters across or it can be 1.8 meters across and that's--for every fraction of an inch, that's a million dollars.  So why did you do that, right?  Why did you take someone who's never built a telescope?  And it's because again people feel very confident that in this set of people who are in the particle physics community that you're not going to come out with an answer unless you're really sure and it's defensible and a lot of people will ask the questions and you'll be able to explain the answer to their questions.  So yeah it gives you a mindset that says I'm not going to trust this to a chemist that may be a lot smarter, they may be a lot better trained at what they do.  But these set of people who have been through all, again all the same common experiences they are the people I really think can be trusted to make these decisions only because they've been vetted by having to go through the same kinds of hoops that I'm very familiar with in which the end product has been something really huge or very spectacular.  Or--and I don't mean in the sense of Nobel Prize winning, but just a marvel in terms of technology or a marvel in terms of what you can do.  So we'll find people in the field who built cameras, that use charge coupler devices, CCDs as the space telescope was.  And the kinds that you use on a digital camera that you buy, maybe has if it's real expensive eight million pixels in it.  The ones we design now have 500 to 800 million pixels, right?  So how does anybody do that?  How does anybody decide they can do that?  Well this is the kind of field where okay you might think of yourself as elite and you might think it's egotistical, but people in this field feel, I'll figure it out, right?  That's what I can do.  And so we're all mindful in this, if you want to call it a club, we're all mindful that everybody in the field feels that same way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Whether it's justified or not, I don't know.
Story_ID: 29513
Speaker 1: Okay. And then as you go back to the civil rights idea of physics too, is physics like a great equalizer in some ways?
Speaker 2: In some ways it is and in other ways it's really too much of an equalizer.  I think one of the things we're realizing brilliantly is that this really "throw the baby into the pool and see if they sink or swim approach" is really not very appropriate if you want to increase the representation by women in particular, but by minorities as well.  And it's because it does take the kind of strength of personality that says we're not doing this because we want you to go away.  This is what everybody has to go through because that's part of the training.  This is how we do it.  And I think we could certainly figure out whether that's the best way to do it or whether or not there are ways in which we can have a, for lack of a better term, kinder, gentler introduction that would have it accessible to more people who come from more backgrounds or more varied backgrounds.
Speaker 1: So what you're suggesting is that it's culturally loaded on some level--?
Speaker 2: It is, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where only certainly people are going to respond in the ideal way projected by the designers?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And as I said I'm not convinced that that's the best way to do it.  But in the end since what you're getting out is something that's very unique.  There are not that many physicists.  There are even fewer particle physicists and there are about I'm going to say right now a dozen active African American high energy physicists.  So who's to say whether you know there could be twenty or two hundred?  I don't really know I just think that as scientists it would be incumbent on us to try and explore as we do with everything else.  Is there a better way to do it?  Do we really understand how it is that we lose people from the field?  Do we really understand how it is that we could gain more people again from different backgrounds coming in 'cause that's important for science, independent of what you think about what society's needs are and how many role models we need even if you didn't care about those things.  If you care about the science then you understand that without having the different points of view and the different experiences of people coming into it, the science is not as rich, it's not as interesting, not as many new ideas get tried because people don't have the new ideas.  And therefore it's an important thing to try to do almost independent of what you think the social good that comes out of just having more access to more people, you ought to do it for the good of the field.
Story_ID: 29514
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now okay, let's go to Penn[University of Pennsylvania].  We probably should go to Penn and talk.  Now what did you--well you taught at Penn right?  Did you teach or did you--?
Speaker 2: When I first went there I went there as a post-doc, post doctoral.  You know I wasn't really a student.  I was part of the research staff and I went there to work with what I thought was the best opportunity at the time which was to work on this new accelerator at Fermi Lab which in 1985 was just coming online so it was the new frontier.  So it represented for me the tradition I had been in, in that you'll get--you're going to work with the best group in the world.  One of, certainly one of the best if not the best group in the world on the most visible experiment in the world.  And Penn was only one of the universities was on, that was on it.  University of Chicago had also offered me a position.  But Penn was where the people who were most familiar to me were, right.  I worked with one of the people as a--who was at Stanford [University] as a post-doctoral student who is now there as a professor and it seemed more familiar in terms of when you come here at Penn, it would be different than it was at a lot of places because it will be up to you to decide what you want to work on.  In other words we're trusting you to make decisions at a very junior age that will severely determine what your career trajectory is going to be.  And so again you can be afraid of that or you can say that's a great opportunity.  So for me it was definitely a very--I mean I'd take the chance and go there and I'll make my own decisions about what I want to work on and if they succeed or fail, it's on me.  But at the same time it was also a question of trying to decide what other things you want to do in the world that are good.  So I had to make the conscious decision that the things I had done at Stanford like working with the Black Student groups, science and engineering, tutoring and outreach activities, I wasn't going to do those for a while.  And so I spent four years really just concentrating only on research.  Then almost as soon as I became the assistant professor there, I went back to working with Lincoln University on a program we did for seventh through twelfth graders on Saturdays, teaching in the summer with groups of students which when we started were predominantly underrepresented minority students in the science and engineering.  Over time society has become conservative enough that you can't really have programs like that anymore in the academy.  But it's still a good proportion of students who are African American for example, who are interested in being in science and engineering but don't have as strong a background in those subjects as the typical student who would be coming into Penn would have with science and math.  And so I still do those things in addition to working on these research projects, these big research projects.  But it's the idea of whether Penn is the best place.  Again, it seemed so for me.  I had been very happy there and I think I had been allowed to do a lot of what I wanted to do again with the idea that if it fails, you're the person who has to pay for it.  But if it succeeds, people will give you the credit for it and they'll, you know they won't try and subsume it under their own good works or the list of things that they're responsible for having made be a success.
Story_ID: 29515
Speaker 1: Now that's another political aspect of this that I mentioned I think off camera this movie Einstein's Big Idea that Melvin did, where quite a few ideas have been subsumed by others.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have.  They have.  And again it's not always the big things like not getting proper credit to people which obviously it should never happen, but does.  It's sometimes the small things.  So the scholar that I had come to Penn to work with who I had worked with as--when he was a post-doc at Slack and was a graduate student at Stanford [University] he told me a very personal story about this aspect of working with someone who was black which is that when he was a graduate student at Ohio State [University] and working on a particle physics experiment, there was another black graduate student who was working with the group but was kind of standoffish, didn't go out to eat lunch with everybody else.  And he had a habit which this guy I'm talking about at Penn found very annoying which is that every morning he would come in, he would pick at a Styrofoam cup and he would write his name on it.  He'd take a drink out of it, he would leave it on the counter all day as if to say, I don't want to have any chance that somebody else drinks out of my cup.  So just as a joke, this guy who was at Ohio State [University], he's now at Penn wrote a pretty nasty epithet on the cup basically to just say, lighten up.  And this black graduate student really took it as a racist--you know there's nothing about this epithet which was racist but he just took it as a very hostile act and immediately demanded who did this, right, as if to say this is an actionable offense.  And this guy at--who's at Penn immediately spoke up and said well I did it, okay?  S--and here's why.  But having to deal with the fact that he didn't understand that it would be perceived that way kind of opened his eyes to say that you know any action that I take or don't take has this consequence and so I have to be more expressive in terms of how I think about people perceiving things.  Because again I'm making the assumption that he would think about it the way I would if I got that I would just say you know what a joke, right?  That somebody's ticked off at me or something and okay fine, right and then we would just drop it and go from there.  So I think that it's those kind of things that at Penn I found it whether it's just a coincidence or whether it's the history of the place or whatever people, they've kind of come to their own terms about how to deal with the issue of not having inclusion as something they've thought about and it's certainly not universal.  And I'm going through a struggle right now with the current administration about you know how resistant we should be to the forces outside that really want to stop inclusion under the guise of being fair to everybody.  But it has been a place that has been very positive in comparison to other Ivy League institutions in terms of at least the attitudes of people.
Story_ID: 29516
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now from what I was reading there are two major fields of research that you're involved in right now I guess or--?
Speaker 2: Particle physics and cosmology.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Those two fields overlap at the place where I'm very interested which is how did the universe begin?  We believe that it started with a big bang which is an explosion so it was very hot and very dense and those are exactly the conditions in which there wasn't any normal matter.  All the matter was in the form of quarks and the forces between them were all very strong forces not like the ones that we see today.  So that it's exactly that intersection that I'm most interested in and it's where the two fields have pretty much identical goals and the methods up to this point have been different for approaching that same goal.  So that one of the things very interesting about having people like me who had been very traditional particle physicists come in and work with cosmologists is that we're bringing some of the things that have been very successful for very large projects in particle physics where now it will be commonplace for papers.  And particle physicists you know are journals to have a thousand or more authors.  Some of them will have two thousand authors in the next few years.  Whereas in cosmology, if you had a group of ten, that's considered huge, that's big.  So merging these two cultures, we hope to take the best aspects of both in terms of proceeding with mounting these very challenging experiments to do things that are far beyond everyday experience now and far outside what we can reproduce in a laboratory.  So if it doesn't work out optimally, would--neither of these groups, the cosmologists, nor the astrophysicists nor the particle physicists will get what they want which is the answers to these very deep questions.  And we'll see how that works.  It's, again it's another experiment and we can only judge it after that, after the fact.
Story_ID: 29517
Speaker 1: One question I read about that you are interested in figuring out is why the universe is dominated by positive matter (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Matter, antimatter.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Well again in the early history of the universe, there had to be equal amounts of matter and antimatter.  We don't actually know how to create one without the other. But if I look around this room is all one type, it's all matter.  And in fact it would be very, very bad for us if there were even small specks of antimatter around because it annihilates--all Star Trek fans know it annihilates and creates a huge amount of energy so that there's a--it's the equivalent of a murder mystery, right.  The universe figured out a way to get rid of all of the antimatter and yet leave the matter behind.  We don't know how that happened and one of the things we want to explore is to understand what happened to the antimatter and whether or not the mechanism that nature used reflects again something even deeper about either the mathematical aspects of the physical laws that we've come to understand and sort of base our beliefs on how the universe behaves on those or whether or not this is just one aspect of the story on how the universe came to be, right.  I mean we couldn't have a universe like the one that we see that has life in it and intelligence if nature hadn't figured out how to do this, get rid of the antimatter.  But maybe that was only one brief phase and there isn't anything deeper about it.  That it's just, it's a card trick.  It might have happened with some other universes if they happen to be existing or maybe it only happened with ours.  It's a very rare occurrence.  And so there's nothing deep, it's just, it's the equivalent of the existential question.  It just is.  But even that is a deep question, right.  If you ask the philosophy of how likely is our universe, that's a very deep question.  [Albert] Einstein expressed it by saying I want to know whether God had any choice about how he made the universe.  Once he set down these laws and they were mathematically firm, was he then constrained in that this is the only way you can make a consistent universe that has sense and that has life and intelligence in it because there's no other way that you can logically put things together that they actually do work or not.  So we have that as a legacy right, are we going to try and make a sensible universe or are we just going to accept what nature tells us and no matter how preposterous it is, just decide that we're going to live with it.  That's a huge philosophical question and it's not going to be resolved probably for ten or twenty years if ever into the future because it requires us to get to the point where we either say [Albert] Einstein was wrong.  The universe isn't sensible and so there was a choice about how you could have made it in that once you say that things don't have to make sense, you can choose you know it's like making up a story.  You can have any story you want and you just got to live with the final result.  Or if there really is some grand scheme and it all does make sense at some very fundamental level we haven't seen yet, that would also be a great thing to expose.  But we're not going to know right, because one of these paths you can never prove and the other one you can say what's fundamental but again you never know that if a hundred years from now somebody might discover Rome has a cellar under the basement, that there's something even more fundamental underneath that.
Speaker 1: Right, and it's--it can be any number of complicated scenarios I guess if you--
Speaker 2: Or it might be a very simple one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: There is also--you know philosophers argue about whether or not its possible for human beings to understand the universe completely or not.  Do we have that capability?  And the answer could be no, that we'll always have mysteries and we'll continue studying them and we'll just go on ad infinitum.  But we won't ever get to the bottom of it because we don't have a brain that's set up to put all the facts together and say right, well now I know how the whole story is told and every part of that story makes sense to me.
Speaker 1: Well Roland Kirk used to have a song called 'Let's All Look For The Reason Why'.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's something I think you know not only physics but politics and every other --
Speaker 2: Aspect of  human endeavor as far as I know.
Story_ID: 29518
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, now you're--now how do these--now you've been doing this to some level today talking to me but how do you explain to a lay audience what you're doing?  I mean how do you--I mean is there a way that you try to approach it where we can actually understand what you're getting at or is there--
Speaker 2: Well I--
Speaker 1: --way that works?
Speaker 2: I guess the first thing is I don't try to have people feel like they understand it.  One of the things that I personally think is relatively important students that I teach to understand and for teachers, one of the outreach program I'm doing now in the summers is to train middle school teachers how to teach science.  Is that science is the opposite of religion.  It's not closed off.  It's not here's the set of facts and those are the only facts that you have to know, right.  It's a continual cycle of asking questions, learning a bit more and then finding that there are more questions on the basis of the answers.  So I think it's wrong to leave people with the thought in mind after I talk about these very deep subjects that okay, well I get it. I understand it.  I mean it personally would make me feel good but I think it would be wrong for them to feel that way cause I don't feel that way and I don't--none of the people that I work with feel as though you know there are all these facts.  I know so much more than the average person does about how the universe works, but I still don't feel as though I understand it or that I'm very comfortable with the level of knowledge that I had with it.  So I think it's, it would be good if I can in the course of talking about it, figure out how to get people to loosen up a bit in terms of whether they should have the expectation or understand it just because I or anybody else you know Brian Green or Stephen Hawking or any of these people has explained it to them.  What you can do is you can feel that there are abiding mysteries there that they're interesting mysteries.  They're questions that almost everybody can relate to in terms of you know they've come up at some point in your life.  You look up in the night sky and you wonder is that all there is?  Well we now know there isn't.  There's a whole lot more of the universe than you can see by eye or with any of the instruments that we have currently.  But does that in and of itself mean that you understand anything more, right, because anybody can look up at the sky and ask the same question, is that all there is?  And we say well no there isn't.  But I still can't tell you whether even the things that I know that are there that you can't see, whether that's all there is or whether it still continues down again to other levels that we haven't even begun to explore.  So mostly what I try and do in public lectures is to give people a sense that the questions that you'll find were asked are the exact questions that we want to ask.  They're all the essentials, they're the "why" questions.  Occasionally though the "how" but the focus isn't on understanding from the point of view of I've mastered this.  I've got it under my belt and I feel very comfortable with it because in a certain level again it's not honest as a physicist to have gone through this training in which you're told to do at every step.  You have to understand every detail before you say I understand, right.  You can't be loose with that term so that if people can get some flavor for that which is this cycle can go on and it's interesting for it to go on because it's been a part of human history for as long as there's been a recorded history, right.  The ancient Egyptians are just as interested in terms of having a few people want to explore these very same questions, where did you universe come from: is it finite or does it go on forever: will it have an end: did it have a beginning, as we are today?  So if you connect to them with that same sense of awe or mystery and willingness to step beyond whatever you're worried about today and think for a little bit of time about these very, very deep questions then I would say that's the best you could probably get out of a public lecture, right.  Everything else that you get, the personal victories that come from understanding, they have to come with an enormous amount of work but it has to be very personal work.  Nobody can tell it to you and have you absorb it, at least I'm not aware.  And that the way I try and get that across to people is to think about the experiences of others that they've read about or seen on TV.  Everybody's heard of music geniuses right, I mean they know about [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart and playing piano or harpsichord at three and writing his first opera at 12.  Everybody has heard of chess prodigies you know, somebody who at age 12 is able to be a grand master.  Everybody has heard of math prodigies.  Nobody has ever heard of a physics prodigy, they don't exist.  In the entire history there's never been a 12 year old who was able to explain quantum physics to [Albert] Einstein and there's a reason.  We need a body of knowledge which can only be accumulated by having direct experience with nature itself.  It's not innate.  It's not something that is part of our brain structure and some people have a really bit more of it than others.  Nobody is a physics prodigy until they're in their late teens at the earliest and they don't really become I think ahead of anybody else even if you're an Isaac Newton until your early 20s.  So again it would be wrong to try and explain to people something that if you listen to me or you listen to this guy or this woman, you're going to know so much more about the universe.  A lot of things will be introduced but to have a personal understanding of them, you would have to do an awful lot of intellectual effort on your own part with the helping and explaining but it still has to be again a personal journey that when you've mastered this level of it, you've mastered by virtue of all the work that you put into it to get to that.  And it would be great if we had to tell people that cause it sounds like who wants to do all that work?  What do I get out of it?  But I really don't see historically that it's been any different from the time there have been people.  I mean we're still confused about some detail aspects of how the pyramids were built.
Story_ID: 29519
Speaker 1: That's right.  So what to you today is the most intriguing aspect of physics in terms of--I mean is the project you're working on?
Speaker 2: Well the project I'm on now and I think it's the biggest question in all of physics is, what is the dark energy?  What is this mysterious anti-gravity that's forcing the universe to get bigger and bigger at a faster and faster rate?  And it's I think the most important question because it is so different, right?  It's something that is allowed within [Albert] Einstein's general theory of relativity but it makes everything else wrong.  It makes general relatively the one theory that we can depend on but quantum mechanics is wrong.  And quantum mechanics has been just as fundamental to these foundation of physics as Einstein's theory of gravity has been.  So that there's no comfort anywhere, right.  In order to explain this you even have to give up on the physics that are very small in terms of quantum physics or the physics that are very large in terms of gravitation.  One of those two has to be wrong and it might be both.  So I don't see any other branch of physics where you can say there's something that is that profound as a possibility of you know rearranging the way we think about everything, right.  That these things that have been very successful that have allowed us to build the atomic bomb, that allowed us to build nuclear reactors, that allowed us to build electronics and computers in terms of quantum physics.  All those things are based on a theory which at its fundamental level is in disagreement with general relatively and the theory--Einstein's theory of gravitation.  And we didn't have to reconcile those two before but now that we know about the existence of this anti-gravity, we can't escape it, right.  And those two will have to interact in order to understand what this new phenomenon is.  And every attempt by every physicist no matter how smart to date has failed to figure out a way to get them to play nicely together.  There is one aspect which you would hear about from Jim [James] Gates who's going to be on the program with me tomorrow in which he thinks there's promise in this theory called super strings, super string theory and that may work out.  But it's still got lots of possible holes in it that haven't been confirmed and probably can't be confirmed in a laboratory experiment for some time.  So an experimentalist like me says I got to leave it as an open question, right.  That these two things don't work together.  I can't figure out how they're going to be consistent with one another.  But until I understand the dark energy I don't have a clue as to what's going to force us to the next level, what's going to give us the crucial insight that allows some version of Einstein in the present day to figure out hey, this is how it works. This is how these two can fit together.  And it causes us to rearrange some of the stuff we thought we understood before but that's okay because here is this bigger picture I can see how that works out.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, can you explain to me the program that you--now you are on a program tomorrow and this is not a--this isn't something that's going to go into our archive of course.  But there, I know there (unclear) is a tenor aspect of this.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what's the connection here?  What are we--?
Speaker 2: Well there's only about a dozen active African American high energy physicists in the country, experimentalists. Two of them will be on the program, two-- a cosmic chemist tomorrow and the third is a quite well known physicist, James Gates whose had his own NOVA [on PBS telelvision] programs on super strings and so forth so he's quite famous.  And I don't think--
Speaker 1: Is that the one with the hair, the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he has the hair.
Speaker 1: He has the hair, he's at University of Maryland?
Speaker 2: University of Maryland, that's right. That's right.  So I don't remember now the idea of tenors came from but it is the aspect of having three of us together talking about things and having a harmonious conjoining of the subject matter and the way in which we talked about it which was quite by accident.  So in February all three of us were asked to give presentations at the National Society of Black Physicists meeting and it was a session that was organized relatively quickly for these things.  Normally you want to have months of preparation but we were all asked to talk about the future of particle physics and we needed a catchy title for it so it was called Physics on the Frontier or Frontier Physics or something like that.  So here we have three people who work in different areas.  One was very conventional, particle physics, one who used to be and is now in astrophysics and cosmology and one who does theory.  And you normally would not get a very cohesive program out of that because we weren't given very much direction about what to say or how to say it.  But it turned out great and people were so convinced that we had rehearsed it and had shared what we were going to say and we had never you know none of us had seen the slides of the others.  They decided well it's like a concert program, right.  We had three tenors.
Story_ID: 29521
Speaker 1: Okay. So just to pin down what we were saying before, you, Dr. [James] Gates and Dr. White and you know we've interviewed Dr. Carl Spight from this area and I know there's Dr. Rowan Mallard (ph.) who experimented with time.  I mean and there are a lot of black--not a lot but, not a lot of--well but there are some significant black men and women in physics.  So--
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And there's a society, I mean they're organized themselves.
Speaker 2: They've organized themselves.  There's the National Society of Black Physicists which has annual meetings now which are huge affairs.  It started I think with fewer than thirty people in the 1970s and now it's regularly you know several hundreds of people coming plus students, huge numbers of students come.  So it's partly a celebration of what's happened with blacks in physics but also it's a you know quite legitimate scientific meeting in which people do present their latest results and prospects for new experiments or new theories that they have in mind. But it's the kind of eclectic mix that you get I think from a community in which the cohesiveness allows you to get away with things that the normal scientific community meetings would never attempt to do that for example, I have never been in a meeting of the American Physical Society which is held every year for condensed metaphysics, solid state physicists.  We just don't do that and they don't come to our meetings.  But here at the National Society of Black Physicists, you're expected to come and listen to a lecture by somebody who's talking about electron motility and silicon or gallium arsenide and find it interesting and engaging and ask questions.  So it's very real for me in a way that I think other societies can't be in that we are so specialized within physics that there are very few opportunities to have overlap between people in different fields because they have to be on top of the field they're in and it moves so rapidly and it's so distinct from other subfields of physics that there isn't this kind of what does it mean to be a scientist as opposed to being a physicist.  So I think that the NSBP [National Society of Black Physicists] is kind of a throwback to maybe the way that scientific societies used to be in the 1700s or 1800s in that people can come in and they can talk about anything, right.  The shared experience is that you're interested in physics and you've done work in physics.  That's the thing that makes it interesting to come and talk to you.  Not that I'm going to particularly gain in my own subfield by listening to your results.
Story_ID: 29522
Speaker 1: Like the old, (unclear) attended the International Statistical Congress in London where if you had anything to do with science and math you showed up.
Speaker 2: You showed up there with your results.
Speaker 1: Or nature, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So it's very refreshing in that way and also I think probably when I talked about this issue before of having a better way to introduce physics to students that would be more inclusive, I suspect that that may be one of the ways that may be better because it sort of says that you don't have to pick something that you're interested in and specialize in right away.  I mean the idea of that I think a lot of people who are currently in physics probably did have early on, you know I want to do nuclear physics or I want to do astrophysics.  Or I want to work in industry so I want to do solid state physics.  But I think you probably catch more people if you had a more open approach that says here's a number of different things and it's laid out as a menu and it's got to be at a level hopefully where everybody can understand it without being a specialist. So you've got whoever--a chance at a legitimate scientific meeting, which results are being presented.  Scientific results that are going to be published or being presented, you got a better chance that students are going to understand you know part of the lecture that goes on there than they would at a typical scientific conference where if you don't know all the buzz words and you're not familiar with all the techniques, you're not going to follow very much of what goes on.  You can get some sense of the buzz and the excitement but you can't really share quite as much of the science.
Speaker 1: So needless to say that's probably an attempt to bring youth to this kind of conference?
Speaker 2: Yes it is.  So the meeting is held in conjunction with the National Society of Black Physicists students who agree to hold their meeting at the same time or very close and always in the same location so that they have overlap with the senior physicists.
Story_ID: 29523
Speaker 1: Okay. Now we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well certainly a concern is that I talked before in kind of a negative way about the cohesiveness of the community where I grew up and not everybody liked the same things, the same foods, the same fashions or listened to the same music.  But there was a certain sense of that which gave you a real identity, right that is apart from what you assume for yourself as an individual, you were a part of a community in which you felt very comfortable.  That's starting to fragment and maybe that's an inevitable thing and maybe in the end it, it's a positive thing.  But it does mean that young people growing up today have all these possible identities that they can take on and these possible worries about who they're going to be, what their values are going to be that we don't have.  I mean when I was growing up because the community was uniform in terms of so many aspects of life, they were also uniform in what's right and what's wrong.  So I had a very firm sense from our neighbors just as I would from my mother of what things you don't do.  And so some of them were little like you say yes sir, yes ma'am to your elders.  When older parents or I'm sorry grandparents or older people need help you're the first one to give up your seat on the bus.  That's just the way it was.  Those are the aspects of the culture which anybody just would tell you right, and agree on.  And we've lost that.  And as part of losing that I think we've fallen into the trap of not having an identity that we can transfer it to young people that is valuable to them.  And so the things that have come in to replace that are things that are kind of negative.  Some aspects of rap music, I mean I like some rap songs but there's whole parts of that genre which are just negative stereotyping and filling a gap which really shouldn't have been there in the first place.  And so when somebody like Bill Cosby complains about it, I really think if he thinks about it and goes back to the basic issue, it's not a failing within the young people, it's not a failing necessary within the parents.  It's a failing in this disintegration of the community that allows this to happen in a way but didn't, then didn't replace it with something that's also substantial.  But the hope is, I have is that these issues of what it means to be an African American are going to be important and we still have to work them out but they're not going to be the defining limits of your life.  It's getting to be less and less the situation that just because you're black, here are the limits that you can't go beyond or you can only get beyond with the very, very luckiest of circumstances.  But again that's been replaced with new emphasis on limitations due to poverty, certainly in terms of education and opportunities for jobs and careers.  That's I think probably as important now as simply being black was in the late '60s [1960s].  So my hope is that that trend will continue that people again will find fewer limitations on the basis of the color of their skin, simply because it's not only a wrong thing, it's just not practical.  We live in a society that really need to have all the positive aspects it can get from all of the citizens that it has.  That if there are people that are disenfranchised and dropping out that's not going to be sufficient to get along anymore.  We're going to find everybody's standard of living changing dramatically for the worst if that continues.
Story_ID: 29524
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done up to this point and you're still fairly young by some of the standards we've set in terms of ordinary people, where would you--well what would you do differently?  Is there any memorable thing that you would do differently if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question, right.  I married my wife by saying, I have always been as you see me now.  So there's nothing to change 'cause it's, I've always been the same.  Of course that's not true.  But no, I don't see any choices that I consciously made that I would probably do differently mostly because one thing that my mother told me about is that you make your choices and then you just continue on with them.  When I was young and I would decide that you know I want to join the boy scouts or patrol troops or whatever and then later it became uncool to do that.  [using his mother's words] You're doing it, right.  You made the choice.  It was up to you so now you're sticking with it for as long as you commit for.  So if it was for a year, it's for a year or for however long it is. So I don't find as the choices I made are things I looked back on and say well I wish I had done that differently.  Certainly possible that it might have worked out better, but you have to make the best with the choices that you make.  That's the way I was raised and it was continually drummed into me that you're not really going to be happy in life unless that's true, right.  If you have any aspect where you look--of your life where you look back and you say well if I had just done this differently things would be so much better.  And that's not a way that you could be happy living.  And you may eventually have to come to the consequences of your understanding where the failing was if there was one or you're going to have to decide that it really wasn't as important as you're making it out to be.  In which case, why worry about it?  So I'm very happy with all the choices I've made, but I think I would have been happy with a whole different choices probably as well.
Story_ID: 29525
Speaker 1: Okay.  By the same token when you look back at everything that's occurred before now, what do you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Well I don't have much of a legacy cause I'm not sure that I think in terms of that.  But the thing that students have told me particularly black students is that you don't get to make the Charles Barkley [retired NBA player] statement.  Everybody is a role model.  Your visible, you've got a Ph.D., you're a professor at an institution.  You can't say well I don't want to be something that somebody else looks up to and says well because you did it, I'm disappointed or even I'm related or you know I think I'm going to do the same thing.  So I'm very uncomfortable with that role.  But as I said, they made it very clear to me you don't get away with just saying in your own mind that that's not what's going to happen.  So the legacy I think that if there's going to be one that I leave is, it's going to be understanding that all the things that you do in your life that involve other people make a difference, took me a long time to learn that.  So there are students that I had the toughest time with when they were in 7th or 8th grade and you couldn't imagine why they would remember me or thought to remember me.  And they come back years later and they reflect things that you've told them, that you thought they weren't even listening.  And its surprising because there are times when hmm, I wish, I probably wish I hadn't said that now.  Let me correct that after the fact.  But they remember things.  And so the legacy that we all leave if we work with kids of any age and to me kids, you're a kid until you're past the age of 21, is that we make these footsteps in their lives and they remember a lot of it despite the fact that we kind of think they're not paying attention or they're not absorbingit or they're not believing it.  I've just seen way too many instances in which they've come back and said this little decision you made which you didn't think about afterwards impacted me for years after that, mostly for the good.  But sometimes it's been negative and that part of it I think is a legacy that a lot of us don't realize that if you work with young people you know everybody's leaving a legacy for the good or bad.  And you know hopefully it's something that I'll look back on and I'll appreciate right.  I mean there won't be one single thing cause my career has been successful but I have no account--career as something that is a legacy or an invention or things that I have come up with or particular papers I've written.  I mean those are normal things that people think of scientific legacies.  But I'd really like to think that that's not all that's left behind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us a little bit about your family?  You have any children (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I have one stepdaughter and I have two grandchildren now.
Story_ID: 29526
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well is there anything I should have asked that I haven't asked before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No I don't think so.  I think it's been pretty complete.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At least up to this point.  We'll interview you again when you're 80, you know.  But--
Speaker 2: If I'm still around then you won't have to ask any questions.  Everything will be written on my face, every fear and it will all come back to haunt me I'm sure.
Speaker 1: All right. Well this is a question we always ask.  It's similar to legacy but a little different.  How will you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know I'm not sure that I'd like to be remembered.  I'd like this--I'd like the things that I've done to not be unusual, to not be things where people have to say make a note of that.  I mean, saved stories are very deeply personal.  I haven't told it to many people.  In fact I'm not sure I told it to more than three people in my life.  But my family has generally been very supportive but it's not clear that everybody knows how to be supportive in that their experiences in life have been so different.  So when I went off to college I was asked by one of my uncles, so what are you going to do after you go to college?  And I said well it's--I'm going to be a physicist, absolutely clear.  And his response was, physicist?  What kind of job is that for a nigger?  Now he didn't, I think, mean for it to be as negative as it was to me at the time but it made me think that you know he's right, right?  I mean this is not a job for a nigger, but it ought to be a job for anybody who loves science independent of what their identity is.  So I would like to be remembered as not being unusual, not being so out there, not being you know one of just a dozen or so who are actively working in this narrow field of particle physics and to have it not be unusual for somebody like Neil Degrasse Tyson [American astrophysicist at the Hayden Planetarium] to say just the fact that I'm an astrophysicist.  If I never did anything with my scientific career but be an astrophysicist, that states volumes about what's possible for black people.  To not have that be a statement that needs to be made anymore I think would be terrific.
Speaker 1: All right sir.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
