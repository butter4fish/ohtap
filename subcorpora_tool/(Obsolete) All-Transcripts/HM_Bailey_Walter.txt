Speaker 1: All right.  Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we will start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please.
Speaker 2: Willella, W-I-L-L-E-L-L-A.

Speaker 2: Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Jefferson.  Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She is eighty-four and she just recently had a birthday about a month ago, I'll have to--
Speaker 1: That's 1926, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 1926.  And, was she born in Memphis [Tennessee] too?
Speaker 2: No.  She was born in Arkansas, I believe.
Speaker 1: Do you know the town?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can't go very far with the exception of her mother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandfather at all?
Speaker 2: On her side?
Speaker 1: On mother's side.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Lurenia Robinson
Speaker 1: L-O-R-E-N-A?
Speaker 2: L-U-R-E-N-I-A, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Robinson.  Okay.  Do you about when she was born by any chance?
Speaker 2: I don't have the faintest recollection.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now was she from Arkansas too, as far as you know?  That side of the family, were they basically Arkansas-based, or did they move around a lot?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did your mother grow up in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: I think she did, prior to moving to Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she go to school in Arkansas or Memphis?
Speaker 2: I'd have to--do you want me to call her and ask her?
Speaker 1: No, you don't have to do it now.  This is just a source, where once you tell us is a source, I guess if people really want to find out, they'd dig deep to find it, you know.
Speaker 2: But I don't recall when she moved to Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, I take it your mother didn't say a lot about growing up then and where she grew up and what she did as a child?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And your grandmother?  Did she have any stories?  Are there any stories on your mother's side of the family that passed down about what life was like when they coming along?
Speaker 1: On my mother's side, as I recall, her father was killed in a domestic quarrel, my grandmother's father, that is, in which he tried to intervene.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he tried to intervene in somebody else's domestic quarrel, man and wife?
Speaker 1: Man and wife.  And they were Caucasian and he got stabbed.
Speaker 2: Okay, it was two, a white man and his wife, had a quarrel and he tried to intervene and he was stabbed?
Speaker 1: That's the way I understood it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Any other information about him.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: About that period of time?
Speaker 1: No.  'Cause I was--I don't think I ever had the opportunity to meet him.
Speaker 2: Did you get the impression from your mother or grandmother that they thought that life was fair to them and that they, you know--?
Speaker 1: No, not really, they thought it was rather harsh in terms of racism, failure of opportunities and came out of an era of poverty, not abject poverty, just sort of borderline poverty.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know what, what did your grandmother do for a living?
Speaker 1: I don't.  She's very religious though.
Speaker 2: You don't remember what she did for a living?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 158548
Speaker 1: What about your mother [Willella Jefferson Bailey]?  What did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was very enterprising.  In fact, she conceived me at an early age, sixteen I believe it was, and after having dropped out of school, went back and got her high school certification, she worked at a doctor's office as, doing unskilled tasks, and she decided to become a barber, which she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after becoming a barber, licensed barber, which was sort of hard because there weren't many women barbers cutting men's hair, but she was very efficient at it, and she then decided to go to nursing school and got--obtained her nursing license.
Speaker 1: Where did she go to nursing school?
Speaker 2: She went to nursing school at John Gaston Hospital [Memphis, Tennessee].  It was John Gaston at the time.  Now it's the Regional Medical Center.
Speaker 1: It was Gaston before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Gaston.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
Speaker 2: John Gaston, G-A-S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: John Gaston.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was the public hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158549
Speaker 1: So, let me go to your father's side now.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's [Walter Bailey, Sr.] full name was the same as mine.
Speaker 1: Same as yours, right.
Speaker 2: I'm a junior.
Speaker 1: (unclear) All right.  So what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, I'd have to--I keep all those, the material on my iPod.
Speaker 1: Now is he older than your mother [Willella Jefferson Bailey]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, by--
Speaker 1: You know she was born in 1926, I guess.  She's eighty-four now.  So how much older is he than--?
Speaker 2: Not much, by a couple of years I would say, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So maybe 1924 or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thereabout, we just say, we just approximate.
Speaker 2: Their age--we're in proximity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was he born in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  I think he was born in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he didn't really talk about-I take it they're not talking about where they come from, you know.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: They didn't talk about growing up.  Did he talk about growing up, or where his family came from and at all?
Speaker 2: Not really.  There wasn't very much of that kind of discussion.  They were too busy struggling to meet modern day needs.
Speaker 1: Okay, where they grew up was modern I guess, until--but present time you're talking about they had a present time orientation about what do right now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: And no discussion about where they came from and why they came to Memphis in the first place?
Speaker 2: And I paid little attention to that at the time.  I wasn't very sensitive to their development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they pass away early on?  Which of your parents, either one?
Speaker 2: My mother's living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And healthy and doing well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except for some bone degeneration that goes with getting old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she never talks about where she grew up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Your father, and I take it he didn't say much either did he?  Did he ever, did he have a chance to finish high school and go to a trade school or anything?
Speaker 1: No, he did not.  I think he dropped out in the, about the ninth or tenth grade.
Speaker 2: Was he going to high school here in Memphis [Tennessee] when he dropped out?
Speaker 1: I believe so.
Speaker 2: What did your father do for a living?
Speaker 1: He was a Pullman porter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For the Illinois Central Railroad.  A job of which he was very proud.
Speaker 2: That was a good job in those days.
Speaker 1: He was.
Speaker 2: --for people.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: With benefits and everything?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, but now--
Speaker 1: But we didn't have much discussion about their history.  Very little.  We were always in the present, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He never went to the [U.S.] Military or anything of that sort, so there's a, in fact, nobody in my family ever went to the Military.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, during World War II [WWII], he wasn't doing anything?
Speaker 1: Oh no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was because of issues with his feet.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Sometimes they have a story about how they met and fell in love, or you know, where they met.
Speaker 1: No, I mean we, oddly enough, didn't have those kind of discussions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 158550
Speaker 1: Well, can you tell us in, what kind of personalities your parents [Willella Jefferson Bailey and Walter Bailey, Jr.] had?  What were they like?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was very enterprising.  He, and my grandfather, his dad, that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you knew your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew him.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: D.A. Bailey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, that's how my brother got [HM] D'Army Bailey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did the D.A. stand for?
Speaker 2: I believe it was, I don't know.  It was D. A.
Speaker 1: So it didn't stand for D'Army, right?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: It was just D.A.  There are some names like that.  I know some people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just D.A. Bailey.
Speaker 1: And what did your mother--
Speaker 2: And that was the only name I knew him by.
Speaker 1: What, did your mother and father like build on that name to name D'Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was named after my dad, and he was named after my granddad.
Speaker 1: So they didn't--
Speaker 2: Now he may have had, that A, I mean that D may have, I think it represented D'Army [ph.], but I'm not sure, I'd have to check on that with D'Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now he was, he never talked about where he was from either?
Speaker 2: My granddad?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was from Mississippi, but I don't recall a thorough discussion of what part because again, they were very much in the present.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was very religious.
Speaker 1: Okay, your dad?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my grandmother.  My granddad was, and my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Oh, let me get your grandmother's name too on that side.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: On my dad's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: His mother died at a very early age.  He never got to know her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he had a stepmother.  His stepmother was Mary Bailey.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: We referred to her as Sister.  I don't know why we came up with the name Sister, but we always referred to her, nicknamed Sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158551
Speaker 1: Now what was your mother [Willella Jefferson Bailey] like?  She seemed to be enterprising too, you know, in a lot of ways.  You said your father was somebody's always--
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was very enterprising.  As I told you, she, in the sense that she went out and go licensed as a barber went into nursing school, made the necessary sacrifices to become a nurse.
Speaker 1: Were your parents out of the home a lot working?  I know a Pullman porter always is, he's always out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He [Bailey's father, Walter Bailey, Sr.] looked forward to getting that call from the, from the railroad telling him he, to make a certain schedule.  They would get called to report.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what his route was, from here to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Here to Chicago and New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess he was on the City of New Orleans they called it, the train.
Speaker 2: Yes, the City of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay, Pullman porters daily don't get a lot of sleep.  That's the main complaint they have, why it's so tough.  Did he sleep a lot when he came home?
Speaker 2: No, not, I mean he got his fair share but he wasn't a big sleeper.  I mean, he was very active in terms of enjoying entertainment, loved to play checkers, and dance and have fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he would enjoy taking us to ball games, my brother and I.  He enjoyed taking us on trips on the train.
Speaker 1: How far would you go?
Speaker 2: We'd do the run with him to Chicago.  I don't recall if we went to New Orleans or not with him.
Story_ID: 158552
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' [Willella Jefferson Bailey and Walter Bailey, Sr.] personalities, dispositions and talents, who do you think you take after the most?  Even in terms of looks.
Speaker 2: Probably my mother.
Speaker 1: And why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Well, she was one given to reasoning a lot and thinking matters through and had a good intellectual discipline about herself.  And my dad was a, Walt, Sr., was a bit more given to the fun and emotional side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you're the oldest of the two brothers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're, how much older than the younger?
Speaker 2: About a year and two, three months.  I was born in August, he was born in November I believe.  In November.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The next year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have a birthday coming up next month and he has a birthday coming up in November.
Speaker 1: That's a little over a year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you basically grew up together and--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Story_ID: 158553
Speaker 1: My earliest childhood memories consisted of going to Rosebud private school [Memphis, Tennessee].  It went from the kindergarten through the fifth grade.
Speaker 2: Rosebud private school, huh?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Not a public school?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So your parents had to pay tuition?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: From K [kindergarten] to--
Speaker 1: --through five.
Speaker 2: --through five, okay.  Now, do you have a, in retrospect, I mean was that til, I mean that spoke to some kind of commitment, right, on the part of your parents to give you a better education than you could get in a public school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My grandfather [D.A. Bailey] was, he couldn't read or write.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he was an excellent carpenter, and could do, he could build homes and did primarily maintenance work, for a woman by the name of Mattie Ford [ph.], who was a woman that had, white woman, that had a number of low income housing units and he would do the maintenance work on them.  He had a car, a T Model Ford [Ford Model T].
Speaker 2: Now this is your grandfather Bailey?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And he had a store.
Speaker 2: He had a store?
Speaker 1: We called it stand at the time.  It was just a little neighborhood store with a big oil drum for people who needed oil for cooking purposes.
Speaker 2: Oh, cooking oil?
Speaker 1: Yeah, cooking oil.  Yeah, drum, and they'd come in and buy oil that was out in the big oil drum out in front of the store.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he would--it was the neighborhood sundry, canned goods, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Things you couldn't grow, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: Anything you couldn't--he would sell can goods, cookies, things of that sort, candy.
Speaker 2: 'Cause of the school kids that would come by after school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Drinks.  He built the store himself and the store was next door to where we lived.
Story_ID: 158554
Speaker 1: Describe the house you grew up in?  Did you grow up in the same house the whole time?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first home that I recall we grew up in when we were very small was a, was on Ford Place [Memphis, Tennessee] and a duplex, outdoor toilet facilities on the back porch, and we lived there for a number of years until my parents [Willella Jefferson Bailey and Walter Bailey, Sr.], the living room, front living room was their bedroom, and, of course, my brother and I slept in the same bed, which was the next room, and then, of course, there was the kitchen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's, what you're describing is called a shotgun house, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Shotgun house, with three rooms and one, two, three in a room.  So that's the first place you lived in?
Speaker 2: That I recall.  It's not the first place.  I think we moved from one other site, but I don't recall exactly, where we were so small when we moved there on Ford.  And, of course, we had a tin tub to bathe and kettle, water kettles to heat water.  For refrigeration we used bought ice, iceboxes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's where they sell, the ice man would come.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the ice man would come down the street.  We'd buy ice from the ice man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my father, I mean my grandfather [D.A. Bailey], decided to build on a vacant lot that was about three, four doors up, and he built, he built a beautiful, a nice home.  It too though was, was a shotgun, a duplex.
Speaker 1: So, like two of them together.  And did your grandfather and your grandmother live on one side, and you all--
Speaker 2: No, they lived in a home three buildings up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from us, but he built the home that we moved up to.  The one I just described with the indoor toilet facilities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the room wasn't that much greater, just that it had indoor plumbing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But it, well it was, naw, I guess it was about the same size when you really got down to it.  Maybe a little larger, much prettier, and it was painted white, and that's why I guess I thought it was so much prettier.
Speaker 1: So was the store attached to that home?
Speaker 2: No, the store stood alone, but it was next door to that home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were most of the other houses in the neighborhood about on the same order?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on that street.
Speaker 1: Now this was in South Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: South Memphis, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158555
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the neighborhood and, we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sights of grow up, sounds of growing up, and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: One smell I will always remember is that first duplex I mentioned that we, in which we lived, there were people who moved there, in fact a number of people moved on our street from Mississippi, from rural Mississippi, 'cause these were low-income homes, and the people next door had a, I think they had personal hygiene issues.  I mean there was a stench that came out of that house that I will always remember.  Strong offensive odor.
Speaker 1: Was that like a typical problem when people would move from way out in the country into the city?  I mean, would you say?
Speaker 2: It's wasn't nothing common.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Just wondered.
Speaker 2: Because they brought with them all of the rural shortcomings in terms of trying to adjust to an urban environment.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know even now when we talk about, you know--
Speaker 2: Girls would use snuff, some of them, and they would just brought with them the rural ways.
Speaker 1: You mentioned the galvanized tubs, I remember those days, you know, people didn't take a bath as often.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  I mean, the whole weekends.
Speaker 1: Probably all the kids lined up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights, across the street from us I recall there was an elderly man and his wife, and he would sit out in the yard and he had a tendency to have a problem with his bowel control, and flies would accumulate around him.  That--also across the street, we had a--there was a man who, a family that where the dad had a mule and a wagon and he would haul things with the mule and wagon and he had one arm and an artificial, had a brace on the other arm with a hook.  Not with a hook, with the whatever you call those.
Speaker 1: Like a pincher like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And he was mean to that mule.  I mean he would really beat that mule.
Speaker 1: I guess, now today, you know, people had trucks and stuff like that.  In the '40s [1940s], it was uncommon to see a mule in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, this mule lived at that house, in their backyard, on that wagon.  I mean that was his enterprise.  And also across the street we had a young man who had some mental issues, and we used to laugh at him all the time because of his bizarre conduct.  But again these people all were recent immigrants from the rural South.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you say a lot of the people that were in your neighborhood, were recent up from the South?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Rural agricultural kind of environments.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the name of your, did your neighborhood have a name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was just considered part of South Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Mississippi Walker is about, what we referred to it as 'cause that was the major intersection and everybody would--
Speaker 1: Oh, Mississippi and Walker.  Okay.  Everybody has, easily there is a name for neighborhoods.
Story_ID: 158556
Speaker 1: So you were at private school until the fifth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Rosebud [Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Rosebud.
Speaker 1: How was that?  Was that a--now this was a school that was founded by some member of the black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know who the founder was?
Speaker 2: A lady, as I recall, her name was Miss--we referred to her as Miss Jordan, J-O-R-D-A-N.  And there was a one-room facility.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So about as many students that could fit in one big room?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We would be segmented, of course.  But for the most part, we were all in the same room.
Speaker 1: So all the grades one through five would be in one room?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how many students do you think there was altogether you think?
Speaker 2: Weren't that many.
Speaker 1: Would you say fifty, forty?
Speaker 2: I'd say around forty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And a goal, I don't expect you to have known then, but I guess in retrospect I'm asking was the goal then to do something that a public school was not doing?
Speaker 2: My father [Walter Bailey, Sr.], I mean my grandfather [D.A. Bailey] was a real promoter of this private school notion.  He thought that we couldn't get a good education in the public school system for some reason.  Don't ask me why, I can't tell you.  That was his belief.  I think tuition must have been around ten to fifteen dollars  a month.
Speaker 1: Now, oh, when you first raised the name of the school, you mentioned a white woman that he worked for doing maintenance on her buildings and such.  What role did she play in the school at all?
Speaker 2: Not the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She would pick him up and take him around to the various properties from time to time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she had nothing to do with the school in terms of tuition or anything like that.  Because you raised her right after you mentioned the school, that's why I thought she had something to do with it.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Well we won't talk about her.  But it was your grandfather's idea to make sure that you all went to Rosebud?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because he didn't believe in the public education system.
Speaker 1: He didn't think it was good enough?
Speaker 2: That was his notion, that you couldn't, and, of course, he wasn't equipped to properly make that evaluation because he couldn't, he was illiterate.  He signed his name with an 'X.'
Speaker 1: So, you think he might have had a bad experience in the public school himself?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  And one of my close friends, current close friend went to Rosebud too, Ricks Mason [ph.].  And his folks sent him there for the same reason I suspect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to look forward to, when I was around, I guess, third or fourth grade, going to school with lunch pail smelling the prepared food.  It was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now, a favorite teacher.  I don't know if you had more than one, but I--
Speaker 2: There were two teachers in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Two teachers.  So was Mrs. Jordan a teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The other one was Miss Williams [ph.].
Speaker 1: So you didn't have a favorite of the two of them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you looking forward to going to public school?
Speaker 2: It was almost like home schooling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In a sense.
Speaker 1: Were you looking forward to going to public school?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean I was content with where I was.  And when we graduated from Rosebud, of course, I graduated and then my mother [Willella Jefferson Bailey], my brother was in the fourth grade, I was in the fifth grade, and I graduated from fifth grade, she instead of waiting for my brother [HM D'Army Bailey] to graduate from the fifth grade by allowing him to remain there another year, she sent both, had both of us, or enrolled both of us into LaRose Elementary [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: This was, what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: LaRose, L-A-R-O-S-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158557
Speaker 1: Now when you go to Larose [Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], did you find that you were ahead or behind or the same level?
Speaker 2: Well, she [Willella Jefferson Bailey] put our grades up.  She doctored the enrollment, I mean the cards to reflect that we were a grade higher because when you, she felt that coming from Rosebud [private school in Memphis, Tennessee] that they would put us back a year.  So in order for us to get in the right year, she doctored the cards making it appear that we were a grade, coming from Rosebud, a grade higher than we were.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  What did they do?
Speaker 2: They didn't put us back, but they got it straight that we, that I was, just gotten out of the fifth and my brother out of the fourth.
Speaker 1: So they had you in your right grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did you feel?  Did you feel you were ahead or behind the other students, or about the same?
Speaker 2: Well, I felt that we were about the same.  I used to get into a lot of fights when I moved over to, when I enrolled in LaRose.
Speaker 1: What were they about?
Speaker 2: Well, you had kids from some of the other neighborhoods and they tended to pick on me a time or two.  I remember sticking one guy in the arm with my pencil and biting another guy.  I always got the blame as being the aggressor or the bad guy because of the wounds I would afflict on them, on the assailants.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they would do the talking and you would do the wounding?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I never will forget I got in a fight with one guy and he, I bit him, and his buddy, as soon as the teacher left about two or three days later, jumped up and slapped me and then I hit with a, I stuck him in the arm with a pencil, and it, then we'd get, I got into a couple of fights in the, in the boys' room, the toilet there, but I would always have a couple of guys.  I punched him in the eye on two occasions.  One of them had, they had swollen eyes so that they referred to me as the eye man.  But again, it was because I, I think I got picked on more coming from Rosebud private school and I guess I didn't, I had to really, I didn't fit, I didn't quite fit in.
Speaker 1: Now were these, these were kids in your neighborhood, right, that you, did you know these kids already?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They came from a different side of the track.  I mean when I say side of the track, I mean they lived in different sections.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Larose was your neighborhood school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Larose was the neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: But they came from a different neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause you were in the same neighborhood, I mean you knew kids in your neighborhood that went to that school I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then there was another private school in the neighborhood.  Actually, there were two other private schools in the neighborhood.  I can't recall the name of one.
Speaker 1: I've heard of, people I've interviewed this week have mentioned a Mrs. Rice's [ph.] kindergarten and Mrs. Snails' [ph.] kindergarten.
Speaker 2: No, this one, this one went, the other school in the neighborhood, private school, went to the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And so these went all the way through.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then, or course, there was a Catholic school in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Was that Saint, that wasn't Saint Cyprian was it?
Speaker 2: I don't recall the name of it.  It think it was Father Bertrand [School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It went from K [kindergarten] through twelve.
Speaker 1: You started at Larose's by 1950, I guess.  You were ten or eleven.
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: You started sixth grade, it must be '51 [1951]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-one [1951].
Story_ID: 158558
Speaker 1: When you grew up, I mean were you aware of what was going on in the world when you, I mean as a kid, in terms of reading the paper, magazines, newspapers, you know, the radio.
Speaker 2: Not really because I was very much into football.  I guess I got into football when I was about the sixth grade, we used to play football in the neighborhood.  Football and baseball because my dad [Walter Bailey, Sr.], in fact, we had a baseball team, a neighborhood baseball team.  There were several neighborhood baseball teams.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your neighborhood team?
Speaker 2: I wanna say, I don't recall.  But we had uniforms and my dad pitched in to help buy the uniforms.  He was really happy to be associated with the neighborhood baseball team.
Speaker 1: Did your neighborhood play other neighborhoods, in a league or something?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And neighborhood baseball was big then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is different from little league they talking about now, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was little league.
Speaker 1: It was little league?
Speaker 2: Well, when you say little league, I mean it was, we called it sandlot baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it was organized by league, but it wasn't school sponsored.  Individuals developed teams.  We went to companies and got sponsorship of uniforms.
Speaker 1: Was there a major company that sponsored your team?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so now.
Speaker 1: All right.  Just a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Well wait a minute, there was a Qualls Funeral Home that sponsored--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a team with uniforms.
Speaker 1: I know in those days some teams were sponsored by Odd Fellows, the Elks, or another team might be sponsored by the Dukes, you know, or in this case Qualls Funeral Home sponsored, put up most of the money.
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: So you had uniforms and everything?
Speaker 2: We had uniforms.
Speaker 1: What position did you play in baseball?
Speaker 2: I tried to play second base.  I didn't fair too well at it, but I did the best I could.
Speaker 1: Now second base happens to be the position of Jackie Robinson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you see yourself in that, you know, mold?
Speaker 2: Kind of, yeah.  Well, I couldn't pitch and I wasn't very good at being a catcher, so I had, I picked the infield, I picked second base.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were some kids who could really play baseball and I, they overshadowed me and I just didn't get much of an opportunity to play.
Story_ID: 158559
Speaker 1: But you were good at football?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was good at football.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I say this because I know you played football at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], you know, you must have been good if you played in college, so, what position did you play in football?
Speaker 2: We started off with neighborhood football, as I said, in sixth, seventh grade.  And I played on the line.  We didn't have any equipment, we just played sand lot football.
Speaker 1: So you played tackle without any pads or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We was kids though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Wasn't any real threat of any broken limbs or anything of the sort at that level.
Speaker 1: So were you a lineman in high school too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What'd you play, guard, tackle, center?
Speaker 2: I played, in fact, I left, I would leave Larose [Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee], I had to, I worked out an arrangement with Booker Washington High School [Memphis, Tennessee] which was very close to Larose, where I could leave school around 2:30 and go over and practice in preparation for my freshman year at Booker Washington.  I was very proud to have my football shoes hanging off my shoulders as I went to school at Larose because I was captain.
Speaker 1: So they were getting you involved while you were in grade school playing high school ball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You must have really been good, huh?  Were there other students that they used that they brought over too?
Speaker 2: There were two of us like that.  They brought me from Larose and then there was a kid from Porter School that they allowed, that they had an arrangement with that had him practicing, coming over during the fall, during spring training, that's what it was, spring football training.
Speaker 1: Who were the football stars in the community when you were growing up?  I mean did you idolize any guys that were playing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  They had, I idolized them by their reputation.
Speaker 1: Can you name any of them right now?
Speaker 2: One guy was a quarterback at Saint Augustine [School, Memphis, Tennessee].  Oh, Saint Augustine was the name of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that Catholic school.  It wasn't Father Bertrand [School, Memphis, Tennessee], it was Saint Augustine in the neighborhood.  There was a guy called Gip, G-I-P.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I idolized my cousin who was a, Eddie Bailey [ph.], who was a tackle on Grover Washington's football team.
Story_ID: 158560
Speaker 1: Now when you were in school, how were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: They were fair.  I didn't concentrate on them.  I was rather mischievous.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So given to mischief.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So you didn't concentrate a lot on your grades in grade school at all?
Speaker 1: In grade school I did more of that because my parents [Walter Bailey, Sr. and Willella Jefferson Bailey] stayed on me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] you concentrated less?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: High school, I concentrated less because I was so into football and social organizations and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: So what else were you involved in in high school?
Speaker 1: That was my passion, football, and I got, I became star and all-Memphis [Tennessee] and gridiron great in high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, the photo I got of Elvis [Presley] with me is one where I was getting a football award by WDIA radio station recognizing the gridiron greats and I was backstage to receive, coming to brought on to be given a presentation and Elvis was back there, back stage watching the concert, the musical event that was appearing.  So we both happened to be backstage at the same time.
Speaker 2: That was a big deal.  We're talking about 1950--
Speaker 1: '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: This was when Elvis was first coming out, '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was my last year of high school when I took the picture with him.
Speaker 2: Now how in the world, you played line, you're a lineman?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And what position on the line did you play again?
Speaker 1: I played guard.
Speaker 2: Guard, all right.  And did you play both ways?
Speaker 1: Offensive and defensive.
Speaker 2: Offense and defense?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was captain of my football team my last year.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what did you play on defense?
Speaker 1: Guard, nose guard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Over a center.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: If we played a five, four defense.  If we played a six man line defense, I played over the guard in front of him, of course.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I'm thinking like there aren't many lineman that get a lot of credit, you know, big credit and become a star and such.  So you must have really been good?
Speaker 1: I had a reputation for penetrating the line.  I had developed a technique that was very unusual in terms of getting back to the quarterback.  And I had, also had that reputation in college.  I had pretty much worked that out to a science.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What would you do, what would you do?  How would you do it?
Speaker 1: It was all timing and stunting, especially on nose guard.  In the nose guard position I did a lot of stunting and especially on parts.  In fact, we, in the championship game we lost in high school, which was my last game, we got beat 9-7 I believe it was where they gave up two points, the Melrose [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] did, the high school that we were playing for the city championship.  They gave up two points for fear that I would block the punt, the back, they were in the, inside their own ten and instead of punting out, they gave us two points.
Speaker 2: And so you all won the championship?
Speaker 1: No, we lost.
Speaker 2: You lost it?
Speaker 1: We lost it, 'cause it was 9-7.
Speaker 2: 9-7, okay.  It's more like a baseball score or something.
Speaker 1: All because, as I've said before, because they didn't, they chose not to gamble on kicking out of the end zone when giving up the two points 'cause I really had, I had it down to a science in terms of penetrating the line.  And, I would wrap myself up in my arms and leg with shin guards to keep, because I, I got spiked so many times on line, you know you falling and people running on your leg and your arms, so I'd take white tape and wrap my arms, my shin guard around both my arms and my leg and you see coming across that line my arms stretched out chasing the quarterback.
Story_ID: 158561
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Booker T. Washington [High School, Memphis, Tennessee], right?  It's a black school, and segregated school, right, in those days?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Very much so.
Speaker 1: In the sense that you couldn't even play inner high school sports with the white schools, in Memphis [Tennessee], right, in the same public school system.  So what would you play, the other black schools, Manassas?
Speaker 2: Manassas [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and Melrose [High School, Memphis, Tennessee], Hamilton [High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: St. Augustine [High School, Memphis, Tennessee]. Douglass [High School, Tennessee] (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay, there are five, six black schools in Memphis?
Speaker 2: So far I've named-I think I've touched them all.
Speaker 1: I think so.  Now Carver [G.W. Carver High School, Memphis, Tennessee] was new, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Carver didn't exist when I--
Speaker 1: Carver didn't exist did it?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you said Melrose, you said Hamilton.
Speaker 2: Douglass.
Speaker 1: Douglass, Manassas,
Speaker 2: Manassas.
Speaker 1: St. Augustine.
Speaker 2: St. Augustine, St. Augustine they called it.
Speaker 1: St. Augustine.  All right.  I guess it depends on where you're from (unclear).  Okay, now, all right, but you had a nice little league there, five teams, I guess.
Speaker 2: Six teams.
Speaker 1: Did you have to go out of the city to play any teams?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think, did we ever go out of the city to play?  I mean, not local, but we played, we played a couple of local, I mean not local, but as I recall we went to, we played a Coahoma Junior College [Clarksdale, Mississippi], a couple of junior colleges, but they weren't in our league, and they were--
Speaker 1: Like an exhibition game or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --outer league game.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 158562
Speaker 1: So, what else did you do in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] outside of play football, and let's see, you concentrated on that, but did you take the college prep course?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You took the general course?
Speaker 2: General courses.
Speaker 1: And were you in any other clubs or did you run for class office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were a senior then, did you have a favorite teacher or did the coach serve as a mentor to you?
Speaker 2: Coach did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did he talk about anything beyond football to you?  About what you ought to be doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he got on us about keeping the grades up and cause I enjoyed flirting with girls when I was in high school.  We have the social clubs and they were truly social clubs because they would, we'd have events at night clubs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where liquor is sold?
Speaker 2: No, you couldn't buy liquor then.  You had to brown bag whatever you had in liquor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Memphis [Tennessee] was dry?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Shelby County [Tennessee] was beer?  Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't dry, you could buy packaged liquor, but it wasn't liquor by the drink in these places.  In fact, and we, I had cousins who were older than I in high school at Booker Washington, and they were very fair complexion, I was very dark complexion, and the one football coach, he used to refer to--of course they were seniors out there and I was a freshman coming on.  And one of the coaches used to refer to one of them, he'd say black Bailey or white Bailey.  I mean in good fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't an insult.  He didn't do it as a, he wasn't being derogatory, just having fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158563
Speaker 1: Now were you and your brother [HM D'Army Bailey] very close growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know you're in the same house, but--
Speaker 2: In high school we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  It's just a year's difference.  Now, did he play football too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He went out one year for practice and I encouraged him not to because he couldn't keep up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did radio broadcasts at one of the local radio stations and had a little high school radio show talking about events, high school events.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you're a senior then, you are a football star and the captain of the football team, you all go to the championship game, barely lose it, you know--
Speaker 2: I was highly recruited by all of the major black colleges.
Speaker 1: Those were the days too when black athletes, especially in the South, they go to a black college.  It's so different now with all the major (unclear) Alabama, all of them, but there weren't any black students in the major white state colleges (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, no not in the South.  No black athletes in the South at any college.
Story_ID: 158564
Speaker 1: Okay. Now was there a discussion in your home about the Civil Rights Movement and what was going on and--
Speaker 2: No, it hadn't started then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is 1959, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Montgomery bus boycott came in '56 [1956], you know, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was on the news.  Did they show Dr. King on TV here?
Speaker 2: I wasn't familiar with Dr. King when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know I heard in some states they actually blacked him out, you know, they didn't have the local, the national coverage of CBS, NBC would have in that city in the south.  That might be the reason why you didn't know him.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did you read the Tri-State Defender when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, your household was pretty apolitical I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That just kind of surprises me, your father [Walter Bailey, Sr.] being a porter and traveling around so much.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but his head wasn't into politics.  He enjoyed his pleasures.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158565
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior then, what were your prospects?  What did you see yourself doing next, you say you saw yourself playing high school, I mean college--
Speaker 2: I saw myself going to, and I chose Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] because I really wanted to go to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] but my grades weren't adequate, so I said well I'll go to the biggest black university in the country, and that's why I chose Southern.  It was the biggest.  Still is, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Southern's football team--
Speaker 2: Of course, they ain't black now.  It's, it's integrated to some extent.
Speaker 1: To some extent.
Speaker 2: Technically it's integrated
Speaker 1: Yeah, technically it's integrated.
Speaker 2: Except the law school.  The law school is difficult.  It has probably as many whites as black students.
Speaker 1: Now who, did the coach from Southern come up and talk, or did you go down and visit?
Speaker 2: Well, Southern recruited a number of very good players out of the high schools and they went there.  So when they would come back and work with us and, of course, they constituted the pipeline to the recruitment efforts of the coaches down there at Southern.
Speaker 1: Okay, like ambassadors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So some of the ex, the former Booker T. [Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] students would come back and talk to you about going.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did they offer you a full scholarship?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Absolutely.  I had scholarships, several of them.  I had the pick of my choice among the black colleges.  Many coaches came and sat on my front porch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did your parents think of all of that?  Were they excited?
Speaker 2: Oh, they--very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158566
Speaker 1: So you went down into Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in was that, 1958?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fall of '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you like it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I mean I was just amazed at that college environment.  Pretty girls and--
Speaker 1: Now who was the coach of Southern when you were there?
Speaker 2: Munford.  I think he spelled it M-U-M-F-O-R-D, Coach Mumford [Arnette William "Ace" Mumford].
Speaker 1: Mumford, okay.
Speaker 2: And Rob, and Bob Lee who was the assistant coach from Memphis [Tennessee].  Coach Brown.
Speaker 1: They were all there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were all there.  Very good coaches.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went down and started practicing, probably early before the rest of the students--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we went down in August.  It was hot.  The dormitories weren't air conditioned.
Speaker 1: This is Baton Rouge [Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: I remember the mosquitoes were just awful because we were on a swampy area of the Mississippi down there on the bluff, where Southern was located, is located.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the band?  Was Southern's band as good as (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Southern had a great band.  The band was nationally known.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well tell me, did you have a good season that year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had great players.  Some of our players, some of the players, a number of them enjoyed pro recruitment.
Story_ID: 158567
Speaker 1: Who was there that went to the pros when you were there?
Speaker 2: We had, at that time you had two leagues, you had the NFL and AFC, I believe it was.
Speaker 1: AFL.  It was a league, American Football League.  It was the rival, a new rival to the NFL.
Speaker 2: And a number of our players got recruited by the AFL.
Speaker 1: Did you remember who?  What are their names?
Speaker 2: I can visualize them, but I can't recall their names.  One guy would tackle, big guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's alright.
Speaker 2: You know as time goes by--
Speaker 1: It was a (unclear) from Rome I think that the American Football League recruited more of the black college players than the National Football League did.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we used to hear the names, Abner Haynes and all those guys from Texas, what they call (unclear).
Speaker 2: Alan Ladd, not Alan Ladd, Aaron Ladd [sic, Ernie Ladd].  In fact, we played against him, I played against him three years, I believe, and I remember having to go and trap him, you know.  Trapping means, I don't know whether, means a pulling guard comes out of the line on offense and sneaks down the line and block the unsuspecting tackle to help open the hole, and Aaron Ladd [sic] was a tackle.  And I had to go and block him, open up the whole traffic.
Speaker 1: He was like six--how tall was he?
Speaker 2: He was tall.  And they had some good players in our league.  It was the Southwest Conference.
Speaker 1: You had like Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: Grambling, Florida A&M [University, FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Was Bob Hayes playing for Florida A&M then?  I believe he was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.  In fact, we played against Bob Hayes.  And I think I stepped on his ankle or something.
Speaker 1: These are (unclear) for those who are listening.  Tell us what the significance of Bob Hayes was.
Speaker 2: He was the world, was the world class runner.  He held a number of track records.  He was a damn good football player with that speed.
Speaker 1: I think at the time he was the world's fastest human.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Homer Jones, Gloster Richardson, Frank Pitts and a whole bunch of guys.  Okay, so you all really had a tough conference.
Speaker 2: In fact, we were the national champs by, I believe my second year in college at Southern.
Speaker 1: I know you remember the Bayou Classic?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Explain what that is.
Speaker 2: Between Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Grambling, but it wasn't quite as celebrated as it is now.  I mean now it's really a huge marketing deal, but then it was just rivalry between the two colleges.
Speaker 1: When you look back on it, do you think the black colleges in those days had, were analogous to the Negro Leagues back in the old days in terms of having some of the best players, you know, in the country?
Speaker 2: We had some great players.  In fact, Southern had great players in baseball.  Lou Brock [Louis Clark "Lou" Brock] came from Southern.  Had great basketball players.  I don't recall who.  Not quite as well known for basketball as football.
Story_ID: 158568
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, at some point down there, you kind of woke up to academics, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  What happened was, I went down with the notion of being a, coming back and coaching a high school football team.  That was my, the coaches were my idols, and who had gone down and come back and, I just couldn't envision myself coaching a football team, with all the admiration that went with it from people in the community and that sort of thing, but my first year, even though I was an outstanding player, of course, I made the second unit my first year.  And, but I didn't run with athletes.  I hooked up with, my association involved a guy out of Chicago [Illinois]-- and a fellow out of New Orleans [Louisiana], a guy in East St. Louis [Illinois].  We thought we were cool.  And I thought the football players were just too slow for me on the social scene, and I was into jazz, enjoyed jazz, had a great affection for the females on campus, so I was--kinda got into a little trouble too.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Even though I had a meal card, there were some guys who, who stole some meal cards out of the business office and I ended up buying one and selling mine, because I had one, as an athlete, which was free.  But I sold mine and then bought this one at such a low price, had a little profit margin, so all of us who had the bad meal, the stolen meal cards, ended up being disciplined.
Speaker 1: What happened, who, I mean what did they do to you?
Speaker 2: A couple of day suspension for people on the peripheral like me, who did such a silly, if not a stupid thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your second year your brother [HM D'Army Bailey] came down too, right?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  I got into a little academic problems too when I first got to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] because I wasn't studying as I should, wasn't applying myself, enjoying the, I was too busy enjoying the pleasures that the university provided.  But fortunately I was running with the right guys, hanging out with them and they were into books, and they were talking current events, and [John F.] Kennedy's presidential bid and all that sort of thing and I didn't want to be the dummy in the crowd, so I started reading.  In fact, I got on probation my first year my grades were so poor 'cause I wasn't doing anything, wasn't applying myself.
Speaker 1: But could you still play football with the grades you had?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In fact what happened is I got on probation my first semester.  My second semester I didn't make enough, my grades weren't high enough to bring me off probation and I was supposed to have been booted out, but I was such an outstanding athlete, had some great potential and my head coach intervened with the dean of students and they gave me another shot at getting off probation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It has as its privileges, so--
Speaker 2: So then I really got into reading then.  I mean, I really, public events and public affairs and I changed my major from political science, I mean from, from physical education, well I was flunking (laughter).  I changed my major, I couldn't even, I think I flunked health.  So I changed my major from physical ed [education] to political science and people thought I was nuts.  Some of my friends did, you know, here I am flunking health and education over there physical ed and talking about political science where you got to do a lot of reading and going into liberal arts.  We went from physical ed to liberal arts, from general education to liberal arts.
Speaker 1: That is a jump. That is a jump.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was quite a jump, remarkable jump.
Story_ID: 158569
Speaker 1: Right. So were there any teachers that kind of stand out in terms of their teaching (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  There was one guy named Adolph Reed [Sr.], very controversial figure.  In fact, his son [Dr. Adolph Reed, Jr.] is a Ph.D. on the intellectual scene now.  I mean nationally.  Adolph was on the international, I mean the national scene as an intellectual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Dr. Adolph Reed was there and he said--
Speaker 2: He wasn't a doctor then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just Adolph Reed?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  But he was a very, most controversial professor on the campus [Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in political science.
Speaker 1: What did he say that was controversial?
Speaker 2: Well, he was, as I recall, a, he scorned religion, and he would constantly chide the evils of capitalism and he always thought black folks were duped into being religious.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The students loved him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his colleagues loved him.  I mean he was the gadfly.
Story_ID: 158570
Speaker 1: Now did the administration, the president of Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] at that time was Felton--
Speaker 2: [Dr.] Felton G. Clark.
Speaker 1: --G. Clark.  And tell us a little bit about him.  I know he, there is quite a bit of history about him.
Speaker 2: Felton Clark was committed and dedicated to running a good university, and proud to be head of good university, excellent university, but he resisted students' efforts to pioneer for a clamor for social change within a university setting.
Speaker 1: Now his father [Joseph Samuel Clark] had been the president before him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he was like a favorite son?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Absolutely.  And therein was the conflict.
Speaker 1: And (unclear), I been down there and it's a tight community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is a tight community.
Speaker 1: Everybody is like a big family.
Speaker 2: It was Southern Heights where all the faculty live, members live, out in Scotland.
Speaker 1: Scotlandville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Scotlandville, yeah.  Teachers weren't involved in any kind of social engineering like demonstrations and that sort of thing.  So it made Adolph Reed [Sr.] a real stand-out gadfly with lots of guts.  He had a drinking problem, but anybody who went through political science (unclear) talked about Adolph Reed sometimes.  He was--
Speaker 1: Now Thomas Fine [sic, HM Thomas N. Todd] who we've interviewed, he was another HistoryMaker, he's an attorney and a well-known spokesman on college campuses around the country.  Was Thomas Fine there?  How far was he (unclear).
Speaker 2: He was about, Tom have been about three grades ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Getting back to Dr. Clark, Dr. Clark played his role well, was well-respected by the legislature and State Board of Education under which that had jurisdiction over Southern, unlike LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So this is a significant difference.  These are both state institutions, almost like occupying, adjacent to each in the Baton Rouge area.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You got LSU, Louisiana State University, and Southern University which is basically the colored school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Both of them are supported by the State.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you're saying that LSU didn't have to answer to state authority--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --whereas Southern--
Speaker 2: had its own board.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was a white, I mean a State Board--
Speaker 2: of Trustees over there with LSU.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the governing body of Southern was what?
Speaker 2: The State Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Which was, did, were there any black people on there?
Speaker 2: No, absolutely not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all white State Board of Education in a paternalistic fashion dictated--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They kept tight reins on the activities of Southern in terms of any social disturbances of pioneering by the students.
Speaker 1: And, here's Dr. Felton Clark with a Ph.D. from a northern school, I think Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] or someplace, which is better educated than a lot of the professors at LSU, President, and yet he can't make his own, he has to refer to State Board of Education.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if he didn't he'd a been--and he lived on campus now.  But, if he didn't, I mean he really, if he had rebelled in any kind of way, been obstinate in any kind of way, he'd have been booted out, so he, he's very unctuous (unclear) kind of guy, very mannerable, you know, very smooth.
Speaker 1: So had he not, so he was trying to negotiate life between the State Board of Education and what the campus, the needs of students on campus were?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At the same time?  And, it's an uncomfortable position to be in I would guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 158571
Speaker 1: In comes your brother [HM D'Army Bailey].  Now tell us how, what your brother's activities were.
Speaker 2: He was, he came in and became, he was elected president of the freshman class [Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and he, he was a rebel.  And when the city movement broke out, then a handful of students, mostly guys out of the political science department, decided to challenge the order themselves, organized the students and go downtown to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and demonstrate.  And led demonstrations down there.  And, of course, they met resistance and you got [Dr.] Felton [G.] Clark trying to retain the students and keep the students disciplined for being disruptive in a community context, and he in that process, he, he had to choose sides, and he chose to side with the administration.
Speaker 1: With the State?
Speaker 2: And at their direction, he closed the university down.
Story_ID: 158572
Speaker 1: All right. Now we were talking off-camera about some of the events and you were saying that President Clark, Dr. Felton G. Clark, was portrayed in an article that Professor [Adolph] Reed [Sr.], you know, wrote for Nation magazine.  Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, the article ['Crisis on the Negro Campus'] projected, showed Felton Clark, the late Felton Clark, as a, as an individual who was standing in the way of having the social structure change, the racial social structure change and had him as a pawn of the white state board institution that governed Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And to that, and in addition to the article in the Nation magazine, he also published a letter that he wrote to Felton Clark, and that was one of the most controversial letters I've ever seen.  He talked about the administration.  It wasn't, it wasn't a personal attack on Clark, he was just, it was a personal attack on the setting and the cowardness [sic], as he saw it, of the faculty and the administration and the whole structure there in Baton Rouge, in terms of failing to want to be part of resisting the harsh existence of racial discrimination, but instead joining in, being in complicity by accommodating it.  And that's the way Dr. Reed, Adolph Reed, saw it.
Speaker 1: What was the result of--
Speaker 2: And, of course, he got fired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The administration fired him, they couldn't.  But he was a real gadfly.  Students would cut other classes to sit in on Reed's lectures.  I mean he'd fire you up.
Speaker 1: And now--
Speaker 2: And one thing, on a humorous note, he was so controversial, he would say very controversial things.  He would talk about, one of his favorite quips was he said, you know down here in Louisiana, some of you very fair complexion people call yourselves Creoles, but you really black folks with white pompous.  And, I mean, but students took it in the right vein.  Not in any sense of an indecent personal attack on their heritage or anything, but he was just, it was the way he revealed things.  He would, he had a shocker for you.  You know, he was almost like a shock jock in his classroom.  But he was, and the same thing when he would address religion.  He thought religion was just, he saw religion as being an anchor on blacks.  He thought it kept blacks duped with mystique.
Story_ID: 158573
Speaker 1: Now was there a lot of religious practice on the campus of Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: It was highly Catholic, largely Catholic.  It was a primarily Catholic community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know the state, state school as such, it was still--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, the two didn't mix.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But of course you get a heavy student population and their faith is Catholic-based.  I mean they practice their religion, not in any sense of interfering with or confusing the State.  I mean no official religion was encouraged or structured, it was just that the students, I mean pop, people were just Catholics.  Louisiana is basically is a Catholic state.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Story_ID: 158574
Speaker 1: I know the national Civil Rights Movement things were heating up--the students in North Carolina A&T [State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] conducted that sit-in in Greensboro and then you had the formation of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].  Was there a chapter there at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] by that time?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have any SNCC.
Speaker 1: How did you feel as a student locally there in Baton Rouge?  I didn't know until I went down there that LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] is so close to Southern.  Two state schools, one all white and super powerful, and the other one, you know, all black.
Speaker 2: Idempotent, Black idempotent, politically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you feel as a student, as an individual going, you know, moving around Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I, I felt at points some sense of outrage, especially after the Civil Rights Movement broke out, and I felt so bitter about the setting at one time that I, I said hell, a lot of sugar cane, cotton fields, I mean not cotton fields, a lot of sugar cane growth, agriculture is on the outskirts of Baton Rouge, and I felt, in time, I said somebody ought to take a torch and light up some of these sugar cane fields, 'cause it represented the Old South so much to me.
Speaker 1: Did you experience a lot of personal discrimination in Baton Rouge?
Speaker 2: I mean it was segregated.  We couldn't, that's why we went down to the lunch counter, marched all the way down to Baton Rouge from Scotlandville [Louisiana] to have a sit-in.
Speaker 1: Did they have the signs up and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: You mean the facilities?  No, but you knew, I mean, everybody knew it was part of the culture, segregation.
Speaker 1: So they didn't need white and colored signs on the restrooms?
Speaker 2: No.  They didn't need that on there because you knew that the order was segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you allowed to shop in the stores downtown?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could shop in the stores.  Segregation didn't mean you couldn't shop in the stores, but you couldn't use the same restroom, couldn't drink out of the same water fountains, and you didn't have any blacks working as salespeople or anything of that sort.  They were all white.
Speaker 1: So job opportunities were limited, and how did the police treat you in the Baton Rouge area?
Speaker 2: As long as you stayed in your place and didn't buck the system.  If you didn't buck the system, then you were okay.
Story_ID: 158575
Speaker 1: But now getting back to what Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] did.  Southern expelled, when it shut down the university, it had a filtering process where it permitted the re-enrollment of all the students with exception of about seven or eight.  And [HM] D'Army [Bailey], my brother, was one of those seven or eight.  They were considered the troublemakers, the leader of the movement.  And they were prohibited from re-enrolling.
Speaker 2: So he had to go finish school someplace else.
Speaker 1: Yeah, D'Army ended up going to Clark University in [Worcester] Massachusetts, and I was up front during the march and my picture was taken.  I had a beard at the time.  I wore a beard at the time and, of course, I looked menacing with a beard, I guess.  But at any rate, photographers within the new, within the police corps made it a point to take my picture.  I guess I looked different.  And I was up at the front line.  So, but, and I had trouble getting back in the university too, though they, I wasn't filtered and excluded.  My coach, because I was such a great football player, my coach insisted, they wanted to--well what happened was  there was a boycott of the university by the students then after the students were expelled, and I participated in the boycott.  I didn't think football players ought to be, during spring training, I didn't think football players ought to be out in spring training practicing and students were boycotting the university.  So my coach tried to encourage me to come back to practice and I refused.  I still didn't go, but that wasn't a big deal with him, but when I got back in (unclear), I got in law school [Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] when I got back to, so when, after, they accepted me back on campus, even though I was sort of a second-tier leader in that leadership operation, and second or third, and they felt that I shouldn't, the administration felt that I shouldn't live on campus so they told me, even though I had a full scholarship, I had to live off campus.   So I had to fend for myself in terms of providing my own housing and meal accommodations.  And my coach decided he didn't want me living off campus and he brought me back on, and he put me out there with the faculty.  I had to live in the faculty dorm.  I guess so I wouldn't stir up the students, so the faculty women complained because they said I had too many female visitors coming to my dorm, so then I got moved over the law school barracks, to the law student dorm.  And there was about six or seven law students. [HM] Thomas [N.] Todd being one of them living in that dorm. And since I was a political science major, then they start asking me what am I going to do when I graduate, and she start haranguing me on the virtues of law school.  So with the political science degree, I said well, why not, what else can I do with a political science degree?  So that's when I enrolled in law, chose to go ahead and enroll in law school.
Story_ID: 158576
Speaker 1: Now you had never thought of becoming a lawyer before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not until I got thrown off campus and required to, and end up placed in the law student dorm [at Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Now did you know any black lawyers before or had you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew those who were involved in the movement 'cause we were meeting them.
Speaker 1: Around the Baton Rouge [Louisiana] area?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Baton Rouge, New Orleans [Louisiana], they came up out of New Orleans to assist and provide representation, guide us.
Speaker 1: Can you give me the names of some of the guys.
Speaker 2: Johnnie Jones out of Baton Rouge and Lois Eli [ph.] out of New Orleans, Lois Eli.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you aware of A.W. Willis [Archie Walter Willis, Jr.] or some of the people in, or had they even got out of, he might still been, I don't know how old he was again.
Speaker 2: No. A.W. and Russell Sugarmon [HM Russell B. Sugarmon], Ben Hooks [HM Reverend Benjamin Hooks], Ben Jones and those guys were here.  They had organized the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, of course, they were and I really got to know them because when I came home during the summer I got active in the NAACP here, [HM] D'Army [Bailey] and I both.  I really got the opportunity to work with them.
Speaker 1: Now did you start doing that after you became a political science major?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was like your sophomore, junior year.
Speaker 2: This was social consciousness development.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so back at Baton Rouge here in the law students' dorm and Thomas Todd [HM Thomas N. Todd] and some of the other law students are telling you that you ought to become a lawyer?  So by that time you did have an idea of what they were doing and what was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then my admiration switched from the coaches to the civil rights lawyers.  I thought those guys were so, how should I say it, so deserving of admiration and projected such great role models.
Story_ID: 158577
Speaker 1: Now, were you recruited by the American Football League [AFL] or any of the professional teams out of Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I got a, I had a contact from Chicago Bears [Chicago, Illinois], invited to try out.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you decided not to--
Speaker 2: But my senior year, I was just fed up with football.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, I mean I was done.  Had no reflection on my playing on game day, but I found all kind of excuses not to get out there early and practice and that sort of thing, but I still was performing very well.  But, and when I graduated, I mean, I say graduated from college, I didn't graduate from college.  What happened is, when I switched my major, I had, I got credits for, under the combination program you could go to law school and after third or fourth year, I think it was ninety hours for undergrad, then you get credit toward your undergrad degree to go with your law school hours.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you really didn't graduate from Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] as such, but transferred credits in the law school [Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and were able to get your law degree.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But the only thing that kept me from getting two degrees is that I, the only thing that I couldn't pick up in law school and have applied, was foreign language courses.  And I was six hours short in foreign language.  And even though I lived on campus, I was married then.  I got married my first year in law school and I was living on campus in the married student dorm and I could have gone any summer and gotten six hours in foreign language, but I said I'm not that degree conscious.  You know I had this little rebellious thing about me.  So I never picked up my undergrad degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you got your, you went to the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee] for law school?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: No, I went to Southern.
Speaker 2: You went to Southern Law School?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Southern University Law School.
Speaker 2: Now here they got, we got a big mistake on this outline.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: I thought you had gone to Southern and really it kind of makes sense you might go to Southern but I don't know--
Speaker 1: No, I told you that's where I met [HM] Thomas [N.] Todd.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So I'm put a big line through this here and putting Southern.  So you stayed on campus and just matriculated on through.
Speaker 1: Got married, had a child my first year in law school.  My wife was an instructor.  She was (unclear) here and she transferred down to Southern.
Speaker 2: So did you meet your wife here in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Here in Memphis.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then she moved down to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: So this is, now what year is this that you start going to law school.
Speaker 2: That would have been what?
Speaker 1: 1963?
Speaker 2: '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: No, it was '63 [1963].  In '58 [1958], add four years, be '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Since 1962.  Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I graduated law school in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what degree did you hold in law school?
Speaker 2: Juris Doctorate [sic, Juris Doctor].
Speaker 1: Juris.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean Doctorate of Jurisprudence [sic, Doctor of Jurisprudence].  Juris Doctorate or Doctorate, it's the same thing.  Some call it Juris Doctorate, some call it Doctorate Juris.
Speaker 1: Right, I've heard several different versions of law school degrees.
Speaker 2: It's a J.D.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  J.D., okay. In 1965 you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158578
Speaker 1: Now when you were in law school [Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] a lot of things were jumping off on the national scene in terms of civil rights, were you involved in any of those activities?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head no).
Speaker 1: Did you go to the March on Washington [1965]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you continue to be involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just went to law school, didn't go to a single football game when I was living on campus for the three years I lived there.  When I, after my senior year in playing football, I was just through with it.
Speaker 1: What did your coach think?  Did he think you had missed out on an opportunity?
Speaker 2: No.  You mean in terms of not attending any--
Speaker 1: Yeah and just, you know, not going on in the sports.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I was too small anyway as a lineman and I played linebacker too defensively at Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] as well.  I had to, I switched around, nose guard and then linebacker, and I was just, no way I could have been a nose guard in pro ball.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: You know, my stunting wasn't going to work in pro ball and I had a lot of stunts that enabled me to get around the center and block punts and I even ran a touchdown, block a punt, picked it up and ran for a touchdown.  In college and high school.  But that kind of stunting wouldn't cut it in pro ball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not long.
Speaker 1: Some big guys in the--
Speaker 2: Especially nose guard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I surely wasn't big enough to play offensive guard.
Speaker 1: I remember Curley Culp from when he played for Kansas City [Chiefs, Missouri] maybe about three times your size.
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't have lasted five minutes.  I had no illusions about any football career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you really just dedicated yourself to law school when you were in law school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was it, tough?  Was law school tough?
Speaker 1: Well not after the first semester.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You do, I developed a studying technique and I survived, supported my family taking Polaroid pictures in night clubs, in Baton Rouge.
Speaker 2: So just an investment in a Polaroid camera was enough to--how much would you charge for a photo?
Speaker 1: I charged for black and white, I charged a dollar and for color I charged somewhere around dollar seventh-five.  A lot of profit ain't it?  Only cost me about twenty cents to make a black and white.
Speaker 2: Sounds like a good-
Speaker 1: Now color was a little different because if I didn't get the color photograph right, color photograph would cost me around, pretty close to around sixty to seventy cents.
Speaker 2: How did you get that idea to sell Polaroids in the night club?
Speaker 1: I came to Memphis [Tennessee] one summer around my junior or senior year in college and saw people doing, I mean saw a couple of guys down, around the nightclubs here taking Polaroid pictures.  Light bulb went off.  In fact, when I was in my junior and senior year in college, that's when I really started taking night, I mean Polaroid pictures.  I'd come back home and take Polaroid pictures around our night club.
Speaker 2: Did you know [HM] Ernest Withers in Memphis?
Speaker 1: Uh hum.  Oh, I knew him very well.  Knew him, very well.
Speaker 2: A famous photographer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 158579
Speaker 1: So, after you got your J.D. [degree] in '65 [1965], what did you do?  You move back to Memphis [Tennessee] immediately?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well I went down to New Orleans [Louisiana] to take the bar [exam].  My wife and I stayed down there temporarily for, no she stayed up in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and I went down and spent about a month down there.  I studied for the bar, and I missed it in my favorite course, Evidence.  So then I said, well, I'm not going to take it again.  We'll go on to Memphis [Tennessee] and I came here and passed my bar my first shot at it and I could not figure that one out.  Louisiana law was different from southern, I mean Tennessee, in a number of respects.
Speaker 1: There have been articles written about that.  I've heard lawyers discuss that.  It's based on French--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Napoleonic Code (unclear), but it's basically the same law, it's just, the concepts have different names, except for the federal law, federal law is universal all over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, most states have adopted federal procedural laws anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you passed the bar, was that the same year, in '65 [1965], or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, same year.  A few months later I came here and I took some bar refresher courses and breezed through the Tennessee Bar.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so--
Speaker 2: I guess if I had passed the Louisiana Bar I may have stayed down in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny how that happened that way.
Story_ID: 158580
Speaker 1: What did you do after you passed the bar, did you start, did you open a practice?
Speaker 2: I opened a practice at my home, and put my shingle out and Russell Sugarmon [HM Russell B. Sugarmon] and A.W. [Archie Walter] Willis, A.W. Willis in particular, says you can't do that, say you got to come on down here, we got space.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they brought you in right away?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That must have made you feel welcome?
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they organized the first integrated law school.  I believe it was in the South.  I know in this region, called Sugarmon, Lucas and Willis.  Was it Sugarmon, Thompson and Lucas?  Oh, it was Ratner, Sugarmon, Lucas and Willis.
Speaker 1: What was that first name?
Speaker 2: Ratner.
Speaker 1: Ratner?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Ratner, Sugarmon, Lucas and Willis.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did they concentrate heavily on civil rights cases?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  Ratner was a Jewish guy whose a business, practiced business and tax law, but he had, he was very social conscious.
Speaker 1: What about Sugarmon and Willis?
Speaker 2: They were active in Civil Rights Movement kind of stuff.  But Willis also was very much into real estate development and banking.
Story_ID: 158581
Speaker 1: I know I've--I have heard there was a tremendous struggle around housing in Memphis [Tennessee] in those days when you came in because of restricted covenants and that sort of thing.  They couldn't move, black folks couldn't move to certain neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: Even after the Fair Housing Act passed back there in, there was still devious ways of declining to provide housing for blacks.  In fact, I brought the first housing discrimination case.
Speaker 1: Now what year was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know what year that was.  Somewhere around that period though.
Speaker 1: Okay, between '65 [1965] and '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Beltz [ph.] Apartments where this black school teacher, male, tried to, I mean applied for residential housing.  They told him they didn't have any occupancy.  Then we sent in a couple of white people, male-female, to apply and they asked the right questions too about any problem with blacks moving in here.  They said, "No, no problem."  And we nailed them good and settled the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that case was won. What did the court order?  Was it a federal case?
Speaker 2: Federal case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 158582
Speaker 1: Louis Lucas and I got involved in the school desegregation case here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In Shelby County [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Now what county is that?
Speaker 1: Shelby, this is Shelby County.
Speaker 2: Okay, Shelby, this county, okay.
Speaker 1: There was a Shelby County school case.
Speaker 2: And that was before Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: This was '66 [1966], '67 [1967]?
Speaker 1: (nodding head yes)
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was the essence of that?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was ongoing for years.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it started up then, but it wasn't resolved?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Still, I mean there's still drifts of it out there.
Story_ID: 158583
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in 1968 coming to Memphis, Tennessee and how you came to represent Dr. King.
Speaker 2: Well, of course, being one of the civil rights lawyers.  Oh, I also, what happened was, before Dr. King came, I was big also with the American Civil Liberties Union, with ACLU.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was big in politics.  When I say big, I mean very active.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I took on causes like the Veterans Against the Vietnam War [VWAW] who wanted to distribute pamphlets out at the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee] campus, and told they couldn't do it and we filed an injunction against the University under the auspices of the American Civil Liberties Union.  And, I am, in fact, I defended the first pornography case here.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Magazine, nude magazine moved the nudity, I mean the nude magazine industry, that was the infancy of the porn, well, porn industry.
Speaker 1: These magazines were produced here in Memphis?
Speaker 2: No, no, they were produced out of Georgia I believe it was.  They guy, the distributor, the owner and distributor was out of Georgia, Mel Thesis [ph.] I believe was his name.  He's dead now.  Because of my ACLU affiliation, they hired me to defend them on local prosecution for selling girlie magazines, nude girl magazines.  So I got involved in that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: So basically defending their right to sell.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did that go?  Did you win that case?
Speaker 2: We lost the first one.  Jury found our client guilty of distribution of obscene materials and then they came right back, and he had stopped, the manager of the bookstore didn't stop selling them right down here on 2nd Street.  He didn't stop, he continued to sell his magazines.  Had his windows all blackened and everything so he wouldn't be intrusive to the general public at large, so they prosecuted him a second time.  He got a fine the first time, five thousand dollar fine.  They prosecuted him the second time, we got a not guilty verdict.  They prosecuted him a third time, we got a not guilty verdict.  So then they stopped prosecuting that girlie magazine.
Speaker 1: Did he ever get any restitution for the five thousand dollars?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Different case, jury found that material obscene.  It was in violation of the obscenity law the way the jury saw it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now we're at '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: So then I was on national, I held membership on the national American Civil Liberties Union board.  Each state has a board representative, national board representative, and then the board met every two months in New York.  I enjoyed that experience for three years.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is prior to 1968, or around 1968 when you served on the board of the national ACLU?
Speaker 1: It was '68 [1968].  It was around that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I was on the board for three years.  Mike Cody [W.J. Michael Cody], I succeeded him.  I'm just trying to think, thinking out loud.
Story_ID: 158584
Speaker 1: All right.  Now [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. comes to Memphis [Tennessee] to support the sanitation workers strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what, how did you come to represent Dr. King?
Speaker 2: I came to represent Dr. King in that during, in fact, I'm a, in that the city refused to recognize the union, the sanitation union.  And they got around to saying, well, we'll recognize the union but we won't allow for dues checkoffs.
Speaker 1: Well that's the life of the Union, right.  I mean that's financial stability of the Union.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And [Henry] Loeb was adamant about that.  He was the mayor then.
Speaker 2: So Dr. King, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC], decided to, was invited by, after the sanitation workers started, went on strike and started having marches, then they invited Dr. King to come to Memphis and lead a rally.  And Dr. King then decided, I mean, made the decision that he would come, which he did of course, and led and participated in the march and rally.  Well during that march and rally, there were disturbances.  Some of the young participants took sticks off the, they used to carry the placards, when they got around Beale [Street] and Main [Street] they started breaking windows with the sticks, and looting.  And, of course, then the march was broken up with tear gas through the powers of the law, of law enforcement.  Everybody scattered, including me, [sic, and] other people that were participating in the march.
Speaker 1: Now were those people organized in any way, because I know some had blamed invaders for this, and, did they have anything to do with or was it just some random people?
Speaker 2: It was random people in my judgment.  I don't think invaders--they weren't given to that kind of mischief, looting.  They were philosophical based.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what happened?  The city charged Dr. King with--
Speaker 2: No.  The City decided to go to federal court and enjoin Dr. King and when they did that I got a call from Louis Lucas in my law firm and I got a call from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund [later, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund], to represent Dr. King regarding the injunction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were working through the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and they retained you to--
Speaker 2: (nodding head yes)
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were able to get an injunction to--
Speaker 2: No.  We met with the judge, federal district judge Bailey Brown who issued the temporary injunction and, a preliminary injunction I should say, and he met with him and he instructed us to be back in court the next day or the day after and be prepared to argue at that point the lifting of the injunction, show cause why the injunction shouldn't continue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To prohibit the march.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So what happened?
Speaker 2: So, we were working on the injunction to get it lifted and I was in the law library over at another law firm with some other lawyers that ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] had urged to get involved as well.  And while we were in the law library working and finding the law, of course, you wouldn't have to do that now, you can get on the computer.  All the law now is on the computer.  We don't have any books any more.  We were using books then.  So while we were looking up the law, we got word around six o'clock or so, that Dr. King had been shot.
Speaker 1: How'd you feel, I mean, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, I felt just absolutely devastated.  I did, I felt devastated.  In fact, I wept.  And then I got a call from New York for an on-hand local report, people with the Legal Defense Fund, for updates in terms of his condition, and the condition surrounding, disturbance conditions surrounding Memphis.  Because then curfews went into effect and all sorts of movements being restricted by the police.  So we, after things calmed down, we then had a scheduled meeting in court regarding the injunction in place and we convinced the court to allow the march.  King was dead then, of course, to continue.  And then that's when you had all sort of, when you had all of the national prominent leadership figures to show up, to appear.
Story_ID: 158585
Speaker 1: So, now before Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, first the march where the violence took place was considered unsuccessful, right, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And people were even criticizing Dr. King about coming to Memphis [Tennessee], and after his assassination, the place filled up with people right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And keep in mind, King wasn't really held in admirable terms by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] then.  Roy Wilkins, the head of the NAACP, you know, they questioned King's tactics.  He had a lot of critics.  And then, by then before his death, right prior to his death you know King had, he was very much involved in the Vietnam War demonstrations.  And the civil rights leaders didn't want, like the NAACP, didn't want the war and the Civil Rights Movement intertwined, mixed.  And they were very critical of King for providing the leadership for the anti-Vietnam movement.
Speaker 1: I'm just curious though, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [later, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund] had defended him in the past and so they retained you.
Speaker 2: See there's a difference between the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the NAACP.  It's an outgrowth of the NAACP, and Jack Greenberg headed up the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and what's the lawyer name, I'm looking right at him, Bob Carter [HM Robert L. Carter] headed up the legal arm of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, yeah, the NAACP--
Speaker 2: Two separate entities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: The same goals and purposes, but two separate entities.
Speaker 1: There was a history of them being separated for a reason, right, in certain time frame, was set up like that?
Speaker 2: Some disgruntlement which I can't describe.  Some disagreement.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Because members who were formerly in the NAACP moved over to establish the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
Speaker 1: Right, because I didn't, the NAACP seemed to be split when we interviewed [HM] Benjamin Hooks a few years ago before he passed, he was very much, he was adamant about being against demonstrating, he said it didn't accomplish anything and he was very, you know.  Did you ever hear him talk about that, or what he thought about?
Speaker 2: Oddly enough, the NAACP figures, prominent figures here, some of them that is, Ben Hooks one of them, and I loved Ben Hooks, but I really, he and I were unalterably opposed, not unalterably opposed, but completely opposite in terms of our stand on the Vietnam War.  He having been a [U.S.] Military man who was very hawkish on the war, and NAACP president, Jessie Turner who was very hawkish on the war, and Jessie took the position that we weren't doing enough over there.  We ought to go ahead and get it over with.  Of course, I was a dove and I took the position that being a dove I didn't think we, I was just unalterably opposed to the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about the whole thing of demonstrations versus legal action and that sort of thing (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I never knew that--the leadership here wasn't out front in the King march.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know what that stems from.
Speaker 1: And so the attorneys like A.W. [Archie Walter] Willis and Russell Sugarmon [HM Russell B. Sugarmon] they weren't involved in--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they were very much involved in providing legal assistance.  Of course, the lawyer was involved in, lawyer never have been involved in terms of strategy for direct action.  That ain't the role of a lawyer and I wasn't involved in strategy for direct action.
Speaker 1: But the Memphis [Tennessee] people who were involved in that were Billy Kyles [HM Reverend Samuel Billy Kyles] I guess and some others.
Speaker 2: [HM] Maxine Smith.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Vasco Smith.
Story_ID: 158586
Speaker 1: So in the end the garbage workers didn't get--was their struggle successful?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you got a city [Memphis, Tennessee] so divided in such crisis and turmoil and controversy nationally that the powerbrokers, that is the influential people of commerce and white political leaders were persuaded and said, look, we got to abate this.  It ain't, it's not good for the city.  And when they moved in to direct hand, they put pressure on the mayor.  And had him to accede and make concessions.
Story_ID: 158587
Speaker 1: So what was the general feeling about who assassinated Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King] in Memphis [Tennessee]?  I know we've heard around the country speculated but being right here on top of it, what did you think?
Speaker 2: I don't think there was-I don't recall much argument here, or much, or many questions asked about who killed Dr. King here.  I think most of us were satisfied that it was James Earl Ray.  That they had nabbed the right guy.
Speaker 1: No big confusion about it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've heard other people in Memphis say the same thing.
Speaker 2: No, I, there hadn't been any, as I can recall, any express doubt about who killed Dr. King.  Now that doesn't allay the arguments of those who may have sound premises on why they're suspicious, that Ray did not kill Dr. King.  But that's not the prevailing mood and attitude.
Story_ID: 158588
Speaker 1: In 1972 you, now you fulfilled someone's expired term for Shelby County Commissioner [Shelby County, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And why did you decide to go into politics?
Speaker 2: Well at that time, at that point, I was thoroughly entrenched in politics anyway and been with A.W. [Archie Walter] Willis and Russell Sugarmon [HM Russell B. Sugarmon], the civil rights folks.  I even ran a voter registration project.
Speaker 1: Now Memphis [Tennessee] is a city, a southern city where black folks could vote, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It wasn't like being in Mississippi where nobody, you couldn't--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --guess how many bubbles in a bar of soap to vote?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have that problem here in Memphis.
Speaker 1: It was the heart of the mid-south, but black folks had voted since reconstruction right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Were there any procedures in place to try to keep down the number of black voters in the city?
Speaker 2: Not that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Or to disenfranchise black people?
Speaker 2: I never recall any issues about efforts to hamper or impede black voting participation.
Speaker 1: Did white politicians curry the favor of the black electorate?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was the black turnout decent at the poll?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What's the percentage basically of black people who, black voters to white voters in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: Well then.  Then and now, I guess.
Speaker 2: Then, it was predominately white.
Speaker 1: By a lot?
Speaker 2: I'd say somewhere around 60/40.
Speaker 1: And now, what would you think?
Speaker 2: Now, it's about flipped.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So black electorate is about sixty percent now and the white is about forty, in the City of Memphis?
Speaker 2: Uh hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the white people moved to the suburbs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the same patterns as a lot of major cities?  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: If not greater, but that's a good ball park estimate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well who appointed you to fulfill the expired term?
Speaker 1: I ran in a special election.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you weren't appointed, you didn't get an appointment.  You ran a special election?
Speaker 1: (nodding head yes)
Speaker 2: Okay, and did you have strong opponents when you ran?
Speaker 1: I had, I did.  There were four of us who ran the race, two blacks, two whites.  It was a small district race.  At the time there was a white female and a white male and white male was the political insider and the favorite.  And the white female didn't like him at all.  She despised him.  She called me one day while I was running in the campaign and said, look, the person, the mayor was Rijani [ph.], Louis Rijani [sic, J. Wyeth Chandler], I think, was his first name.  She said I don't like this Rijani crowd and I want to help you.  I can't win so you just tell me what I can do to help you.  I said stay in the race.  She said fine.  So she stayed in the race and sure enough there was another black in the race and she hurt Rijani more than the black in the race hurt me.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Even though they had a greater number of votes, but she really cut into him much more of his vote, his base more than the other guy cut into my base.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now I've heard the elections for county offices are a non-partisan, I mean you can't declare your--
Speaker 1: Now they are partisan.
Speaker 2: Okay, but in those days they were--
Speaker 1: Nonpartisan.  So when I got on the commission, I became chairman immediately of the reapportionment committee, or redistricting committee, based on the latest census count.
Story_ID: 158589
Speaker 1: Now what role did the new housing laws have, play in the proportion of the black voters in the City of Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Housing?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so movement of black people around the city didn't change in voting?
Speaker 2: It didn't change, the migration did.  People moved to the suburbs, but the neighborhood shift changes in Memphis in terms of the Memphis politics didn't cause much shift.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the ability of black people to move to new neighborhoods, I guess what I'm asking was there a chain reaction, when the black folks moved and white folks moved out, did that change the demographic of the city?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  That took place a lot.  When the Fair Housing Act [1968] came into existence, that is, enabling blacks to live wherever we wanted to live and blacks moving to certain neighborhoods, man, even the street that I moved on Idlewild, course I'm not there now, but when I first moved on Idlewild, it, that street was heavily white, and boy that thing is now heavily black.
Speaker 1: How fast did the white residents move?
Speaker 2: Immediately started moving because there was that shift going on.  And that was primarily a Jewish community.  A Jewish residential area with a synagogue as the centerpiece of it.  And they moved and then sold--ultimately sold the synagogue.
Story_ID: 158590
Speaker 1: I wanted to go to 1985 and talk about the Garner case [Tennessee v. Garner, 1985].  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, the Garner case stems from a period in the early '70s [1970s] when the police in Memphis [Tennessee] were very brutal in terms of the application of deadly force against young black males especially, who were involved in nonviolent felonies, and during that period, the early '70s [1970s], there were, in one month we had nine killings where individuals were running from burglaries and car thefts, nonviolent felonies, and shot and killed as a result to prevent their escape by the Memphis Police Department.
Speaker 1: Nine in one month?
Speaker 2: One month.  That was the sanction policy then.  So being passionately against that sort of stuff and again being a civil rights advocate having been based out of, I mean based from my movement activities and ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] activities, I took it upon myself to crusade and take cases, seek out cases with families who had loved ones shot and killed by policeman under those circumstances.  And, in fact, I had, before the Garner decision, I had, the Garner case I should say, I had three other cases that I had filed suit against, I mean where I filed suit against the City of Memphis and the police department.  One case involved, as an example, a Vietnam [War] veteran who burglarized a service station.  Police drove up, he took off running and they shot him into (unclear) and killed him as he was trying to get away.  Unarmed.  Another case involved a young man behind a restaurant, early in the morning and police saw a chain that was obviously broken on the back of the building door, and this young man took off running and the police shot him with a shotgun and killed him.  Shot him dead.  And there was one other situation where the police drove up on an unsuspecting burglar and the burglar took off and they stopped, don't stop, boom, they shot him, killed him.  Those were three cases I had handled so, and lost them all.  The courts took the position during that period that, federal court that heard those cases, took the position that the cops couldn't tell, that deadly force was justified, that the law then was you can use any means, any reasonable means to stop a fleeing felon.  Now it didn't say, stop a dangerous fleeing felon, it said stop any fleeing felon which means you could have stolen anything over $500 from a, and that would have been a felon, if the felon ran, suspect ran, and you decided to, you wanted to use that as a, deadly force as a measure to stop him, you were authorized under the law to do it under our state statute.  So when Garner came along, the facts of Garner came along, it was so, I was so outraged when I read about it in the newspaper the next morning.  I believe it was on Sunday morning I read about it.  Where this young sixteen [sic, fifteen] year old kid had made an effort to burglarize a house, police drove up, one came from each, he was in the back of the house, went through the back bedroom I guess, and the police, unoccupied house, broad daylight.  The police drove up and he took out running.  The kid got on a six foot, he tried to scale a six foot cyclone fence, and was shot dead right there trying to scale the fence and his hands were in clear view.  The cops knew he wasn't armed, and that young man was Robert Eugene Garner [sic, Edward Garner].
Story_ID: 158591
Speaker 1: So we took that case to, so that was the next case we filed in federal district court here [Memphis, Tennessee] and I got, had the help of Drew Days [III] with the, Drew then was the, and I'll tell who Drew is in a minute.  Drew was the, at that time he was with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund [later NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund].  In fact, they had helped me on the other cases as well.  So they were my resource backup.  Drew and I tried the case together here and, of course, put on the evidence, took many depositions of the police officer and all about their policy and training and practice in terms of unarmed fleeing felons.  So it was clearly established what the practice was, which is first, the first requirement in terms of establishing unconstitutional conduct.  You gotta show that this was sanctioned by the city policy, policy and practice of the city.  The one in question that they followed the, and of course, it was law, the legislature authorized the shoot and any means necessary stop somebody who's a fleeing felon suspect.  We lost the case before the district court, then we appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, and while the case was on appeal, Drew Days, my co-counsel, was appointed by [President] Jimmy Carter, as the United States Solicitor General.  Now what the United States Solicitor General does, he's the lawyers who argues for the United States before the Supreme Court [of the United States].  That what he does, in a white tuxedo.  That's what the Solicitor General does.  So Drew got this high appointment and then the Legal Defense Fund gave me another, assigned another lawyer to work with me.  And the Sixth Circuit agreed with us that the policy was reprehensible and unconstitutional.  Then the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court by the, after the Sixth Circuit agreed with us and overturned the District Court here.  Then the United States Supreme Court, this happened I believe in the, it was in the early, I believe it was '74 [1974] when [Edward] Garner was killed--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --But the Supreme Court rendered the decision and, after it worked its way up through the system in '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 158592
Speaker 1: So we went up and argued the case before the United States Supreme Court.  Thurgood Marshall was on the Supreme Court then.  And in a split decision, 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that you can't shoot an unarmed fleeing felon except under rare conditions, and they enumerated those rare conditions.  Number one, if his escape would pose a danger to others like a Jack the Ripper, some notorious potential killer, or if his activities while you were trying to arrest him posed a danger to the police officer and you shot in self defense or something of the sort.  But no more of that, the Supreme Court said of shooting young kids running away from crime scenes who are obviously unarmed.  And that decision has saved more lives, more lives than any, case of recent times.  I mean nationally.
Speaker 2: I think that was the case that sent Cincinnati [Ohio] up in flames a couple of years ago.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: A case of the Cincinnati police shooting an unarmed young man running away from, you know, (unclear) like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  In fact, Justice [William] Rehnquist, when the case was being argued, said well this could apply to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and the federal law enforcement officers, which, I mean, it does, that what it say.  If you in law enforcement, whether it's the FBI, CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], some sheriff in a small town, you just can't shoot people who are unarmed running from and suspect that are running from crime scenes.
Speaker 2: Now in your opinion, is this a racially kind of charged issue.  I mean how many young white men are shot running away from--were they any?
Speaker 1: No, not here in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Okay, during that period.
Speaker 1: No, you just had some trigger happy cops then.  I mean they were on the force, they were, the thing is there were, there were a just a small number, about three or four of them, that were really just trigger happy.  But they had black neighborhoods where burglaries would more than likely occur and they would snatch that shotgun off that rear panel, I mean off that front panel and unload.
Speaker 2: Now, okay, so this is a landmark court case?
Speaker 1: One of the most, in my opinion, this is one of the most important United States--I mean important court cases had been rendered.
Speaker 2: And the official name of it is?
Speaker 1: Tennessee versus Garner [Tennessee v. Garner, 1981].
Speaker 2: Okay, Tennessee versus Garner.  Okay.
Story_ID: 158593
Speaker 1: Now in 1989, you were elected chairman of the Shelby County Commission [Shelby County Board of Commissioners, Shelby County, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what does the chairman of the Shelby County Commission do?  They function almost like the mayor does of the city?
Speaker 2: No, the chairman just presides over the Commission, legislative.  He makes sure that the order is conducted within the proper (unclear) rules of protocol.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's not an executive position?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So, well, just to, you were on the Shelby County Commission for many years and getting ready, and just was reelected, you're commissioner-elect now.
Speaker 2: It's a thirteen-member body incidentally.
Speaker 1: And what's the jurisdiction of the county commissioner?
Speaker 2: The entire county.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the cities included.
Speaker 1: And how is it different from the city?  Well, yes, county-wide instead of (unclear) against the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In other words we set property taxes that include the City of Memphis [Tennessee] Collierville [Tennessee] and all the other cities within Shelby County and we provide health services for people throughout the county and law enforcement through the sheriff department, although the city has its own city police, the sheriff still is the top law enforcement officer in the county.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There are other services, of course.  We build roads, bridges.  Chief funding source for the city and the county school systems.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a county executive at all.
Speaker 2: We have a county mayor.
Speaker 1: Oh, county mayor.
Speaker 2: Who is the chief executive?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're almost like the Speaker of the House in some ways of county.
Speaker 2: I guess you probably, yeah, yeah, that's what it boils down to.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Or president of the senate.
Story_ID: 158594
Speaker 1: What have been some of the issues I guess, in your years as a county commissioner [for Shelby County Board of Commissioners] that you've had to deal with.
Speaker 2: Well, one of primary issue that comes up annually is school funding, and, because the commission had the responsibility of funding both city and county schools.  Now the city provides a supplemental funding from its budget, but it doesn't have to.  Been a lot of controversy about that because the taxpayer pays twice when the city provides a service, I mean pays, I mean kicks in and supplements then that means the city taxpayer is paying twice.  He's paying through the county tax assessment, I mean the Commissioner assessment, then he's paying from the city council's assessment for the schools.  And we also like the Fed Ex forum there, a lot of projects we had joint funding with the city to which I'm opposed.  I think we ought to have, I think we ought to be consolidated and have just single funding.  But then a lot of people are not for consolidation now because of turf protection.
Speaker 1: Now do the city and county, I mean even though they're supposed to be nonpartisan, do they, is there like a political process going on in terms of how they, it breaks down and people vote?
Speaker 2: I think it does.  At one time when I first, there are many years that the county commission was nonpartisan.  But the legislature passed an act having the county legislative bodies partisan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what's the breakdown basically of democrats and republicans?
Speaker 2: On the commission now?
Speaker 1: Un-hum.
Speaker 2: Seven-six, democratic.
Speaker 1: So it's close, you know.  Okay.  And, you been on, have you been on the commission longer than anyone else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My thirty-five years on the commission before I was declared ineligible, by the court, to seek another term without sitting out a term was the, was history-making in that no other county official had ever served that long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't brag about it, I mean it just happened that way.  I don't get off over average than the longest serving person on the legislative body is nothing unique about that.
Speaker 1: Well you must think it's an important position to be in and, you know, value the spot, you know, to be in, to have been in it this long.
Speaker 2: Well, I do, especially seeking another term or two terms.  I want two terms.  It is, it's, I want to see our schools properly funded.  One of my, one of my, I should say, one of the things for which I'm known is not being, is being against local government subsidy of private projects, like Fed Ex forum.  I don't think I was, I was the poster boy for being in opposition to us building the city and county using taxpayers' dollars to build a Fed Ex forum.
Speaker 1: That's a stadium?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the basketball (unclear).
Speaker 1: The Memphis Grizzlies [in Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, of course, that stems from my local spin on life and value system.
Speaker 1: And (unclear).
Speaker 2: Research in terms of whether or not it benefits.  If so, the depth of the benefits.

Speaker 1: You played a major role in the election of Mayor [Willie Wilbert] Herenton, right, when he was elected in 1989?
Speaker 2: I didn't play a major role, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, or how would you describe your role and what happened, what does it mean to the city [Memphis, Tennessee], you know, when it elected its first black mayor?
Speaker 2: Well, it gave the blacks a lot of pride.  Power shift as we saw it.  But, other than that, I don't, I'm not too sure that we realized a lot of value.  Well let me back up and say that, I, there is a lot of value in the sense that he's got the power for appointments and that sort of thing, but his value system was so much, as I saw it, have always been so closely akin to any white businessman, that I didn't see much relief by his election.  And you'll find most black politicians like that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a close relationship with Herenton when he--
Speaker 2: He and I graduated from high school together [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: We graduated from grammar, elementary school and high school.
Speaker 1: I've heard some say, of course, he got in trouble later on in his, during his, I think the latter part of his tenure as mayor, but some say that when he started off there was a lot of promise and a lot of hope of what he might do.
Speaker 2: I don't think he came from the discipline where he had to philosophical bet to see the broader picture of how you can, of how government ought to, which classes of people that government ought to benefit more than others.
Speaker 1: When he was in office, when he was elected, was it politically wise to be a critic of the mayor, I mean, you know, in the black community?
Speaker 2: No I don't think it was politically wise.
Speaker 1: Well you know what I'm getting at.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, did he have any, were you one of his critics, did you hesitate to do it because--
Speaker 2: I didn't, I never launched any personal attacks on him, but I fought his projects, like that, like the Fed Ex forum.  And, of course, I staked out my position why, I didn't, I'd seen economic reports from noted economists and they all didn't see how public gain and so in fact, public losers poured money in supporting bond issuances on structures like that.  It dazzled the community but didn't have any real bread and butter benefits.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Where do you think, now he was mayor for seventeen years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a long, long time.  Where do you think, he eventually got in trouble, do you have analysis of what happened, basically?
Speaker 2: He got in trouble with whom?
Speaker 1: Didn't he have some financial improprieties or something that--
Speaker 2: Well, I, there were newspaper stories about, they questioned his judgment regarding a number of issues.  First off financing and investments and that sort of thing.  But here again, he's a smart man, he got into a fight on his hand on this election, and his efforts to get to Congress.  Made a lot of mistakes.  But I guess nobody's perfect.  I guess somebody could say the same thing about me.
Speaker 1: Now what about, I know there are other, Larry--
Speaker 2: [HM Myron] Lowery?
Speaker 1: Lowery, yeah.  He was a candidate for mayor I think the last time along with [HM] A.W. Wharton [Jr.].  What did you think about those, that kind of (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't think much of Mayor Lowery.  A.C. Wharton, he's not one of my, he and I don't, I don't see things in terms of approach the way he does.
Speaker 1: Well go ahead, I was--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm just a bit more aggressive I should say, outspoken, confrontational, a bit more confrontational than he is.
Speaker 1: Do you ever see a time when you might run for mayor.
Speaker 2: No. No.  I wouldn't leave, there is no way I would leave the law practice.  You have to leave the law practice for a full-time job.  I'm a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your county commissioner position, it's part-time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you don't have to--
Speaker 2: Meet every other Monday.  Committee meeting sometimes during the--between then.
Story_ID: 158596
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community in Memphis [Tennessee] in terms of the leadership?
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope that we'd have a more strong and daring leadership.  A leadership that is not timid about addressing issues that affect blacks.  And talk about them in that context.  And not be an apologist all the time in terms of this business about everybody getting along because this is, I mean it, that's why I'm one of the few politicians who doesn't mind speaking out in favor of getting tax increases, cause I know you got to have money to support public need.
Speaker 1: And some of the politicians don't want to mention tax increases?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, very timid about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Because it got the public psyched out into thinking it's such an awful thing, that everybody is overtaxed, overburdened with tax and most of the time when you analyze tax increases, you'll find that it is negligible in terms of impact.  You talking about pennies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Less than the cost of a package of cigarettes sometimes in a year of taxes being increased.
Speaker 1: Now do you think, I know it's been said on a national level that some of the southern democrats is more conservative than other democrats because of the region they live in.  Do you think that's true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: No more to say about it than that?
Speaker 2: No, and I think it stems primarily from the cultures.  And what I see in terms of the difference between conservatives and liberals as an example of progressives is that conservatives like this Rush Limbaugh crowd, or the tea party folks, they see things as everybody ought to, been any effort to help the community at large with social programs and taxing wealthy folks, is some, it goes against the grain of how this country was founded, and they really, I mean usually they just espousing nonsense.  They don't even know what they're talking about and if you stop and put them under cross examination, they couldn't tell you what that meant.  They just code words, sound bites that sound good to them.  If you talk about an example of cutting taxes and say if you cut taxes and it impacted health care, well that's another example, then would you be for cutting taxes?  Aw, absolutely, some of the conservatives would say, and in the south primarily I think it's still race based, most of the conservatives, because I think most of them see public aid or public assistance, public benefits, social programs as helping blacks.  Which is far from the truth but you ain't gone convince them because they are irrational people who usually hew that line.
Story_ID: 158597
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about the nature of politics down here.  Tell us about the Confederate Park [Memphis Park] and what that's about.  This Confederate memorial park.
Speaker 2: Well, we've got in the downtown area, we've got a number of Confederate monuments dedicated to the memory of the Confederacy, and I think it's an outrage. We've got tributes to, as an example, to some of the most villainous and cruel Confederate leaders and it seems to me that that shouldn't be.  I think paying homage and giving recognition to those type people like Nathan Bedford Forrest, Jefferson Davis, that is an outrage.  It makes me want to puke.  And what has happened is those monuments start popping up throughout the South right after the Civil War and Reconstruction.  They were designed to let, as symbols to let the world know, and, of course, their fellow citizens here, to let people know we still love our Confederacy, and these are our heroes I don't care what you say about them, whether they, this is where our sentiment is.  "We think we were right then, and we think we're right now."  That what they symbolize to me and the got organizations like the sons and daughters of the Confederacy that give the thrust to these kind of monuments. So one day I was in my office, I had a different location that was across the street from Jefferson Davis' monument over there in the park and they had the Leonard [sic. Lennox] Lewis fight here in Memphis [Tennessee], him and [Mike] Tyson, and the lawyer out of the New York for Leonard Lewis was a, he and I were at my office, he associated me as counsel on a matter he needed handled here, and he was staying at the Peabody Hotel.  We were walking in front of my office and we passed that Jefferson Davis monument, he said he couldn't believe it.  He said, "Jefferson Davis."  He said, "Only in Memphis, Tennessee."  So at that point, I said I'm gone take some measures to try to get these monuments removed, especially we're in a majority black city and there we are paying tribute and homage to some of the most ruthless Confederate leaders that the world has known.  So, I started a movement.  I was on the Center City Commission Board which gives guidance to how downtown should be developed. I got them to pass a resolution and nobody, and Steve Cohen was on the board too.  He was the only vote against, after an extensive study, against the Center City Commission passing a resolution raised in the city council to rename the parks and remove the monuments.
Speaker 1: Now there's a, is it called Confederate, was it called Confederate Park or what was it?
Speaker 2: There was a Confederate Park down there too.  You got a Confederate Park, which is right here on Front Street, with Jefferson Davis statute in it, and then you got a Jefferson Davis Park [Mississippi River Park] right down the hill from it, and then you got Nathan Bedford Forrest.
Speaker 1: Now he's the founder of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK]?
Speaker 2: He's the founder of the Klans.  Got him on a big horse being glorified right in the heart of midtown.  They had, he was initially buried in the cemetery, and they removed his body, him and his wife, and brought them and put them in the park.  They named that park Nathan Bedford Forrest Park [Health Sciences Park].  And those rebels go nuts when you attack those monuments.  Now what has happened is that the, even though we've had two black mayors, neither one of them has had the guts to tackle the issue, on this everybody ought to love everybody premise of theirs.  It ain't that they think everybody ought to love everybody, they just don't want to stir up any controversy.  They want to, and that's not leadership.  That not leadership.  To duck tough issues, racial issues.
Story_ID: 158598
Speaker 1: In your estimation, do they [Memphis, Tennessee's black mayors] have the political clout or the votes to remove those [Confederate] monuments in the City of Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: We got a black city council, black mayor [HM A C Wharton, Jr.], what's stopping them?  And the black councilmen are so timid, I've talked to some of them about it, and they'll tell you, "I'm for removing them, but I don't want to be by myself."  In fact, we had [HM] Al Sharpton here when we really pushed the issue and they had a major demonstration at Nathan Bedford Forrest Park [later, Health Sciences Park] over that monument of Nathan Bedford Forrest sitting on his horse, and Willie [Wilbert] Herrenton [W.W. Herenton], the mayor then, called him an outside agitator.  Said we don't need outside agitators coming into Memphis telling us how to run our city.
Speaker 1: We heard that before in the 1960s, right, when that civil rights (unclear) came to town.
Speaker 2: I was just flabbergasted.
Speaker 1: So was anything done at all to resolve any of this?
Speaker 2: No, they still up.  Now the mayor never took any action and this mayor we got now, he certainly not going to take any action.  He just ain't, he's not a confrontational guy.  He's not a guy who believes in pushing forward.  He wants everybody to get along.
Speaker 1: Just kind of freezes this moment in time.  Okay.
Speaker 2: He likes being called the good guy, being polished.  Newspapers love him, 'cause he not gonna rock the boat.
Speaker 1: So you think the boat needs to be rocked some?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean you got to have creative tension in order to progress.
Speaker 1: So you agree with Frederick Douglass and some others about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Absolutely, you're not going to have growth and people are not going to grow and mature without some nudging.
Story_ID: 158599
Speaker 1: So what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I would think that we need, as I see it, we need to get more focused on our young kids getting educated, and we need to focus more on, and I also think we need more government intervention in the sense of providing programs that would enable the disadvantaged to have more opportunities.  Of course, again, that requires spending, but realistically that's the only way you're gone be able to do it, and I believe in taking some of the money from, putting, stopping tax breaks for the wealthy, scaling back on some of them, and using those monies to help lift the downtrodden and disadvantaged with health programs and better educational outreach programs, putting more of a heavy thrust on seeing the people the economy can provide jobs and opportunities for people.  Now that may be visionary, but those are the sort of things that I think are desperately needed.  We need blacks who will stand up in leadership positions and be forceful on the issues in terms of how to improve everybody in the community, and how blacks are held back and how we ought to, because of the disadvantages, and how we don't own anything.  We don't own, we're not capitalist, we're not, we're consumers primarily, and employees.  We don't own any industries and commercial institutions.  We're consumers, but we need leaders out front talking about that in those terms and that's only way you gone effectuate change.  You got to let people see and know that change is necessary, that you can't, and all this business about not rocking the boat, one community, everybody ought to get along, that's fine, I'm for that too, but I'm also a proponent of strife, and strife is a natural consistent product of reeducating people.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the recent presidential election and the history making election of 2008?  Were you a [HM Barack] Obama supporter from the beginning or did you have other ideas?
Speaker 2: No, I was an Obama supporter from the beginning, and I bought into his argument about the need for change.  I'm unalterably opposed to what we're doing over in Afghanistan.  I don't, I think he did wrong on that.
Speaker 1: You think, you think some will argue and they do it a lot, that there is only so many things he can do as president and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: And that's right.
Speaker 1: --shouldn't expect him to do everything.
Speaker 2: No, but he at least ought to be again, and I'm giving him more flex and latitude than I would look upon an ordinary politician.  I know he's got a tough job.  Of course, all leaders of this government have tough jobs.  I think he has done extremely well with his health care program [ObamaCare, Affordable Care Act] and, but he hadn't, he's kind of backed off of affirmative action and I think that needs to be picked up and put back on the table.  I mean that's always disadvantaged blacks that have overcome the vestiges of historical racial discrimination.  That's what put us as disadvantages, the disadvantaged class in the first place, being exploited, slavery and then after the elimination of slavery, even segregation, we're free but we don't have the economic tools to compete and our labor, unskilled labor is surplus.  There's no market for unskilled labor anymore.  You know you take my law office as an example.  Heck, I use Dragon Naturally Speaking voice dictations.  I don't need a secretary with a pad and pen taking dictation.  I just talk right into the computer and it types fast as I talk, so--
Speaker 1: That's another job.
Speaker 2: --that's two jobs.  And my son-- the same way.  Both my sons in the office with me.  They, especially the one running for judge, he uses voice recognition software.  He doesn't need a secretary.
Speaker 1: All the (unclear) operators are gone.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Still need janitors I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So our folks who have been menial workers for the most part, not by any choice, but by conditions of the country where we're going unless we can get technologically skilled and how do you do that?  I mean it's a big challenge, and even if they get technologically skilled, all the jobs aren't there.
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about the--
Speaker 2: And unfortunately, I've been advertising for a secretary for two weeks now and I've been looking for a black applicant because I got one white secretary who is very skilled and seasoned, and I want one black secretary.  Every time I advertise, the toughest thing is finding a black secretary who got some form of legal training.  And I know why, it's because the law offices have traditionally been white-based and dominated, so they have had no motivation to go into the field, the legal secretary field, but hell, I get, in the past week I advertised, I bet you I got about forty responses I think by e-mail, and maybe one or two black.  But what my point is, that's an example of us being out of the loop in terms of needed skills.
Story_ID: 158601
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask you about Nikki Tinker's run for [U.S.] Congress and what that was about?  I heard some kind of flak about that.  What was that about?
Speaker 2: That's where, I thought we had stirred up all the commotion on the Nathan Bedford Forrest [Park] demonstrations and all, and Nikki Tinker running for Congress, a black brilliant female lawyer, and I really was passionate about the need to have a black from this district 'cause we don't have, right now we don't have a black within our congressional delegation, but then eleven congress people consisting of two senators and nine representatives, we don't have a single black.  I don't think that's right.  So Nikki Tinker decided to, Steve Cohen ran the first time, because they were, he got the party nomination because there must have been about nine blacks running and they all split the vote and he won with 30 percent of the vote.  The nomination then ran against the republican, it was a shoo-in cause it was a democratic district.  Then Nikki Tinker decided to take him on the next year.  She came closest to catching him during that first time out and then she decided to run again and I immediately embraced her, after she asked me, and we did her advertising firm out of Washington were aware of my argument against Cohen about the position he took on the Center City Commission of being against the removal of the monuments and renaming the parks, and so I got in front of the Nathan Bedford statute on this ad and I talked about Steve Cohen's efforts, how I had tried to change the name of the park and remove this monument and how Steve Cohen was the only one who voted against it.  Well, the market guys out of Washington had a picture, had a figure of a Klansman [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] in a hood and all with a cross in the background too, and that infuriated Cohen, and even had [HM Barack Obama], Cohen got Obama to make a comment, otherwise Obama wouldn't have known about it or couldn't care less.  But Cohen needed some, he was running scared so he got the President, he first turned Congress, so he got the President to make a remark that's racial politics.
Speaker 1: So (unclear).  Okay.  So did Cohen win?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he won the election and then you hear some national commentators saying oh, that's outrageous putting that Klan statute in an ad suggesting that the Congressman is sympathetic to the Klansmen.  Well, everybody knew, that wasn't what it was designed to do at all.  It didn't come off like that except for those who wanted to read it that way.  So that's what that was about.

Speaker 2: My father [Walter Bailey, Sr.], yeah, he did, 'cause he died in, around '86 [1986] I believe it was.
Speaker 1: Well your mother must be proud of you and your brother both, you know, going to law school [Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Did she ever think that was going to pan out?
Speaker 2: No.  None of us thought it.  In fact, there are five of us, five Baileys that are lawyers.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing you'd do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I've always pressed for social change in terms of trying to improve the lot of my people, the black folks generally, after I've served with an efficient voice.  I try to speak for those who can't speak for themselves, for a lack of talent and opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back again at everything you've done to this point, what today do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Fighting for social change, improvement, fighting for opportunities and for minorities.
Speaker 1: And last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who fought for justice and social change.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: And who was champion for the downtrodden and the disadvantaged and who stood up against the big shots and the wealthy who want to put their hands in the pockets of the taxpayers and have us pay for projects like Fed Ex, which is a small microcosm of what goes on all over the country.  I mean they do it all over the country.  Memphis [Tennessee] is not unusual or unique in that regard, but.
