 Wilson  Today is April 8, 2011 and we are in Clinton, Oklahoma. My name is  Latasha Wilson and I am here today with A.O. Heintz. I am interviewing  A.O. on behalf of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. I want to thank you for  talking with me today. Let   s start out by just telling me your full name  and where you were born.  Amanual Otto Heintz. Bessie, Oklahoma.  When were you born?  January 25, 1928.  Were you born at home?  Born at home about two miles south and maybe four miles west of  Bessie. The city of Bessie, Bessie Church, whatever.  What was the house you were born in like?  It had a sod roof for one thing. Now that you ask me, it did look like  some Germans built it. (Laughs) It was a modest house. There was a  porch, not screened, but a pretty good sized porch. I don   t really  remember how many bedrooms.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I had brothers and sisters. In that house there were six of us. The other  three were born in Mangum, Oklahoma.  So were you the fourth child, or where do you fall in the lineup?  5  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  I   ll have to back up here now. There were nine of us, and I was one-two-three-  four-five-sixth, three younger.  What were your parents    names?  My father   s name was George Heintz, my mother   s name was Mary  Etchberger Heintz.  And what were there professions?  Lutherans and stern discipline. My grandparents came from Russia the  same time they did, and they were George Heintz, Senior and Elizabeth  Heintz.  So your family is of German heritage and they moved to Russia. Can you  tell us the story?  Well, Catherine the Great, she was married to   well, I don   t remember  which czar. But on his death she became the czarina of Russia and ruled  for a number of years. She sent people to Germany to recruit people who  had farming background to move, and my relatives lived on the Volga  River. The big city was Saratov, the town village, Skodafka. I used to  think it was Neuhaus, the German city back in Bavaria.  Is that where they came from?  The ancestors came from there. That   s about all I know about it from  that standpoint.  So how long did they live in Russia?  Probably four generations. I do not know how many years that would be.  And then how did they come to leave Russia?  The next to the last czar decreed that the promises made by Catherine  the Great had lasted a hundred years, and a hundred years meant  perpetuity in his interpretation. Therefore, he required them to serve in  the military and pay taxes. That is one of the reasons they left Germany  originally. They really didn   t liked being forced to serve in the military.  That was a big complaint in the Bible because    Render unto Caesar,     they thought that they had better pay taxes. (Laughs) That   s compatible  with their religion, too. They began leaving there, I do not know when,  but there   s a lot of Russian-Germans scattered all through the United  States, the central part of the United States, especially Nebraska, Kansas,  Oklahoma, and some in Arkansas. I see names as I go through. They  6  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  seem to migrate a lot of places. (Laughs) Sort of like Kilroy during  World War II. Whenever you went somewhere, Kilroy had been there.  Do you know much about how they actually got from Russia to the  United States?  Yes. They had to mostly leave by train from Russia and then go to  Bremen, Germany, which is a port. That is basically where they left  Europe. My ancestors, my parents and grandparents, came into  Galveston instead of on the east coast. I do not know why, except very  possibly there were some other distant relatives here in Bessie. Some  had come earlier and they were in Kansas, I think Lehigh, Kansas. When  the land became available, some of them moved down here by Bessie  and settled mostly east of Bessie. My parents lived west of Bessie, but  they didn   t come here. At the time land was available, free land. They  owned a farm there and lost it during the Depression. A fellow named  John Baumgart, he was instrumental in the current Bessie Church. He  helped fund a big part of the funding of the current Bessie Church. He  had a place down in Mangum and offered to let my parents move down  there, and that   s why I was there.  So were your grandparents and parents both farmers in Russia?  Part-time farmers, part-time soldiers. After the czar that ended their  terms of not having to serve in the military  came in , my granddad  served thirty years   six months  there  and six months home to make a  living there and be a farmer. They didn   t really pay them, very little.  They fed them when they had them on active duty, but they didn   t pay  them as far as I can tell. Then my dad was pulled into the Russian Army  and served a six month term. He had gone to some schools. They picked  a   I   ll brag about this. I guess we   re smart, because from what I know  they took the smarter, more intelligent Germans and gave them some  military education, and my dad was one of those. They commissioned  him in the military and then they face a thirty year service. I saw my  grandfather   s papers. I think they are in the ones I   m leaving here with  you. He was transferred to a reserve unit after thirty years, and they had  planned over a period of time to leave. I know they did, because my  grandmother and granddad also had a feed yard for transient wagons to  come through. They saved what they could over a period of time.  When my dad was ordered to return to active duty after a short vacation,  that   s when they decided to leave by whatever means. I visited with my  dad just before he died and this was the last visit. I didn   t know this. He  normally goes to bed at sundown. This time he went and wore me out, it  was almost midnight. (Laughs) We both knew this was going to be the  last time we saw each other, because I lived in South Carolina. He told  7  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  me then that when they decided to leave, he and my mother got married.  That   s what I told you earlier, that they had an arranged marriage and  that was not unusual. They had relatives here at Bessie, George Kyle and  there are some other distant relatives. George Kyle and my dad were  first cousins. George Kyle had been here maybe ten years or so, and his  wife   s name was Anna Marie. He had two daughters, Christina and  Lydia Dyck   D-Y-C-K. Christina never was married, and Alex Kyle,  farmed and also did dirt work, terraces and dams and stuff out here.  That   s really about all I know about that as far as   but they moved  down to Mangum and my dad farmed. He bought a farm down there  after he had been there a few years, and he died there at the age of about  eighty-four or eighty-five. I   ve got the farm now.  Do you know what crops he farmed in Russia?  Yes, some of the material that I   m going to leave with you, the article  that I   m going to show you that was written by one of the neighbors   indicates  turnips, rye, wheat, barley. Spring, cool weather crops,  mostly vegetables, cabbage of course. When you   ve got a German,  you   ve got cabbage and a wine barrel. (Laughs) They   ve still got that  here.  Once he came to Oklahoma what did he farm?  He went to work. Got off the train at Bessie and went to work.  It was   not more than two days  before  he went to work in a wheat thrashing  field. In those days, you had a binder with bundles and a steam engine  and a thrasher that the steam engine was used to drive. He went to work  in wheat fields. Then he went to work for the Frisco Railway Company  and traveled down to Bergman, Texas, and back along the Red River  and did a lot of bridge work. After about a year of that, a farmer here in  the area of Bessie allowed him to farm some land that he   d been  farming, but he was getting up in years. He farmed that for three or four  years as far as I can tell from some of the old letters that I   ve got. Then  he and my dad bought a farm out south and west of Bessie until the  Depression got it to where they couldn   t make payments on it. That   s  when I mentioned to you earlier that John Baumgart let them go down to  Mangum and farm a place that he had down there, and that   s where I  grew up.  So how old were you when you moved to Mangum?  Five. I   m like a lot of Okies that were here in the bad days, dust, misery,  poverty. I left when I was seventeen and said I   d never be back, but I   m  back. But it   s different now. Although, it   s getting almost as dry as it  was back during the Dust Bowl.  8  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  When you moved to Mangum was there as much dust as there was in  Bessie?  More. It   s a different kind of soil down there. There was always dirt in  the air. But Bessie I do not remember having all dirty days. After we  moved, my parents and grandparents brought me back up here with my  granddad and one of my older brothers were here farming. They brought  me up here for   they made me think I was their favorite grandson, but I  found out that when I got there that they wanted me to carry water to  them in the fields. (Laughs) Then there was a creek that had a lot of  grapes, wild grapes. Those Germans liked them wild grapes for making  wine. They kept me until we got the grapes harvested and then they took  me back home down to Mangum. (Laughs) My granddad died that  following winter, so after one time I had to come back. In that time they  had given up the farm at Bessie.  So growing up did they speak German in the home?  Yes.  Everybody did in your home?  Yes. They had the idea that if we learned German, then we would have  to learn English when we started school and we   d have to be bilingual.  To a degree that   s true, but that doesn   t hold over a lifetime unless you  keep both languages active. At about the age of twelve I acted kind of  like a young grown up. You couldn   t really challenge them like the older  ones did. I noticed that my brothers and sisters that were older would  challenge them on that language. My parents would talk in German and  they would answer back in English. I lived for the day that I could do  that, and my heart pounded for two or three days because I knew I was  going to do that at some time when I got the courage. At the supper table  when we were all there, I answered my dad back in English. All that  happened was he just got quite for a while, and he answered me back in  English, too. So I knew I had passed the course. (Laughs) That   s the way  it was, so there were three more that had to go through that. I guess  that   s the rite of passage, when you speak English in the house. (Laughs)  Do you remember hearing many stories from your grandparents or  parents about their migration over?  Oh yes, yes. They barely had enough money. I think they calculated  when they left   and they had to cross the Volga River, which is a huge  river. They had to get passage across that Volga River and then go by  train across Russia into Germany to Bremen. My dad and granddad both  9  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  were worried, terribly worried. He told me this the last time I talked to  him, that he used his accent. He had an accent as long as he lived. He  said,    We covered the womens,    two women, their wives, my mother.  (Laughs) He said,    We put clothing and rags over them in the train to  hide them.    I said,    How come?    He said,    Well, the Russian secret  service people were on that train, and they would   ve shot me and your  granddad. Then the womens would have to fend for themselves.    He  said,    We       (he and my granddad)    We watched on the train as we  were crossing. I saw the sign that said    Poland    and I said,    We can now  relax a little bit, but not entirely.       I said,    Well, how come?    He said,     The secret service still operated on the trains in Poland. When we saw  the sign    Germany    I said,    Ah  We can uncover the womens now         (Laughter) I said,    How come you could do that?    He said,    The  Germans would not let them have us.     So they traveled in fear for the first leg of their journey?  Oh, they did until they got into Germany. Then of course they worked,  they got jobs. My granddad and dad got jobs in Bremen. They had to  wait a while to catch a ship, and they used that opportunity to get some  more cash. He also told me that they bought a lot of rye bread dried to  last and dry cheese. They took that on the ship with them and they ate  that mostly on the way over. They didn   t hardly eat any meals onboard  the ship and lived off of that. They docked at Nova Scotia, Halifax,  Nova Scotia. He said they discussed getting off there. Said,    The climate  maybe was more like we were used to.    But he said,    We decided to  come on to Galveston because we had enough money to buy our train  fare up to Bessie. Then we knew we were going to make it from there.     He said they came up here and were penniless. Originally, my mother  and my dad lived in a cellar. I do not know where that is,  somewhere   down around Bessie while he worked. I do not know about my  grandparents. I never did hear how they fared. My dad was probably the  money earner and my granddad was probably the farmer keeping  together the family.  Wow. I   m thinking about the process of booking international travel  today, and it   s still difficult even with the internet and with travel agents.  In thinking about from Russia planning your migration around the world  to another country, calculating train fares once you get there, where  you   re going to stay, and making connections. That is amazing.  I tell you, on the ship   s manifest, I pulled their names up and I did get a  copy of the thing.  That was in Galveston?  10  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Galveston. When I saw they were nineteen years old, that puts a weight  right here in your chest, it really does. I was thinking,    When you were  eighteen, you were in Japan by that time,    but I was a ward of Uncle  Sam. He was going to feed me as long as I lived, and give me some  clothes. (Laughs) Provide me transportation, although not necessarily  the best. There was just not a comparison with that and what they went  through.  Do you know how long the ship journey was?  I think he said something like two weeks.  Did he talk about the conditions on the ship?  Yes, they lived below the water line because they got the cheapest  passage they could get. That   s not good, because I   ve been below the  water line. (Laughs) That gets pretty rank after a while. The ventilation  is not good. They didn   t have it easy by any means.  Did they learn English eventually?  Yes, my dad with an accent. But he learned it all in the fields and on the  railroad tracks working to make a living. In earlier years, when some of  the older kids were going to school and learning how to read and write,  he improved his language after they helped him. He did a lot of self-improvement.  One thing about not just my family, but the others that  came out of that group out of Russia, they preached education on equal  par with religion. There were a lot of people, the first generation out of  that group of people wound up with college degrees. That   s normally not  the way it works with immigrants. When immigrants come, they remain  laborers during that period of time they came over. The kids can become  tradespeople, blue collar workers, and their children become college  graduates.  Out of the nine of us, there are six who have college degrees and the  others had blue collar kind of jobs. Notably, I was thinking about this on  the way up here from Mangum, I think there are about eight college  graduates in the six following my generation, my older brothers and  sisters and younger. That is a high percentage of people from the number  of offspring they had that were grandchildren of my dad. There was  about eight, and I   d say half of them or more have some advanced  degrees too: professional degrees, teaching, accountants, management,  and those kinds of degrees. I noted that and just asked people whom I   ve  met that had somewhat similar circumstances. They said, yes, they heard  as much about education as they heard about religion.  11  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  What church was your family a part of?  Lutheran. They belonged to the Peace Lutheran Church down here at  Bessie.  And then when you moved to Mangum   ?  There was a Lutheran church at Granite just as the crow flies about four  miles, as the cars went slowly about seven or eight miles. We were there  all the time, whether we were scrubbed or not. (Laughter)  Were either of those German services?  Yes, when we first moved there they were all in German. Some of those  kids around there, older than I was at the time, they had also sort of  rebelled. To appease them they had German services, one out of each  month. When I was probably six, seven, Christmas programs were the  tradition in the Lutheran church, at least the ones up here at Bessie and  the one down there at Granite. The kids were used to showing off what  they   d learned at catechism school. We were a family that still said our  parts of that Christmas program in German. I noticed that the older  heads came right up and the other kids said they couldn   t talk German  but they did. (Laughs) But they had the English parts, and we had the  German parts. There was a lot of intrigue that takes place when you   re  going through stuff like that, where the parents have to relinquish some  control. They had an old German Christmas tree, with dangerous,  candles, live fire, two men standing up with some instrument they had  built, homemade something, fire. Luckily, we didn   t have a fire. I don   t  know if they still have that service or not. They probably don   t have that  with a live tree.  Did your mother speak English?  There again, my mother and grandmother felt like their job was in the  house, and they weren   t really required to speak English. I can recall that  my dad said,    If you don   t learn English, do not speak German when  people are around you who cannot speak German.    He really nailed it on  that. It was two things. He was trying to force them to learn. The other  thing, it   s irritating. You know what goes on around when people, the  less English they talk, the louder they talk, don   t they? It   s irritating, and  you can   t learn Spanish that way, regardless of what goes on in a Wal-  Mart store. (Laughs) I think the Germans that came over were really  more sensitive to people   s feelings. There is a book out, Frieda Entama,  I think is her name, and she wrote a little history of Peace Lutheran  Church. Have you read that?  12  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  I have not.  I   ve got a copy of that. You   re welcome to use it, both of you. They talk  about some of that in there a little bit. They talk about how the services  were held. They didn   t have an organ. We Baptists have to have a piano  and an organ, we think we do, and guitars and drums sometimes now.  (Laughs) But they had brass instruments. I think if I recall right, it was  about five men, no women. You   ll like that. They sat in the balcony and  played those brass instruments and the congregation sang following  those instrumentalists up on the balcony. I don   t know about the  Lutheran church now. It   s been a long time since I   ve attended, but they  don   t have song leaders like we do to tell you to sing louder, go on, more  jazzy, and all that kind of stuff. (Laughs) I can recall that at this church  down here, but I don   t know what they do now. You need to go up there  some Sunday morning and just go in. (Laughs)  My grandparents are buried in that cemetery down there. Notably, they  are buried on the, I think    If they did the same as they did down at  Granite, each family got a plot of land, eight gravesites just for being  members at that church. They are buried on the same plot with George  Kyle and Anna Marie Kyle. Anna Marie and George were first cousins,  husband and wife. That makes our relationship a little closer than     And that   s the Bessie Cemetery?  Yes, they   re buried there.  So, when your family moved to Mangum, what kinds of crops was your  father farming?  Wheat, maize, sudan for pastures. He tried some of the stuff that he had  in Russia there a time or two. He grew some flax one time, that   s  enough. (Laughter)  And your mom kept things going around the house?  She died young, though. She was forty-four years old when she died.  And she had nine children?  Yes, three who were the youngest ones. Fortunately, there were two  boys and two girls in the older age group, so we had some farm help,  some man help, and some women help in the house. It put a big burden  on those girls. It really did. They had to assume the household.  13  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  How would they do laundry?  In the early days, with a rub board. Now, when my mother died, there  was a help-yourself steam laundry in Mangum, Oklahoma. They   d take  their clothing there and wash and dry them.  How would nine kids take a bath?  In the tub. The boys would rebel against that and go swim in a lake.  (Laughter)  Especially if you were number nine, I can understand why. (Laughs)  We just didn   t want to get involved in that tub, water carrying, in and  out. As long as we could in the fall, as early as we could in the spring,  we   d go to the lake. They had a river that we   d go down to on Sunday  afternoon. The girls weren   t permitted to do that. That wasn   t ladylike.  Would your mom sew many of your clothes?  Oh, yes. My mother and my grandmother both ran a spinning wheel.  They did a lot of knitting. We had some socks and gloves. And geese.  They kept a bunch of geese so they could get the feathers. We ate the  geese, too, and made big  sacks of  feathers. Had old comforters, had big  old sacks full of feathers. They were real warm.  Would that serve as the mattress or the cover?  No, the cover, and we   d make the mattress out of cotton. They   d have  the neighbors get together when they had cotton and they would bring a  proper bale home, somebody would. And the women, the home  demonstration club, they   d make a mattress for somebody.  Were your mother and grandma involved in home demonstration clubs?  Yes, yes  my mother  was. My grandmother wasn   t, but my mother was.  Were there Germans from Russia home demonstrations clubs?  No, there was just what we called Yankees. (Laughter) English  speaking, but that didn   t keep them from participating.  Would your mom quilt?  Yes, oh yes. There were homemade things. We had some stuff like that  that they made. All the girls    dresses were made at home.  14  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Did you keep a big garden?  Yes, a cellar full of stuff, canned pig   s salt pork. We didn   t have much  beef because that was too much, and you couldn   t really preserve that by  canning or salting and they didn   t dry it. They didn   t eat jerky for some  reason.  Did they have a smokehouse on your property for the pigs?  No, we didn   t, not when we lived down at Granite. We did up at Bessie.  I remember that.  Would they raise the sheep to use their wool for knitting?  We had a neighbor that had a flock of sheep and they   d get the wool  from there. We never were forced to eat sheep, but we did eat goat.  (Laughter) It was pretty good, but we   d protest and we   d say,    Oh, that   s  not fit.    But you   ll eat it if that   s what you got.  What were some of your chores?  I   d help milk and run the cream separator, and bring in wood for the  stoves. At twelve years old I was driving a tractor, but at about nine I  was running a team of mules, working in the cotton field with them  plowing. The mules knew more than I did, so we got along that way  pretty well.  Was it just kids helping your dad farm, or did he have anyone else?  On occasion he had some others. When they   d run the thrashing  machine they   d have some others. At times, he   d hire somebody to run  the tractor while the rest of us were tied up with something else. But  when I got old enough to run a tractor then that was my full-time job.  (Laughs) I got out of picking cotton that way. That   s good  I   d see my  poor old sisters out there picking that cotton and I was riding on that  tractor. I didn   t feel bad about it, but I probably should have. (Laughter)  It was a good life, but it was a hard life.  How old were you when you started to school?  I was not quite six.  Was it in Mangum?  In a little country school called City View, out there in the country.  15  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Now, I   ll say something about that. If you wanted a kid to start school  before they were six it   s just almost impossible to get it done. What  happened with me, I was around the house and I was pretty active and I  think they wanted me to get started to school if they could to get rid of  me. (Laughs) I   m not sure. I remember schools used to provide a lot of  social life. We had a lot of things after school. Of course, there wasn   t  anything else for social life except ten cent movies, western movies in  town. My dad got me by the hand and said,    We   re going to go talk to  Ms. Powell, now.    She was the first grade teacher. That evening after  some function at school, he and Ms. Powell talked about me. I was there,  I can recall that. He told her he wanted me to start school. He said,    I  think he   s ready.    She said,    Well, send him to school with his sister.     She was just going to be a grade ahead of me, so I started a little bit  younger. Two years was the standard spacing for kids in those days.  After I went a couple of days (I sat at the same desk with my sister) at  another function she told my dad,    He   s okay. Send him on.    I couldn   t  speak English then. I was still under that mandate to answer back in  German. But, at the end of the year I was up with the other kids. I don   t  recall ever having trouble communicating with the kids. I would run and  play with them. But there was one special boy that lived across the field  and he and I were good buddies as long as he lived. At the end of the  year I was writing my name on the blackboard, I was speaking English.  From then on, I stood close to the top of my class all the way through  twelve years, so I wasn   t hurt by that. (Laughs)  When you started out was it a one-room schoolhouse?  No, no.  How big was it?  It had twelve years. It had a twelve year school, had three stories, a  basement and two stories. It had twelve grades. In the last two years with  the population diminishing down here because the Depression and  people were leaving going to California and other places, we  consolidated two schools and I went to a school called Midway for the  last two years. There were twelve in my graduating class. It probably  wouldn   t have been but about four had we not gone to that consolidated  school.  What do you remember about the Dust Bowl days?  I remember a bunch. We didn   t have very good houses, they weren   t  very tight. We   d hang sheets over the doors and windows. In some  cases, some people had  to wet sheets to hang up . We never did have to,  16  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  but they did. It was just dirt. You had dirt in your nose all the time. The  sun didn   t shine very bright most of the time. It seemed like one storm  would pass and then four or five days later there would be another one.  You couldn   t make any crops there for two or three years. It got pretty  tough.  What about the Depression? Did your family feel the effects?  We had a pretty good farm. We didn   t have any money. We were poor  like everybody else, but we didn   t know we were poor because we had  plenty of food and bought a few clothes along with what little cotton  they made. Dad had some alfalfa and he would sell some hay  occasionally. We milked some cows, and there was some of that money  left over for buying groceries. We did good.  Did your grandparents move with you to Mangum?  No, my granddad died here at Bessie before. Then my grandmother  came and my mother had died just shortly before, so we had my  grandmother there for a while, but she was getting on up in years. My  older sisters had a little bit of help that way. I think she died at about  eighty-six or eighty-seven.  Was there a Germans from Russia community in Mangum?  No. We were the only ones. We lost kind of our heritage as far as that  goes. I see pictures right here at Bessie when they had a wedding, there  would be cars lined up for an eighth of a mile waiting to have a shivaree.  The people up there didn   t know what a shivaree was. (Laughs) Down at  Mangum they didn   t know. It was quite a different culture. The people  from down in there had come up from south Texas and from the  southeast part of the other states shortly after the Civil War. They were a  whole different kind of people. There were some Germans that lived  across the river where the Lutheran church was. Their names were  Graumann and Neuman and they were all intermarried, too. (Laughs) I  think they came from Mississippi, I   m not sure.  So, did you ever go back to Bessie to participate in any cultural events,  or visit?  No, just went back and visited with some of the good old boys. My dad  would sit around in the shade of a building somewhere in Bessie and  they   d talk. They did their best to talk English. Well, by this time I was  fluent in English and I was fluent in German. When they got hung up on  some words (and they got hung up on both). While they were trying to  think of what the English words were I   d tell them. I served as a good  17  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  purpose there for them and didn   t even know it. (Laughs) They said,    Er  sprecht sehr gut,       He talks real well.    (Laughs) I thought that was all  right, so I just helped them with that.  Did you do anything special on your birthdays?  Not really, except have a cake or a coffee cake. You didn   t get out of  anything, you still had to do what you had to do or whatever. (Laughs)  No, I think they did what they normally would   ve done in better  circumstances because what they did was more personal to the  individual, rather than giving something or getting something. That  wasn   t a part of our culture at all.  Did you celebrate many other holidays?  Christmas, Fourth of July was a big one because, you know why. My  parents docked at Galveston July 6, 1913, so July Fourth was impressed  upon us as a day you needed to observe. We didn   t have to go to the  field on July Fourth, that was the difference. So, that was a pretty good  holiday. (Laughs)  What would you do to celebrate, do you remember?  Eat watermelon. (Laughs)  Did you ever get ice?  Yes.  From an ice truck?  We had an ice plant in Mangum. You could go get a fifty pound block,  or twenty-five, and make ice cream. We had the cows, we had the eggs,  and we had the cream to put in it and sugar. And vanilla. Makes pretty  good. That   s what I thought ice cream was.  Did you grow up around any musical instruments?  No, nothing more than just an old, cheap French horn. You   d take it  outside and blow it and the dog would howl. (Laughs) No, we weren   t  musical.  What would your parents do for entertainment?  Visit with other people, basically. Then the schools had other programs  where they put the kids on the stage and show us off, what we   d learned.  18  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  A little thing I   ll relate to you. In the first grade, we marched out on the  stage. We had learned and were holding a little trinket, and had a  Christmas tree out on the stage. There were fifteen or so of us. We  practiced and practiced and practiced that until we had it down real pat. I  don   t even remember what my part was, but we had a young fellow  there that had a little bit of a speech impediment. Not bad, just a little bit  of a speech impediment. It came time to say his part and he held his little  trinket up and said,    I shent shouw want sushi. I put it on chimichi.     Anyway, and all hell broke loose. (Laughs) He was the star of the night.  I don   t know what my piece was, but I know his. It won   t go away, it  stayed. So what does that tell you about human nature? I don   t know,  maybe I   m perverse. (Laughter)  Do you remember some games you would play with your classmates at  school?  Oh yes. We   d get to a house, we   d play Annie Over and take a ball and  catch it, then run and put somebody out. We played a game called Wolf  over the River at school. You   d hold hands, two sides, and a kid would  say,    Red rover, red rover, I   m coming over.    And you would run to see  if you could break the line of kids. If you did, you would bring one of  them over and put them on your side. If you didn   t, they   d keep you.  Those are the kinds of games we played then. We played jacks, we  played marbles, we   d play keeps at school sometimes. When the  teachers would watch we would just try to keep score of who won what  and collect later on. The teachers knew what was going on. (Laughs) We  didn   t dare take a marble if we knocked a kid   s marble out of the ring.  We didn   t dare because the teachers were watching and they said it  wasn   t right.  There was a real important game if you had a two bladed knife. You  could open one blade straight and the other and you played mumblety-peg  and tried to flip that knife and make it stick up. Just stuff like that.  Kids didn   t have this other stuff. Kids look at it and wonder, can I throw  it away or what should I do with it? You didn   t get much stuff in that  period of time, but what you got you took care of. Fifty cent pocket  watch, that was a big deal. If you ever got one of those you were the star  around there. They would come to you wanting to know what time it  was all the time during recess. That is a more simple life. (Laughter)  Did you listen to any radio programs?  We had a radio, but we couldn   t turn it on very often because it had  batteries you had to buy, and those batteries cost quite a bit of money.  You had to be careful that you didn   t sneak in and turn that radio on at  all. The only time you played that radio was when everybody was in the  19  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  house at night. There was a choice of the stations that we  listened to .  Do you remember any programs your family would enjoy?  There was a cowboy program that came on, Tonto. We can   t say that  now. (Laughter) Tonto was the helper of  the Lone Ranger . We   d listen  to that. It was a good program.  How old were you when you graduated high school?  Seventeen.  What did you do then?  I went that summer and ran a combine for a fellow that did commercial  cutting. I went and ran the combine on the west Texas plains and up  through Kansas and Nebraska. Then I came back from Nebraska and the  harvest was still going on in South Dakota and North Dakota. But I  came back to go to school when I was seventeen and I went to OU   University of Oklahoma . I was a little bit nervous about that because  here come these kids from Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The old boys had  briefcases and electric razors. None of us needed a razor. Us country  boys, we   d shave with a safety razor, and they   d come in with their  electric razors. They thought they were walking tall but there was a  requirement then. I don   t know, I think it was all the land-grant schools,  you   ll know about this if it   s still in effect. There was a requirement that  all the land-grant schools had to give one test, by law one test. That was  at the end of six weeks, to all the freshmen. I   ve never asked about this,  but I think it was because at that time if you were twenty-one you could  go to college. If you could make it, you could go ahead and stay in  college. I think that was a way to figure out if you were making it or not,  because not everybody had a high school diploma, and there were no  admission requirements really, even if you had a high school diploma.  We were living three to a room. It was still World War II, 1945. There  were still a lot of Navy men up at Norman. They ran officer training  courses that they were training them for directly out of civilian life.  When we had the six week tests, the Oklahoma City and Tulsa boys  were gone and I had nobody in my room until they rearranged. There  was plenty of room in the dormitory after that and the big boys were  gone. I said,    It wasn   t so bad being from a country school.    Our  teachers were not all qualified to teach the subjects they taught, but they  taught and they did a good job. I found that I stood about as well as any  of them, and all the other country boys did. Now, you could tell a  country boy from a city boy while the city boys were still there because  we had to walk about a mile and a half. The country boys couldn   t stand  20  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  the pavement on their feet. We   d walk in the grass. (Laughs) That   s the  way you told the city boys from the country boys. There was some  element of truth in that. Not much, but some.  What did you study at OU?  I just took a general science course at OU. I was thinking maybe about a  medical career, but I realized that was going to be a little bit more  than   I still had two sisters that had to have help. The boys, my priority  was a little bit lower than theirs, and there was only a certain amount of  money in the family, so I went into the service at the end of freshman  year. Well, I received a draft notice. My birthday was in January, I was  eighteen, the draft was still going on, and I was called up and took a  physical in Oklahoma City. I wrote a letter to the draft board and asked  them to let me continue until the end of the semester. They granted me a  deferment to the end of the semester and the draft quit about two weeks  before the semester ended. I still went ahead because the G.I.   Government Issue  benefits looked pretty good to me. That   s the way I  got through school.  So what branch did you go into in the military?  I trained in the Army, the infantry. Then I was assigned to a combat  engineer when I got overseas. The older people were gone, the regular  forces that survived World War II. I was in the first cavalry division and  that was in a little bit different unit because it had a lot of history behind  it. That   s not why I was assigned there. I was assigned there because  they needed somebody with my specialty. I had a job in the personnel  office in the headquarters, a pretty good job for a kid that was eighteen.  It   s all relative, and the people still left from World War II, holdovers,  were people who were career soldiers ten years earlier. They were not of  the same quality that some of the kids coming in there were. (Laughs)  We got pretty good jobs because these guys just really didn   t have the  skills. They were combat men, so I got a pretty good deal. I did a lot of  traveling, I took money to prisoners we had there, bad boys, give them  ten dollars, have to sign for it, then make them buy shoe polish and stuff,  and the ones in the hospital. So, I had a pretty good job for an eighteen  year old kid, had a lot of free reign. I liked that and thought about  staying in. (Laughs) I thought,    No, you   ve got to finish school first.     Were they looking specifically for people with German language skills?  No. I hate to say this, but times were more crude. If you needed to have  a translator you got that other ways. You showed folks who couldn   t  speak English what you wanted. They really enforced that, and they got  along all right. The interaction wasn   t all that great all that much.  21  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Where did you serve?  I was in Japan, just outside of Tokyo. Then I got out and was in school  in Stillwater. I was in the National Guard and the National Guard got  mobilized during the Korean War, and I went back over to Japan into  Korea and served over there during   oh, I guess I was there about eight  months while that war was still going on. There again, I had a pretty  good deal. I wasn   t one of the guys that were lacking any skills, and you  get a better   they tried to shield the headquarters, and I got to stay in the  headquarters, for which I was thankful. That one year of college made  the difference.  What did you study while you were at OSU?  Agriculture. I was an ag teacher for three years. Then I went to work for  the federal government. When I went to work for the federal  government, I was an instructor at Sheppard Air Force Base at a  technical school, aircraft electrical and then a missile refrigeration  course, intercontinental ballistic missiles. Then I transferred over into  the personnel office and was a personnel type for about thirty years.  How did you meet your wife?  I knew her when I first went to Sheppard Air Force Base, and I knew her  husband real well. He died prematurely and I became single other ways.  I went back to work at Sheppard Air Force Base after about twenty-five  years. Someone told me that her husband was ill. I   ve told her this, but  he came into the personnel office there. I knew he was ill, but he wanted  to talk to me because he knew I was in personnel. I   d been there before,  but I was not in the specialty that counseled people about their benefits,  retirement, and that stuff. He said,    I want to talk to you because I know  you.    I said,    Well, I   ll tell you, but then you have to go and talk to  those other people anyway, but take this piece of paper with you.    So he  told them what he wanted to do to retire to use his sick leave and stuff  like that. He got that all taken care of before he died.  Then she said I was sitting in church and looked around, and I did. She  sang in the choir. I thought,    Well, that   s a pretty good old gal, I know  her.    We had social things together and so she asked me to marry her  and I did. (Laughter)  What year was that that you got married?  We married in the fall of 1987. We   ve been married twenty-two years.  22  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  And you all live in Mangum now?  Yes.  How did you get back to Mangum?  When my dad died, I was in the process when he died of buying that  little place, that eighty acre farm there. I was looking for a place to retire  and get away from it and I did. It took a little doing to get her, this city  girl, out into the country. (Laughs) We raise cattle and as long as we had  the cattle, she finally learned the difference between a cow and a bull.  She quit taking pictures of all the calves because they were cute, because  when they get six weeks old you can   t tell the one from another anyway  unless you get a brand on them. (Laughs) So, she   s a country girl now,  she doesn   t want to go back to town. Is she smiling? (Laughter) Okay.  I don   t believe I asked you, what were some favorite foods your mother  would make?  We had a lot of noodles. Noodles came around pretty often, and coffee  cake. I think that was bread dough with a little bit more cream to make it  a little bit richer. It had some toppings put on it. Sometimes it was  cinnamon, sugar, other times it was what they call Riffle, which was  flour, hog lard, and eggs rolled up until you made a little ball and could  sprinkle it across the top with some cinnamon. It always had cinnamon  and sugar, and that was kind of a Sunday morning treat. We didn   t eat  that too often,  it was  pretty rich. Then they made some cookies that  were called N  sse. That means nuts, but I don   t recall nuts in them. They  were a hard kind of cookie with, again, cinnamon seemed and some  sugar seemed to be on the outside. They kept a long time. You could eat  them for a month or two if they lasted that long. (Laughs) There was  another dish called Ranza, which was usually cooked cabbage with  cracklings. Do you know what cracklings are?  No.  That   s when hog lard, you cook with it. You grind that hog lard up in  chunks and render it out. The cracklings are what are left when the fat is  all out of there. It turns brown and has a pretty good flavor. It was just  grease, brown. You can   t buy cracklings like that, they are too rich.  (Laughs) But they   ve got a pretty good flavor. They   d chop some  onions, pinch those together and then boil that in milk. That   s pretty  good eating if you like that kind of stuff.  Sounds good.  23  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  And sometimes when apples were in season they   d make apple Ranza. It  had a lot of milk, skim milk, clabber, cheese, and they would make kind  of a cottage cheese out of that. That was all right, too. They flavored that  up, put some onions in that. They called that Baringa. They   d take a  smaller piece of dough and put some of that cottage cheese in there and  do it the same way, and milk. That turned out pretty good. All this is rich  now. All this is rich. When they had a litter of pigs weaning size (in  those days pigs weighed about forty pounds when they were weaning  size) they   d butcher one of those little pigs and call that Gehacktes. That  means chopped up. They   d take that pig, dress that pig, they had a big  roaster wood stove with a big oven in there. They   d put that whole pig in  there. Then they   d chop it up. I guess that   s where the word Gehacktes  came from. They   d chop tomatoes or new potatoes if you had them, but  they didn   t wait for the new. They used old potatoes, too. (Laughs)  Always onions and salt and pepper and I don   t know what else. We   d eat  that pig. In later years when we had that, I   d get to where I   d get the  grease out of that. Grease was dripping off the elbows. (Laughter) But  that   s pretty good stuff.  What would you have for breakfast on a usual day?  For breakfast? We   d have eggs, cured ham or sausage, biscuits or toast,  or homemade bread.  Did your family make sausages?  Yes, they did.  Like German-style sausages?  Yes, we had two kinds. It   s what you   d call sausage now. It   s ground up  red meat. They   d clean the small intestines until it was just a membrane  and had a press. Then there was a liquid smoke they   d smear on them  and hang them up somewhere on the corner of a room, and periodically  put that liquid smoke on there. They   d be dry, and that was pretty good  stuff, too.  It sounds good.  Some of the sausage they would take and make into patties at the same  time you rendered that grease that you use to cook with. They cooked  them and put them in a can, and it would go to bakeries. We   d get a lard  can, something that was maybe up to five, ten gallons, and pour that hot  grease in there. Those patties in there would be completely surrounded  by grease. They   d keep so you could go dig some of them out of there,  and that was good. We   d have fried chicken sometimes for breakfast.  24  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  You mentioned eating goat. Did you make goat cheese or drink goat milk  ever?  No. This was my dad   s idea, they   d eat those in Russia sometimes. He   d  go to sale every Tuesday and he   d get a young goat for a dime, bring it  home, and give it to my younger brother and me and say it was our goat.  We had to take care of it, that   s what that meant. We   d take that goat and  there was a lot of nice grass out there in that bar ditch. We lived out in  the country, and we   d put that goat on a chain and get him going to  where he weighed about ninety pounds, in pretty good shape. Then he  decided he was going to butcher it, but he   d give us a quarter. Buy the  goat back from us, because we weren   t going to let him butcher our goat.  But if he gave us a quarter we   d butcher that goat. We   d make chili out  of it, steak, and eat that because with nine of us there, eleven, twelve,  counting my grandma, we could eat that goat pretty fast, so we didn   t  have to have refrigeration or keep it in the ice box forever, with a chunk  of ice. Basically, we had chili, we had some steak, and then it was all  gone. (Laughs)  Did your mother pickle much?  Oh, yes. She pickled all kinds of stuff. Cucumbers, squash, tomatoes, I  don   t know what else. In the absence of refrigeration, that was the way  to keep stuff. Whatever was alive and we could catch, and whatever  would grow in the garden and whatever came out of the milk, we   d eat.  Did she have any particular cooking traditions for Christmas or for the  New Year?  These little cookies that I was telling you about. Sometimes, they   d  make chicken and noodle soup. Out of some of the dough I guess, if you  all are going to be around to eat some of that down here tomorrow,  you   re going to eat some   they may call it klase, I don   t know whether  you   ll have that. It   s just chunks of noodle dough cooked in with chicken  and water and vegetables of all kinds, or cooked in milk. If all else fails,  cook it in milk. The closest thing to that is dumplings, I guess. That was  a pretty good treat. The variety was not what we have nowadays, but  there was more of the other stuff, so we always ate good.  Well tell me about your kids.  My kids. They are all three adopted. They are all three boys, and it   s like  raising mules. Those little girls are softer and sweeter, but I get some of  them down in our church once in a while and make up for what I missed  with that kind of stuff. The oldest one is a quality control specialist in a  25  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  factory out in Mesa, Arizona. They make parts, plastic parts. He helps  mold that stuff and figure out how they are going to mold. They do work  for commercial companies and show them how to take plastic and make  parts   like for a telephone, for instance, and other things. He   s a quality  control specialist, and he   s been that for quite a while. He   s about fifty-six  years old. He married a childhood sweetheart from up in the Goose  Air Base up in Canada. She   s an American citizen. Her daddy was in the  service. They went to school there for five years together.  The other one is a pure Swede. When you look at him he   s got blond  hair and blue eyes, big guy. He   s a welder, he   s a pipeline welder. He   s a  good welder. He   s going to school up there at Tulsa. That is one world-wide  renowned welding school. He   s single. The youngest one is out in  Mesa, Arizona. This one, that   s the welder, lives in Waurika, Oklahoma  but he travels to industrial areas, pipelines.  The other one, he was a firefighter but he got hurt and he was an aircraft  rescue man. He pulled guys out of airplanes. He was working down out  of Sheppard Air Force base in Frederick, Oklahoma, in NATO  North  Atlantic Treaty Organization  training taking place down there. They  come in and they do rescue if they have trouble so they rescue. He fell  on the ice and really hurt a knee real bad, and he was only about twenty-six  years old. He kept on as a firefighter there for another ten years. But  he kind of became disabled and had to quit that. Now he and his wife,  they are living out in Holbrook, Arizona. They keep orphaned kids there,  kids that are in the custody of Arizona University. They foster what they  call hostage kids that require special care and try to rehabilitate them and  turn them back over to somebody. A lot of them are Indians, and turn  them back over to the Indian tribes. That   s it.  Have you passed on any of your German heritage to your sons?  Well, to a degree. (Laughter) I felt like I had to be a pretty good  disciplinarian with those guys. If one of them got out of hand, they  probably all would. They emulate me in my physical  manner . The way  I get around, the way I do, my expressions and stuff like that. Other than  that they are all different, they look different.  Do you think they embrace your family   s heritage?  Yes, they think of themselves as being Germans. (Laughter) They really  do. That   s strange, but it   s true if   no, that   s not strange either. Genetics  is only part of it with a kid. I think the influence in the formative years is  probably seventy-five percent. I see that, anyway. They don   t tell me  this when they are together, but they   ll tell me,    Dad, I   m glad we  moved around.    I was at Sheppard Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force  26  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Base in New Mexico, Air Force Academy at Goose Bay in Labrador,  Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, Kansas, and retired. Because the  youngest one is dyslexic, he was going to school at Mangum and they  just weren   t able to provide anything to help him, including a vocational  program. We got him into a vocational program at Burkburnett, Texas,  and I went back to work at Sheppard Air Force Base while he was in a  vocational program down there. I worked there for sixty or seven years.  I enjoyed everything. Everything I did I enjoyed it. (Laughs) People say,     Well, do you like living in different places?    I say,    Well, yes.    I just  hung my hat up and said,    Here   s where we live,    and we did.  How do you maintain a connection with you heritage? Are you involved  in this Germans from Russia group?  Not really. I come to a few of the things, but not very many, because we  live a hundred and fifty miles from Oklahoma City, a hundred and forty  now. It   s a little bit better than it used to be, but no. I feel like I   m an  American first, whatever that is. I think I was reared with some of the  German heritage, and I   ve still got it. I haven   t gotten rid of it. (Laughs)  Although, I hang around with people who don   t have it, but there are not  many of them around. There were a few people down at Burkburnett,  but they were enough older than I was that we didn   t really   and they  were farmers and I was living in town. They went to Lutheran church  and I went to Baptist church by this time. They probably consider me a  renegade. (Laughter)  I wanted to ask, now that you   re living in Mangum, you and I were  talking about Hamburger Inn and its history on our way up. Will you tell  me about that?  Will I tell you about that? Well, what I know about it. It was there when  we moved there. It took a nickel to get a hamburger at that time. I wasn   t  allowed to drink coffee, so you had nickels for all you needed, but a  nickel was pretty hard to come by. So I often tell people I used to go  down there and hang around when I was in town, which is not very  often, but Saturdays sometimes. I   d be down there and somebody was  coming in. Old Lee he owned that place and hamburgers are primarily  what he had. It seemed like he might have had biscuits and gravy for  breakfast. About ten o   clock in the morning when the town was full of  people, he   d go put a bunch of onions on his griddle, and they use that  same griddle today in there. He had a fan that would suck that stuff out  of there. He   d turn that fan on and people would start salivating. I   d go  down there and smell that stuff, I   m salivating now. (Laughter) You had  one of those hamburgers and it would do it, it would make you salivate.  (Laughs) I smelled a lot of hamburgers.  27  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  I was a good speller but a terrible writer. My teachers always told me     we   d have a contest, the county contest at Mangum, and they   d say,     Amanual, you can   t write very well and we   re not going to improve  your writing, so why don   t you practice spelling?    Once a year I   d get to  go to this contest representing my grade. At that time, I got a dime and  you could go get a big old hamburger that covered the whole plate for a  dime once a year. I worked hard to get that position to go. (Laughter)  Other people had other things to compete in, and you always got a little  trinket of some kind from the teacher if you went to the contest. So that  was a big deal.  Speaking of spelling, will you tell me about your name?  You are talking about how it   s spelled? It   s because it   s   I am called  Amanual, A-M-A-N-U-A-L. I count the same amount of letters, E-M-A-N-  U-E-L, but the a   s and the e   s it   s a, b, tse, de, e   e   a, b, c, d, e. The  doctor that delivered all of us when we were going here at Bessie  learned to speak a little bit of English after he came here from Germany,  and he spelled my oldest brother   s name, which is Emanuel, his middle  name, correctly and he put a   s where the e   s should   ve been. (Laughs)  So I   m called Amanual. It   s a matter of the level of English versus  German of the physician that wrote it down. There it is, I   m Amanual.  Do you remember what his name was?  His name was Farmer, his last name was Farmer. I do not remember  what his first name was, but he is long dead. A lot of things happened  that way. (Laughs)  Can you think of any more stories or anything else you would like to  share?  Well, since you asked about the name, I   ll have to tell you this. I lived in  Hooker, Oklahoma, for two years and taught school. There is a little  town out there beside Hooker. It   s  actually  no longer a town. It   s called  Tyrone. The way it got its name was back in early statehood, still the  horse and buggy days, there was a fellow who was a rancher up there.  He told me, he said,    If you don   t believe what I   m telling you, go ask  him.    He said,    You   re right, fellow.    He was courting this young girl  and they were taking a buggy ride on a Sunday afternoon. They came to  this little place, Tyrone, and it   s a dry   an arroyo   it dries up and then  in the wet weather it gets a little bit of moisture, and then green stuff  grows, and it   s all cedars and stuff. They were driving along in a buggy  and he propositioned her. She said,    Tie Rone.    The horse   s name was  Rone. (Laughs) So, T-Y-R-O-N-E, so some of those things have an  origin that you don   t know. (Laughter) They   re long dead now, but they  28  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  had a nice ranch out there. The fellow told me, he said,    That   s right      Well, one more thing while we are talking about names     I   ll tell you one more. There is another town up there called Slapout.  Yes, I   ve been to Slapout.  Do you know the background to that?  No.  This was an old bachelor. In the earliest days he put a store in this  crossroads. He wasn   t too interested in the store, he just wanted to visit.  When people would come in and ask him for something, he said,    I   m  slap out.    That   s a true name. He was just slap out of everything all the  time, mostly slap out of stuff. (Laughter) And so the town got the name  Slapout. They still call it Slapout, and there is not a town there now.  There is a stop in the road.  Yes.  Will you tell me about your father, his middle name?  Okay, it was my granddad. His middle name was Daniel and the Russian  czars made them take Russian names. They got around that, they  complied unwillingly. His name was George Daniel Heintz, but on the  documents that I   m going to leave with you here, his name is listed as  George Danielovavich Heintz. My dad   s name was George Heintz,  Junior that I knew. His name was also Danielovavich because he was  Junior. When they both came to the United States, they took a vow that  they would never be called by their Russian name. All Russian heritage  was gone because the Russians had not treated them well. So, they  dropped the middle name and neither one of them had a middle name.  They never used it again, never spoke it again. That is hard-headed for  Germans. That describes the Germans pretty good. (Laughs)  Yes.  It really does. (Laughs)  So that was just a personal vow?  That was a personal vow with that. I don   t know of anybody else. But  I   m sure they had kind of sneaky ways, and that was probably one of the  29  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  Wilson  Heintz  ways. I do not recall any of these. I knew several German-Russians  down here at Bessie when I was just a little kid, and they were all  George or Alec, that   s what I knew them by. So, I think they might have  also done that. That   s kind of like how me in the Navy, they holler,     Aye  Aye     when they   re mad. (Laughs) That   s a respectable way to  show,    I   ve had enough of this      You said your parents had an arranged marriage?  Yes.  Can you talk about that a little?  All I know about it is that they did that. That wasn   t unusual. With him  being away on military duty for six months and then coming back, and  within weeks of leaving, getting married and leaving, that had to be a  wild, fast, and furious courtship. (Laughter) I don   t think it was, just the  things that he said and didn   t say. I didn   t disturb that a whole lot, even  in my older years. I allowed him some sanctity. (Laughs) I didn   t bring it  up, but I did say one time to him,    Dad, I think that these people over  here in Granite at that Lutheran church,    I said,    I think the preachers  are making arranged marriages.    After a while he said,    Why do you say  that?    I said,    I say that because the closest church that I see them  coming from is Bessie, and once in a while from Carnegie, never from  the church in Altus.    And there was one over in Lone Wolf. I said,    Not  from there.    I said,    I think the preachers are doing that.    It was too far  to go. It was sixty miles to Bessie from where we lived. I said,    It would  take us all day just to go on a one way trip. What   s a guy going to do?     (Laughs) He said,    I don   t know about that, but would you like me to  talk to the reverend about you?    I said,    No     He came out on top of that  discussion. (Laughter) Now, some few months before I married her I  said,    Oh Daddy, I need you and the reverend because I   ve got a mill  stone hanging on my neck here and it   s heavy.    I   m glad I can laugh  about it now. (Laughs) But I did call on him.  Well, I want to thank you for talking with me today.  I   m glad we came. I wish I could come back tomorrow and we could eat  noodles and what else. (Laughter)  You   re not coming back tomorrow?  No, I   ve got to take care of some farming stuff. I   ve got a bunch of grass  and I   ve got to get in and get the gophers. The gophers get real bad on it  and they have your land. That   s what you need for Bermuda grass.  That   s kind of a curse, but I   ve got a big drag I need to get over that so  30  Wilson  Heintz  that if it does rain we can get a sprayer, or fertilizer dispensers, across  there. You need that ground smooth for the fertilizer operator, because  the machine bounces and you don   t get a good coverage of fertilizer and  insecticides or herbicides. If we have to have it baled then it   s terrible,  rough bouncing around with the baling equipment. So, I   ve got to clean  that up a little bit because if it doesn   t rain right away   which I pray it  does   then it   s not like I   m going to have too many options with what to  do with that. I   ve got to get across that ground.  Well, we   ll miss you.  I   ll think of you all at about noon when you start chowing down.  -------  -------
