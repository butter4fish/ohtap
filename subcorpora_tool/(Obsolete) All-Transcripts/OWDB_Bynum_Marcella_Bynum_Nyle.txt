 Lemons  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  It   s November 6, 2000. We   re at the home of Marcella and Nyle Bynum in  Woodward, Oklahoma at 1520 Eighth Street. We   re going to talk with them  today, Shelly Lemons and Steve Kite are the interviewers, about their  experiences during the dust bowl.  It became a way of life to us really, didn   t it honey? It was an everyday  occurrence. It became a way of life, the wind and the dirt (laughter). But the  big dust storms that would blow in, mother would see them coming. I was  probably 14 to 16, and she   d have my sister and I run and wet towels to lay in  all the windows to keep it out   well it didn   t keep it out. She   d lay clean  sheets over the bed, so at night she could just gather that sheet up and we   d  have kind of a clean bed. The same with our tables. She would lay clean  sheets on them or over the food and stuff on the tables to keep the dust out.  The one time that I really remember was standing at this window, and this  huge black cloud coming at us, which we called Black Sunday. It looked like  a storm coming. We were all thrilled because we were so desperate for rain.  It   d been so hot that people were sleeping out in their yards for a breath of air  because we had no air conditioning, nothing like that. I remember standing at  that window and looking out, and the streetlights were turned on it was so dark  with dirt. It   s unbelievable how to describe what it was like. You   ve seen  storms come in that are dark, but this was a cloud of dirt.  Did it have any sound with it? Could you hear it coming or could you just see  it?  You just saw it. You saw it coming. Now Nyle   s family, they ran to the cave  thinking it was (laughter)  a storm .  It was a cellar.  A cellar, we had cellars then. I have the old cellar under this house. They  thought it was a tornado storm coming, but we didn   t. Somehow we knew.  The chickens even went to roost. It was that black out.  We had a lot of days like that. We had a lot of days that were black and you  couldn   t hardly find your way to school. We had to walk to school over here  you know. The lights would come on and everything else. The air would be  so full of dirt that you couldn   t hardly see a thing. When that big storm rolled  in you couldn   t even see your hand in front of your face it was so dark and  5  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  dirty and the air was so full of dirt.  We refer to that one as Black Sunday. It was on a Sunday.  It scared us all to death.  Yes, it scared us that time.  My folks scared me because they acted like the world was coming to an end.  They   d never seen anything like it. They were scared to death, so it scared us  kids because they were so scared.  I don   t remember ever being afraid at that time.  How could you not be afraid? I   ve seen pictures of that rolling in.  Well, I   ve lived through so much here (laughter).  And you were in this house watching it roll in.  Yes. It was a two-story home then. I was standing at that window watching it  come in.  Where was your house?  We were out in the country. It was on a Sunday, and we went to visit my aunt  and uncle that had a farm out west of town here. We were out there in the  country where we could see it every place. It wasn   t like her watching it out  the window; we could see the whole big thing coming.  Well, there were no houses across the street at that time.  It was really scary because that   s where my folks would rest us all down. My  aunt and uncle and my folks and my brother and sister were there, and we all  went down to that cellar, cave-like thing, scared to death. We didn   t know  what it was.  My grandmother had asthma, and the doctor lived across the street from her.  They would raise the windows at night for air. He would hear her trying to get  her breath. She would go (makes a gasping sound), and he   d run over. She  died in    36, in the dust bowl days, and then my grandfather three months later.  Then my world changed. It was so everyday dirt and wind and hot and dry  that it was our way of life, wasn   t it?  It   d become that way. You began to realize that the world wasn   t coming to an  end. You didn   t have the communications like we do now to where we heard  what was going on every place else in the country. We didn   t hear that. All  we knew was what was in our little world.  Yes, because we didn   t have outside communications. I can remember the  6  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Lemons  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  first radios, much less TV. When I got TV that was really wonderful. Then  you   d have to put your ear up to the microphone of the radio or the speaker to  sometimes hear it because the static was so bad (laughter), so you can imagine  what our life was like. It was very primitive.  I lived over on the northwest side of town on Fourteenth Street.  After he moved off the farm.  I had to walk to school. We walked to school every morning, and then at noon  we walked home to lunch. Kids have lunch at school now, but we had to go  home for lunch and then back to school. It was worth walking through that  dirt everyday, back and forth and back and forth. We did the same thing, hung  sheets in the windows and everything else. You couldn   t keep it out.  We had a terrible snowstorm in    38 or    37. Anyway, it was so high that it  would cover the trains, it was terrible. Most disasters we just took as our way  of life, except a tornado of course. You   ve surely heard of the tornado through  Woodward. If you don   t, I   ll show you the path because it beats the one in  Oklahoma City all to pieces (laughter).  When was this?  What year was that?     47. Over 100 people were killed here and thousands and thousands injured. It  blew half of Woodward away. From Ninth Street on out there was nothing left  through the path, nothing. I   ve often wondered what would happen if a  tornado of that capacity hit a city. This was what we called a rural community  here of about 5,000 then, now it   s about 20,000. We   ve grown, and keep  growing tremendously here because we   re the only big town in northwest  Oklahoma to be frankly. Our trade territory is a 100 miles around   that  includes Texas and Kansas. We   re the only really metropolitan area. We   re  really not, but we were the only city.  After driving through the area, Woodward looks pretty big.  Woodward looked big, see. They come from Perryton  Texas  and Coldwater,  Kansas. If you go to Wal-Mart here, they   re from Texas and Kansas and  Oklahoma because this is the trade center of this part of the United States.  I noticed it this morning, lots of Texas license plate. I didn   t even think of it  like that.  That   s what   s so odd for people who visit this part of the state, and yet we  have more to show here than any other part of the state. We have the sand  dunes from the ocean, the alabaster caverns, which they   re still exploring.  When we were young people we would take lanterns and flashlights, and we   d  crawl through those caverns out there. I look now where I crawled through  and I think,    Oh my lands.    It scares me to death that I was that brave.  7  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  They   re open now to public viewing. We used to call them the bat caves.  Now we have a bat cave where you can go see the bats fly out at night.  Selman?  Selman   s, yeah. I   m a good friend of theirs. The alabaster caverns were the  bat caves we all used to travel through on our hands and knees. I think of  coming out of that cave how many rattlesnakes must have been down there  that I didn   t know about, thank goodness (laughter). My grandfather owned a  big ranch out there. I know so much history that I get side tracked.  I do now (laughter).  I just get side tracked, so you   re going to have to stop me.  All right, let   s talk about how you ended up here. Were your parents from  here?  Yes, my grandfather  Peter Martinson came from Sweden  and grandmother   Lacy Marcella Fulmer Martinson from Annville, Pennsylvania  came in on  the run. My mother was three years old. She was Pennsylvania Dutch. He   d  met her there. He came here when he was 19. They came in on the run. He  had thought of settling in Okeene, didn   t like the country, went back to   Meade,  Kansas and waited until they opened the Cherokee Outlet. He took  them down to Mutual. You probably saw a sign as you came up for Mutual.  It   s just a little place. He left my grandmother, my mother, and her brother  down on the claim, 160 acres and dug a dugout for them.  His father by that time had come over from Sweden. He   d never spoke a word  of English, and he left him down there with them. He came to Woodward to  make his fortune. At that time, here I go again, Main Street was on First  Street. Grandpa had opened a feed store down there. I   ve got a picture of him  in here, and a lot of his furniture. He had met a man by the name of Hiram  Brockhouse, who was an old German and they teamed up. The government  came in and said this isn   t the plot we have for Main Street, it   s where Main  Street is today, and a big feud started. This is part of Woodward   s history, if  you   re interested. A big feud started. From this street east was called little  Denver. From this street out was called Woodward (laughing). The two  political fractions really got in it.  Grandpa and Brockhouse decided, and I   ve drawn a picture of it, to build the  first brick building in Woodward on Main Street, so that would end that feud  on government land, which still stands today, not all of it, but I can tell you  where it is. When that happened they had an opera house above it where  court, school, churches, and everything was held up there  for seven years .  My mother   s told me all kinds of stories about the meetings up there. What  happened was grandpa and Brockhouse had the government come in and  survey the town. This little Denver group had the railroad surveyor come in  and survey the town. Well, our Main Street goes down, and it   s crooked  (laughing). Right near Main Street at Oklahoma Avenue we have this crook  8  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  because of this early day political feud here. Isn   t that something?  It   s on Main Street.  I can still remember the dirt roads. We had a man who drove a water truck, a  sprinkler. He went up and down the road sprinkling the dirt roads so it  wouldn   t be quite so dirty and dusty. I can still remember that. Can you,  honey?  Yeah.  Him driving by the house. When grandpa became mayor he had a lot of  influence in the state then. His name was Peter Martinson, by the way. He  had Main Street paved, and he had the senators and stuff in the state declare  Eighth Street the highway so he could have it half paid for by the state  (laughing), and it wasn   t the highway at all. It was over on Ninth Street. He  got half of Ninth Street paved. He was quite a     Wheeler and dealer.  Pusher. He just educated himself by reading and studying. He had a big  library full of books. I never went to the library, I just went to his house. It  was right over here. This big white house across the road here was their home.  I saw my grandparents everyday until they died when I was 16.  What happened to their claim, their quarter section?  Well, I started to tell you. Grandmother lived down there on that claim, and  mother tells of the prairie fires and the dirt and the Indians. They  horsewhipped my great-grandfather because he couldn   t speak English and  they wanted food.  Grandpa sold the claim when he moved his family to town, and they lived in  back of the store for a while. Mother, Hannah Rebecca Martinson Fuller, was  about five then. They lived on the claim for 2 years.  He left his dad down there?  Yeah, he left his dad down there with them. He brought them up here in about  two years to the back of this building he   d built on Main Street, and they lived  back there. When they lived in the back there was a saloon to the west of that  store. You   ve heard of Temple Houston, haven   t you?  Oh, yeah.  Okay. That   s where Temple Houston killed Ed Jennings, and my mother  remembers that night, the gun shots, and my grandfather trying to go over  there, and my grandmother not letting him. She found a carpet slipper in the  alley from somebody who   d run away from the fight. I said,    Oh, why didn   t  you save it mother?    because I   m so into this, you know. She said the trial  9  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  was held in the opera house, and he was acquitted of course. He did finally  kill a man he wasn   t acquitted for, but he was a scoundrel, a drunkard. I don   t  care, they   ve made him so famous.  He   s kind of a hero now.  I say, from my history research here from our madam of our red light district,  who   s quite well known from Denver.  Mary Eliza Kezer was known as Dolly  Kezer. She ran the red light district and the Dew Drop Inn in Woodward,  Oklahoma.   You either had to be a madam or like Temple Houston. He had a brilliant  mind; I   m not going to take that away from him. His speech is in our archives  in Washington D.C. Or a Temple Houston to have any claim. My  grandmother didn   t because she was just a common old housewife raising kids  and fighting the dirt. If you were famous like Temple Houston and Dolly,  that   s who they remember. Isn   t that something, in our history?  Temple Houston died young. My mother was scared to death of him. She  explains him as being small feet and wore high heel boots and dressed very  well for that day, and he always had his guns on. Come down the street, and  you never knew if he was drunk and would shoot up the town or what. So  she   d hide under her mother   s apron. I have never, and I have interviewed a  lot of old people here trying to get their stories and stuff, I   ve never  interviewed a one of them that wasn   t afraid of him, not a one of them. They  all admitted he was good looking and different looking and wanted to make a  name for himself, but they were afraid of him because of these guns.  For instance, one court case he had, he knew he was going to lose it, and so he  gets before the jury and he says, he   s arguing his case,    What would you have  done,    and pulls out the guns. The jury vanishes and they judge flies. He got  a mistrial. He was brilliant. Do you know, when we did our research and  went to the courthouse to get his cases, they   re all gone. All our other files are  there, but he had a son that worked at the courthouse and a daughter-in-law  who was postmistress. They didn   t want a lot of that known, and it   s all  disappeared. What you find out when you really get into research is amazing.  It really is, and real eye-opener. Back to the dust. Nyle didn   t know all this  until he married me, did you honey?  No (laughter).  And you   ve lived here.  You said your family ran a grocery store, right?  Yes, Martinson   s Grocery Store. When my grandparents died my parents ran  it. My father died in    57. I have to tell you about him, too. My mother sold  the store in    60 because by then Safeway was coming in and your big grocery  stores and the little Main Street grocery store was no longer. I have a lot of the  stuff downstairs from that old store. In those days you charged groceries, you  10  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  delivered groceries to their homes. There was no way you could make a profit  because of the big stores that came in, and so she had to sell it.  The only customers they ended up with were the charge customers. They  never paid their damn bill. When they got cash, they went to Safeway.  My grandfather hated Franklin Delano Roosevelt being elected and welfare  and all the programs he implemented   and we   re stuck with them today     because he had enough money that he took care of a lot of poor people here.  He felt the rich should take care of the poor in the churches. He was very  much against federal intervention, and that   s what Roosevelt did. I was  brought up with we don   t like this. He was a big political man here. Isn   t that  amazing what he accomplished from a foreign country? He always spoke.  He   s in all of the history books that have been printed out here. What he  accomplished boggles my mind. I don   t think I could have done what my  grandmother and he did. I don   t think I could have done it. I don   t think I  could have lived in a dugout with small children on a prairie.  How did he help the families?  I   ll tell you one thing he did. He got the farmers to plant castor beans in the  World War I era. Castor bean oil was used in the airplanes in that time   laughing , in case you didn   t know it. I   m educating you, aren   t I?  Yes, you are.  So to keep the farmers here, he got them to plant castor beans. If they   d plant  them and raise them, he   d buy them. That   s what he did. Before that, it was  broomcorn. Nyle has picked broomcorn. He   ll tell you about that.  What   s broomcorn?  You know the brooms you sweep with?  Yes.  The old fashioned brooms, that   s broomcorn. They had whiskbrooms. Now  I   ve got more coffee if you want it. Anyway, he got them to plant castor  beans, and in two years he shipped 25 train carloads of castor beans back east.  He was listed on the New York stock exchange as the largest buyer of castor  beans in the United States (laughing). He made a fortune.  It helped the people, like she said, the rich would help them. He ran the  grocery store and charged to everybody. Everybody that needed groceries got  them because he   d charge to them. A lot of them never paid him back ever.  During the depression they just came in and laid their deeds down on his desk.  And left. A lot of people left here because they didn   t have any money.  11  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  He became land poor.  He owned half of this county.  Land rich.  Land poor. He couldn   t pay the taxes. He didn   t have the cash for all of the  land that he owned. He owned half of Woodward County or more.  So they would just give him the deeds to their property and head out.  Yeah, and he became what you call land poor.  You go for years and not raise a crop and stuff and all these farmers owed him  for groceries and stuff because he   d let anybody have groceries.  My daddy did, too.  He took the guy that ran the water wagon, fell off and it killed him, so he took  that family and put them in a home up here, and then took care of them.  It   s still there today. It   s an old saloon he moved up there, and it   s still a home  today right up the street.  That   s the kind of things he did that he thought everybody should do.  He would take over ripe food to them or meat that was maybe a couple of days  old.  Now this is your father?  No, my grandfather.  Your grandfather.  And grandmother.  My grandmother would make dresses or give them material. They took care of  that family. That   s the way he believed in doing. He believed that if you  made money that it was your duty to take care of the poor. He was a Lutheran,  naturally. There was no Lutheran church here at that time. She was a  Methodist, and one of the founders of the Methodist Church here. We   ve just  built a new Methodist Church, and my daughter   s youth director is studying to  be a minister out here. My family has been so tightly involved in that.  My dad was a minor league ball player. He was big, tall, and skinny. I took  after the Swedish side of the family (laughing). My mother met him playing a  ball game traveling through here. They wrote to each other a year, and got  married. They lived in Winfield  Kansas  for a couple of years. His name was  Art Fuller, Arthur, but they called him Art or Slim Fuller. After two years,  12  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  mother was so lonesome for her mother, that grandpa put in a store down here.  Then he took over the ownership of the store, and then my mother did, after  my grandparents died. My grandfather sold the light plant here. They used to  have bitter political feuds here.  He was mayor, now that   s how come he was what she said.  He was mayor. The old light plant was losing money. They had to raise the  dues or sell it. So much of the machinery was going wrong that he knew he  had to sell it, and made this other fraction very angry. There was this society  fraction and grandpa   s, who could care less for society. It became a big feud,  and he was defeated during that election. He   d won three or four times. The  next election, my dad ran, and he won. He was mayor for a long time. He  built our stadium that they still use for the rodeos today. Crystal Beach; him  and some men established Crystal Beach out here. I   ve got a picture of it.  A swimming area?  Yeah. They got the C.C. camp in here to establish Boiling Spring State Park.  By the way, my grandfather owned that land and sold it to the state. The big  golf course out there, he owned all that land clear out to the lake. Bubbling out  of the ground, he owned that. We used to drive out there. He thought that  water was good for us. He   d unfold his little cup and we   d all have to drink it.  Then, he owned all of the United States field station that   s through the center  of town here. To get that establishment here, he sold that to the federal  government so they would come in and establish the U.S. Field Station here.  The cemetery was on that ground, so they had to move all the cemetery over to  our cemetery today (laughing), which included my great grandfather. What he  accomplished here is amazing to me. My father got them to build the big rock  fence along by it and out by the Crystal Beach. They brought in loads of sand,  him and the two men that were on the commission with him  Vance Terry and  L.S. Fisher . They put it along the beach so we   d think we were in California  on the beach (laughter). So I grew up at Crystal Beach and Boiling Streams  Lake, before we had swimming pools.  We swam in the lakes.   Your family had such strong ties to Woodward that there   s probably no  question about whether or not you were going to stay or go.  No, I stayed. There was no question. Then I married a man when I was 18  who was the football hero and I was the rodeo queen  laughing . He worked at  the store, all of the family worked in the store in those days, until my mother  closed it. He helped her close that store after my father died. Then he went to  work for Kids Incorporated here. I don   t know whether you   ve heard about  Kids Incorporated and whatever, but it   s a marvelous program. It has  implemented all over this part of the country. This program, any child can  play any sport and it doesn   t cost them a penny. All they have to buy is their  shirt, if they have the money. There   s basketball, soccer, football, there   s  everything. When he took that program over, they had to go to Tulsa to play  games.  13  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  When he took that over there was one football field and one gym that the town  had built. He went up to Liberal, Kansas, and he decided to organize this  whole part of these three states into a league, which he did. All these little  towns could come in and play from all over this part of the country.   He was director for 24 years when he died of cancer. His name was Wendell  Plank. There were two days honoring him and he   s well known in sports state-wide.   That   s where I heard it from, I   m sure.  And they named the big baseball park out here after my dad because he spent a  fortune on ball clubs and bringing them in. One year he hired the whole OSU  ball club to come over here and play so that he could win the Sandlot  Tournament. I lived about a block over here with a full basement. I put them  all in my basement, or a lot of them. It was a mess that summer, because I had  three kids by then. I ended up with four.  A basement full of ball players.  Jockstraps hanging every place (laughter) and girls calling them. It was a  mess. Boy, my dad loved his baseball, didn   t he honey?  I   ll say.  He spent a lot of money on that. I   m broke today (laughing), I mean they  spent all their money doing things for other people to keep Woodward going.  The Fuller Ballpark is out here at Crystal Beach. The Kids Incorporated is just  north of it, and you can see the big gym and it has Wendell Plant Complex on  it. Nothing is named after my grandfather who did more than those two. Well,  in a way he did.  He kind of paved the way for them.  He helped paved the way for the rest of this to get done.  Your family took off?  No.  The reason I   m here is my father. I was born in Colorado, and my father was  killed in an accident. My grandfather lived here, and so he came up and got  my mother and the three kids, the three of us, and brought us down here.  That   s how come I ended up here was because of my father   s death.  Eventually my mother remarried. She sold everything up there and had   5,000. They came and put it in the bank down here. That guy hadn   t seen so  much cash for so long he closed the bank that night and left here with her   5,000.  14  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  That   s the depression era.  That   s the way it   s been all my life it seems like, poor. My mother had to take  in roomers and boarders and stuff. She cooked for the thrash people, and  that   s the way we met my stepfather. He came through the country with a  thrash outfit, thrashing wheat. She was cooking their meals and stuff, and so  my stepfather became my father. I was six years old when they got married. I  was three when my father was killed, and so I was six when my mother  remarried.  What year did you come here then?  I was born in 1920, so I came here in 1923. I was three years old. My  stepfather was wonderful to us, but he wasn   t too damn ambitious. He got a  job grading the roads out with a team. They used to grade the roads with a  grader and horses, and that   s what he did. They did away with them when  they got a motorized grader. At that time, we were living at Tangier, and so  then we moved to Woodward. He went to work for the highway department  here in Woodward, in a truck, when they go up and down and do what they  needed to do, like haul dirt and stuff. He made a dollar a day. We existed but  I used to have to wear shoes that he would put cardboard in my shoes. I   d  have holes in my shoes, so we   d put cardboard in there so the stickers  wouldn   t get me.  His life was just the opposite of mine.  I got one new pair of overalls every year to start school with.  You never had cardboard in your shoes?  My dad would half sew them with leather, and I   ve got the thing he half sewed  them on downstairs, but no.  I   m going to ask you an embarrassing question; when were you born?  1920, the same. When he fell in love with me, so to speak, I said,    How old  are you?    because I didn   t want to marry a man younger  His birthday   s July  15 and mine was August 14. I said,    Okay, you   re older    (laughter).  How long have the two of you been married?  We   ve been married 20 years next April. I knew his family, and I knew him as  a young boy before he left here. Tell them what you went to work for, honey.  When I was eleven I went down and pulled broomcorn. That was the first  money I ever made.  Tell them about pulling broomcorn because a lot of people did it.  I got 50 cents a day for working all day pulling broomcorn. That broomcorn is  15  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  full of sap and syrup-like stuff. You pull it off and it gets all over you, and the  bugs and the bees and everything else about eat you up trying to get some of  that syrup. When we went to lunch at noon, we jumped in a horse tank with  all of our clothes on to wash all of that syrup off (laughter).  A lot of people did this.  It   ll cool you down, too.  That   s why I wanted him to tell you this story.  The next job I had, at 12, I spent all summer and I drove horses. We were  harvesting wheat, and I was driving a big wagon and we   d put the wheat in it.  I had three mules hooked to it. The one on the outside was blind in one eye.  The wind would blow real hard and blew the canvas off. It come around and  scared that old mule to death, and he took off with it. Here I am, a 12-year-old  kid, trying to hold those three from running across the wheat field (laughter).  And the dust.  I had an awful time trying to get that mule stopped, but I finally did. I got my  meals. Part of the time it was about 50 cents a day, but I got my board and  room mostly  free  living with my aunt and uncle working for them.  It sounds like you earned it.  Tell them about working here.  When I was 13, I got  a job  at Little   s Drug Store as a soda jerk. I worked  there for seven years until I got out of school.  Tell them what you earned.  When I was nine I had a horse kick me, and it broke all these ribs and ruptured  this kidney. I spent a month in the hospital over at Shattuck. They were trying  to save that kidney and stuff. They thought they had, but when I was 19, I  missed a year of school because of it, I had to have this kidney out. That   s  when I became kind of discouraged. My brother had gone to California, and I  decided I   d go too.  Tell them how much you made at Little   s, and the hours you worked.  I was making 50 cents a day there. My dad was making a dollar and I was  making 50 cents. That   s what we had to live on all those years.  How many hours a day would you put in?  I   d go to work at eight o   clock in the morning and sweep out the drug store,  and then I   d go to school at nine. At four o   clock I   d come back and work all  evening. It   d depend on the weather and all the shows and stuff. My boss  16  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  would walk up front at ten or eleven o   clock at night and look up and down the  street. If he couldn   t see anybody then he   d come and lock the drug store up,  and I   d get to go home.  At ten or eleven?  Yeah, ten or eleven o   clock at night. I worked at least seven hours a day there  and went to school.  For 50 cents a day.  For 50 cents a day.  Now that   s depression.  That   s depressing (laughter).  He was not alone. There were a lot of people like that in those days. Today,  my grandkids and great-grandkids are so spoiled, oh my.  You mentioned Tangier. Where is that located?  It   s about five or six miles west of here.  It no longer exists.  They still talk about Tangier. It   s still listed on maps and stuff, but there   s not  anybody there anymore.  A ghost town.  When I first got there, it had several stores and a hotel and a post office and all  that, but being so close to Woodward and Woodward becoming the county  seat, and so Tangier just got so    We had a big school there and everything at  that time, but eventually it just died.  Tell them about the first train you ever saw.  As a three-year-old, unless something really drastic happens, you don   t really  remember anything. When they brought me down here I remember taking my  father to the hospital. In Trinidad, Colorado the hospital is way up high in the  mountain. I remember going up in this car, and it just scared me to death. I  just thought we were going to turn over or something as we took my father to  the hospital. I do remember the accident in a way because my mother was so  scared. She was hollering, and it scared me so bad that I remember hiding  behind this big rock. My father was bringing down a big load of lumber from  trees that he had cut down to get firewood for the winter and some posts to  make a fence with. Anyway, the wagon turned over, and he tried to jump  clear, but he didn   t make it. It broke his arm. The bone went out through the  flesh, and that   s what he died from.  17  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  Blood poisoning.  Yeah, blood poisoning because of it. My grandfather came and got us, and I  remember coming home that night. It was raining so hard, from somewhere  up there, and the water was rushing across the roads. My mother was scared to  death that we were going to crash into it. I remember, in that old car, being  scared to death that we were going to get washed away. The next thing I  remember is that I was standing in the window of my grandfather   s place, and  it was right next to the railroad. There was a big overpass out at Tangier.  Then here came this train. I never had seen one in my life. The smoke was  coming out and it was making all this noise, and I just thought that sucker was  going to eat me up (laughter). It just scared me to death. I don   t remember  anything else for years. I remember those things as a little kid.  I remember the first pop I ever had. When my stepfather married my mother,  he took us over to Gage to a swimming pool, and they were selling bottled  pop. I had never had one. He got us a big bottle of orange pop, and I  remember drinking that. Oh, I   m telling you, I had never had anything like it.  It was just wonderful to get a bottle of pop. I remember it. I was six years old  before I ever got a pop.  Tell them about the first orange you had.  Then he took us to the Christmas show, the Christmas deal at the church.  They gave us some oranges and apples. I   d never had an orange in my life,  and I   m telling you, that was just wonderful to have something like that.  You were six years old at that time?  Six years old.  Just think how our world has changed.  A bottle of pop or an orange or anything like that, it tasted     In those days Nyle had red hair and freckles and was tall and skinny (laughter).  His hair was bright red. It   s not anymore, but he looked very different.  I was the only redheaded kid in the school at Tangier, and everybody wanted  to fight me because redheaded kids were supposed to be tough. Hell, I   m a  lover not a fighter. The janitor would take us down in the basement and put  gloves on all of us and make us fight. I had more damn fights because I was  redheaded. One night at a ballgame, some guys came from Fargo that were  playing ball, and they wanted to fight me. Hell, I had an awful time trying to  get out of those fights with people (laughter).  You mentioned exploring caves, what else did you do for fun when you were 15  or 16?  Well, we swam in the lakes. We went swimming a lot. I   ve got a picture of it  18  Lemons  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Kite  Lemons  back there that I   ll show you. They built a big wooden slide. It had a metal  slide on it, but it was into the water. I went down it one time, and it knocked  the breath out of me. I never went down it again. It was about 60 steps up the  darn thing. They finally took it down because it was so dangerous. We had a  raft out in the middle of the lake and a wire cable across it. If you went past  that you were over your head. Carnivals would come through, and that was  always fun. In fact, when Wendell and I married we didn   t have children for  four years, and then we had four. I remember we had  5, and he was a  baseball player. I married a player, too. Would you like to hear about my  wedding to him? We were married here.  Sure. Here at the house?  Yes. He was playing in the state softball tournament. He got a job with the  government engineers as they were building this dam out at Fort Supply, and  he was making  100 a month. We bought furniture, groceries, paid bills, and  the house on that. Can you believe that? He was playing third base and  pitcher on this softball team. They were in the state tournament. We went  down to the game Saturday night, came home and were married here Sunday  at noon, and went back down there and played ball that night. As we came in  the stadium everybody applauded because they knew we   d just gotten married.  We spent our night down there with three other couples who went with us in  the same car because we didn   t have a lot of cars. You all traveled in one car.  There were three other couples with us that night. That   s how I spent my  wedding night, playing ball.  Did you make it to Crystal Beach during that time period?  Yes, I swam some out there, but most of the time I was working. I had very  few dates. I didn   t have much of a life outside of working. I just had to work.  I got off every other Sunday. That was the only time I was off work. The  other time I worked everyday.  You two seem like you had very different experiences.  We had very different lives.  And yet here you are together.  I wanted him to tell you, too, how different the lives were here.  You left for California in    39.  No,    39 is when I had my kidney out. I waited a year. I went in    41.  So you were both here during the main period of the dust bowl. Did you have  a lot of friends and neighbors and relatives even that moved away or did  something else?  You said that your brother was in California.  19  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Yes, my brother, he went sooner than I did. Right after graduation one of the  boys that we went around with went out and got a good job. He kept writing  to us telling us that we should come out there, there were a lot of jobs, and a  lot of work. I did, and when I went out there I got a job as an errand boy with  the Aluminum Company of America.  How much were you making then? Tell them that you thought you   d died and  gone to Heaven. (laughter)  The first job I had there I don   t remember. I just filed stuff for this guy and  everything else like that. They were hiring cost accountant timekeepers, and  he was in charge of them. I impressed him enough that he gave me a job, and  let me go out as a cost accountant timekeeper at  20 a month. I   m telling you,  I was in tall cotton. For  5 I bought all the groceries I needed, and the  apartment I rented was  20 a month. I was really making good money at the  time. That   s not right. That   s almost double what I was making here, wasn   t  it?  They replaced all Nyle   s veins a year ago, from here down and to his knees.  He had a light stroke during that. Can you imagine? Now he has a bad hernia,  and they   re afraid to operate on him again. He   s had a lot of health problems.  He gets kind of confused at times.  That   s that wild life. I went into the army for a while with one kidney. I was  probably the only person who ever went in with one kidney. A lot of them  came out with one kidney because they   d get it shot out and stuff. That horse  saved my life. If I   d have been in good health, I may have had to go to Europe  or some place, and got my ass shot off  laughter . The way it was, I was in  limited service in the army, so they could send me any place except where  there was battle. They finally discharged all limited service people. I got a job  then as a salesman for a drug company. They sent me to Denver, Colorado.  That   s where I spent most of my life, was in Colorado again. I married there  and had two children. My wife died of cancer the same as Wendell did in the  same year. My mother was still alive here, and so I   d come to visit her. That   s  when I went to the museum and ran into Marcella.  He came into buy one of our history books.  And got reacquainted. I started dating her.  He says,    You don   t remember me.    I said,    No, not after 50 years I don   t.     He said,    Well then, I   m not buying it.    I said,    Oh yes, I vaguely remember  you    because he loved one of my friends in high school (laughter). From then  on it took off.  So for you, California paid off. You went there, got out of here, and made  some money out there.  Yes, that   s right.  20  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Did you have friends or relatives that went out there and came back?  I have only one friend that went out there and came back. He   s back again out  there. He was here and had a heart attack, and had to have all his veins  replaced and stuff. He still had children out there in California, so he went  back to California. Most of them have died out there.  During World War II, Wendell went into the army. I had two babies, and he  went to India, Burma, and China for two years. I have to laugh at these today  that go for six months and think it   s terrible. In World War II they went for  two to five years.  That displaced a lot of our friends, the war.  Our life changed. Life has never been the same since, has it?  No.  So it sounds like the war had a bigger effect than the dust bowl did.  Oh, my yes. Before that, here we had these silent movies first, and then I  remember the first talking picture, oh my (laughing)  Fredrick March was in it  and Janet  Gaynor . Before the war we lived in this wonderful world of make-believe,  Victorian almost, where the movies always ended happily. There was  never tragedy. We were so naive. We were just really naive. Even those who  were poor, it was the same life to them. After the war, our morals went to  heck. We had an army camp here, west of town. They trained out in Boiling  Springs Park. That was all cut off then because they were teaching them to  fight in jungle warfare. If you   ve never been out there, it   s very jungle like  down by the river. It   s very different. We had a lot of soldiers here. My sister  was a mess. She was three years younger, and she dated a lot of them. I was  married with two babies, so I was pretty well stuck.  I was wondering, Nyle, how your family felt about public assistance or  welfare.  Didn   t have it.  During the depression, not having as much money?  Right. My mother and father didn   t socialize very much, but I don   t think we  knew anybody that was on welfare.  Well now, your uncle did, honey.  It seemed like everybody was able to get some kind of little job. Like my  stepfather, he was making a dollar a day, but hell, at least he was working. He  had to go to work in the morning. He used to leave at six o   clock in the  morning and go down to where they have all the trucks and stuff at. He didn   t  get off until six o   clock at night. He put in 12 hours a day about, for that dollar  21  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  a day he was making. He was a strong Democrat. When Roosevelt came in,  he was really excited about that because Roosevelt finally raised wages, the  minimum wage went up. He began to get more money. I   d already left here,  but they were thrilled to death that he could get more money.  There was no welfare in those days; in fact, the churches, preachers, were very  poor. They had to be committed to the Lord to even preach. Mother said that  every year, she had a friend that was a preacher, that they would send a  welfare barrel to them, I guess you   d call it. I forget what she called that  barrel.  It still goes on there. We were supposed to take groceries and stuff down so  they   d get that barrel.  When this girl would get the barrel she   d get some new clothes, and she was so  excited. They were all used. People helped each other. We had tramps that  came by the house. We called them tramps.  So Roosevelt   s programs didn   t affect your family, and the New Deal didn   t  really come into play?  My father was working for the state of Oklahoma. That   s who he worked for.  When Roosevelt came in and raised the minimum wage all over the United  States, that   s the only way he benefited was the fact that they began to pay  more money.  Did you ever hear of Amos Chapman, the famous Indian scout?  No.  You never heard of him. He had a wooden leg, and it attached on with a strap  around his neck. He married a Cheyenne woman down by Seiling. You came  through Seiling coming up here. That   s a lot of Indian country down there on  to Canton, Cheyenne and Arapaho. He was a Cheyenne scout, and he is in the  history books. That   s why I was asking if you   d heard of him. Nyle   s  stepfather loved horses. They would get together, the little communities, and  raise their horses. Tell them about Amos Chapman and his horse and your  stepfather.  He had a horse with a big sore on his front leg. It was a great big old sore, and  the horse could hardly walk around. He was a racehorse. My dad had a  racehorse, so he had a matched race with him. He beat my dad. We never  could believe it. Here was old Chapman who was so old with that old wooden  leg on him, and that horse with the big old sore on it. I don   t know what it cost  my dad, probably  4 or  5. They used to race for  4 or  5.  10 was the most  they had to bet on the horse races, but he beat us.  When I was doing history research I went down and called on Amos  Chapman   s youngest son that was still alive. My family was so well known all  over this part of the country that I just went up to this trailer, knocked on the  22  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  door, and said,    I   m Marcella      Plank at that time      and my father was Art  Fuller.       Oh come in here,    because he   d played ball with him. Indians are  inclined to exaggerate (laughing). He told some whoppers that I knew weren   t  true, but I taped it all. When Wendell died I got a couple of cards from some  of those Chapman   s down in there. It   s amazing the contacts you   ll make, and  what I learned. In early days, they told me they put a pump down in for water,  and there was so much quicksand here that the pump had disappeared. Our  water was so high then. They   re using that for irrigation out in the panhandle.  I   m worried. There   s oil down here yet, but it is so deep that the bits they  would use are not strong enough to get to it. We have iodine and salt here in  abundance, because they   re using the underground water so fast for irrigation  purposes.  About the pumps going down into the ground, if you drive around this country  you   ll see rows and rows of trees on the fence line. They cut the posts and  planted them there, and there was so much water there that they started  growing. That   s how come we   ve got so many trees in a lot of areas out here  is because of the water that was here. Roosevelt, the one thing that they did  was plant all these trees. They came in and planted great big groups of trees to  help stop the dust. That was a wonderful program that really helped to settle  that dust and stuff. The reason why we had it was because of the way that they  were farming at the time. The farmers would just plow up all the land and just  let them set there bare, and when the wind came along it took the topsoil off.  You see, our lives were different, but I still didn   t have all that I wanted.  Grandpa didn   t believe in spoiling you. In fact, you had to walk a certain way  up his front steps to get in his house without falling through. When I went to  Sweden, I found out that the Swedes don   t flaunt their wealth like we do in  America, do they?  No.  They   re very laid back. Then, I understood him much better, why he had  money, but I didn   t know he had money. He was also a banker here. He was  vice president of a big bank here. The Stein home   that was the banker   s  name, L. L. Stein. He was also an early day, first guy here. They built a big  home down by the railroad tracks. They   re trying to save it now. They   re  trying to make it a Bed and Breakfast Inn or something. They lived in it about  three years, and Mr. Stein had bought German war bonds in World War I. The  public found out about it and made a run on the bank and broke him. He  ended up a pauper. His family left him.  My grandfather found out about it, set my folks down, and he was lying on the  bed with no sheets or anything. Mother went and got sheets, and grandpa  hired a nurse to take care of him until he died. Then he found out there was no  tombstone or anything, so he had a tombstone put up. I got that first hand,  after they were all dead, from the lady whose father ran the tombstone place.  Stein   s a whole other story, but my grandfather was vice president at that bank.  He had his finger in everything throughout the whole Western part of  23  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Oklahoma. My mother made my clothes. Then when I married Wendell, he  never made a lot of money, and the store didn   t have a lot. As Grandpa says  you could make a living and that was about it. I made all of my kids    clothes  but their jeans, and girls didn   t wear jeans then. My girls, for my 80th birthday,  they wrote down, I have it over there, a little blanquettes of what they  remembered about me. Both of my girls said I didn   t have a boughten   purchased  dress until I married (laughing). My life has not been rich, but my  family was influential here. Do you understand what I   m saying? Nyle  thought I was untouchable, didn   t you? I lived on the right side of the track,  and dated a boy that had some money.  All of us that lived on the other side of the tracks was poor people. All the rich  people lived right in this area.  It was kind of a disgrace, and it is to this day, to live on the North side of the  tracks because that   s where the red light district was. I   d dress up as the  madam of the red light district and give talks about her life. The last time I  gave it at senior citizens, oh dear, one of the old men even followed me home   You must have been playing the role pretty good, huh?  Yeah, I had a purple satin outfit and a hat that had a plume. I was popular, and  my family being well known, my life was very different from his. I worked in  the store.  She was probably one of the richest girls in town when we were in high  school, so all of the boys were after her.  Well, I don   t know if they all were honey, but I had my share. (laughing)  Your dad worked in the drug store, right? You worked with your dad, is that  right?  No.  No. My father worked for the Oklahoma State Highway department.  So he was never a farmer?  No.  Tell them what you told me, that today he would have been a hippie.  When he was young, he would leave the farm. He grew up on a farm down  here, but he   d take off on his racehorse. He had about three racehorses. He  had a wagon and a team that pulled them. He   d go around all over this part of  the country to county fairs and stuff and race these horses. That   s what he did.  He was a hippie for those days. He didn   t stay and help out on the farm, he  was always doing other things, traveling around this country racing horses and  stuff.  24  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  What years would that have been that he was out there?  Probably before I was born. Probably around    19 or    18 or something like that  when he was a young man.  1918 and 1919.  He had odd jobs. He was with the harvest crews and stuff. When he worked a  little bit that   s what he did. If he wasn   t racing the horses, then he ended up on  odd jobs.  I started to tell them about the tramps that would come to our door.  Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.  They were poor people who would come and knock on our door and want  something to eat. My mother would always fix them a sandwich and a glass of  milk or something. Then they   d go on. They never bothered us particularly,  did they? They just would be traveling through on trains and stuff and stop.  I imagine we had a lot more than you did because we lived by the railroad  tracks there at Tangier.  Yeah, you probably did.  Those guys would jump those trains. I don   t think there was ever a day that  we didn   t see a tramp of some kind as a kid.  I remember when I got out at the museum, and for years I just helped the  curator and then she got Lou Gehrig   s disease. I   ve been secretary, treasurer,  president, and curator out there. I read in an old newspaper where my  grandfather, in running for one of his races, was a frequent visitor to the red  light district, and shouldn   t be mayor. I thought, oh boy. I later found out that  those girls traded with him a lot. In fact, I have a picture of them in the back  of the store with my grandma and grandpa in the front. She didn   t speak to  Grandpa for a week. He also had some property down there. Whether he ever  used it, and knowing the Swedes he probably did (laughing) because my  grandmother wasn   t    He won the race, so I guess it didn   t matter very much.  You have to go to Sweden. Their life is so different. I was with this cousin,  and he took me out to draw on the ocean. We had an Italian artist giving us  lessons, so I can say I   ve studied in Europe. Coming back, we were driving  through Malmo, and he said,    Now that   s where those women live,    because  here was this street with great big boulders across it. I said,    What women?        Those women.    It finally dawned on me that that   s what he was talking  about, and he said,    The priest went down there one time and took all the  license plates down there, and then called their families.    I said,    Oh boy, I   ll  bet that caused a lot of trouble.    He didn   t like that remark. He said that it  caused much trouble. He was unhappy. We are inclined to do that, and they  don   t understand our humor.  25  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Did you have the tramps work around the house, do any chores, or things like  that for their food?  Sometimes.  We always had a cow. We had to milk the cow, and we fed chickens and stuff  like that. There wasn   t much to do. None of us had any clothes. We never  had a closet, we just had a nail in the wall where we could hang our overalls  and shirt and stuff that we weren   t wearing at the time.  My mother even made my panties, little white cotton panties. Flour sacks  were a big item that you got.  My mother made all my shirts and my brother   s shirts. We bought overalls at  the store, the stripped overalls and stuff. We got one new pair every year to  start school with.  And you had to take care of them.  When you got home at night, you   d change into your old ones to go out in the  yard.  I had two dresses for school that were nice, but I had older ones I played in. I  liked to play with dolls. I   d set up in my apple tree. There was no grass like  there is now, and the wind was blowing a mile an hour with the dirt. I   d set up  in that apple tree with my doll and play like it was my house.  Even out in the dirt storm, huh?  Yeah, it was just terrible, dust and dirt, and I   d be up in this apple tree.  You may think back during that time of the Dirty Thirties and everything, what  would you say would be its biggest mark that it   s left on you?  Christmas.  I wouldn   t have guessed that. Why?  See, my grandmother, being Pennsylvania Dutch     I   m going to ask you the same question in a little bit.  Being German, she put a lot of emphasis on Christmas. We   ve always had big  Christmases in my family. Every year my grandfather would stand up and say,     Well, I didn   t have time to shop, so here is my gift,    and he   d give me money  in an envelope according to our status in the family. My parents got more or  her brother and sister got more than us kids, of course. Grandmother and my  mother would bake a month before, fruitcakes and stuff. There was all this  lavish food around this big table.  26  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  I always had to eat in the kitchen, I never made it to the living room. It   s that  way here now. Christmas to me has always; you ought to see this house at  Christmas. It   s just decorated inside and out. My daughter, who lives here,  and her children have never, my daughters were both married here, have never  spent a Christmas outside of this home. We really make a big thing out of it,  don   t we honey?  I   ll say.  On Christmas we have Jesus    birthday party and a big cake and blow out  candles to him and sing and we go to communion. They all have to come to  the kitchen when they get here, and they come in according to their age, the  littlest one on up. The stockings are just thick around the mantle. They open  their stockings first. The gifts will be the whole end of this room. It   s gotten  bigger and bigger because the kids are so spoiled anymore. We always have  shoo fly pie for Christmas breakfast. My grandmother did it; my cousins do it.  That   s just how it   s always been.  So that   s something you   ve carried with you that whole way.  From early days. Shoo fly pie is syrup in piecrust with flour and sugar crumbs  on it. It   s a coffee pie really. For dinner, we have turkey and potato dressing  that she made. A lot of the old recipes are carried over every year, and my  family, I can   t make enough potato dressing for them. It   s an old German  thing. She used her recipes, but my grandfather didn   t. I didn   t have a lot of  Swedish food until I went over there. I could eat all but the pickled herring.  That   s raw. I couldn   t eat it, could you?  Yeah, I like that a lot. I like the pickled herring.  I think thinking of it raw kind of got me.  It   s odd, yeah.  One of the cousins, that was his specialty was pickling his own herring.  Did you eat the caviar in the squeeze tubes?  Oh, all of it, the red and the black and all of it, and a lot of fish. One of my  cousins over there is quite wealthy, so we ate in a big tower that extends over  the road and glass. We went up there and he ordered a fabulous dinner. The  matre   d wanted to see his credit. He showed him a card that he was an  ambassador, and we just really got the attention.  I   m guessing your Christmas memories were a little different.  I didn   t ever believe in Santa Claus. We were so poor and my mother didn   t  want anything like that started because she couldn   t have given us any gifts.  She told us when I was very young that there was no Santa Claus. We never  had a Christmas, never.  27  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Lemons  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Isn   t that something?  Did you not have a Christmas tree?  One time after we moved here, my stepfather went up to the canyons and cut a  little tree and brought it in. Only one time do I ever remember having a tree,  but no particular gifts for any of us. We never had a Christmas. I didn   t know  what it was all about. I believed that there was no Santa Claus and no  Christmas and stuff. My mother was so upset about my father getting killed  and being left with three little kids, so she got so she hated God. She didn   t  believe in God or anything like that because why would he do that to her. She  was left with three little kids and had all of her money taken away from her.  She put  5,000 in the bank, and the bank closed that day. She was completely  broke, and here she was with three little kids and no husband. My mother was  always very upset about all this stuff. She finally, over the years, got over that  a lot.  His mother was one of 12 children.  You can see why we didn   t have Christmas at all. We didn   t go to church or  anything like that.  That   s all I knew, see.  It was just different.  So, then, what was your fondest memory?  I don   t have any.  You got that orange.  Yeah, I got that orange pop, and I got a real orange. My stepfather did take me  to the church that night for the Christmas party, but we didn   t get any gifts or  anything except for what they gave away, the orange and the apple. You  might say I guess, that   s the only thing I remember about anything like that.  So you would say of that whole time period, of the depression and dust bowl,  that the memory that sticks out in your head the most is the orange soda.  Right.  Wow.  I   d never had anything like that, and it tasted so good that hot day.  We don   t think anything of cracking open two or three a day.  No, my kids leave half of them setting around and don   t even drink them all.  28  Kite  Lemons  M. Bynum  Lemons  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Do you want to shut this off and look at some pictures?  Unless there   s anything else you want to tell us for the recording.  Do you want to see some of the stuff here?  Sure.  That sounds great. I had a quick question for you. You brought this up, that  most of the customers at your family   s grocery store were charge customers  because they didn   t have any money. So one of the biggest effects of that  period on your life would be the closing of that store. You were giving away  so much.  I see families today that have a lot more money than I   ve got that owe my  folks.  Oh yeah?  Yes.  That must be kind of odd.  One is my son-in-law   s mother.  Okay, we   ll leave that there (laughter).  She married a real wealthy man over at Shattuck that had no family or  anything. My family kept giving them groceries and giving them groceries,  and she owed them like  500 or  600. Do you think she   s going to pay that to  me? No way. I live with that. I know of families.  Did your family charge groceries?  Yes. We definitely did. We traded at the other store, the Adams Store. My  aunt worked there, that   s mostly the reason. My father really liked the  Martinsons and the Fullers better than he did the Adams, but my aunt worked  at the Adams store, so we traded and charged there all the time. That   s one  thing my mother did. When my father got his check every month that   s where  most of it went was to the Adams grocery store.  A lot of them were real honest and would come in and pay, but a lot of them  weren   t. I   ve cameled eggs in that old store. I don   t even know if you know  what I   m talking about.  Oh yeah. You hold them up and see if they   re     The farmers would bring in cream to sell that you couldn   t even stir with a  spoon.  29  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  Would you buy that cream and those eggs that weren   t very good or would you  just have to throw it out?  Yes, and they would take the money. I have some tokens back here, too, that  my grandfather, if you bought so much groceries and paid for them he   d give  you a token, and they were worth like a dime to a dollar. I   ve got some of  them back here. If you got enough tokens you could turn them in for a pair of  shoes for your kids. And you had general merchandise. One half was dry  goods and stuff, and the other half groceries. When my folks took it over, they  did away with the dry goods part and just had groceries. There were different  promotions even then to get people to trade with you.  The Adams store, all the stores were that way. They had clothing and  everything, groceries and clothing.  They were general stores. Kind of like little Wal-Marts (laughing).  When Safeway came, they didn   t carry dry goods and all that kind of stuff.  You couldn   t charge there, but they could be cheaper to buy.  So Adams built a big new store, and they only had a grocery store in it. Two  of the boys that worked for them in the dry goods and then they opened a big  clothing store here separately. That   s the way that things began to happen on  account of Safeway.  And the small stores went out of business. One of our questions here deals  with the kind of house you lived in. That   s easy for you to answer because  we   re in it, but what about yours? What was your house like?  It was a little small two-bedroom house. It was very small and over on the  other side of town. We didn   t have a bathroom inside the house. The  bathroom was back on the alley. They didn   t want to run everything to the  house and build onto the house to have a bathroom, so they built it out on the  top of the sewer line.  So it was running water, a flushing toilet, but it was way out in the back?  Yes. And a shower.  I can remember that, and then the folks built on a bathroom here. I can  remember using the slop jar at night upstairs, if you had to go.  I   ve never heard it called that before.  Oh yes, I   ve got one in here (laughter). It was for if you had to go at night, and  then mother would clean it up during the day. I can remember, in those days  the kitchen was where the dining room is today, and I can remember taking  baths in the big old round tub according to our age. It went me and my sister  then my brother and my dad and mother. I cannot remember whether we used  30  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Lemons  M. Bynum  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  Kite  N. Bynum  M. Bynum  the same water. I can remember her heating that water.  You did; we did anyway (laughter).  And her pouring it in to keep it warm.  So if you were the last kid in the chain, you were using that fifth, sixth kid old  dirty water.  Yeah, and I remember the old stove sat where you   re at. Dad would come  down every morning and get the stove started. It sat on an asbestos pad. I can  remember how cold it was in the winter, and how hot it was in the summer,  and how   d I   d have to open the windows for mother upstairs during the  summer. The flies would come in so bad that our ceilings would be so fly  specked that we   d have to paint them every fall, and take out the stove in the  summer, and build it back up in the winters. I can remember a lot of the  differences. It was not easy like it is today for our bath. We used the same  towel because washing was so hard. Even when I first married washing was  hard. I had to hang diapers all over the house in the winter because they froze  outside. Even when I was a young woman, life was difficult. We did have  refrigerators by then, but I can remember as a girl the sign in the window of  how much ice you needed, and it was brought in and put in the refrigerator.  Icebox.  I gave my icebox to the museum. It was my place to empty the ice pan, the  water that dripped through.  So that was like your chore at the house, was to do that.  Yeah. It was so different than today. I love today, dishwashers and dryers.  We didn   t have dryers.  Inside bath.  And inside baths, my goodness. Our convenience today, and you can bathe  every day. Mother always washed our feet and hands and face before we went  to bed. I was in bed every night at eight o   clock, no questions asked, because  Mother wanted the evening with daddy. I remember one time she let me stay  up to listen to Rudy Valley on the radio. It was a big night for me.  Did you guys have a radio?  No, eventually we got one, but they had been around for quite a while before  we ever owned one.  Our old radio sat there in that little corner. I   d rush home from school to listen  to Little Orphan Annie. There'd be so much static that I   d get right down next  to the speaker to try to listen to it. My grandfather had a big red microphone  thing, and played music. That was really something. Our life was so different.  31  It just was different.  -------  -------
