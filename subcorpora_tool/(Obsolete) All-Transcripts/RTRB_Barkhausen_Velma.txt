RIGELHAUPT: Okay, it&#039;s September 22nd, 2006. I&#039;m in Modesto, California doing an
oral history interview with Velma Barkhausen. And if I could just to begin ask
you what year you were born and your full name.

BARKHAUSEN: I was born 1915. My full name is Velma E-V-A-N-S Evans Barkhausen.
Not now but should I--it&#039;s Evans though, maiden name. And I married W. B. Jones
in 19 and 33. We had no children, and see he was--we was married 26 years when
he passed away. And we moved. We came to--we left the farm to come out here and
see our mother and dad. And while we were here, the war started and we stayed
here because we had some people on our place. My first husband died in 19 and
59, January the 1st, I believe. And then I moved to California. I sold my farm.
I sold my everything and the farm. Put my stuff in my little Chevy that I had
and I brought it to California to be here in Modesto with my family. Then I met
Barkhausen and we got married. We were married 28 years when he passed away.

We went to work in the shipyard I think &#039;45, sometime. I have all my papers here
to show you. When Port Chicago had the three ships explode, blow up, my husband
and I were here visiting with our parents. We spent the night with them. We went
home like noon. When my dad told us about the shipyard blowing up we went home
then. But we had to have our papers to get to Port Chicago because couldn&#039;t
nobody go in there that didn&#039;t live there. And we got there. Our home was gone.
It was just a ruin. And we stayed in--I don&#039;t know--remember what it is, Walnut
Creek, or some--they put us up in a motel for three days. And then Richmond had
little new apartments and they moved us and put us in an apartment by the
shipyard. And we were working all this time.

And then while we was going in and out, it was wonderful for me to get the
experience that I got while I was working there. Because I helped the ship
plates, building them, and we had little roller things with scoot on them or tar
it up and down putting that drill for the drill holes in the ship plates. And
then the smoke got to me and I signed up and went to electrician. And I went to
the school. Then I passed my test, went on the ships, and put in electricity.

One night we were ready, getting ready to come home, and the whistle blew. So we
all went out to go home. And we couldn&#039;t go home because our ship had got out in
the ocean. And we didn&#039;t know it. So we had to wait till they came back in. But
we had to do that to finish up the ship so we could have it ready for the next day.

And I laughed many a time because when I was changing shifts they was people,
people, people like all cows a-going, some going to work, and we were going
home. My mother, she was getting up in age, and she went in as a clean up lady,
her and a little black lady worked together, and they&#039;d come home and my mother
would tell what fun they had working and then, too, at noon they was always an
entertainer there, Bob Hope, or some of the movie stars that come and entertain
us while we were eating our lunch. And we had benches out on the beach. We&#039;d sit
there and eat lunch. Those birds would come along and we&#039;d throw our--feed them
and they really take things over, but we had fun with them.

But the day that Roosevelt died we were coming home from the work and as we were
going out we heard President Roosevelt had passed away and everybody, &quot;Uh!&quot; You
know because we didn&#039;t want to lose him during the war but we did. So then after
he died, my husband and I got a call about his father. He was sick and had to
put him in the hospital and so we got--Barry then got--went back to Oklahoma to
be with him. And so then we didn&#039;t come out here anymore till he passed away, my
husband passed away. And I moved out here. So I don&#039;t know. I need some
questions now.

RIGELHAUPT: Well, I was going to say could we jump backwards a little bit. Where
were you born? And could you talk a little bit about your first few years of
life and your family life?

BARKHAUSEN: I was born in Walden, Arkansas in 19 and 15. In a little log cabin.
My dad and mother was both born in Arkansas. My grandmother on my dad&#039;s side was
from Tennessee. And they moved to Arkansas in, I guess, like 1910 or something
like that. And then--and when I was eight months old my dad and mother decided
to move to Oklahoma. And we moved--at Bragg, Oklahoma, and the stork brought my
little brother. That&#039;s what I was told it did. And my daddy, he&#039;d go out on the
porch and look under the porch. I&#039;d say, &quot;Daddy what you looking for?&quot; and he
says, &quot;That old stork has not got here yet.&quot; And I&#039;d wonder what he meant about
a stork. Finally he told me, he said, &quot;Well, you know they bring little babies,
don&#039;t you?&quot; And so I thought that&#039;s what it was.

But anyway, we stayed there till my brother was about two years old. Then we
moved to Sulphur, Oklahoma and Davis. I was just real small then. And I stayed
there till I got married in 19 and 33. And then we moved on our own farm. And we
farmed till my husband died. Then I moved out here.

But I was raised in Oklahoma. Went to school in Oklahoma. And helped raise seven
of my siblings. My mother and dad worked in the field. I know--I remember one
time my brother that is deceased now, he was a mischievous little guy, and my
mother and I had fixed--well mostly I had fixed lunch that day. And we had
cleaned up the table and left the milk on the table because then you didn&#039;t have
iceboxes. And this jar of milk about this big, that little guy, he took a box of
matches, and he would strike them and throw them all over the house. I was
trying to catch him, he&#039;d run over here and strike another. Directly he caught
that tablecloth on fire. Well, then I had to grab my sister. She was sitting on
the floor. And there&#039;s a box there and I grabbed the box and her in one hand,
other box. And ran out with her and put her in that box. Then went back in and
tried to run him down again. Finally, he run out the door. So about that time I
went to screaming. I looked up and here come my little mama just running fast as
she could come to see why I was hollering.

And so anyway after it was all over with well--oh, the milk. It got so hot it
broke the jug and put the fire out. And when my mother got there, well I said,
&quot;Mama, I couldn&#039;t catch him.&quot; I said, &quot;He got that box of matches and he just
kept throwing it and throwing it.&quot; And so she taken the box of matches and got
one out, let it burn a little bit, she blew it out, she touched it to her hand,
and then she put it to him, he said, &quot;Oh Mama, that burnt.&quot; She said, &quot;I meant
for it to. Now you leave matches alone.&quot; He said--but I guess he did. Because
that was dangerous.

But anyway I was just a normal, stringling gal. Had been trying to help Mom and
Dad with the kids and doing what I could. But I never did mind things like that.
I did if they were hurt or something. But I guess I&#039;ve been ornery all my life myself.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you know why your family moved from Tennessee to Arkansas?

BARKHAUSEN: To better their life, livelihood. Then it was hard on people. And
that&#039;s why my family moved to California because they thought they&#039;d find better
living means. So that&#039;s when my dad and mother came to California when they had
that dust storm in Oklahoma and I was married then and I didn&#039;t, I stayed in
Oklahoma till my husband died. And lived in there. But then we came out during
the war and stayed out here, but our home was still there.

RIGELHAUPT: And you also said that your family moved from Arkansas to Oklahoma
just after you were born. Do you know what caused them to move then?

BARKHAUSEN: I think they were hunting a better living and a better way of making
a living or something because the way I saw it, Arkansas didn&#039;t really thrive
till I&#039;d say they started doing good maybe in the &#039;29 or &#039;30s. They was
real--but now they&#039;re just as up as much as we are out here. Because when I was
able I went back every year. But my mother and dad, they were farmers at heart
and so they was looking for farm work. And I know they moved to Tulare. And my
dad worked in fruit trees and things there. And then my brothers did when they
got big enough. But my younger brother, he said that wasn&#039;t for him. So when he
got out of high school he got him a job and went to Cal Poly and got his
education. And he worked while he was going to school. So he still lives in San
Jose. He likes it over there. And then I have three that&#039;s passed on, siblings.

RIGELHAUPT: What were some of the crops that your family farmed?

BARKHAUSEN: Cotton, and but after we got married, the first year after we got
married, I quit cotton. I didn&#039;t like to pick it, I didn&#039;t like to hoe. And you
didn&#039;t make no money on it. Because you&#039;d have to borrow money at the first two
years to buy seed and then it took all you made to pay your bills. And so I said
There&#039;s a better way. Then we got in the cattle business. We raised our cattle.
And then we fed them but still we&#039;d sell--now and then you could sell them. The
cow would pay your bills. And I didn&#039;t mind that. But we made our own sorghum
molasses and we just did all of it, raised our beans and potatoes and I canned
stuff, froze stuff in freezers after we got electricity. I was married before I
knew they had electricity on the farm. [chuckles] Because we didn&#039;t have it there.

RIGELHAUPT: So in those first few years of your life did your parents own the
land they were farming?

BARKHAUSEN: No. No. They had sharecropped if you know what that is.
Sharecropping is when you raise--when at the end of the year you give them half
of what the crop brought. Then you had your bills to pay out of that. It was
hard. It was a hard go for a family on the parents, say three or four kids, and
they&#039;re little and they don&#039;t get to work or anything. Well, but after us kids
got big we picked cotton. That&#039;s before I got married. Picked cotton, chopped
cotton. We had to stay out of school to do all that because picking the cotton
would be about the first month of school starting in the fall. So kids had to
work--or we kids did. And I remember looking around, everybody else did. But I
don&#039;t think--we didn&#039;t mind it. We thought that was the way that everybody was doing.

And then if you had a hailstorm or something come and wipe your crop out, well
you&#039;ve had it there. So when I was two years old we lived in Bragg, Oklahoma
because that&#039;s where my little brother was born. Then we moved from there to--I
don&#039;t know why we moved to Sulphur really. I guess--oh I do know. [pointing to
picture] My grandfather, the guy up there holding that little guy, that&#039;s my dad
that&#039;s there in his lap, well he had already moved, him and my grandmother. And
we moved to be close to them. Used to people would do that, the family would all
move to the same place.

RIGELHAUPT: I&#039;ve read there was a bad crop infestation in the early teens, the
boll weevil that attacked cotton. I&#039;m wondering if your family talked about that.

BARKHAUSEN: I don&#039;t think--I remember that. That was after--I remember that well
because this went through and it was some grasshoppers also went through too,
and just ate everything that was green. They just wiped everything out. Then I
guess the next two or three years later, it came the sandstorm and nothing but
just sand, and people couldn&#039;t even plant things because it wouldn&#039;t stay. The
seed, the dirt would come off the plants. It was bad.

RIGELHAUPT: Did you have extended family, aunts and uncles, living near you?

BARKHAUSEN: Yes and each one took care of the other&#039;s kids while the other
worked. Of course, then I was smaller but I remember my mother, my aunt and them
taking care of each other&#039;s kids. And they worked together. And everybody looked
up to our grandfather and grandmother. All the family. And we were afraid to
sass our grandma. And my grandpa would have bopped us. So we respected them.
That&#039;s why it gets me sometime when I see kids that don&#039;t take care of their--I
mean parents don&#039;t take care of their kids. Especially when they go to church.
But anyway I feel sorry for the younger generation because they&#039;re allowed to do
things that we wasn&#039;t. It&#039;s not jealousy, it&#039;s just I wonder what they&#039;re going
to do when they get grown. But that&#039;s life for you, I guess.

RIGELHAUPT: You mentioned church. Was church life important to your family while
you were growing up?

BARKHAUSEN: Yes. Yes my grandmother put her little hat and her little gloves on
and here we all went to church. My mother and my aunts, one week, one Sunday
they would--my mother would do lunch on Saturday for everybody, and then they&#039;d
take turns every Sunday. We&#039;d all meet at my grandparents&#039; and have lunch
together. And I can remember the ice cream after lunch. We made ice cream and
lemonade. And then after church on Sunday, after we had our lunch and
everything, my grandparents had a room called a side room. And they had their
organ in there and my dad and my aunts and them would play that organ. We&#039;d sing
hymns all afternoon. And we were a close family. And right today we are, aren&#039;t
we? There&#039;s few of us now but we all get together two and three times a year for
our family thing.

RIGELHAUPT: What denomination was the church?

BARKHAUSEN: I was raised in a Methodist church but I was baptized in the Baptist
church. And now I go to Salvation Army church, Red Shield. Been going there 12 years.

RIGELHAUPT: Did you have a favorite subject in school when you were in
elementary school?

BARKHAUSEN: Not really. I just wanted to hurry and get out and go home and see
how my parents was doing. When we were going to school, my first school, our
teacher didn&#039;t teach us. The elder kids, like in high school, everybody was in
the same one little room, and we&#039;d sit with the older kids and they would help
us read and things. And the teacher would teach the elder ones and then it&#039;s
like taking care of--like, I took care of older kids and then the olders would
come along and help with the others.

But our teaching wasn&#039;t like it is today. Because there were--well, I don&#039;t
think they had that many teachers anyway. And really we didn&#039;t--it seemed like
they got along all right. Because they had ballgames--I mean basketball. I
played basketball with them. Things like that. But we sat with whoever was
assigned to us and they&#039;d help us write and whatever that we needed to do.

But I enjoyed school but I&#039;d rather have been out with the kids and things
taking care of them. And then, too, my mother, every time she got sick, well I&#039;d
have to stay home and take care of her. I guess you didn&#039;t get to stay
interested in it like you should. But anyway, I only got to the tenth grade. But
I guess I didn&#039;t miss it too much. I made it pretty good. But I enjoyed my life
because, living like the time was, it made me be better with myself. I learned
to do these things and do independent things that I could go ahead and do even
after my husbands died. I just went right on with whatever we were doing. And
taking care of it. I&#039;m not saying it was easy but it wasn&#039;t all that hard.

RIGELHAUPT: When you were elementary school age roughly what was a typical day
like for your father?

BARKHAUSEN: My dad? Working in the field. He worked in the field. Our dad, I&#039;ve
seen him many a time sat and wait till we got through eating before he started.
He wanted us kids and Mom to have the best. And he thought that&#039;s what he worked
for. He worked for us kids and our mother. And I&#039;ve seen him many a--and we used
to get tickled at my mother and dad never ate until they kissed each other when
we had a meal. I&#039;ll always remember that. And I respected that. My dad always
told the boys don&#039;t come to the table without your shirt and your shoes on. He
always--your clothes. And they did, the boys did. But our dad and mom was good
to us and we respected them. But they got killed out here on the highway in
1965. A truck hit my mother from the back and my dad died in the accident. But
my mother never did get over it. She passed on. 1965.

RIGELHAUPT: And what was a typical day like for your mother when you were about
that age, elementary school age?

BARKHAUSEN: Work in the field. And taking care of the little kids if I wasn&#039;t at
home. Somebody had to stay because there was always the little ones. There&#039;s
eight of us and so my parents had five of us, then they waited eight years and
then started another family, they had three. [chuckles] Three little kids. And
so there&#039;s always something to do.

We used to carry water when we were little up a hill and our well was way
down--seemed like miles but it wasn&#039;t. We&#039;d have to--here we&#039;d go to the well
with two little buckets in each hand, water to carry for the evening meal. We
had a big old pot outside, until that pot full up and that was our bathwater.
And we did it in a number three washtub. Had no bathtub or anything. And it was
a treasure when we got electric. Anyway it was a good life.

RIGELHAUPT: And so the years when you were say elementary school age again and
were living in Oklahoma, your family was still growing cotton?

BARKHAUSEN: Yes. Yeah. But my husband and I wasn&#039;t. We went out of the cotton
business real quick. Because I didn&#039;t like it. I had enough of that before I got
married. Because you had to get up early and work late to get that cotton in and
in wintertime it was cold. Your little old hands would be freezing picking that
cotton. And then in spring you had to hoe it, get all the--keep the weeds out of
it. And it was work. But as I said everybody worked, seemed like to me.

RIGELHAUPT: What do you remember about the start of the Great Depression?

BARKHAUSEN: Well, I tell you, it didn&#039;t hurt my husband and I as much as it did
a lot of people because we had our own home. We had our own chickens, raised our
calves. And I did all of our canning and gardening. We had a big garden. And we
prepared for it. And then in the fall we had our potatoes or sweet potatoes. We
made our syrup, sorghum syrup. And oh, too, we had pecans, had a couple pecan
trees. And we sold the meats of the pecans and we had our fall garden. But the
people that didn&#039;t have their farm and things, they couldn&#039;t have all of that.
Because a lot of them moved from one farm to another to sharecropping.

But my dad and mother finally moved to Texas. But that was after I got married.
And so I think he got to working in the fruit then. He&#039;d help them prune trees
and--Mr. Connelly that used to be in Houston out here, he had a ranch and my dad
worked for him for 20 or 30 years. Well, until both of them got retired.

And my mother, she worked in the dry shed, they call it here, on Ninth Street
for years, in the fruit and drying the fruit and I guess in the fresh fruit too,
I don&#039;t know. I know she used to do the raisins. Because one year I came out to
visit her, there she was picking that stuff out of the raisins. And I got to
looking at it and my head got to doing that. I was trying to catch up with the
fruit. But that belt was going so fast. I said, &quot;I don&#039;t know how you&#039;re doing
that, Mom.&quot; &quot;Well, you get used to it&quot;. But it was hard on them. I know it was.

RIGELHAUPT: I&#039;m just going to pause for one second. [interview interruption] So
I&#039;ve read that the first couple years of the Depression, 1930 to 1932, were
especially hard on American families.

BARKHAUSEN: It was. It was because a lot of them didn&#039;t have nothing and then
when this dry spell came they couldn&#039;t raise nothing. It was bad. That&#039;s why so
many of the Oklahoma people moved out here. My dad and mother, that&#039;s why they
moved. But they stopped in Texas and stayed a year. And then they moved on out
here. That movie they made, I think my dad and mother was in the middle of that.
I&#039;m not for sure but they went through it like they did.

And when they came over, when they came out here, they had to stay across the
river in Yuba--was it Yuba?--for about a week. Because they had to get somebody
that lived here in California to go over and bring them back in. They had some
cotton sacks, my mother had I guess some clothes in it, and they had them cut
them cotton sacks up to see if there&#039;s any weevils or anything in there. And
Mama had to then take and put them in boxes. But my dad came down in Imperial
and we had a half-cousin living there. And he went back with my dad and brought
him back out there and then they brought him, moved my family in here. And they
was here five years before I got to come out and see them.

But anyway, they kept moving up this way from Tulare and they stayed in Imperial
Valley for a while and I heard my mother say, &quot;Well, the boys will go to the
sheds in the evening,&quot; after they all went, got through working, they&#039;d pick
carrots up and celery and stuff like that, bring it home, and they cleaned it up
and eat it because there&#039;d be a lot of things, carrots and things, they didn&#039;t
pack. And so they were allowed to bring that home with them, that they didn&#039;t
pack. And my mother a lot of times--well, our blood got plum orange eating so
many carrots. I could just see them eating carrots. They got carrots, celery,
and whatever vegetable that they were working in, they bring it home to them.

But my husband and I didn&#039;t seem to hit it very hard because we had all of our
cattle and--not much but enough to make a small living. And we canned and--one
year, when Hoover is in there, they came along and bought our cattle and then
they taken the cattle and killed the beef and canned it and give it back to the
farmers. Because we didn&#039;t have feed for them. And that was something that
was--seeing our little old cows and things, just kill them and put them in a can
and--but we got some of it. Whether it&#039;s ours or not, I hope not. But it was
rough for a lot of little people.

RIGELHAUPT: You said you got married in 1933? So those first couple years you
were still living at home with your parents.

BARKHAUSEN: That I married? Oh no, my husband, he was on a sharecrop farm then
and we just moved into the little old log cabin that was in the place. And we
sharecropped for two years and then we got us a farm and then eventually we
bought our place. We bought 20 acres. Then the next year or two, we bought 20
more. So when we got through we had 100 and some acres of land. Each year we&#039;d
add a little bit more to them. You had to dig your own well, build your own
house and all that. And then while we were out here working we made enough money
to rock veneer our house and when we went home my husband got a piece of the
ship, one of the ships that blowed up in Port Chicago. And I said, &quot;What in the
world you going to do with that?&quot; He says, &quot;I&#039;m taking it home.&quot; I said, &quot;That
thing?&quot; Yeah. So he took it down and it had the year and where it came from and
everything and he put it in that rock veneer at our front door on the outside
and everybody&#039;d come and, &quot;Oh, what&#039;s that?&quot; He was so proud of that piece of
metal and it was still there. I guess, still there now. But anyway he was proud
of that piece of metal that came out of that ship.

So. But I lived there after he died. I stayed about six months and then I moved
down here. And I loaded my little old &#039;68 Chevy up and away I came. I kept my
farm for a year because I didn&#039;t know whether I&#039;d want to go back or not. But I
didn&#039;t. I stayed. The year I went back and sold it, came back.

RIGELHAUPT: How did you meet your husband?

BARKHAUSEN: Well, my last husband, my brother was in Houston, his wife died six
months before my husband died. And then when I came out here I was staying with
my mother and dad for--and I was sitting there one day and I said Dad, &quot;I don&#039;t
know but I can&#039;t take this, I&#039;m not used to not doing anything.&quot; And they
wouldn&#039;t let me do any dishes, they wouldn&#039;t let me do anything. And so I sat
there and I said, I wonder if Bussy--that was my brother&#039;s name--would like for
me to come over and stay with him and his little girls? And so I called my
brother up. I said, &quot;Hon, you think you and me could get along and take care of
you and the three kids?&quot; He said, &quot;Sis, come on.&quot; And so I told my dad that. He
said, &quot;That&#039;s the best thing that I know you can do.&quot; So I moved over and lived
with him and the girls for until I met--and one day we went to Tulare, the three
girls and I, because on the weekend when my brother gave me money to buy gas, he
said, &quot;Now you girls go anywhere you want to, I&#039;ll just buy your gas and your
eats.&quot; And so my husband-to-be was working at Blueberry Hill then and I said--I
told the oldest one, I said, &quot;I&#039;m going to stop in here, Betty.&quot; She said, &quot;Now,
you know Dad filled the car up.&quot; She said, &quot;What are you going to get?&quot;. I said,
&quot;I know we got plenty oil but I&#039;ll just say check my oil please.&quot; And here come
that redheaded guy out, skipping like a little school kid and I looked at him
and I thought &#039;I like you!&#039;

And so he asked me, &quot;Oh, you sure got a cute family.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, really
they&#039;re my brother&#039;s but I&#039;m staying with him and helping take care of them.&quot;
And he said, &quot;Well, when you come back in Tulare, stop back by.&quot; And I said,
&quot;Okay.&quot; So I did, and that was the start of it. And about three or four--[phone
rings] Sorry.

RIGELHAUPT: It&#039;s okay, it&#039;s no problem.

BARKHAUSEN: Just raise it up and tell him to call later please because it&#039;ll go
on the answering machine.

RIGELHAUPT: I&#039;ll just pause everything. [interview interruption] I wanted to ask
you about how you met your first husband in Oklahoma.

BARKHAUSEN: Okay. I told you about carrying the water up the hill from the well
down--. One day we went down to the well, got the water, my two brothers and I.
And here he came on horseback and he stopped and was talking to us and so we
talked and then the next weekend, he did the same thing. And so then we went to
going together. And we just--oh, and there was a black pastor that went to
church and sometimes we&#039;d go over to their church. And I guess about six or
seven months after we met we got talking bout--kind of kidding around, &quot;Oh I&#039;m
not going to get married because my dad said I wasn&#039;t.&quot; So anyway he said,
&quot;Well, we are too.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; And it just fell in line that--so we went to the--he
came, picked me up in the wagon and he had sideboards on there and so--I mean
the seats. And we went down to the preachers, went to church. And so we told the
pastor there that we wanted him to marry us.

And so then after we got married we went over to one of his brother&#039;s and wife&#039;s
place and spent the night. And so the next day, when we went home, my dad, he
was mad, he said, &quot;How come you not come home?!&quot; And I said, &quot;Well Dad, we got
married.&quot; And he said, &quot;You got what?&quot; And I said, &quot;Yeah, we got married
yesterday.&quot; He said, &quot;Oh.&quot; Then he said okay then. And so that was that.

So we just went and moved into his place. We went and got my stuff and I moved
in with him. And it was I think a good marriage, because we were happy. We were
close, very close. But anyway we had our farm then. After we got two years we
got our farm. And anyway, we worked together. We had our own job, I did the
housework, the canning and the gardening. And we didn&#039;t have any children,
either one of us. And it was just us two. And we enjoyed life. We had a good life.

And he had cancer but he never would tell me and so the year before--Christmas
before he died, he went down to Odessa, Texas. And visited with a brother. But I
didn&#039;t realize he went down there to see a doctor. One of his
sister-in-laws--his sister-in-law down there had cancer. And she had went to
Dallas, Texas to a doctor and for her treatments. Well, I didn&#039;t know it but he
went down Odessa to go, his sister-in-law, to get a treatment. He went to that
doctor and the doctor told him he is eaten up with cancer. But he never told me.
So Christmas I got him an electric razor, that&#039;s the first one I think came out.
And then I had bought him some boots and a Stetson hat. Because he always wore a
Stetson hat.

And then, oh, when he got sick I had to take him to the hospital. Well, in fact,
I was working in town, and one of our neighbors, he hollered--because they&#039;d
lived on our place--and he hollered, kept screaming, finally she heard him, she
went up there and he told her, he said, &quot;I got to go to the hospital.&quot; So she
took him to hospital. Then she came by where I was working and told me that she
took him to the hospital. And so then I went right down, walked down--no, I had
my car, I drove down there--and they never told me what was wrong with him. So
then I went home because we had stock to feed. Then went back up, I got me
a--then you could stay in the hospital with them--and I take my nighties and my
robe and things, spent the night. So the next day or two they moved a bed in
there. And I stayed with him and I went out to the farm to take care of things
and I come back and they told me he&#039;s spitting up blood. He said, &quot;It is not,
it&#039;s grape juice, I drank some while ago.&quot; And they motioned for me to come out
and they said he&#039;s eat up with cancer. And so he died that night. But it was a
shock because he told me that day before Christmas, he said, &quot;I want you to take
these back to the--and you get to turn them in and get you something for
Christmas.&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#039;t want it, I don&#039;t need it.&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah, you take
it back and if you don&#039;t want, don&#039;t need it, just get the money.&quot; [knock at the
door] So--come in! Oh I&#039;m sorry. Come in. [interview interruption] Did I mess it up?

RIGELHAUPT: No, I just turned everything back on. So we were right at your
husband&#039;s passing.

BARKHAUSEN: That was 1959 that he passed away.

RIGELHAUPT: Now could you tell me about the first time you came to California?

BARKHAUSEN: It was in Houston. My parents had been here five years. And my
grandmother and I came by train out here. My parents sent me the money and I
came out. Well, they sent it for my grandmother. And my husband wanted me to
come with my grandmother. And we came out and we stayed a month. And they all
lived in Houston. They were working in the peaches. They were pitting. They had
little pitting machines. I never saw anything like that. That was so fascinating
to me, seeing them pull that thing down and put that peach in there and it
pulled it down, it took the seed out. We stayed a month and they lived out on
Whitmore, kind of in the country like. And I really enjoyed it because I&#039;m not
used to all this fruit and stuff. It was really a nice trip. My grandmother
enjoyed it too. And then my youngest sister was five years old. I had never seen
her. I really enjoyed my family. They lived out in the country over in Houston,
California. They came here I think like was it like &#039;34, 1934.

RIGELHAUPT: And where is Houston, California near?

BARKHAUSEN: Right here, right out--it&#039;s about eight or nine miles out, between
here and Tulare--I mean--well, oh, isn&#039;t that something? About nine miles
southeast of here. Yeah.

RIGELHAUPT: One of the things I&#039;ve read about is that it was hard for a lot of
people who moved to California from Oklahoma and Arkansas. That a lot of
Californians were not very welcoming.

BARKHAUSEN: That&#039;s right.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk about what you experienced or what your family told
you about?

BARKHAUSEN: Well, as I said, when I stayed with my brother and them my oldest
niece, she was about nine years old, and we used to laugh at her because she&#039;d
say, &quot;Daddy, you&#039;re an Okie and my mother is a prune-picker. What does that make
me?&quot; And I don&#039;t remember quite what my brother told her. But she had--Oh! She
had--&quot;Well, you&#039;re a prune-pickie.&quot; And she laughed and she--&quot;Prune-pickie.
Prune-pickie!&quot; But it was bad because they slurred you. But we would say, &quot;Well,
if it hadn&#039;t been for the Okies and the Arkies, well, California would be off
the map.&quot; But I just--a lot of it, I just didn&#039;t hear it. I was busy. I was
trying to help win the war. But that shipyard was something else. I really
enjoyed, I was enjoying it, because I was able, I felt like it was helping the
boys and the ladies that&#039;s over across that were fighting for me. Because they
did a wonderful job.

But, no, my nieces and I, I had the control of the house. I cooked, did their
laundry, they&#039;re just like my own kids. And today they are. And they--well, one
of them lives in Oakdale and one lives in Ceres, the other one. Then one over
in, oh, Santa Rosa. She is design and decoration. She sells furniture and then
she goes and puts it, decorates it for them, a good job. But they all done well.
I&#039;m very proud of them. The one that lives here in Ceres, she&#039;s in computers,
and the one that lives in Oakdale, she&#039;s a retired phone operator. She
worked--that&#039;s the only job she ever had was working for the phone company here.

RIGELHAUPT: How many visits did you have to California between the time your
parents moved here and the start of World War II?

BARKHAUSEN: Oh, after the fifth year--I came every year until we came out. But
we drove out here three times. When we came out this last time before he died,
we had a new pickup and we just came out to visit. We stopped in Tulare; one of
his brothers lived there. And one of our suitcases, we put two suitcases of our
clothes up in the front seat because we was going to visit with him a while. But
one of them, we couldn&#039;t put up there. So when we got back out to the pickup,
that suitcase was gone. We never did find it. But it was just clothes. And so
anyway we just went--came on to Modesto and we stayed with Stan, with my dad and
them till--well we was just visiting, and then the war started. Well, that
finally got us and so my dad said, &quot;Well, stay and go to work in the shipyard,
they&#039;re begging for people to work.&quot; So we did, we went to Port Chicago, was
living in Port Chicago. And then after the explosion, well the Richmond shipyard
moved us to Richmond, California. And we stayed there in that one apartment till
the war was over.

And, well, I think we left, went back home just a little bit after Roosevelt
died. Because we figured it&#039;d be over pretty soon. And I guess we thought maybe
it would be such a rush going back to Oklahoma and Arkansas than to just go on
home. But it was funny, my husband, he had taken the money we had left from
after we got here; he put the half of it back in his hip pocket. He says, &quot;Now,
this is for us to go back home on because we may not get work here.&quot; And when we
went back home, he still had that money in his pocket because we made pretty--I
think I made $1.08, the most I made, he made a little more than I did, per hour.
But it was good money.

RIGELHAUPT: I&#039;m just going to pause and change the tape.

Begin Audio File 2 barkhausen 02 09-22-06.mp3

RIGELHAUPT: Okay, could you tell me about what you remember about hearing about
Pearl Harbor and the attack on Pearl Harbor?

BARKHAUSEN: I don&#039;t remember a whole lot about it. I know it was terrible, but
no, I don&#039;t know. Right now I can&#039;t remember where I was at then. Now that was
after the war, wasn&#039;t it?

RIGELHAUPT: Well that was when the Japanese attacked in Hawaii.

BARKHAUSEN: In Hawaii, yes. Because I know, this brother that I showed the
medals and things, he went over later. [dog barking outside] Oh, that dog. And
he stayed six months after the war was over, and during that time is when they
had that explosion, because I know we were worried about him being there. But I
don&#039;t--I think he was in Germany, seemed like. But both of my brothers was in
Germany. And the younger one, he was on the fighting line, and they were after
him, they was just right there, and directly they looked up and they saw these
cranes--I mean these jeeps coming, great big things with the star on it. And my
brother said, &quot;Thank the Lord, the Americans are here.&quot; And he said they saved
their whole squad because they went to backing off when the Americans got to
coming in. But I guess it was close call. One of his buddies, they left here and
went together to war, and his buddy got killed right there in front of him and
he&#039;s never got over it. He still grieves about it.

RIGELHAUPT: So, what year did you start working in the shipyards?

BARKHAUSEN: I think it was like 1944. No, it was earlier than that. Because we
went right after it started but we didn&#039;t stay--we stayed till after Roosevelt
died and then we felt like going back, we&#039;d better go back. We worked there
probably a year, maybe a year and a half.

RIGELHAUPT: I&#039;m looking at the article you photocopied about Port Chicago, and
the explosion was in July of &#039;44. So how long had you been living in California
before the explosion?

BARKHAUSEN: Oh, we were working at the shipyard a long time before. About six
months before the explosion I&#039;d say. Maybe longer. Because they had a big truck
that they&#039;d come and pick us up there at Port Chicago and drive us to the
shipyard every morning and then when we&#039;d get off work, well, we&#039;d get back in
that truck, they&#039;d bring us back to Port Chicago. We did that for a long time.
But then when the explosion came, well, they moved us--Richmond shipyard moved
us to one of their new apartments. And then we lived there a couple years.

And I know my sister, she, her husband left her and her two babies in their
apartment, and so one day when I came home from work because I could walk to
work and my husband was waiting for me, I was standing at the stairs, we lived
upstairs, and I said what are you doing, he said, &quot;We&#039;ve got to go get Mae.&quot; I
said, &quot;How come?&quot; Said, &quot;Well, Herschel left her and the two babies in the
apartment and they don&#039;t have no food or anything.&quot; So we went over, got my
sister and two little kids. And she lived there, all of us lived there in that
apartment for a year or more. And I remember the little guy said--one of us
would take them to their nursery as we went to work, and then the one that got
off the earliest would come by and pick them up and bring them home. And we did
that for a long time.

And when my husband got over there, all she had was a part of a quart of milk in
the refrigerator. So anyway, we just told her to get in the car and we brought
their clothes. And that&#039;s all they had there. Because everything was furnished
in the apartments. So she had a rough time. She and the little kids, now they&#039;re
all grown kids, and they still remember being with us then, two kids. But I
don&#039;t know, we just--we try and help take care of each other. So it was bad on
her but it wasn&#039;t bad on us.

But the shipyard taught me a lot of things to respect people. Because you worked
with every kind of people, there in that shipyard. But I never saw a fight all
the time we were there. Everybody was busy working. And some of us made it more
like a game than it was work. And I think that helped us get by. But it was
worth it to me because I grew up, seemed like I grew up a lot there, I learned a lot.

But I&#039;ve been in California since 1959 after my husband died, I moved on out
there. And we had our own business, my last husband and I, and he was a
carpenter. I know, one time, we had service stations, and Williams had two, and
one day I come home from going to the bank and I saw him standing out there
closing, locking the door, and I said, &quot;Why are you locking the doors?&quot;. He said
the gas went down to 17¢ a gallon. He had bought a tank full of gas. And he
says, &quot;I&#039;m not selling that gas 25¢,&quot; or whatever it was, &quot;And pay 17¢ a
gallon for it.&quot; And so on the sign, he put out there he said, Gone Fishing, Why
Don&#039;t You Go, and we closed all the doors and locked up, went to Reno, both of
us went to work for two weeks, then we come back and opened the stations up and
went on working with that. The gas went back up. So I think we got it for--we
made 2¢ a gallon on it or something like that. So we kept in business till we sold.

Well, I got sick and I had to quit. Doctors told me if I didn&#039;t quit well I&#039;d be
in the grave in six months and so we quit, sold out and traveled for two years
before he died. So anyway, it&#039;s always a good working time.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk a little bit more about what you remember about the
people working with you at the shipyards? You mentioned some people ate a lot of
garlic. Could you talk more about everyone you were working with?

BARKHAUSEN: Well, it was a lot of Mexicans not that, you know--that&#039;s fine. But
they did eat garlic and they didn&#039;t take too many baths, I don&#039;t think. But we
all worked hard. Each one had their own job to do, and we had a foreman, and
he&#039;d come along and see if we was doing it right. And we did our job. But then
when that smoke got to bother me and the garlic, too, I told my husband, he
said, &quot;Well, quit and don&#039;t go back to work.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I want to work.&quot;
So I told the boss man. I said, &quot;I don&#039;t think I can work in this [drilling?]
anymore.&quot; And he said, &quot;Is the smoke getting you?&quot; and I said, &quot;And the garlic.&quot;
He said, &quot;Yeah,&quot; because he was from Arkansas.

Anyway, I signed up to be electrician. I went to school and I think it took me a
week to get back to work. And I got to be a journeyman, though, and I got to
where I could do it by myself. And that&#039;s what I was doing the day the ship went
out in the water because we had to have that ship ready for the next day for
them to christen it. We had a christening every time we&#039;d send a ship out.
Finished. And we were out there and the whistle blow for us to go home. We went
out on the deck, [chuckling] there we was, water everywhere. But anyway we
finally went back.

And then one time, something happened and our boat, we had to stand in it, for
was crossing the bay in a boat. And it got stuck out in the middle of the bay.
And so there we was stuck on that bridge for an hour, couldn&#039;t move. So finally
it got to moving and then we all got home. But it kind of scared everybody
because you&#039;re on that--nothing around you but water and you&#039;re in this thing
crossing, and you&#039;re crushed in just so close, you can&#039;t hardly move, and--but
it was quite experience getting on there and getting out of there.

But I enjoyed working with them people. I think we made a game of it more than
anything. Working because everybody, we worked together good. The only thing I
just didn&#039;t want to be close to smelling that garlic. And now I love garlic. But
I didn&#039;t then.

But you know what? When I first went to work there this gentleman, he told me,
he said, &quot;You&#039;re too heavy, we can&#039;t work with you.&quot; And I said, &quot;Heavy!?&quot; I
say, &quot;There&#039;s people heavier than me!&quot; He said, &quot;I know but you&#039;re a woman.&quot; I
said &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m a woman but I tell you what, you put me to work, give me that
work slip, let me go to work, and if I can&#039;t do it in a week, I&#039;ll quit and
bring you back this worksheet.&quot; He said &quot;Okay, that&#039;s a deal.&quot; So I went to work
but he never did have to say anymore. I worked. But I told my husband. I said,
&quot;He must be crazy. I&#039;m not all that big.&quot; He said, &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;this is
California, remember, and we don&#039;t speak very plain English.&quot; But anyway, they
still know I&#039;m from Oklahoma.

RIGELHAUPT: And so you were working at the Kaiser shipyards in Richmond.

BARKHAUSEN: Yeah, all three of them were Kaisers.

RIGELHAUPT: Were you in a union?

BARKHAUSEN: Yeah I got my union, some of my union papers there. Yeah.
Boilermaker union, I think was the name of it. Our union dues, you know what
they was? Like, I believe our hospital cession was 50¢ a payday, 50¢. And I
would get a bond--I bought bonds with mine. And I think I bought a $3.50 bond
every week, every payday. And you&#039;d be surprised, even with that, it counted up
pretty fast. And my husband, he&#039;d take his, and we lived on his, and we saved
that $3.50 bond a week. But we done good.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember any of the union leaders or the shop stewards?

BARKHAUSEN: No, but I have some of their union--union books and silver payments,
you get a sheet every time you got a payment. I don&#039;t know, was it once a month
or what, but anyway we paid union dues. And I wonder, I never did go back to see
anything about retirement or anything. I guess they didn&#039;t give it to them. They
didn&#039;t know what it was then, maybe. Because when we quit we packed up our
little old car, pickup, and we went back to Oklahoma.

What was funny to me, then, they rationed food and everything. You had these
stamps to buy different stuff. Well, my husband was a meat eater, he
liked--which, it was easy on me, if we could get the meat. And so he had talked
to different ones and we&#039;d trade for--maybe they wanted some tires or something,
somebody, and he&#039;d swap them for meat tickets. And so one time he went back to
Oklahoma and I knew what day he was going to be home and I didn&#039;t have no
tickets to get anything but I think we got mutton for no stamps. And so, I told
my dad, I said, &quot;Well, I don&#039;t know what to fix for dinner because I don&#039;t have
any meat stamps and I know he&#039;ll be hungry.&quot; So anyway I went and got a leg of
lamb and I fixed that and I made some chops out of it. And he come in, he said,
&quot;Hon, this is the best meat. But why aren&#039;t you eating any?&quot; I said, &quot;I&#039;m not
hungry for meat tonight.&quot; So the next day at work my dad and him always ate
lunch together. And directly he told my dad, he says, &quot;Boy, this is the best
sandwich she had for me, left over from last night.&quot; My daddy said, &quot;What is it.
Is it pork?&quot; And Daddy laughed. He said, &quot;That&#039;s not pork!&quot; He said, &quot;Oh yes, it
is. Because I don&#039;t eat horsemeat.&quot; And Dad said, &quot;It&#039;s not horsemeat either.
It&#039;s goat meat.&quot; And he come home, and he said, &quot;What was that?&quot; I said, &quot;Lamb
chops. A lamb roast.&quot; He said, &quot;I thought it was pork last night.&quot; I said, &quot;I
know it but I didn&#039;t have no stamps.&quot; And he said, &quot;Well, it&#039;s good.&quot; [laughing]
But anyway --

RIGELHAUPT: One of the things I&#039;ve read about with the boilermakers union is
that they had like a separate auxiliary for African American members of the
boilermakers union.

BARKHAUSEN: Oh, I don&#039;t know.

RIGELHAUPT: And it was only for a short time at the beginning of the war and
then everyone could be a member of the union.

BARKHAUSEN: Oh, well, they had to be a member for the union or they couldn&#039;t work.

RIGELHAUPT: Exactly, but for a while, at the beginning of the war, the
boilermakers made all the African American members join a separate auxiliary.

BARKHAUSEN: Oh, I didn&#039;t know.

RIGELHAUPT: And they didn&#039;t have full voting rights but paid dues. And then it
changed and everyone worked together. But I&#039;m just curious so --

BARKHAUSEN: No, I didn&#039;t know anything about that. Well I know when we moved--I
mean when you go to work at the shipyard, automatically you&#039;ve got to go to the
union, which everybody did. And it wasn&#039;t all that much. I don&#039;t know, but each
stub tells you how much you paid per paycheck and so I know we paid union dues
because I have the union book and then I have several receipts. But you know
what&#039;s funny to me, I married and was married 26 years to my last husband. And
these things all showed up one time after his death. And I don&#039;t ever remember
saving them. And I know when he died, I had his, but his family and my family,
were doing the family tree, and I guess mine got in with some of my family tree
stuff, and they just got lost for a little while. And then, when I moved--well,
when I came back after my second husband died, I came back, because I went to
Reno and helped my sister in her beauty shops for a year. Then I came back here
and bought me a trailer home and lived in it for--well, until I moved here. But
somewhere in last few years, here they are. And I still don&#039;t know where I kept
them or where they&#039;s at. And I said Jiminy Christmas look here, check stubs and
union dues. They&#039;s all in one envelope. And to this day I don&#039;t know where they
were at. But they must have been in some of my papers that I did for family
tree, because you have books and books and books of that. And so--but I know
that&#039;s what happened but it was a mystery that I found them all. And how many
years is that? About 70, and well, it wouldn&#039;t be that long because I&#039;ve been
working with that about 20 years. So it would be around 50 years I guess.

RIGELHAUPT: And so what made you stop working at the shipyards, the end of the war?

BARKHAUSEN: Yes. And then we was ready to go back home. See, we had our home
back there and the boys was taking care of it and his dad. Oh, I know why we
went back, is because his dad got real sick and he passed on. And so really, I
think that was why we left so quick. Because the boys called us or something,
and told us that their doctor said that he wasn&#039;t going to make it. So we went
back. And we were back home about a month and his lungs filled up with fluid.
And they never could get it all out, he drowned in his own fluid.

But I don&#039;t remember about the--well, I&#039;m sure it had already settled before we
came to work because we didn&#039;t come to work till a few weeks or so after the war
started. Because we wasn&#039;t going to work but just a couple of months or two and
then go home. But then I guess we was comfortable, we enjoyed it, we just kept
staying. And we did feel like we were helping to do something. [laughs] And then
another thing, the Rosie the Riveter, that got to be quite a deal. Women,
leaving their home and getting out into the shipyard. There we was wearing big
old shoes and big old overalls and a hardhat and all of that. No jewelry because
we couldn&#039;t even wear rings or anything because they were afraid that you would
get it hung on something, pull your finger off or--no watches. No nothing. But
that was all right. It was experience.

RIGELHAUPT: What do you remember about the internment of Japanese Americans
during World War II?

BARKHAUSEN: You know to tell you the truth, it did bother me. Because honey,
they are human as same as we are, their heart is most of them is just like the
black people and other--their heart&#039;s just as--their blood is just as pure as
ours is. Some of it, they use it--they live different and some of the things
that they do we don&#039;t like it, but they&#039;re still human being. And I have no--and
what I don&#039;t like is different people, countries, coming over and trying to take
over our country and getting all these things that we didn&#039;t have until they got
to come, different people coming over here. We never did have this writing
things on people&#039;s walls and houses and things. And I don&#039;t approve of that.
Because that&#039;s hurting the human being. And I can&#039;t--just like this dope they&#039;re
getting in them new homes up there. That is something else. That is just the
devil&#039;s work is all it is. And I don&#039;t agree with them.

Because we could just be happy people here. And everybody get along and be good
to--you know what, here, I&#039;ve been here 14 years, I have never seen--I&#039;ve heard
people arguing a little bit. But you don&#039;t hear them fighting or hearing that.
And you take these older people, they&#039;re a little bit grumpy sometime, but we&#039;ve
all got pain and we&#039;ve always had it. You see somebody in worse shape than you
are, so. But these people here it&#039;s more like a big one family. And we just--I
want to help everybody if I can.

RIGELHAUPT: But do you remember hearing or hearing discussions or in the
newspaper about Japanese Americans being taken to concentration camps in
California and the west?

BARKHAUSEN: Yes yes. That, I did not approve of. But I don&#039;t know why--well, you
do know why. You didn&#039;t trust them. Then. But I didn&#039;t think that they should
have done that because, well, I don&#039;t know. I really don&#039;t know. Because lot of
that we don&#039;t know why, but you didn&#039;t know why they were here either. Or I
didn&#039;t. But I did feel sorry for the Chinese people that had to work and live
like they did because I don&#039;t think that was right. But that was something else.
And they still--still that is hurt a lot of the people. It&#039;s still hurting them.

I got to scratch my neck.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember talking about it with friends or family members or?

BARKHAUSEN: No. In my family, it wasn&#039;t discussed. It was not discussed.

RIGELHAUPT: You mentioned smoke at your job at the shipyards. Do you know what
was causing the smoke?

BARKHAUSEN: Yes. The drilling, see drilling through steel, the steel bit, and
that would get hot and it kept--you had a little thing with water, it dripped
there, and then when it dripped, well, that steam would come up and hit you
right in the face. And you had to have that water going because your bit would
get too hot. Because it&#039;s steel on steel that caused it. And you get that shell,
you had holes, drilled holes. When you picked it up it was marked with chalk for
every hole that you were supposed to put in that shell. And then you were on a
little stool with little rollers on it. And you just rolled from one hole to the
one and when you got a long row, they&#039;d come along, pick it up and carry, put it
on the ship. And that was a shell on the outside of the shell. And that&#039;s what
made the smoke.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember other chemicals or other workplace hazards that
maybe weren&#039;t considered hazardous then that we might consider hazardous now
while you were working in the shipyards?

BARKHAUSEN: Yeah, like the wires, they had like each burner--each welder had
their own equipment, like their wires to electric and then they kept them on the
floor and you could have fell, caught your foot on it, fell. But I don&#039;t know
how else they could have done it though. Because there&#039;s many welders and
burners on each floor till--they did the best, I guess, they knew how. But I
don&#039;t remember too many people ever falling and getting hurt or anything. Of
course the thing about this, as much noise made and everything, you wouldn&#039;t
hear it all anyway because working with steel, it was a lot of noise and
everything there that we worked with was steel. [phone rings] Bingo. [pause
while answering machine picks up]

RIGELHAUPT: Okay, so we were talking about--

BARKHAUSEN: The odor--

RIGELHAUPT: And potential hazards. So you don&#039;t remember many workplace accidents.

BARKHAUSEN: No.

RIGELHAUPT: Now what about outside? Near the Standard Oil refinery in Richmond,
do you remember any strange smells or chemicals being an issue?

BARKHAUSEN: No, not really. Of course I think everybody got a lot of that odor
from working there, the drilling, and well, I don&#039;t--I know we had a lot of
those seagulls flying around. And they&#039;d try to take the food away from us. But
it wasn&#039;t their fault. We&#039;d throw things at them and they got to where they
expected it. But no. And they did keep the restrooms clean most of the time. But
each shift had their people there to clean it. I have heard different ones say
well so-and-so left this and didn&#039;t clean that. But it was just more like
gossip, you know what I mean, something to talk about.

RIGELHAUPT: Could you talk a little bit more about Port Chicago?

BARKHAUSEN: That was something else. When we got back up to Port Chicago from
here we had to show them that we lived there and we got through at--oh, one of
the towns just before we got--wasn&#039;t Walnut Grove but it was another. And we
went on to Port Chicago. And it was--you&#039;ve seen the picture there. And we
didn&#039;t even hardly know--well, by the road and maybe the sign we could tell
where our place was. Well, they--the Salvation Army and Red Cross came in and
they fed us for a week. And we&#039;d sit there on the street and wasn&#039;t nothing we
could do because we couldn&#039;t go to work because our clothes was ruined and then
Richmond, they were building those little apartments. And so they take the ones
that lived there and couldn&#039;t have--didn&#039;t get into their home or anything,
they&#039;d take them and moved them to Richmond, California. They put us in a brand
new apartment. Then we just had our clothes is all we had because everything
where we lived, we had furnished. Of course we had our groceries. Our groceries
was down on the floor under everything. But I don&#039;t think we even picked them
up. We just got a few clothes and what we had down here. And went on up to
Richmond. But we was riding in a truck like a cow truck, had seats all around
it, and they&#039;d pick us up and take us to Richmond from Port Chicago. Then they&#039;d
bring us back at night. And so it was awful. It was awful. See all that
explosion and all them dead people.

And then one of my brother-in-laws, he was a guard there, a security guard in
the shipyard, I mean where they load the ships. And we couldn&#039;t find him. We
found his coat and it was all cut up. And we couldn&#039;t find him. They were taking
him to the hospital in Pittsburgh. He heard somebody say well Port Chicago
blowed up, nobody living there. And so we assumed he was dead because we
couldn&#039;t hear from him and three weeks later, well he came to, and asked them
about his family, and they said, &quot;Well, I think they&#039;re all right because
they&#039;ve been coming to see you every day.&quot; And so then it was really something
to know that he went through that without--but he got all cut up and everything.
He got over it. It crippled him for life, but he got over it.

And then we all--I don&#039;t think--no, he and his wife moved back to Modesto after
that, because they had their home in Modesto. And then my husband and I, we
stayed in Richmond. He had four brothers that were working in the shipyard at
one time.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember hearing about the soldiers that wouldn&#039;t go back to
work at Port Chicago? Could you talk a little bit about that?

BARKHAUSEN: Well they were scared, they didn&#039;t want to go back because--but what
did it, they was most of them black people. And they were filling them boxes
with ammunition. Loading the ships. And one of them dropped the box of
ammunition, it blowed it up, then when it went up, well, the other two ships
went, they were three big ones and I guess they were nearly full of ammunition.
And that could have been anytime because they loaded that ammunition there all
the time and no one thought nothing about it. We were just fortunate. It was a
weekend, we came down here to see our parents and spent the weekend here. It was
Sunday morning when we heard about it. It was terrible. But that was just like
being overseas, getting blowed up. We lived through it. And that&#039;s nothing, what
they&#039;re having to live through now over there, I don&#039;t think.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember more about the trial, the soldiers were brought up
on charges of mutiny?

BARKHAUSEN: Not too much about it because we moved to Richmond. But it was bad
because one of my sister-in-law, ex-sister-in-laws, her mother and her husband
lived there, and I guess they were like my husband and I, they happened to be
out of town and they just blew their place all to pieces. They had a service
station and I guess when it hit that it just blowed the service station up and
everything. But they happened to be gone too and so they were still--they died
several years after that. In fact they moved to Tuscadero from there. Lot of
people didn&#039;t even go back to Richmond to work. I think they was even afraid to
go back over there and work. But we went on over there.

RIGELHAUPT: Were you a member of a church while you were living in Port Chicago
and Richmond?

BARKHAUSEN: No. No. Really we didn&#039;t--well, we should have been but we didn&#039;t
because you worked every day and sometimes even on the weekend you worked. And
then, too, if you didn&#039;t work, you had your laundry to do and your shopping to
do. But it was a lot easier when we moved to Richmond because it&#039;s a bigger
town. Port Chicago was just a little bitty thing. I doubt there&#039;s over 2,000
people there. But I didn&#039;t remember quite about Concord being so involved in the
shipyard till I read that piece of paper. They had some kind of a thing there at
Concord pertaining to the war. So I didn&#039;t know that, but a lot of things went
on that I didn&#039;t know.

RIGELHAUPT: How do you remember hearing about the Holocaust and so many millions
of people dying in Europe?

BARKHAUSEN: Not too much on that. I remember some but not all.

RIGELHAUPT: But do you remember if you heard about it through newsreels before
movies or did you read about it in the paper?

BARKHAUSEN: It was more on the TV, because I&#039;m not too much on TV, but when
you&#039;re working you don&#039;t come in and turn your TV on much or I don&#039;t. In fact
that&#039;s not been on all day. Because I&#039;m not much of a TV person. Because I stay
busy other things.

RIGELHAUPT: Do you remember favorite forms of entertainment during the war? Did
you go to films or--?

BARKHAUSEN: We went to movies once in a while but not much. After my sister
moved in we entertained each other because she had those two little kids and
then--did I move it? [referring to microphone]

RIGELHAUPT: It sounds okay.

BARKHAUSEN: Okay. But you were tired, you came home tired. I know one evening,
we came home after work, we must have--I think he was working the same shipyard
I was then. Because sometimes, they&#039;d change you over to the other one. And
anyway, we came home and take a bath and we just lay down on the bed and went to
sleep. And so directly the whistle blew. We jumped up and my husband said, &quot;Get
up quick because the whistle&#039;s done blowed, we need to be working!&quot; and some way
or other, in a little bit we decided, &quot;Well, it&#039;s still night, it&#039;s not--oh it&#039;s
getting dark.&quot; And we got tickled and said, &quot;Well, we just slept till it was
dark, but I guess your body gets so tired you just slept, but we thought it was
morning. It was a laugh.

RIGELHAUPT: How do you remember hearing about the atomic bombs and Hiroshima and
Nagasaki? The atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what do
you remember hearing about?

BARKHAUSEN: About that, I don&#039;t remember a whole lot about it. I remember it was
done but just how and when, I don&#039;t. Seemed like I don&#039;t know, like I say, I
don&#039;t use--I don&#039;t listen to TV too much and don&#039;t play my--I use my CD with
religious music and that&#039;s about all I listen to. And maybe a game or two on the
TV. But and now I don&#039;t see it very well so.

RIGELHAUPT: How do you remember hearing about the war ending? About the end of
World War II?

BARKHAUSEN: I really don&#039;t really remember but I know everybody was ready to
quit when President Roosevelt died. I know and then when Kennedy got shot my
husband and I, this is my second husband, we had a service station and we was
going over to Marysville to check on the station, and we heard it and he said,
&quot;Well, we&#039;re going out of business.&quot; I said, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He said, &quot;Well,
we won&#039;t be making any money.&quot; And said, &quot;I&#039;m not working free for &#039;em.&quot; He
says, &quot;We&#039;re selling out.&quot; And then about a week or so later, that&#039;s when the
doctors told me I had to quit work. And that&#039;s--we were going to check a station
out, and it was on our TV--I mean our little car radio, telling about the
shooting and everything.

RIGELHAUPT: Was it different in thinking back about how you heard about what was
going on in World War II since there wasn&#039;t television? Versus now if you turn
on the TV you can see --

BARKHAUSEN: It&#039;s right there.

RIGELHAUPT: You can see pictures of the war. Was it different back then?

BARKHAUSEN: Yeah, because you didn&#039;t see nothing at all then. Because we
didn&#039;t--I don&#039;t think we had a TV or radio because we were out there for the
war, we didn&#039;t--I don&#039;t even think we had a radio then. I don&#039;t remember it. And
I know we didn&#039;t have a TV. Because our TV, if we had one was still in Oklahoma.
See we didn&#039;t move nothing, no furniture or anything out here. We just came out
for vacation ,and just our clothes. Or part of them because part of them got stolen.

RIGELHAUPT: Well, that&#039;s about all the questions I have. And generally the way I
like to end is to ask, one, is there anything you&#039;d like to add or, two, is
there anything that I didn&#039;t ask that I should have.

BARKHAUSEN: Honey I don&#039;t think--I think we&#039;ve covered a lot of it.

RIGELHAUPT: Okay, well I&#039;ll stop there.

BARKHAUSEN: Okay, and thank you for everything.

RIGELHAUPT: Thank you very much as well.

BARKHAUSEN: And I&#039;ve enjoyed you and God bless you.

RIGELHAUPT: Thank you.
