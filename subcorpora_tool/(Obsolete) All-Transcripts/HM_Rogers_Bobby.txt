Speaker 1: Nineteen eighteen [1918], okay, okay, all right. Well, what do you know about your father's side of the family? What can you tell us about them?
Speaker 2: Well, really, all I know is him, basica- basically. Because you know, we used to always go down south every year. And I'm trying to see how I can put this. I mean, everybody was just--the family and his home--he was just a person who took care of us kids. The kids weren't the kind of kids that would be trying to do something crazy or nothing like that, you know. And he taught us a lot of things, and he and my [maternal] uncle [Edward Wilson] were good friends. Because my father knew a lady that my uncle liked, which became my auntie, you know, and he helped her, helped him meet that girl, and stuff like that. So, he was--only one time he got after me, one time. And it was, we were playing in our yard here in Detroit [Michigan] and playing--bouncing the ball against the wall or something. And I guess the place was about as high as that, where The Temptations are up there (points off camera). And he told us not to get on that, you know, the top of that--
Speaker 1: Wall?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on top of the thing. But he liked to drive and stuff like that. And then he ran around the lot, he just drove around the lot real quick and came around, and all those guys were on the floor, on the top of the (laughter) place. And that's when I found out the actual person that he was, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, he got after you all about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did--now, did he come from a large family in Marietta?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't. Because he only had, well, I guess maybe a little--see, he had three sisters which lived in--where (unclear), Joan [Rogers's second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers]?
Speaker 1: (JOAN HUGHES ROGERS): Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Atlantic City.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 1: My uncle--
Speaker 2: --introduced them? Is that how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He introduced him to my mother.
Speaker 2: Did they li- like each other from the beginning?
Speaker 1: Well, I think so, because they stayed--you know, there were no fights I never heard, especially on her side. So they loved one another, once I found out what love was. I mean, what I mean by that is that he took care of us, and we were five kids I think, five kids.
Story_ID: 557789

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And every Wednesday she would bake, bake me a cake, and I would just go by her house and eat that cake. But I had friends with me, and so they would go with me because right there by that, where she lived at, you could walk about three or four blocks and you could go to the show that afternoon. And so that's what I would--that I remember.
Speaker 1: Was that, was that when Hastings Street was real popular in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's before they knocked it down and built the highway and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh, well, the highway, I'm after the highway [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay. The highway was already--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's still the guys with the Cadillacs and all that stuff. And so, I could always go there. And that's the woman that was always working at--
Speaker 1: Hudson's [J.L. Hudson Department Store; J.L. Hudson Building, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Hudson's, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was your grandmother, right?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was trying to get the perfect word. But, so, I would never get in trouble and stuff like that, because she knew that probably I was going to do something. She was that type of woman, yeah.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any other sights and sounds and smells of growing up? Anything else that you remember in terms of a sight, or a sound, or a smell?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm trying to figure out--a lot of the sounds, especially with Bel- when we went to, when the time came to go to, you know, Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park, Detroit, Michigan] and stuff like that, which was not far from here. We'd have a lot of fun and stuff. And my mother [Lois Wilson Rogers] could cook real good and my father [Robert Rogers, Sr.] could cook real good, as a kid, you know. And no bad things, no bad--I don't remember--I don't ever remember getting--oh, one time he knocked me out, one time. And--
Speaker 1: Your father actually knocked you out?

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Throwing the ball on top--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and jumping up on--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --getting on the wall.

Speaker 2: So everybody, you know, we wanted to be like--we had some gangsters in our neighborhood and stuff, you know. And so, we wanted to be like them. But they were like real gangsters, I mean like them Cadillac gangsters and stuff. So anyway, we had little knives and stuff that you put in your hand, and you pull it out that, and all that stuff. And I did that, and he hit me one time. I did that, and my dad really knocked me out. And my mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. So he didn't want you to--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He didn't want you pretending to be a gangster, or trying to be a gangster.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He said, "Oh, you going to rear- rear up on me?" That's what, that's what--I remember them words.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was probably about eleven, yeah, and my mother got me out of there.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you actually thought at age eleven that you should, you know, you could pull a knife on your father?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't--I was just playing. In my mind, I was playing. But he just--you know, in his mind I was going to try to do something. But you know, we had them, and we were pulling the thing and doing this, and you know, to see who could draw the fastest. That's what were were--basically what we were doing. And so, that's it.
Speaker 1: Would you consider your neighborhood [Black Bottom, Detroit, Michigan] kind of a rough neighborhood when you were--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, but--no. But we had a lot of, we had different guys, you know. We had a lot of guys that--a lot of us skated, which all of that stuff was right around here where we are right now. And, you know, we had some guys called the Shakers. The guys called the Shakers, they were bad guys. And I was young and stuff. And then when I started singing, then they was liking us, (laughter) you know what I mean. "Y'all sing a song for us. Sing a song for us."
Speaker 1: So there were bad guys when you--they thought you weren't doing anything. But when you started singing--
Speaker 2: You know, like we were kids, you know, and we wanted to be like them. But I guess that's what they were doing. You know, some of them are still around, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they want to be like you after you became a singer?
Speaker 2: No, no. They was--all them gangsters were something. But there were some guys that were singers that wanted to sing, you know, probably some of them that we have here now.

And, you know, Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] and all them gir- women singers. And we couldn't get in there, but you could hear them singing and stuff like that. And you'd go over there and we had a street--do you live in Chicago?
Speaker 1: No, I--well, I did for thirty years. But--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: I live in Dayton [Ohio] now. But, yeah--
Speaker 2: You probably know what I'm talking about then.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, yeah, there were shows that--you had different shows coming to town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you couldn't see them but you could hear them, you know. You couldn't go to the show--I mean it's a regular show.
Speaker 1: And kids couldn't get in?
Speaker 2: They couldn't get in, yeah, right, you know. But you'd get a chance to hear that music.
Speaker 1: What was the theater here that showed--that hosted black artists and performers?
Speaker 2: The Flame Show Bar [Detroit, Michigan]. It was on the corner of--right around here.
Speaker 1: Okay. I know in Chicago they had the Regal Theater and--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, when we were coming--we sang at the Regal Theater.
Speaker 1: Later, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, later. And for us here, for singing--like, we came to Chicago, and we had this theater here, the Fox Theatre [Detroit, Michigan] here, that you could come and sing like that. But they had a lot of other, you know, other songs, I mean other places that you could sing. We had a whole lot of stuff. Just as you, I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, where did you go to grade school? Do you remember?

Story_ID: 557797
Speaker 1: Now did you all play the radio a lot at home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we had the radio, radio play. But then we just, you know, it's probably just like where you lived at. Cab Calloway and all them guys just came through here, and we'd just go see them. Jackie Wilson was singing here when he first started singing. And that's how, that's how we met him. And [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy was writing that song, the first song. And we was in there, and Smokey had these songs. And we were going in there, and Berry said, "How many--you got some fine--you got some more, some more songs?" Smokey smo- showed, showed them to him, and then we just started singing and stuff.
Speaker 1: Now when did you--now did you meet Smokey in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I went to, I went Northeastern [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan]. And--
Speaker 1: I heard--now tell me if this. I read that you were born the same day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --as [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the same hospital [Herman Kiefer Hospital, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you all are exactly the same age?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the way we found out, we were going to Europe and we had to get our passports. And we looked at our passports, and we had the same numbers, I mean the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, but you didn't really get to know him until you were about fifteen, from what I understand, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years old. So how did you met Smokey Robinson?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my cousin, he used to--I'm singing in another, another guy's--
Speaker 1: Group?
Speaker 2: --group. I'm singing in another group, and he's singing with Smokey and them. And so they were singing on the east side, yeah, and I was singing on the, the house--I mean the side with the school I went to. And so we were just singing and singing, and then we found out that what had happened with my cousin, Emerson [Emerson Rogers], who was Claudette's brother, who died, that's how she met Smokey, you know, all that stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So Emerson, Emerson's sister, Claudette [HistoryMaker Claudette Robinson]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --became a part of The Miracles?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or The Matadors then?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And then--okay. So that's your--so she would be your--well, she's a cousin of yours too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay. So, so, you always--you were singing in a different group. And so Emerson left the group, Smokey's group, and you joined?
Speaker 2: No, no, he went--the group, group I was in was here in Detroit [Michigan]. And I had, I'm singing with three other guys, there were four of us. And Emerson went to, he was on the east side, on what do you call that? What's that side? Anyway, it was away from our side of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we started singing together and we had a great group. And so, we just started singing in the group I'm in--I was in.
Story_ID: 557798
Speaker 1: Now you--your group originally was The Five Chimes [The Miracles], is that it? Was that it? Or is that right?
Speaker 2: That was Smokey's [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] name--band; that was Smokey's name.
Speaker 1: Group? Oh, his group was The Five Chimes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, The Five Chimes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the group I was in was--it's in my mind; I can't--
Speaker 1: That's okay. Well, we--okay, so did you join The Five Chimes when you were fifteen? Did you join that group?
Speaker 2: No, I was, I was going to school [Northeastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] then. And so, we had different guys. It was on this side of town, and we were--our name--and our song was--I can't--anyway, I was singing with that group. And everybody wanted to be, you know, everybody wanted to be, everybody wanted to be the first--the first tenor, the bass, and the lead singer, you know. (Laughter) So, so, we just--but we were folding then. We had been singing, we had sung for a long time. But I didn't know Smokey and them until a long time. I'd never--I'd never been--they was living in, I'd say one of the worst places in Detroit [Michigan]. You know, I mean gangsters--I mean not gangster gangsters, but you know how the little kids are. And we probably did too. But I met them through The Matadors [The Miracles], because my sister was singing with Claudette [HistoryMaker Claudette Robinson], our cousin. And Claudette was going with Smokey and all that stuff, and that's how I met them. And also, because Ronnie White [Ronald White] was singing and [HistoryMaker] Pete Moore was singing with Smokey. And we went to Cass then, Cass High School [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] here, you know, that's how I met them.
Story_ID: 557799
Speaker 1: The Matadors [The Miracles] are 1955, included [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, Ro- Ronald White, [HistoryMaker] Pete Moore, and your cousin, Emerson Rogers?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he left and Claudette [HistoryMaker Claudette Robinson] took his place, is what I heard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you joined, too?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't join.
Speaker 1: You didn't join The Matadors?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't join. I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was telling you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what happened with--
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get involved with The Miracles then?
Speaker 2: Because my Em- my cousin Emerson was singing with them. And it's a guy named, we call him Rat, just 'cause he was big and stuff like that. And--
Speaker 1: Was it James "Rat" Grice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rice [sic.], yeah. And he stopped singing because his wife, his girlfriend, was having a baby. So he wanted to make it, you know, make it right with her, and stuff like that. And so I started singing with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you, you sang second tenor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, first tenor I guess was Smokey, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you have a sense that the group was something special when you got involved in it? Or what were you thinking at that time?
Speaker 2: They had ide- ideals--ideas, and we were, we wanted to come to--I'm trying to figure out--at that time they rode somewhere, rode this way. I think they came to Cincinnati [Ohio]. And they came here and then we had some record people; some white guys that had records, they were doing records. Then, they had Chess [Chess Records] here in this area, you know. And then they went to see if they could get them a thing, you know, like a contract, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they didn't let nobody hire us. So, that's when The Platters came out with the girl [Zola Taylor] they had. So Claudette was singing in our group, but the guy we wanted to--went to see--oh this thing is on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Well, we went to see this guy at this place that we had that you danced at. And he said, "No, you know, can't no other group--no other group going to be like The Platters, you know." And then--
Speaker 1: So he though you all were sounding too much like The Platters? And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I mean it's really--no, I mean I came to explain some things to him or something that, you know, that we weren't trying to be like them. We just--they got a Cadillac and we wanted a Cadillac, you know, something like that. But anyway, so Smo- so right then Jackie Wilson lived in our city [Detroit, Michigan], and he'd just made this song 'To Be Loved,' and that was going to be hit. And then this guy came out and said, "Hey, hey, Smokey," because Smokey had this little book of songs. He said, "Hey, you got some more songs?" Smokey said, "Yeah." You know, so then he hooked up with us and then we went to make our first song.
Story_ID: 557800
Speaker 1: What was your first song (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'I Got a Job' [sic. 'Got A Job'].
Speaker 1: 'I Got A Job'?
Speaker 2: 'I Got A Job.'
Speaker 1: Now, this was an answer to 'Get A Job,' right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, 'Get A Job,' is the answer to 'I Got A Job' [sic.].
Speaker 1: Is it? Okay.
Speaker 2: 'I Got A Job,' is, (singing) "I got a job--." So, (unclear).
Speaker 1: So how did it go? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "(Scats) Get a job," that was the white ones, not the white ones, but these guys in New York [New York]. This guy that sang, you know, (scats), he'd always do his voice like that, a white guy. Yeah, but that's how we, that's how we got that.
Speaker 1: Now, 'Get A Job,' now, 'I Got A Job,' does that sound the same way?
Speaker 2: No, 'Got A Job,' is, (singing) "(Scats) Got a job, sha na na na, sha na na na na." Theirs was--oh, I saw the guy last week, and we did some things for this guy. How did it go?
Speaker 1: I remember 'Get A Job.' (Singing) "Sha na na na, sha na na na na na" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, okay, yeah. Right, that's how it went, that's how, yeah.
Speaker 1: And all that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Then they had that--
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Get a job."
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was it. That was it, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how did 'Got A Job,' go? How did 'Got A Job' go?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "I got a job."
Speaker 1: Same song, same kind of--
Speaker 2: No, not the same song. Like--
Speaker 1: The same beat?
Speaker 2: Kind of, in a way, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: But the other guys was older than us, but that don't mean nothing. But they was singing real good, you know. And we had the girl in our group. And the other guys didn't want Claudette [HistoryMaker Claudette Robinson] in the group with us because of The Platters. So we couldn't use, we didn't have no name. And then Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] was there, and he came out and said, "Hey, you guys got some more songs?" And he took us under his wing, and we started just working with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And The Miracles, we just put it, we threw it up in the hat. I mean we threw some things in a hat.
Speaker 1: Some names in a hat (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And somebody pulled it out.
Story_ID: 557801
Speaker 1: You had another song called 'The Bad Girl'--'Bad Girl,' right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Bad Girl.' (Singing) "She's not a bad girl because she made me see," and stuff like that. But--
Speaker 1: Was that a hit [for The Miracles]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a hit. But they was saying, and I don't know, don't none of us know why they said this, but they say it's a race record, you know, which meant a black person singing it or a white person singing it back then--so--
Speaker 1: Okay. So what they meant by--and correct me if I'm wrong--is that a race record is a record that only black people will buy probably (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which only deals with black people?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And we--
Speaker 1: It couldn't crossover?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I know in those days it was popular for a white group to cover a black song (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and make a white version of it for white people.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, like Pat Boone would do, you know.
Speaker 2: That's what he would do all the time. And you couldn't get--you couldn't get, what do you call it though, the guy, what's the guy with the guitar?
Speaker 1: Elvis [Elvis Presley]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, a black guy with the guitar.
Speaker 1: Oh, Chuck Berry?
Speaker 2: Chuck Berry. (Laughter) They couldn't get to him, they couldn't get it past him. But he put that leg out there. (Laughter) But it was definitely, it was enough room in this country to sing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because when we went to Europe, man, them guys, a whole lot of guys sang.
Story_ID: 557802
Speaker 1: From what I understand here is that the deal with Chess Records didn't make much money [for The Miracles]. You know, you couldn't make any money with Chess Records. Is that true? Or do you know?
Speaker 2: A true, a truth, a bunch of leavings--say that again.
Speaker 1: Chess Records.
Speaker 2: Chess, yeah. We had gotten the golden record, but when we went to get the check, we didn't get no money, you know. And I had seen some--you know, I like to look at a lot of movies and stuff. And when I'd seen this movie, Chuck Berry was getting a lot of money because he had white girls and all that stuff around him. And, but something like--you know, they had a lot of good black singers singing, too, especially from this city [Detroit, Michigan], you know. But they was, you know, everybody was trying to get a lot of money. And then The Beatles and them come, and I guess everybody (laughter) in the world was mad (laughter).
Story_ID: 557803
Speaker 1: In nineteen fifty-tin- '59 [1959] when you were nineteen years old, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy formed Motown [Tamla Records; Motown Records], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so, you all [The Miracles] were part of Motown's family--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of musicians?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. What was your first--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --was 'Shop Around' your first hit?
Speaker 2: 'Shop Around.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. These guys, these guys had a big song in New York [New York], 'Get A Job,' or something like that. I seen them not too long ago. How did that song go? Yeah, but they had--that was a good song they had, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: "You better shop around," how did 'Shop Around' go?
Speaker 2: (Pause) (Singing) "(Scats) Get a job, (scats)." But the other group was talking about (scats), but he was, he was a guy singing by himself. Not singing by himself, but it's a big difference between both of them songs.
Speaker 1: 'Get A Job' and 'Got A Job'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how did 'Shop Around' go?
Speaker 2: (Scats).
Speaker 1: All I can remember is, (singing) "You better shop around." I think that was the refrain but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the part.
Speaker 1: I can't remember the rest of it, but, (singing) "You better shop around," was the refrain of the song.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I know my wife [Rogers' second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers] know it, though.
Speaker 1: So that, that became a big hit, 'Shop Around' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was, that went gold.
Speaker 1: We had it at home, and everybody on the block had it in Dayton, Ohio and every other place probably.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, did you--when you get a big hit like that, you know, in those days, I mean did your lifestyle change? Did you--you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In Detroit [Michigan] it did. Because everybody went and got a car, you know. We had a little car that can't but about two people get in it and stuff, and all of that, you know. It changed, it changed our lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Did you have to work someplace else in those days to make ends meet? Or was being a musician, a singer, enough money?
Speaker 2: A singer was enough, you know, I mean for us, because we was young kids and stuff.
Story_ID: 557804
Speaker 1: Tell me, now so, so you say when you had your first hit ['Shop Around'], after you had your first hit [with The Miracles], this was about 1960 or something, and you're about twenty years old?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so you went out and bought a car. What kind of car did you buy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I bought a, what kind of car did I buy? I can't remember. Oh, I had like a, I had a little red--can I pause for a minute?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Joan [Rogers' second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers]!
Speaker 1: I bet I know what it is. Well, was it an MG [MG Car Company Limited]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Not like a sports car?
Speaker 2: It was a Ford [Ford Motor Company].
Speaker 1: A Ford Mustang?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They didn't make those then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did get one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they hadn't made those yet.
Speaker 2: But that car--
Speaker 1: A Thunderbird [Ford Thunderbird], or--?
Speaker 2: No. It's--
Speaker 1: A Fairlane [Ford Fairlane], or a Falcon [Ford Falcon]?
Speaker 2: It's the one--
Speaker 1: The little one was a Falcon.
Speaker 2: And this one was a--
Speaker 1: Was it a, was this a big one?
Speaker 2: It was kind of big.
Speaker 1: A Galaxie [Ford Galaxie]?
Speaker 2: No, not nothing that big.
Speaker 1: Not that big. A Fairlane?
Speaker 2: No. It was--
Speaker 1: What was his first car? He's trying to find--he bought a red--
Speaker 2: (JOAN HUGHES ROGERS): Ford.
Speaker 1: A red Ford what? What was it? You don't know.
Speaker 2: (JOAN HUGHES ROGERS): It was old.
Speaker 1: It was old? (Laughter) Was it old when he bought it? She said yes (laughter). Well, we can roll again I guess, yeah. All right, so you bought a used Ford?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was, okay, it was a midsize Ford.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a Ford that would be, they kind of still make the same kind of car now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a four door, I mean four door, very fast, and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So at any rate, so you didn't, you know, so you didn't, you never had to really work at doing anything else? You never had to get a job in a factory or nothing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or anything else?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was, I did have the papers, though.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: I still had them papers. I was still peddling papers.
Speaker 1: Oh, selling newspapers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had a newspaper route?
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Laughter) I never will forget that guy. But I did that, because, you know--
Speaker 1: And you washed cars, too? That's what I heard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I washed cars.
Speaker 1: Washed cars, okay.
Story_ID: 557805
Speaker 1: Yeah, I washed cars (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, I just wanted to know if you got to be a big star all at once, or did it come gradually or what?
Speaker 1: Oh, no. We didn- I mean I think right now everybody's still the same, like we was a long time ago. You know, we're not--we're just all still friends and stuff, and I guess we all came from an era at that time that we were happy to each one if they get whatever they get. That we're, we're happy and gracious to what they got, you know what I'm saying. Like Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] is writing songs, and Pete's [HistoryMaker Pete Moore] doing stuff. But Ronnie White [Ronald White], Ronnie White died and, you know. So--
Speaker 2: Now you helped to write some of the songs too, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So how did it work? When [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy started running Motown [Tamla Records; Motown Records], Smokey was writing a lot of the songs?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Berry Gordy wrote some songs too, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the first song that you helped write that was recorded as a single? Or just--you know, you can talk about any of them, actually.
Speaker 1: The guy--me and Smokey got together and wrote a song for the--what's his name? We're friends too. Jo--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know. One you wrote is 'The Way You Do the Things You Do,' right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's one of the songs you wrote.
Speaker 1: But I wrote one for The Contours.
Speaker 2: And 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' ['You've Really Got a Hold on Me'].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you write--not 'Do You Love Me.' It's another one, right, for The Contours?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this one for The Contours is--Joan [Rogers' second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers]? Is she up there?
Speaker 2: No, she's not up there.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Well, oh, I can tell you. I'll collect my mind in a minute.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were in, we were in Washington, D.C. and Smokey--I'm sitting in the back of the car, and Smokey said, "Bobby [HistoryMaker Bobby Rogers]," well (unclear), how did he say that? (Pause) This song we sung for The Contours, it was--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, 'First I Look at the Purse.'
Speaker 1: 'First I Look at the Purse,' right (laughter).
Speaker 2: How did that--you all were in the car talking about that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking, and we were just riding. You know, we always rode together. We were just coming from down--what's the big city right past Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 1: No, that's going the other way. We was going down south.
Speaker 2: Going down south from there, Richmond [Virginia] or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. And we were talking, and he was saying, "Bobby, what's the first thing you look at in a woman?" I said, "I look at the purse." And we were just messing around. (Laughter) Then he started writing.
Speaker 2: I thought you meant Joan (laughter)?
Speaker 1: So, that's how we wrote that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a funny song, I remember that.
Story_ID: 557806
Speaker 1: And you helped write 'The Way You Do the Things You Do,' right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were the co-writer on that one. And there's several other songs. So, you weren't just singing. You were actually co-writing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well--
Speaker 1: Did you ever get a chance to sing the lead on any of these songs?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: You know, it was all identified with Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] usually.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't want to lead.
Speaker 1: I was wondering now, 'cause some people stand back and they got their fist balled up and they're mad, because they think that they ought to be a star.
Speaker 2: Well, see--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's what happened to that group I was in before. Because, you know, they were pretty boys. (Unclear). And them guys was going to school, and I couldn't even get a--I could get my hair processed, but it was, you know, it was just different kind of guys. One of the guys' brother is one of the guys that run the newspaper. I need her [Rogers' second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers] help.
Speaker 1: She's out in the hall. She's not close by.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But go ahead, just go ahead and--
Speaker 2: Anyway, he is the writer for all of the people that come to Detroit [Michigan], and really all over the world. A black kid, a black person, a black man. And his brother was singing with us, which was as old as we were, you know. I can't think of the name right now. But--
Speaker 1: Was he the editor of the Chronicle in Michigan?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Michigan Chronicle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The guy that does that, yeah.
Speaker 1: His brother sang with you?
Speaker 2: He sang with us, yeah. Because he was like a little kid then, I guess. But we did a lot of things, man.
Speaker 1: So you didn't, you weren't trying--I was asking you did you ever say, "Well, I should be the leader of the group [The Miracles]." Or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't want to be the leader (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were satisfied?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked to do the steps and stuff like that, you know, and all that. But if I thought--(laughter) I shouldn't say this though. But I thought if I'd be the leader, I'd get all the money or something like that. But we was with Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy], so everybody was getting the same money, you know, so that wasn't the word.
Speaker 1: He was getting most of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because he was writing. You know, I loved that. I mean because if you're writing them for us, that's good, because we're going to get some money too. You know, Smokey is a good person, though. He'll try to give you something, you know. So, we've always been real close, you know, no bad, no bad stuff around.
Story_ID: 557807
Speaker 1: Now you all [The Miracles] start becoming--I mean you were fairly well known in the black community around 1960, '61 [1961] I guess, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sixty, sixty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I know that we knew about you in other cities.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And if I could know about you as a kid, I'm pretty sure the teenagers all knew about you.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But you all made--I suppose, now tell me. Did you do local TV shows here in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you do that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did a few of them, yeah. But by that time then we started branching off, you know, going on the road.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now there were, I think you all--you all were the first, one of the first black acts on the Dick Clark 'American Bandstand' show, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: My wife, my first wife [Wanda Young] is--what's the name of that group? The girls.
Speaker 1: Oh, the--
Speaker 2: The Marvelettes.
Speaker 1: The Marvelettes were the first ones?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they were doing a lot of things with the, you know, with the white promoters, and they were going all over the country and stuff, you know, Europe and all that stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so The Marvelettes were doing, were the first ones to appear on 'American Bandstand'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As a Motown [Motown Records] group?
Speaker 2: And then The Supremes came on after that.
Speaker 1: And you all were on--now it says here that you all were on in 1961. Do you remember that, being on Dick Clark's 'American Bandstand' in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the only time we ever did it with him.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, I often thought that the people were pantomiming the records on the show. Is that true?
Speaker 2: Doing what?
Speaker 1: Pantomiming the records on Dick Clark's show? They'd play the record and you'd just kind of move your mouth.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, we were singing for real.
Speaker 1: You were singing for real?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because you have a track with you, you know, you have a track. And--
Speaker 1: So you would sing along with the record? Is that how that went?
Speaker 2: We'd just, you know, sing with the music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you'd sing--you know, you'd put your voice on the record, you know. Because they had the band; they have a real band.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you have a, did you have a good experience on the show?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't get to go--we didn't have a chance to get to do anything, only about two times in our lifetime, you know. But the girls were doing it a lot, you know, they were all doing it. But we was, we was, we were working all the time, so.
Story_ID: 557808
Speaker 1: Now also, tell me about this. You and, and Ron White [Ronald White] registered the name of The Miracles (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is important for--just tell me how--why this is important.
Speaker 2: Well, how it happened, was that one Christmas, Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] had a Christmas party for the whole--all the people, all the artists.
Speaker 1: All the Motown [Motown Records] artists?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he brought us one of those long station wagons, one of them full back station wagons. And so, in order for us to drive that station wagon and go on the road with it, we had to get it, you know, registered. And then all of a sudden he said, "Hey, put your name on there." So we wanted to put our name on that station wagon, and so we had to register it. And that's how we happened to, how that came around.
Speaker 1: So you had to register the name, The Miracles, in order to have the station wagon in the name of The Miracles?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, how did that pay off later on?
Speaker 2: We got the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You got the rights to the name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So now, I have it now. But I just have it. I mean, you know what I mean? Everybody has it; I mean, I'm just holding it. When Ronnie died, he was the one that registered it. And he died and then he just gave it to me.
Speaker 1: Okay. So that means that if our videographer [Scott Stearns] and myself decided we were going to form The Miracles--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and sing your songs, you can stop us, right, from legally--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we wouldn't do that.
Speaker 1: You wouldn't do that to us (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, we wouldn't do that, (unclear) TV (laughter). (Cough) No, we wouldn't do it like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You just like, you know, it's like, it's a whole lot of names out here. You know, the Rolling Stones got--you know, and somebody else, you know, comes along and be the Rolling, the Rolling--how can I say it? I can't even, I can't put it in words. But everybody, everybody is just, there's just so many groups out here. But everybody has their ru- their, their name.
Speaker 1: Now, I know that when I interviewed members of The Impressions in Knoxville [Tennessee] a few years ago, Sam Gooden [HistoryMaker Samuel Gooden] and some of the others, the other brother was telling me that there were people--they would go down south on tour and they would run into other groups saying that they were The Impressions.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they'd have to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: They had to go, they had to leave.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and there was another [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler singing after his first big hit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Down south, and there'd be ten other Jerry Butlers down there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have that same problem?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have that same problem. We didn't have that same problem.
Speaker 1: Different Miracles, or Smokeys [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], or--?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, mostly--no we never have that.
Speaker 1: Do you think TV had something to do with it maybe? Because they could see your face and know that you were the real ones.
Speaker 2: No, yeah, they wanted to, they wanted to--people wanted to see the real ones, you know. And the promoters want it to be the real person (laughter), you know, especially if we'd be talking about a lot of money and stuff like that. But, you know, I know what you're thinking. But we had been in kind of, in gracious hands with Berry, in that he did the right thing, and everybody was all--The Supremes, the Judy Judys or something. If they didn't have that, that didn't happen, so everybody was kind of registered.
Story_ID: 557809
Speaker 1: Now, other than The Miracles themselves--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you have a favorite group, a favorite Motown [Motown Records] group?
Speaker 2: Did I, did I have one?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a favorite--what was your favorite group in Motown other than your own group?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The Temptations, the Four Tops, you know. Then outside of our camp, Little, Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I liked him. There was lots of groups that I liked, yeah. And that's when, that's when you're on the road, you get a chance to meet them guys, you know, and have a lot of fun and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's good stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Now did you go to Europe, I mean to England in 1964?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When they had the Motown tour?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was fun up there. That's when The Beatles was out there.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Was this your first tour outside the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a good thing.
Speaker 1: Did the people in England know who you were? Because I've heard some musicians say that when they went to England, the English knew the names of everybody in the group.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they probably heard--yeah, they probably knew, because just like we probably knew all of them. I mean, we didn't have them down pat like they had us, you know, but you know--music. Because that's when The Beatles was coming out, the Rolling Stones, you know all that stuff. But it was big in their country, you know. So it's always good to be good (laughter) in your place instead of somebody else's place, you know. But we met and talked with them a long time and stuff.
Speaker 1: The Beatles?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from The Beatles about--?
Speaker 2: Really, their music, you know. Because they were singing some--they were playing some good music, man. And when they first--you know, they weren't playing it in America that hard until probably the time we went over there. That's when they started putting them out more.
Speaker 1: It was in '64 [1964] that they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --appeared on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's the year that, that's when you all were there I think?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then they started becoming big over here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know the people at Vee-Jay Records in Chicago [Illinois] that--?
Speaker 2: You mean like the guitar guy? What's his name?
Speaker 1: Oh, for The Beatles?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no. You're asking me about The Beatles now?
Speaker 1: No, I was asking you if you knew the people at Vee-Jay Records in Chicago. They were the ones that put The Beatles--you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I didn't know them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I thought you meant--
Speaker 1: There was a black woman [Vivian Carter Bracken] and a man [James C. Bracken] that first produced The Beatles, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, that's good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they made a lot of money.
Speaker 2: I know they did.
Speaker 1: But, okay, but you met them before they became big, real big over here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were big over here though, too, real big, you know. I remember when we was going to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] one time. They were going to be playing, and we was on the bus. Oh--I can't bring that to my tongue. We were going to the Apollo and then we were going to--this disc jockey, what's his name? I can't think of his name. But--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Hal Jackson? Is that--?
Speaker 2: No, this is a white guy. This--
Speaker 1: Oh, a white guy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had this stuff. He had a TV show.
Speaker 1: Casey Kasem?
Speaker 2: It's not that, but it's a guy like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Not Casey Kasem, not Hal Jackson. I don't know, I just know enough of them from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, and we had a chance to meet them, and they were nice people, you know. But as I look at their story though--you know, how people have the real story. You know, we--I'm meeting you, and we would be talking and talking and stuff. "Hey, what's going on?" The next thing, I done chopped somebody's head off because of something or something, something, you know. You know, it would be crazy.
Speaker 1: Well, you lost me there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, I know.
Speaker 1: What were you saying?
Speaker 2: I was just saying that it was good getting to know them, you know, to be--you know, they were courteous to us and we were courteous to them.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you find you had a lot in common with them?
Speaker 2: Well, we did, especially when James Brown came over there. (Laughter) He teach--he taught them some steps, you know, and stuff like that. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were nice.
Story_ID: 557810
Speaker 1: You wrote 'Going to a Go-Go,' too, didn't you, or co-wrote it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, co-wrote it, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: Now who's idea--I always, I think I always thought that The Miracles had some kind of a Spanish influence, Puerto Rican or Mexican, or something. Because your music sounds Latin, some of it did, you know. And 'Going to a Go-Go' kind of had a Latin, has a Latin kind of a ring, you know. (Singing) "Going to a go-go," can you sing some of it for us?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Going to a go-go, going to a go-go, going to a--." That's my part (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's your part?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Going to a--(scats)" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, that's it. I never did think about that.
Speaker 1: (Scats).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it sounds Latin to me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you consciously do that? Or was somebody in the group have a Latin background? Or, I mean--
Speaker 2: Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] probably put his background--
Speaker 1: Did Smokey just do that? Did he just like Latin music you think, or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he probably just had a whole lot of stuff in his head, man. All the songs, you know. I'd be riding around different cities sometimes, and his songs, he had something on the radio, man, and it's for somebody else, and stuff like that. He's a great singer.
Speaker 1: Yeah. He wrote most of The Temptations' hits.
Speaker 2: Yeah, until Norman Whitfield came out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When Norman Whitfield came out, then they say he changed the, changed them up, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the first album that Norman Whitfield wrote for them?
Speaker 2: Um, um--
Speaker 1: Or one of the songs? You don't have to remember the first one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um--
Speaker 1: What was one, what's one of the Norman Whitfield songs?
Speaker 2: Let me see.
Speaker 1: Is it 'I Wish it Would Rain'? Is that one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be one.
Speaker 1: That would be one, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was getting caught up with what do you call it, who died the other day; the guy, one of the guys that sings with him and stuff. But the thing with Smokey is that we used to go over to his house when we were off and wasn't working, and we'd just be talking and would just say something. "Yeah, yeah, yeah," and then all of a sudden it would be on that song. He wasn't, he's not--he wasn't a guy that would say, "Here man, I'll give you five dollars, this is all you get. You only told me one word." (Laughter) But you know, everything was--
Speaker 1: So you're saying the songs, they just kind of, you know, came out of conversations? And--
Speaker 2: Conversations, or if there'd be something. Him and Ronnie, Ronnie White [Ronald White], they wrote that song--oh, what's that song? It's on my mind.
Speaker 1: 'The Tracks of My Tears' or?
Speaker 2: Not 'Tracks of My Tears.'
Story_ID: 557811
Speaker 1: What are some of your reflections on today's music, black music?
Speaker 2: I like it, I like it just--I mean they opened up a new, another wall or something you know, them boys, what they doing. And the girls, you know. They're making a lot of money, you know, just--plus, plus the media isn't on their sides. I mean because, you know what I mean, they're doing some good stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite--
Speaker 2: Person?
Speaker 1: --of the young group, people that are out today?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't really have a favorite right now, because I be listening to a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: But you don't feel that they're not--you know, some people think that, you know, the kind of music that's being played now is not any good, and that, you know, it's not like it used to be (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no. I mean, they be--they're talking words. I mean, and I don't get a chance to listen to it a lot. But I do get a chance to listen to it, because my wife [Rogers' second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers] got it on in the car.
Speaker 1: So you play new, some of the contemporary music in the car?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she got, her car, she got all that stuff in there. She done put a--you know, she can call her girlfriends and things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, she's got digital radio and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 557812
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: There's probably some things I would like to have stopped. But I don't, I still think--I think--when I want--think about it, I couldn't have did nothing about it anyway, you know. So, and that's like with some people who have died around me and stuff like that, like the guy with the--what's his name? He just died, I went to his funeral, with The Temptations. What's his name? Levi Stubbs died.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people are gone, like Eddie Kendricks.
Speaker 2: Eddie Kendricks died, you know.
Speaker 1: And David Ruffin.
Speaker 2: David Ruffin. But I feel good to be here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you think you'd do the same thing again if you could?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If I could do it again I'd say, "Hey, man, don't touch that thing, man. Come on up here and just get you a gallon of water." (Laughter) You know, so--but, Ollie Woodson [Ali-Ollie Woodson].
Speaker 1: Ollie Woodson, right. Yeah, he just passed away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he just passed away.
Speaker 1: Right. He was the third lead singer of The Temptations, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and they had some good lead singers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Dennis Edwards, and then going back to David Ruffin.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 557813
Speaker 1: When you, again, look at what you've done so far--
Speaker 2: (Cough) Excuse me, yes?
Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your legacy, in the context of Motown music [Motown Records]?
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, well it would be that we made it, you know, The Miracles are the miracles, you know. And I'm happy to, happy to have been, come with it this far.
Story_ID: 557814
Speaker 1: Did your, did your grandmother [Azzie Wilson] get a chance to see you become a success?
Speaker 2: No, no. My mother [Lois Wilson Rogers] did, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--which was my, which was my grandmother--mother. But yeah.
Speaker 1: Was your mother surprised to see what happened with you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah. Well, she died, but she'd seen everything. You know, she'd seen everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Robert Rogers, Sr.], I take it he--
Speaker 2: He died. He died.
Speaker 1: Did he die before you all [The Miracles] became big?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because when he died, (cough) excuse me, he had died when we first started singing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he knew we was singing, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How many do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one, two, three--I have four. I have three at home. And that girl who my grandmother told me not to be messing with, she got a baby. (Laughter) But it's like I see all of them and stuff. But I got three, three kids right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were married twice, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was married with one of The Marvelettes, and then somewhat--something happened to her. I don't know what happened to her. She got crazy or something. Not crazy--
Speaker 1: A mental disorder?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Let's see, what was wrong with her?
Speaker 1: A bipolar disorder, or--?
Speaker 2: No. She was, she would like to drink a lot.
Speaker 1: Oh, alcoholism, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. So that's what happened to her.
Speaker 1: And you've been married to--for thirty years to Joan [Joan Hughes Rogers], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty? Thirty?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what she said a little while ago.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Unclear). Yeah, she's a beautiful lady. My other wife was beautiful too. But, I mean she was--Wanda [Wanda Young] was just, she went kind of, was doing that kind of, kind of--I don't know how to put it, but bad sch- bad stuff she was doing. She was doing a lot of drinking whiskey and stuff like that. And one time I went to Europe and I came back home and she had all this stuff spread all in the, in the house, throwing the TV out the window and stuff, you know. I tried to stay with her as long as I could, you know, but that's where--my kids are from her, you know. So, you know, but it's okay, yeah.
Story_ID: 557815
Speaker 1: Well, I only have like--is there anything I need to, we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter). What's your last question?
Speaker 1: All right. The last one we're going to ask today is this one.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It's similar to legacy. But sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would just like to--me, personally you mean? Well, I would like to be, I would like for people to be thinking that I was just a person that did good things in life. By that, doing stuff to help other people, not going to jail and not being on drugs and all that stuff, you know. So, just a nice, honest person, yeah. And the people around me--there are some people but--but whoever I chose to be with, you know, running around with, that that would be a good person right there, too, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and the coup de grace is that they know you are a good person, like yourself. And whatever you're doing, that you'd be great at it. You.
Speaker 1: Oh, me.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay. Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you're a nice man.
Speaker 1: Is that the advice you'd give to people who are trying to be successful?
Speaker 2: No, because you spend time on stage, and they don't be there long enough to talk to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know. I mean I would like to be able to talk to the guys, you know, Snoop Dogg and all them guys and, you know, just, I would like to be around them. But, you know, they might get you killed or something, so.
Story_ID: 557816
Speaker 1: How did you manage to avoid some of the pitfalls of success? You know, because other people have succumbed to drugs and crime, and they get involved in the wrong thing and stuff. How did you manage to avoid that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Was there somebody in your life that helped you or? How did you think--how did you do it?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been around a lot of stuff, but just stuff like--you know, I didn't do nothing. And I know, I guess, in a way, I would know sometimes to be able to ease out of that and go somewhere else, or something like that, you know. And I've seen some of them and they keep going the same way, the other way. And so, you know, I have a nice wife [Rogers' second wife, Joan Hughes Rogers], nice children, nice friends, you know, and some stuff like that. I'd like to have two Bentleys, you know (laughter). (Cough) Excuse me. But, you know, I'm happy. I'm happy, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the bottom line.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thanks for having me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That is the bottom line, too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
