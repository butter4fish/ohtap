 Lemons  Piepho  We   re going to start by letting each of you introduce yourselves on the tape.  Steve will be taking notes through our conversation to try and keep track of  who   s talking, so that when we transcribe it the right person will be credited  with what they said. I   ll let each of you say your name, where you were born,  and when you were born. After each of the four of you have done that, then  we   ll start our conversations.  I   m Dolores Piepho, and I was born ten and a half miles north of Guymon,  Oklahoma, here. I was born on January 5, 1929.  I   m Julanne Davis, born in Guymon December 22, 1924.  I   m Connie Carpenter, and I was born in Perryton, Texas on February 10,  1948. I   m just here for support. That   s it  laughter .  I   m Dorothy Stewart. I was born in Amorita, Oklahoma August 27, 1920.  We   ll start really easy. Would you say that where you grew up was a more  rural area or more urban in town?  I was right on the edge of town. I wasn   t right in the city.  Describe the house where you lived. How big was it? Who lived there?  I had three sisters and a brother at that time. It was more like a white board  house.  Was it one level or two levels?  One. We still had a windmill and a barn and things like that.  Yeah, so you really are right on the edge. How does that compare to the  houses were you lived?  Well, mine was a farmhouse my grandfather had built in 1919. It was called a  story and a half, but we didn   t use the upstairs at that time; it wasn   t finished.  5  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Piepho  I thought it was big at the time, but it was only a living room, dining room, two  bedrooms, a kitchen, and a couple of little bitty rooms and an outside porch.  How many people were living there?  My mother and my father, I was the only child at that time.  So you had free reign of all those rooms.  Yes, that   s why it was big I guess  laughter . I even had one room that was my  playroom, which is our bathroom now.  Do you live in that house now?  No, it   s abandoned now.  How about yours?  My parents moved out here in 1928. We had a three-room house, and there  was a barn and a chicken house. I had a brother that is two years younger than  I. I guess I was about eight when we moved out here in 1928 because I was  born in 1920, so I guess I was eight.  What do you remember doing that was really fun in that house? You had a  playroom, so I bet you had all sorts of things to do   In 1929 my parents bought a piano for me. It was one of those player pianos,  so we had a lot of fun with that piano. We had a lot of dry years there, where  nothing was raised, but people got together. We used that player piano. We  had dances  laughs , and just had a good time anyway, even if times were bad.  Do you remember things you used to do for fun?  It certainly wasn   t as expensive as they are for our kids and grandkids. You   d  use a lapboard with a cross and a hoop. I got to where I could go between two  weaves that close together. I was so good  laughter . We had a basketball  goal and a bicycle, but no sidewalk out that far, so we didn   t have skates then,  because we had no sidewalk.  Did you get skates later? You kind of implied that you liked roller skates.  Yes, and where my home is now, it   s all built up. Where it was is part of north  Guymon. A hospital and everything is all out in there now.  What were you doing for fun?  See, I was an only child at that time, and it seems like we must have gone to a  circus at one time. The barn is a big barn with a loft in it. My daddy spoiled  me, and he hung me a trapeze like thing. I thought I was like the circus  6  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Stewart   laughter . With him doing things with me, we created things.  Like what?  One of the things was, in the old Penny   s store that was here in town, do you  remember, you put the money in the cart and they pulled the string, and it   d go  up to the balcony where the cashier was. I just thought that was one of the  most exciting things. We had a few evergreen trees, so in the corner there, I  fixed me a bakery. Of course I decorated my mud pies with maize and wheat  and those sorts of things. I tried and tried to think of some way to fix that  change or money thing. I played mud pies by myself; that was one of the big  things, mud pies. You   d always have a few wildflowers at certain times, until  it got dry. I   d gone to a few funerals, and I   d see them have these flowers on  the racks, so I spent times fixing racks out of pieces of wire  laughter .  I don   t know if I want to play with her or not  laughter .  Well, when you   re by yourself, you have all kinds of imaginations. Of course,  I guess it was ants that died  laughter .  Speaking of mud pies, when we went to Cherokee to visit relatives, I had to  have some of that red dirt because I wanted it for frosting. It did not stay that  red. I was disappointed  laughter .  Well, so what was a typical day like for you? Did you get to spend all day  making mud pies?  Well, we didn   t have running water. I was too young most of that time to  carry a big bucket. I had kind of a small bucket that I   d have to carry from the  windmill to the house. You had to use it for drinking, washing dishes, and  cooking.  So your job was carrying water.  Well, that a little bit, and you   d go out and help gather eggs. I never had to  milk cows, because my mother had milked cows when she was little and didn   t  want me to have to do that. I   d gather eggs and feed the chickens. If you had  hogs, you would take the garbage out to them.  What about washday?  You washed on Monday, ironed on Tuesday, or at least my grandmother did.  So what was washday like?  Well, you had to carry that water. Did you have to carry water?  Probably, somebody did  laughter .  7  Piepho  Carpenter  Piepho  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Well, you carried your little share. Mother had a Maytag wringer washer, so  we were pretty uptown. She got that six months after I was born.  We had one of those when I was born. My brother got his arm caught in it.  That was always scary.  I know my mother did a lot of washing with a scrub board. Several years later,  Connie found one over at her grandmothers, and she wanted to know who used  to play that  laughter .  What kind of chores did you have to do?  Oh, we always had some toys. At Christmas, we always had some toys. We  lived a mile and a half from school. We rode a horse to school. I had a girl in  my class that rode five and a half miles to school on a horse. I can   t remember  anyone taking us to school, but they must have part of the time, because then  we   d walk home from school.  What do you remember about the school you went to? How many people were  there? Were there a lot of other students?  Oh yes, there were a lot of people. I can   t remember how many were in my  class, probably about twenty-something.  What was your favorite subject?  It wasn   t geography, I   ll tell you that  laughter . I don   t know. I liked  English, spelling, and math. I always liked those subjects.  How about you? Did you go to school in town?  Yes. I think I liked English and literature best of all, and spelling.  Spelling was not my favorite  laughter .  Did you have ciphering matches?  Oh yes.  We did too.  I thought it was more interesting when I was little in school than it is now,  because you had your spelling bees. When you learned multiplication tables,  you had the cards. You memorized them. You didn   t have the little  calculators.  We had good teachers, we must have had.  8  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Lemons  Did you play with other kids in town?  Oh yes, and they came and played with us.  What kind of group games did you play with other kids?  We used to like to hike down to the river when it was permissible, but I   m so  scared of snakes that I didn   t go in the summer much.  Did you ever come in and play with other kids?  Well, we lived ten and a half miles out, so you had just about a weekly trip,  mainly. You were asking about coming to town and playing with others?  Well, I had two girl cousins that I was real close to. They were a little older  than I was, but Mother would see to it that I got to be with them to play. They  tell me now that they were really jealous because I had so many toys and  things. I was the only one, the only grandchild for eight years. They thought I  had lots of goodies. We would mostly go outside and hide in the bushes.  After the dirt storms came and piled up the dirt, you   d go out and play on those  sand piles. The trees had died, and daddy had pulled them off away from the  orchard. Then they filled up with dirt and it was a real mountain to go and  climb on. The limbs would be places, and we would kind of swing on them  and play.  We   ll start with you Mrs. Stewart, what do you remember about the first time  you saw a dust storm coming?  I don   t really remember the first ones. The one that I remember the most was  the one that we were looking at in the pictures. They just kind of rolled in  from the northwest. Then it would just get as dark as night. You could not see  without lights. Our school was fairly new, it was not very old, and they had  lights there. But we used lamps.  Do you remember any signs from animals or anything like that before you saw  the cloud coming?  Yes, well animals   horses especially, seemed     What would they do?  They just got kind of wild, just like children do.  Spook them huh?  Uh-huh, and cattle. Calves would run around a lot.  How about you guys? What do you guys remember about the first dust storm?  9  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Stewart  Scary.  There was no noise. Did you think there was ever any noise with them when  they approached? They were so quiet. You would have thought that you   d  hear a roar or something, but to me it was quiet. This one April 14th, what is  that    35 or    36 that they talk about? I would have been six in    35. That  particular one, we were at my grandparents, and they had a cellar. My  grandpa, boy, we had to get ready and get in that cellar. We stood and  watched. That   s what I said; it was so quiet. If it was like a hurricane or  something, you would have been expecting a noise, but as well as I remember,  it was quiet.  We had to go down in the cellar when it got right there. They watched until  then, because we didn   t know if it had strong winds with it or if it was going to  be hard particles or what. I don   t remember how long then that storm lasted or  how long we stayed down there. I don   t think we stayed down there very long.  We got out as soon as we saw that it wasn   t violent, maybe. We had to have  lights.  I remember one particular one; it really was dark that day. At noontime, when  it was lunch, it was so dark, and there was so much dirt. If you set the table,  you didn   t set your plates up; you always laid them face down until you got  ready to eat. You   d cover up as much stuff as you could while you were fixing  food. I guess what you got into it when you were cooking didn   t matter, but  you weren   t going to have a dirty plate.  What kind of things would you do to try to keep the dust out?  Well, we hung quilts and blankets over the windows and doors. Some of them  were wet to try to keep some dust out. I can remember, on a table you could  just pull up  laughs  a little sand, dust. It was fine. It wasn   t really sand  though, it was topsoil.  Just a dust. Well, something that a lot of the people did, and I bet your mother  did too, we would use brown tape, paper tape. We   d paste all the windows,  every place around the window. Any place there was an opening you put that.  But it still got in.  Yeah, oh yeah. But you did that to everything, any window; anything that you  could paste shut you did.  Like you said, my mom used to put up wet sheets, especially over the bedroom  windows. After we   d go to sleep, she   d put a wet handkerchief on us, and that  would have dust on it.  This is telling about Perryton schools. They fixed things for the kids,  something to put over their face. They gave them to each child in school. Of  course we didn   t do that out in the country.  10  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Did you know of anyone, family or friends that suffered from dust pneumonia?  Yes, my little brother.  Older or younger?  Younger, he was just a baby.  Talking about the masks or handkerchiefs, one of the times when there was a  real bad one. I guess it was the first year that I was in school. I went to the  parochial school. It had no windows on the north side, but it had windows on  the south. One day this storm came up after we were at school, and it got so  dark that you couldn   t see across the way where the church was or over to  where the parsonage was. The teacher was our pastor, so he just kept us in the  building. He wouldn   t even let us go to the outhouse, because it was too far,  he thought. Then, one by one our parents drove up. They drove on the south  side there, and we could see them coming. When they all got there, then he let  us go with our parents home.  My daddy had come for me, and he had a filter mask, and it had a wet sponge  in it. It had a place on the side that was like a valve. He had worn that there to  come, so when he picked me up, he gave it to me and did without it. We  started home; you could hardly see your way home. You found your way by  the fence posts. Driving home, the dirt had drifted so bad already that we got  stuck in the sand drifts, the dirt drifts. He had to get out and take the shovel,  because it was so fine that it kept drifting back in. He tried to get enough  away, and then he   d have me put it in gear so we could go forward. I couldn   t  go too far because I was too little. He didn   t want me to get away, so he   d go  far enough.  Anyway, we got through those drifts and got home, but I think about how  parents did all they could for their children. He had me wear it, except for  when he had to get out that time. Then he gave it back to me. That sponge was  just completely black and muddy. That dirt was so fine you couldn   t shovel it  and make a ditch. It would just fall back in.  It covered up fence lines too.  Oh yes, the fences were just covered. And around the church and the school  and parsonage there were so many drifts. We   ve got pictures, but they   re not  in this book. There were so many drifts. They had to go in with Fresno  scoops and scoop it out after a time, but it quit.  Do any of the rest of you know of any other stories of people who were lost or  stuck out in that storm?  I think everybody ran for cover when they saw it coming  laughter .  11  Piepho  Stewart  Carpenter  Stewart  Carpenter  Stewart  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Yeah, they had enough sense to stay where they were at, I think.  I don   t remember when we went home, but we were having church at that time  in the schoolhouse. When it came in, it got just as dark as night. I remember  that, but I don   t remember us going home. We did later, I guess. I don   t even  remember going home, but it was quite an experience to see it come in like  that, and then see it get just as dark as night when it was afternoon. Also,  years later, when people were trying to redo their house, they   d find that their  attic was full of that dirt. I have no idea how much was in it, but there was a  lot in there.  Roman Max redid your house, the house that you lived in.  That was after that. That was built after the dust storms.  Oh, I didn   t know that. It was full of dust.  I think they built it in 1940.  One time, in 1939, my mother was getting the house all cleaned up because  our new pastor was going to come visit. We had cleaned and dusted and got  everything as good as it could be. Low and behold, in the corner of the room,  that ceiling that plaster came down with all that dirt on top of it. It was so  heavy that it came down  laughter . My mother was expecting my little sister.  She wasn   t very emotionally ready for that kind of an ordeal. So there you are,  and how do you go about cleaning all that up?  What did you do?  Well, we swept  laughter .  Did you give the pastor a dust cloth or something when he came in?  They were from Indiana and had no concept of what we had gone through.  Before they left, we had some dust storms. In the middle or early forties, I  think.  Did they go back to Indiana?  They went further away from here  laughter . They were scared to death, then.  When we did have this one storm, a fairly strong one.... You just had to use a  scoop and scoop all that junk out, start cleaning again. You didn   t have any  Endust at that time  laughter . Kerosene rags, I think, is what we used.  Let   s change gears for just a little bit and go from the dust storm to just the  Depression in general. Is there anything that sticks out in your mind that  makes you think oh yeah, this is kind of hard times?  Not so much, because everybody was going through it. I don   t remember  12  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Lemons  Piepho  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Davis  being any worse off than my friends. Do you?  Well no. Nobody had crops. Of course, we always milked and sold cream.  We shipped it to Hutchison, Kansas, to the creamery. I don   t know how often,  but we brought it to the depot, and they   d ship it. Then our cream check would  come in a few days. With a cream check you bought your things. We raised  chickens, so we had eggs. You brought a case of eggs to town and traded them  at the grocery store.  Do you know how much you got for those eggs?  Well, I don   t know how much a dozen they got, but I know with a case of eggs  they could usually get a case full of groceries. That   d buy your sugar and  coffee and things like that. Syrup, maybe. You bought syrup in the gallon  buckets. I never did think we ever had a shortage of food in our home because  we were farm people.  A lot of brown beans and fried potatoes, which I still like  laughter .  That usually has one of two effects. Either you really like it, or you really  don   t.  Well, that way you had meat if you butchered your hogs and your calves. And  you had chickens. You raised chickens and fried chicken. You always  butchered all the roosters and saved the pullets. One time, I don   t know how  old I was at that time, we went out to catch a chicken to butcher, and I said  yep, I think that   s a rooster. Sure enough, it wasn   t. I killed the prize pullet.  Well, my father had to sell his cattle to the government, I presume. Well, I  know it was. They came out and killed the cattle, but they let him have the  beef. So all the neighbors came over and helped. Our local club bought a  canner... They sealed them with the canner, and they cooked the meat. I can  remember several days that we cooked the meat and put it in the cans and  sealed it with the canner. Then we put them in pressure cookers. That was the  best beef you can imagine.  I bet it was.  It was delicious. I had the idea that he just gave the neighbors the meat, but  I   m not sure about that, I just don   t know. They all came and helped anyway.  And they   d come help when you   d butcher hogs, because you would do the  whole job at one time.  You didn   t waste anything.  No, and you saved the head and everything.  You made head cheese.  13  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Davis  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  You don   t like head cheese, huh?  I never was real crazy, anyway. And you made lard. I know that with no  crops, this was all my parents had to do with. But to have money enough to  make the payments on the farm or pay your feed bills that you bought, chicken  feed or cow. Because if you milked, you had to have some processed feed. I  don   t remember if it was in    37 or what, the years had just gone by and the  folks had not been able to keep up, and they were going to foreclose on the  land. Mother and daddy went in to see the man. Mother was expecting at that  time. The man talked with them about what they had, what their prospects  were, and what kind of resources they had. They told him, and he said,    I see  you are expecting more family. My wife and I cannot have family.    He said,     Anyone that is still planning for a family during times like these, I can   t deny  you. I   ll extend your loan.    We always thought that that was kind of an omen  that the Lord moves to help you in hard times.  Wow, what a story   This says that 1929 was a good crop year for wheat. It was mostly wheat.  Then, in 1931 it says that wheat was twenty-five cents a bushel where it had  been a dollar a bushel before that. It isn   t a whole lot better now than it was  then.  You said how good that canned meat was, what was your favorite food? If you  were going to have a special occasion, what would you have to eat that was  special?  We had ice cream and cake. We always had ice cream and cake. My mother  was a good cook. She made a lot of pies too. For birthdays, we always had  cake and ice cream. How, I don   t know, but we did  laughter . There was a  way I guess.  How about for you guys?  I already said, brown beans and potatoes  laughter . But fried chicken, mashed  potatoes and gravy, and vegetables out of the garden. Good living.  Fried chicken was the thing to have when there was going to be a company  dinner.  We had fried chicken every day.  My grandmother would butcher I don   t know how many chickens and fry a  whole bunch of chickens. She was the organist at the church, so she   d go to  church and then come home and there   d be this big dinner. It was so big that  the men would eat first, that   s all the table room there was, and then the  women would eat last.  14  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Davis  I wasn   t all for that  laughter .  And the kids eat last too.  What about Christmas time? What was that like during the Depression days?  Well, we always had something under the tree. We decorated the tree. We  didn   t have a whole lot of decorations like you do now. We   d make chains out  of popcorn and cranberries and construction paper.  Do you remember any special Christmas gifts you got?  I always had a doll. I don   t remember about my brother. He had something,  I   m sure. I remember one time, it was in pretty hard times, I had a doll just  about that big, and he broke that doll. That was my brother, and I remember  that.  You say that like he might have done that more than once  laughter . Did you  ever get in trouble with your brothers?  We fought all the time, constantly. He was vicious. He hit for my eye. I don   t  know how many black eyes I had. I wouldn   t hurt him, but he was mean.  I believe I would have  laughter .  Something about Christmas that I might mention, and I bet you all did too, was  candles. Did you all have candles on your Christmas tree? Well, we had a  little clip that had a candle about this long. You   d light that, but when you did  everybody had to watch. You only lit it about once or twice during the  Christmas season. That was I though unique until the electric lights came.  You only ate bought candy at Christmas time. Orange slices and chocolate  drops, and fancy hard candy. But, you only had it at Christmas time. You  didn   t have it any other time.  Do you remember Santa Claus coming to visit you?  Not at my house. They   d do it at church. We   d have a Santa at church.  You   d get an apple and an orange and a hard candy in a sack. My dad played  Santa Claus a lot to his grandchildren and the town. He was a Santa on the  Christmas parade. As he got older he said,    When they get to be fifteen years  old I can   t pick them up and put them on my lap.     Laughter  And he was a  mason, and my kids recognized him because of his ring.  So what was it like in Guymon in the thirties? What was going on in town? If  you came in town, what would you be doing?  When we were kids, we had what they call a cavern, and a nickelodeon. We   d  go down there and we   d dance all Saturday afternoon after we got our chores  done. That was older, in high school.  15  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Stewart  Piepho  When I was probably,    35,    36   a first, second, and third grader, to come to  town on Saturday was a big deal.  Parking place  laughs .  You   d want to get here early enough so you could park on Main Street and  watch the people. The country kids always thought it was exciting to come to  town. They   d get together and walk up and down one street. If they got a  little bigger, they might be able to cross the corner here and come down this  street, but usually it was right down there, Main Street, as long as your folks  could see you.  And a nickel for a coke.  Or a nickel for an ice cream cone, and you got a big dip of ice cream for a  nickel.  Well, I thought I was too big, but my brother, in Perryton   Perryton was our  closest town. They had a matinee every Saturday afternoon, so he would take  the little girl that he liked. They would go to the matinee. Of course, I was too  old for that.  So what were you doing instead?  Oh, just walked the streets, I guess, with my friends  laughter .  I always got to go to the Shirley Temple shows. My grandparents and parents  would come in, and we   d go to the Shirley Temple shows. Then we   d go for  an ice cream soda at the drug store after it was over.  That sounds like a pretty good time now.  Maybe we weren   t so poor after all. We saved enough money for the show.  Do you remember any medicine shows or vaudeville shows coming to town?  I remember revival tents, and then we had a skating rink tent. It was a skating  rink, and then they had a big tent over it. That   s the only thing I remember. I  don   t remember any of the others, do you?  Not any medicine shows, but like I say, I think there was a circus one time that  we came to see.  And rodeo.  Well, the Pioneer Day is coming up.  Saved up for that.  16  Davis  Lemons  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Davis  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Davis  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  We always went. May 2nd, I remember that.  What kinds of things do you remember doing at the Pioneer Days?  There was always a parade, and when I got older, there was always the dance  that night. We   d go to the dance.  If you were younger, there was a carnival with rides.  Later there were cowboys and rodeos.  Do you remember where you went on your first date?  I don   t remember having a first date  laughter . That goes back, doesn   t it?  That   s too long ago.  Well, you mentioned you were going to dances and that you were dating.  I can remember that there was a boy that asked me to go to church. He was  going to get his brother   s car, and evidently the brother wouldn   t let him have  his car, because I never did get to go to church with him  laughter . His  brother had a new car, that   s probably why he didn   t get it.  Do you remember anybody from your family or people that you knew that left  whenever times got bad?  I don   t remember any specific family, a lot of them did I   m sure, but I don   t  remember any of my friends doing that.  We did for a year and a half. In 1936, my dad said he   d had it.  Where   d you go?  Well, he had a brother that lived in Carmen, Oklahoma, so we moved over  there in the spring of 1936. We rented a house there and moved there for that  year. As soon as I graduated from high school in 1937, we moved back to  Beaver County, back to the farm again.  Try again.  There were several farm families that just could not make it. They were  maybe renting their land, or if they   d bought it they couldn   t pay it, and they  just left it. I think that one of the families moved to northeastern Oklahoma.  Then there were some that moved away to California.  Yeah, my uncle did that.  17  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Piepho  A couple of families did that.  But he wasn   t with The Grapes of Wrath.  They moved on their own. A little later, several families moved to Colorado,  close to Alamosa, where they had irrigation tracks and went into farming there.  The people that left, did they keep in touch with people that stayed here in this  area?  Yeah, two of them were with family and two of them had family back here that  they kept in contact with and came back for visits from time to time.  Do you remember any of the names those families that left?  I think there was a Cleffman family and their brother-in-law, Hohneman. And  there were some Bowers and Gumper. Those are the names that had moved.  Of my family, my uncle, Virgil Chenault, moved to California. He got on the  police department, and then he was a detective. He   d come back every  summer to visit, but he never moved back.  People did not take welfare unless they just had to. They   d do without before  they would take welfare and ask for help.  Did we have welfare then?  Yes, there was welfare.  The WPA projects people would work for...  My dad worked on the road to get a little bit of money. Then the CCC camps  came in.  The young men went to those camps to work and send some money home to  help the ones at home.  What stands out in your mind when people say dirty thirties? What are your  fondest memories of those times?  It seems to me like people were closer. I have a lot of friends now that are  close, but it just seemed like everybody helped everybody. It made them  closer.  Well, we would, even in those darkest and dirty storms and things, my parents  and other couples their ages and even older ones would get together and play  auction bridge. They would have bridge parties at different houses. That was  always a thing that they could go to.  18  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Lemons  Davis  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  They   d take a covered dish.  They went after supper, after they   d done the chores. They took the family. I  was like four or five or six years old, and we kids that were that age couldn   t  play with the bigger kids. They had their own games that they wanted to play,  so there were about three our four of us little ones. We did things like crawl  under the furniture, like dressers. It   s a wonder we didn   t break everything.  You   d pile all of the coats on one bed, so we little ones, when we got tired,  we   d lay down. Then our folks would have to wake us up or carry us out to  the car. They would always try to figure out what kinds of refreshments they  could have. All the women would try to figure out what was the best  refreshment they could have. They   d have a different kind of pie or dessert.  Did you ever go to a box supper where they auction off the supper? Did you  participate? How did you decorate your box?  Oh yes, we ate with them then after.  What kinds of things would you put in your box?  Usually fried chicken, probably. Then there was pies or cake. I don   t know;  they were always full of food. Maybe there were sandwiches. They were  good. Then cakewalks.  Cr  pe paper was always used a lot on your boxes.  And then the Valentine boxes that we made were for Valentines Day.  I was going to say that our entertainment wasn   t all that expensive.  We had parties and dances. It would be the whole neighborhood.  Do you remember any of the songs that you would dance to?  Glenn Miller.  There was a neighbor that played the piano too. We   d dance just to the piano  music. Like you said, there was always someone who played the violin too.  I can hear the train coming; that reminds me of a question. Do you ever  remember tramps or hobos coming by your houses when you lived at home?  We did before we moved out here. Yes, there was always someone who   d  come.  What would happen when they   d come?  They   d ask for something to eat, and my mother would always give them  something to eat.  19  Lemons  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Carpenter  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  What kinds of things would she give to them?  I don   t remember.  Would they ever do any work around your house?  No. She wouldn   t have let them stay, but there was always someone coming.  And then gypsies, did you have gypsies out here? We did back there.  One time I think is all, and we were scared because we always thought they  would steal.  They did  laughter .  One would come to the house and the rest would go around and pick up a  chicken and some eggs.  They cased the joint  laughter .  But that was the only time, because being far enough out, I guess we were too  far out. They stayed closer to the main roads.  Mrs. Stewart, did you have gypsies come by more than once? Was that  frequent?  I doubt it. Yes, probably there were gypsies more than one time.  What were they dressed like?  I don   t remember that.  It seemed like we knew who they were because they were dressed in bright  colors.  I think they were in wagons or something horse drawn. At that time, we didn   t  even have a car, I don   t think. We had a neighbor that got a new buggy. She  came by and picked my mother and me up. The women left us kids in the  buggy, and the little boy said,    You can   t ride in my buggy,    and he pushed  me out  laughter .  You remember that, don   t you   Mothers were just like they are now. They didn   t take care of their kids.  They didn   t teach him to share, did they  laughter ?  He was probably flirting with you.  20  Stewart  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Lemons     You can   t ride in my buggy,    and boom, there I went out   Did you have any pets around the house?  Always a dog.  Yeah, what was your dog   s name?  Gosh, it seems like Skip.  Rover.  Trixie. If we had a dog, special dog, it was rat terriers. They were small, and  invariably, we   d get one run over. We had one to take down to where the lake  was, and that   s where we   d bury it. There were cats, but they were in the barn.  Cats weren   t house pets.  Did you fix flowers for the funeral?  I don   t think there were any flowers. It was dry. The flowers were all  bloomed and blown out  laughter . A lot of the kids would have horses  because they would ride horses a lot. We never did have a riding horse.  Daddy had some workhorses at times. One time, this one family had a team of  horses and they couldn   t feed them, so they let the folks take them and use  them, to keep them. We called one of them Jack. One of them was frisky and  the other was kind of cloddy. So you   d ride these old workhorses, and I  always took the cloddy one because I was scared. You didn   t ride with a  saddle; you just rode bareback. My daddy would ride with me. One time he  said,    Let   s gallop,    instead of just loafing along. So we did, and I got scared  and slid right off. It never hurt me, but it hurt my pride. I couldn   t even stay  on   It was fun when you had a horse and a big old sled, and they pulled you in the  snow. That was fun.  Did any of you have a nickname when you were a kid?  Julie.  I always thought I wanted one, but I always used my full name. In high school  one time, this one kid would say,    bow wow.    My last name being Bower,  and he would say,    Here   s old bow wow.     I hope it wasn   t the one that pushed you out of the wagon  laughter .  Well, no. I didn   t know that one   Well, how do you feel about the dirty thirties when you look back on it today?  21  Davis  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Stewart  Davis  Stewart  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  I   m glad they   re over, but I really don   t know how many dust storms we really  had. When they learned how to do their land.  We had a number of real bad storms. We really did.  This picture says number four, so I imagine there were a number, of them, four  anyway, that rolled in like that one.  Now, I look back on it and wonder how people today would cope with this  kind of situation. I guess we just thought it was part of our experiences, I  guess.  When they learned to do the land right, that helped.  It tells in here about some people at Perryton. There was a farmer that thought  he knew a better way of farming. Sure enough, he had wheat when the rest of  the country didn   t.  He taught them then, huh.  He taught them.  Probably the thing that was so impressive about these dust storms, it came on  the heels or with the Depression. Besides the Depression, you were having  this weather thing, so you were having more than one hardship to face.  Do you think that changed the way people in this area viewed the  environment?  Some of them. That generation is about gone. The people that farmed in that  era are, gone, mostly. My father, his age group that were farming, the vital  age, and grandparents, are gone. I can see how people don   t respect the  environment, respect the good farming practices   that could get us in trouble  again.  Yes, well if you have very many days like yesterday, everything would start  blowing.  My son prints a newspaper at Perryton. As we went down yesterday morning,  we went sailing because the wind was behind us. As we come home, we were  bucking the wind and really fighting it. There was a place just east of town  here that had been planted with wheat. It was very late and very small, and it  was blowing across the road that you could not see, for this small area.  My husband used to say that he   d see some of the farmers with their land so  fine and clean. He   d say,    That isn   t the way to farm, not out here.    So far,  they   ve been lucky, but it wouldn   t take very many days like yesterday for it  all to be blowing again.  22  Piepho  Lemons  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Carpenter  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Well, we cans see what happened last fall when the moisture wasn   t here for  them to plant their wheat. The ones that had prepared and didn   t get planted in  time to get any growth, there   s nothing there to protect it.  Do you remember the first time that it rained after you had these big dust  storms, and you started getting good rain again?  The summer of    36, it had started raining. I had come back with my father,  and he did the farming. I suppose I cooked for him, but I don   t remember  cooking anything. That year must have been the start of the rain, in 1936. We  moved back in 1937 and just started farming again.  When we got rain in those years, they would be real heavy rains. The ground  was dry, and it would puddle. That was chance you could go out and walk  barefoot in the mud puddles. We had some real hard hailstorms after it started  raining again, like when Guymon had the tornado or the twister that came  through.  What I miss is water in the rivers like it use to be. That   s bad.  See, you had that water in that river at that time even during the dirt storms.  The irrigation is the reason why we don   t have water.  Pulling it down. We   d go on picnics along the Beaver River, and there were  real groves of trees.  And now they   re dead.  There   s nothing there now like that. You   d go down there for your church  picnics and your family reunions, go down to the Beaver River in the grove of  trees. Your folks would warn you not to get in the quicksand. Do you  remember the quicksand?  Do you remember when things, economically, started turning around? Do you  remember when you finally had money to spend, and you could buy stuff?  What was the first extravagant purchase you made?  My folks, our economic situation improved when the natural gas was drilled.  That was in    42 and    43 when they drilled the first gas wells in our area. That  saved us then. That gave you fuel. We had never had anything but coal or  wood or kerosene. The folks then piped gas to the house. Mother got to have  a gas stove, and we got to have a gas refrigerator.  Yeah, Kelvinator.  Then, pretty quickly they came out with the gas motors for electricity, power  plants. That was when things really happened.  23  Lemons  Piepho  Davis  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Stewart  Lemons  Stewart  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  What was the most exciting part about getting electricity?  Probably that you could have lights in any room without carrying the lamp.  After lamps we had, with gas, the mantles. If you had moths, and they flew  through the mantle, well that was the end of the light. You had these things on  it, but if they got inside that was it. What were those called? Miller bugs.  We had a kerosene lamp that had mantles too, and I can   t remember what that  was called.  Rayo lamp?  No.  We just had the wick and kerosene when we had lamps, but then we got  modern and had the gas. There wasn   t great light to it though.  That   s why you didn   t waste any time doing homework and things.  Do you remember when you first got indoor plumbing?  I was trying to think. We always had water.  I was married in 1943, and we didn   t have indoor plumbing for a while then.  Then my parents moved out and we moved into their house. That was in 1947,  I guess. We had a bathroom, then. Then we moved to Perryton for a while.  Then we moved back to where we live now. It was indoor plumbing when we  moved out there in 1951. We still live at the same place. I can remember  when we got our first washing machine though. I don   t remember what year it  was.  Were you excited to get that new washing machine?  Oh yes, that was wonderful.  And the refrigerators, the gas refrigerators. Before that, we always had an  icebox. You   d have to get a hundred pound block of ice and wrap it in quilts  and take it home and put it in there. Then you had to have a drip pan under it,  so you wanted to be sure you got that emptied or you   d have water all over  everything. Since my mother passed away, I   ve got the old chest icebox that  my grandmother had. It was flat and it flipped one way and flipped the other.  It had a drain on it. You more or less set your things down in the bottom of  this.  I just remember that you opened it up put the ice up there and then you opened  the bottom.  Oh, that was a chest. That was nice.  24  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Piepho  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  Piepho  Stewart  Piepho  Stewart  Davis  Piepho  Stewart  You had, what do you call them? It   s where the water runs in from the  windmill.  We didn   t have one of those. I thought that was real neat where you had the  water as it pumped would pump in this one barrel, then it would run off to  another one, and that would be the weight. They   d hang their milk in that  water. Things didn   t spoil then like they do now, because we never worried  about food poisoning like we do now. Now you can   t leave anything out over  two hours. Goodness, you made dinner and left it out until supper.  Well, like you say, you canned. We canned a lot of stuff.  But those appliances like that little chest ice box, I think you probably could  have set Jell-O in it, because it would have been enough cool to do it, but you  sure wouldn   t have brought ice cream home and kept it. Unless you packed it  in ice.  How do you think living through the Depression and the dirty thirties has  affected who you are today?  It   s easier to cope with things I   d say, probably. You know, out here we   re  known as the strongest people in the United States.  You have to be if that   s coming at you.  I just think it   s just one of those kinds of experiences that some people may  have been bitter about, I don   t know. The ones that did leave said they were  glad they were out of there. When our grandparents and great-grandparents  came here in    06 and    07, they came here to better themselves, and we thought  we were going to keep on. We weren   t going to think we had to leave it for  something better. This was good; we accepted it.  We learned early that you do what you have to do.  I felt like I always had good schoolteachers in spite of the conditions that they  had to teach in.  That was another thing. It tells in here about how the teachers were paid in  warrants. They had to accept a discounted price for these. This says in 1945,  Perryton school board cut the school year short because they ran out of funds.  We weren   t that lucky  laughter .  I never went nine months of school until I got in high school. I always just  went eight months.  I didn   t know anyone did until I read this.  25  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Piepho  Davis  Lemons  Davis  Lemons  And we had Kiddie Kitchen, do you remember that? They   d have stew most  always and milk. I hate milk.  So this Kiddie Kitchen was at the school?  Yeah. Kind of a cafeteria, it was.  I never went to anything that uptown. Talking about lunches, my parents  bought me a brand new lunch bucket my first year. So I went to school and  Mother just filled it with all kinds of food. I got there and all the other kids  had syrup buckets. I went home in tears. I told my mom I wanted a syrup  bucket like all the other kids  laughter .  When we did carry lunches, I would trade my sandwich with made with  homemade bread and cake and all that to somebody else with bought bread.  You thought that was better, huh?  Yeah, I never had any problem getting someone to trade.  Well, thank you for coming in and talking to us today.  -------  -------
