Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Elmer Dixon] side, but we'll, we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's Frances Marie Sledge [Frances Sledge Dixon] and Sledge is S-L-E-D-G-E.

Speaker 2: And Frances is F-R-A-N-C-E-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is March 29, 1922.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you go and are there are any stories on that side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I can go back pretty far.  I, I guess I would start with the story that, that we've been told that was passed down was that on my father's side--
Speaker 1: This is on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I--I'm sorry, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On her father's [Roy Sledge] side?
Speaker 2: On her father's side--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the story is that there was a African queen that, that, that was a slave who married a Cherokee chief and so obviously my grandfather on my mother's side was part Cherokee.  And his father was the only black blacksmith in Mississippi who used to ride a white horse, and we actually have a picture of him on the white horse. And on my--on my mother's mother's side, the story is that her great-great-great-grandmother was a African slave woman and her name was Mariah, and she had five kids and I believe they were by the slave master.  And my great-grandmother on my mother's side had a child by a Jewish man in Mississippi and we only know that his last name was Brown [ph.].  And because she had this affair with this Jewish man, she was ostracized from her family.  And so after the birth of the baby, she passed away when the--when the baby was three years old and the baby was my grandmother.  And so my grandmother was raised by her grandmother.  And until--because she was mulatto in Mississippi during the 1900s, from what I understand, that was not a, a good situation for her to be in, and so she was sent to Chicago [Illinois] to stay with her aunts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Josephine Sledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, she had aunts in Chicago already.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we know that Chicago is the terminus for a lot of black migrants from Mississippi.
Story_ID: 486227
Speaker 1: So, did she have any stories of growing up?  Did, did you know your [maternal] grandmother [Josephine Sledge]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--actually, I had a opportunity to live with my grandmother and my great-great-grandmother [Emma Ely].  And, and, you know, she--well, she, she talked about how she was, was treated by her aunt because she was half white.  And so her aunt had actually broken ties with her mother when she was born because of the stigma of having a relationship with a white man, and so she was really mistreated by her aunt.  And her aunt and her husband owned--were, were fairly well off.  They lived out in the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] on 165th [Street].  They owned a huge plot of land and they had a, a ice cream parlor.  And so my grandmother tells me the stories of how she would have to clean the floor of the ice cream parlor while the other kids were out playing.
Speaker 1: Now, 165th would put you in the south suburbs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you'd be out--you'd be pretty far out, you know.  I don't know if you--
Speaker 2: I could be wrong--
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because--
Speaker 1: You think it--
Speaker 2: --maybe--
Speaker 1: --might, might be 65th [Street] instead of 165th?
Speaker 2: Maybe--yeah, maybe it was sixty--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was 65th, that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: 65th would--yeah 'cause 165th would take, take you outside the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know--
Speaker 2: 65th.
Speaker 1: --65th street, that'd put, put you in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], really.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, which sounds like, you know, about where black folks were staying then maybe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or part of--some of them, anyway.
Story_ID: 486228
Speaker 1: And my [maternal] great-great-grandmother [Emma Ely], she had seven kids and her son died in a fire.  I think she had about four of her kids died before they reached adulthood.  Excuse me.  And I also learned that she had uterine cancer when she was very young and she was able to survive that.  And she--even though she was a educated woman, she worked as a domestic.  That was the only type of job she could find in Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Now, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did she--what kind of education does she have?
Speaker 1: She had a--she had gone to college.
Speaker 2: Okay, in, in Mississippi?
Speaker 1: In, in Mississippi, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you know which one?
Speaker 1: I, I don't.  I, I know that my--I had a uncle that went to Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College].  Is that in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's in, in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and right next to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: See, I was wondering if Mississippi, if she was in the part where Rust College [Holly Springs, Mississippi] was at--that's in northern Mississippi in Holly Springs [Mississippi] or--
Speaker 1: I've heard of Rust College.  I've heard of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, there are several places she could have gone, I guess, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, okay, so it doesn't come down which one she went to.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486229
Speaker 1: So on your mother's [Frances Sledge Dixon] side of the family, your mother came to Chicago [Illinois] with--I mean, her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually--
Speaker 1: Her mother came up--
Speaker 2: Yeah, her mother--
Speaker 1: --to Chicago.
Speaker 2: --came up when she was very young.
Speaker 1: And that--would that be like around the turn of the century or?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did she have any--did she ever talk about the riot in Chicago in 1919 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  They--both my grandmother [Josephine Sledge] and grandfather [Roy Sledge] talked about the riot, and my mother.  There was a, a, a great riot in the thirt- you talk--are you meaning the one in the '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 1: No, 1919 was the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That--well, both--any, any of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was the one I was referring to because it was back towards the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know--
Speaker 1: --your grandmother was growing up.
Speaker 2: --I haven't heard those stories about that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I heard about the one in the--in, in, in the '30s [1930s], 1937 I think it was--
Speaker 1: What, what happened?
Speaker 2: --that they had the great riot where a lot of people, you know, black and white were killed.  I can't remember exactly what lead to it, but I just, you know, remember hearing stories about that riot.
Story_ID: 486230
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] talk about growing up and what it was like for her?  What, what neighborhood did she come up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she moved between Chicago [Illinois] and St. Paul, Minnesota, and she started playing piano when she was five years old.  And by seven years old, she was playing concerts.  She was a child prodigy as playing the classical piano.  And it was something, her grandmother had always wanted to play piano, but she never had the opportunity, so she was determined that her daughter was gonna be a famous pianist.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was a child prodigy on the piano, okay.  You know, that's a--okay, and so she played--did she, she do concerts--
Speaker 2: She was doing concerts at seven years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: How far did she range?  Did she--did she do them outside of Illinois or, or Minnesota (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I think she just did them in, in Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, local.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I--you know, my, my mother tells me a lot of stori- had told me a lot of stories about how difficult it was when she would have a--how difficult it was for her mother [Josephine Sledge] to find a really good piano teacher to teach her.
Story_ID: 486231
Speaker 1: Because my [maternal] grandmother [Josephine Sledge] passed for white.  You know, everybody thought she was white.  Matter of fact, she worked for thirty-five years at a restaurant in Chicago [Illinois] passing as white.  And I remember one time when we were pretty small, we were walking downtown with her in Chicago and my mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] and she saw some, some people that she knew from her job and she told us to walk ahead of us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, the people at work thought she was white actually.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That, that would create some dramas I guess from time to time, I guess, you know, with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, any other stories about, about her?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she talked a lot about boarding school.  You know, she went to boarding school in Mississippi.  That's where she met her husband, my grandfather, Roy Sledge, at boarding school.
Speaker 2: Was this Piney Woods by any chance?  Piney Woods Country Life School [Piney Woods, Mississippi]?  That was a--
Speaker 1: I don't--
Speaker 2: I know that was a popular boarding school for black children--
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: --in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: It could possibly have been.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Let me see, any other stories that she told.  I can't think--I can't think of any, any right now.  Well, you know, they, they talked about the--Mariah, you know, who was the slave mother and, you know, that she was just--she was a little black bow-legged woman, you know.  That's, that's just kind of, you know, something that--picture that stays in my mind about her.
Story_ID: 486232
Speaker 1: But, I--you know, I can't recall any other stories, you know. She [Dixon's maternal grandmother, Josephine Sledge] just talked about--and her husband was an alcoholic and so that's why she sent her daughter [Frances Sledge Dixon] to, to St. Paul, Minnesota, and he finally recovered and at thirty-two years old, he, you know, stopped drinking alcohol and went to work for the post office and that's where retire- where he retired.
Speaker 2: This is your--
Speaker 1: Roy Sledge.  That was my grandfather--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --on my mother's side, my mother's father.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  He retired from the post office, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now did, did he go to college?  Did he--
Speaker 1: No, he didn't.  He didn't go to college.  He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But--
Speaker 1: He also--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was a, a porter.  He worked as a porter on the train.
Speaker 2: So, those are pretty good jobs.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah it was.
Speaker 2: In those days, those are--those are great jobs and he, he, he went to the boarding school, too, you said?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It sounds a lot like Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  I hate to put words in your mouth, but it--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --sounds like that's what the--
Speaker 1: --that sounds--
Speaker 2: --what it is.
Speaker 1: --really familiar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Piney Woods Country Life School.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Still going on Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And they've been on 'Oprah Winfrey Show' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'].  I think Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] went at one point to Piney Woods but it was a--
Speaker 1: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 2: It was a school set up for black kids that otherwise would not have a school to go to and they would--could send--you could send your kids there and they would--you know, they'd have to work like Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] or something, but they were, you know--they would stay, stay there and work.  It was co-educational funded by, you know, one of the charities.  So, that sounds like it might be it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I can't think of any other place in Mississippi where that was possible to do outside of college, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yeah.
Speaker 2: If you're in college of something else, but just as a boarding school or high school, right, grade school and high school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it, it would be Piney Woods more than likely.
Story_ID: 486233
Speaker 1: Where did your mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] go to high school in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She went to DuSable--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --High School [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, DuSable, that was--that would be the one.  And did she go on to college or--herself or?
Speaker 2: She went to teachers college.  She didn't finish.  She was a year short.  She graduated from high school when she was fifteen and then she went to teachers college and then she got married--
Speaker 1: In, in Chicago (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and started having kids.  Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Probably Chicago Teachers College.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is now Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 486234
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's full name was Elmer James Dixon, II [Elmer Dixon, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Now, who was the first--the first, I guess, was his father (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he--what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was August 13, 1921 in Henderson, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's, what's the story of the ancestors on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, the--to start off with, first of all, his father's father left Ch- left Henderson, Kentucky, right after or right before his father [Elmer Dixon, Sr.] was born and moved to St. Louis [Missouri] and never had contact with him again.  He started a--in St. Louis, he started another family of Dixons who--and he became a millionaire.  So--
Speaker 1: So your, your, your--this is your grandfather's father (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Father, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And his, his wife had, you know, written many let- many letters to his real father in St. Louis to try to get him to acknowledge his son, but he never responded.
Speaker 1: Now, now what did he become a millionaire doing?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  I do not know.
Speaker 1: Or do you think it might just be that he was rich but we don't really know if he was a millionaire or not?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I don't know.  I just heard that he was a millionaire.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what my grandmother [Mildred West Dixon] told me, that he was a millionaire (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But in, in St. Louis, did, did they say what he did for a living at all?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess, you, you can become a millionaire without disclosing that, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was in St. Louis and he's doing well, we know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he didn't--he never really got back in touch with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never acknowledged his son.
Story_ID: 486235
Speaker 1: Then on my--on his, his wife's side, Mildred's [Mildred West Dixon], side was a little different story.  It was my grandmother, Mildred Dixon, from all the stories and all I've heard came from a really big, proud family, and my mother's grandmother [Amanda Brooks] had her thumb cut off by the slave master 'cause she would not have sex with him.
Speaker 2: Okay, now this is--wait a minute, now this is your, your--
Speaker 1: My--on my father's [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So, his, his, his grandmother's mother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this would be your--okay.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, let me see.  His mother's grandmother.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: --a great-grandmother then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, great--great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So his--her thumb was cut off because she wouldn't have--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she wouldn't have--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --sex with the slave master.  And her husband [Richard Brooks] and her husband's brother went off and joined the Union Army and were some of the first slaves to sign up to fight in the Civil War.  And after the Civil War from what the story goes, a slave master walked off the plantation and left everything and, and their family got it.  My grandmother had almost all the furniture at her house in Chicago [Illinois] up until about ten years ago.
Speaker 2: This is furniture from the plantation from--
Speaker 1: Slave master's furniture, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah, I remember--I remember all the furniture.
Speaker 2: What did it look like to you?
Speaker 1: It was, you know, that oak and had the marble tops and, you know, had these little secret drawers. And dressers and rocking chairs.  There were two rocking chairs that had leather backs to them.  And I was supposed to get one of those rocking chairs (laughter), but didn't happen.
Speaker 2: So, they go all the way back.  Now, these relatives were the Cooks, right?  Were these the--were these the Cooks on that side?
Speaker 1: Brooks.
Speaker 2: Brooks, Brooks.
Speaker 1: Brooks.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Brooks.  I got it mixed up.  Brooks, all right.  And--okay.  So they fought in the Civil War, came back--
Speaker 1: Got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) master left the land.
Speaker 1: Got forty acres.
Speaker 2: Got--okay.
Speaker 1: And the master left the plantation, so they got the plantation.  And the town was, was, was--they named--they, they turned it into a town called Brooksville [sic. Brookstown, Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Now, this is quite a story for anybody who's trying to track down the history of blacks during Reconstruction 'cause rare did we get any land after the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But these brothers got the land and actually had a town named after them right outside of Henderson, Kentucky, so that's, that's interesting.  Somebody watching this tape later on should probably, you know, if inclined, do some research, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we--you know, the, the, the relatives on the Brooks side, they, they have all of that historical information.  As a matter of fact, somebody from the Brooks family married into Oprah Winfrey's family.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So, somebody, you know--Oprah's related to one of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So, that's an interesting history there.
Story_ID: 486236
Speaker 1: Henderson, Kentucky is like near the Ohio River? We--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, that's where--we were listening to your mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] on the phone a little while ago explaining it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's near the Ohio River near where Illinois and Ohio and Kentucky all come together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know--I mean, and the, the Ohio River and Kentucky come together.  So, that's western Kentucky.  So, now, is there a, a story about how the--now your, your grandfather [Elmer Dixon, Sr.] was actually born in Henderson, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And was, was he raised in, in, in Brookstown [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: No, my father's father, he was raised in Henderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, okay, but not in--okay.  And, now, at some point he moves to Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when he met Mildred [Mildred West Dixon] in Henderson, they moved to Chicago.  That must've been 1918, 1919, around then.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a reason why they moved to Chicago?  I mean, it may seem obvious, but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: People want to go to Chicago, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But is there a reason that the family gives for them moving to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I kind of think he probably was trying to get, get away from his past and probably wanted to--felt that he could take care of his family better in Chicago 'cause he never allowed his wife to work.  His wife never worked, Mildred, she never worked a job.  She was a, a--stayed home and took care of the family and became very actively involved in the--in The Woodlawn Organization [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--okay, so--now, did--are there are any stories on this side of the family about the Chicago riot in 1919?  So, he comes up about 1918 or '19 [1919], so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I've, I've never heard of those.  I've never heard it, but I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that was the worst Chicago riot and, and so--
Speaker 2: I don't--I never heard of that one either.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the worst--
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: --absolute worst one that's been written about--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --I don't know, a lot, and so people--so we do have like some stories from, from people who were there that talk about it, you know.
Story_ID: 486237
Speaker 1: Okay, so Mildred [Mildred West Dixon] became involved in the--and this is your, your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She became involved in TWO [The Woodlawn Organization, Chicago, Illinois]
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did she talk about how she got involved in, in TWO or?
Speaker 2: I think a lot of it had to do with all of the young men that were going off to the war [World War II, WWII] and a lot of it was to support them because a lot of them went to Mississippi, which turned out to be a war within itself.  And, you know, my, my father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] had a--really a bad, bad experience in, in Mississippi when he joined the [U.S.] Army, him and his fellow Chicagoans.  And, you know, it, it--things were so bad, they ended up rioting.  They had a riot that lasted for three days and my father's life had been threatened numerous times.  And he had written his mother correspondence to about what was happening, and she wrote Eleanor Roosevelt and asked Eleanor Roosevelt to intervene in what was taking place in Mississippi.  And at some point, my father and his unit were all shipped out of Mississippi and before they were sent to the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know the obvious question here is like what, what, what camp were they, they in and--
Speaker 2: I wish I knew that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I could--I could probably find out.  My mother [Frances Sledge Dixon], you know, she probably knows.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that--I mean, there, there have been stories before about--I mean, a lot of things went down in the Army in those days that didn't get--
Speaker 2: Yeah,
Speaker 1: --widely circulated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so it's a--sounds like another one that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just punctuates an already awful experience for black soldiers.
Story_ID: 486238
Speaker 1: So your father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.], he went to World War II [WWII] and he--did he go overseas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to Jap- he fought in the Pacific Theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So he was out in the Pacific.  Did, did he spend any time in Okinawa or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in the Battle of Okinawa.  He was in Luzon [Battle of Luzon] in the Philippines.  He, he--there's a story he tells about--in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan] where he saw a [U.S.] Marine cut off the breast of a Japanese woman and he, he--you know, he was holding the breast up on the--on the bayonet, and my father tried to load his machine gun and try to shoot him, but he was stopped by his fellow comrades.  I think it was at that point where he just, you know--he was--he was about through after that, yeah.
Speaker 1: There's some tough experiences over there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did he achieve any significant rank over there in the--in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  I, I know that he--you know, some of the stories that I heard about the--you know, a lot of, you know--and, and one of the battles almost everybody in his--in his platoon or company was killed except for him and that he, he did get some medals and awards.  He came back with, with two samurai swords and Japanese machine--a machine pistol and sniper rifles and, and, you know, a lot of stuff like that.  And so in order to get a--to--you know, to get one of those samurai swords, you know, you had to take some risks and some chances to do that.  So, from what I understand, you know, he, he was--he was--he fought in a lot of battles.  You know--
Speaker 1: Now, that's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) he fought in a lot of battles.
Speaker 1: --that's significant, too, because a lot of black soldiers were placed in Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --ended up having to do like a lot of cleanup duty and building stuff and cleaning up after stuff and that's one thing that didn't necessarily--though some got in battles, it wasn't like a--the U.S. policy was to keep them away from battles--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the most part and let them do the so-called dirty work kind of stuff, yeah.  So, did--was he in the Quartermaster Corps or did he--what, what, what kind of unit was he in, do you know?
Speaker 2: He was in the 7th Cavalry [7th Cavalry Regiment].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  In the old days, it used to mean you had a horse, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --they were like truckers or something or they--where they--where they--what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I think they were infantry.
Speaker 1: Infantry?
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from the war [World War II, WWII]?

And so when she went to the party, she met him and, and, you know, they started dating and see- seeing each other and, you know, one thing lead to another.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so--now, when were they married?
Speaker 2: They were married--let me see, my oldest sister [Joanne Dixon Harris] was born in '47 [1947], so they must've been married in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay, now, now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers [Elmer Dixon III and Michael Dixon] and one sister.
Story_ID: 486240
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I think my father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.].  I think I take after my father the most.  Even though I look more like my mother [Frances Sledge Dixon], I think I take after my father the most.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: He was--he was a, a--he was a artist.  He, he--really, he was a true artist.  Not only was he a, a artist that liked to paint and, and do sculptures, but he also liked to write.  He was a--he was a poet.  He wrote poems.  He wrote really beautiful poems and--which is something that I really started doing when I was in high school [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] was writing and writing a lot of poetry and doing poetry readings and those types of things.  And he was very passionate about, about things, you know, things that he believed in and, and I--I'm, I'm the same way as well.  So, that's why I think I take after him the most.
Story_ID: 486241
Speaker 1: Now, what did he [Dixon's father, Elmer Dixon, Jr.] do for a living?  Did he get a chance to do art for a living or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he didn't.  He, he worked as a technical illustrator, which was--you know, it was--I guess you could say it was--it was art in a--in a way, but it was a--it was technical art and was working for--he worked at Chanute Air Force Base [Champaign County, Illinois].  I'm not quite sure who he's worked for down there.  He did some work on some military planes and then he came and worked for Boeing [The Boeing Company].  And I've talked with some of the other people that he worked with at Boeing and they said that he was the best artist out there at Boeing.  He would try to paint on weekends.  He would try to--you know, he would get out his easel and he would--he would--he would work on some artwork during the weekends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he worked in--at Chanute in--that's outside of Champaign [Illinois], right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Champaign, yes.
Speaker 1: --Illinois.  And then from Boeing here in Seattle [Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, that's, that's a pretty--that seemed like a pretty good living.
Story_ID: 486242
Speaker 1: You were born in Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't stay there long, right?
Speaker 2: No.  We, we went to Champaign [Illinois].  We moved to Champaign and then from Champaign, we moved to Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] attend the Art Institute in Chicago [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He graduated from the Chicago Art Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  About what year do you think?
Speaker 2: It had to be after he came back from the war [World War II, WWII], so it must've been '46 [1946], '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, no I'm sorry.  It probably was more like--yeah, yeah, I'd say probably around '47 [1947], '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  This is before you were born.
Story_ID: 486243
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I do.  I remember living in Champaign [Illinois] in Burch Village.  I--well, actually I remember living on Langley Street [sic. Langley Avenue] in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where we stayed with our aunt.  Yeah, I just remembered.  They had one of those couches that you--you know, fold-out couch and, you know, we were--I, I just remember and we were--all of us were crammed into this small place and--
Speaker 1: So you were on Langley.  You know about what, what the cross street was, what, what number street it was?
Speaker 2: I have to ask my mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Langley right off of Cottage Grove [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: Yes, Cottage--
Speaker 1: Right around Cottage Grove and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cottage Grove.  Lang- yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You don't know--
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't know the cross street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to ask my mother (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 486244
Speaker 1: So, then I remember growing up in Burch Village [Champaign, Illinois] and I, I remember Burch Village was--I don't know if it was considered a projects at that time, but it was a former military barracks and there were predominantly black families that lived in there, and it was really--it was such a great sense of family and community livi- living in Burch Village.  You know, it just--everybody knew each other and, you know, we as little kids, we were, you know, four or five years old.  You know, we could walk all over the village and, you know, we--our parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] wouldn't worry about anything happening to us.  And I just really remember that--just that really strong sense of security that existed, you know, living in Burch Village in Champaign, Illinois.
Speaker 2: This was mostly black neighborhood?
Speaker 1: It was all black.
Speaker 2: All black, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  And I remember going to Washington Elementary School [Booker T. Washington Elementary School] in Champaign.  And I remember the Burch Village Cats [ph.] which was, I guess you could call a gang and the Alley Cats [ph.] and them fighting each other.  And I remember--
Speaker 2: The Burch Village Cats, huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: And another group called the Alley Cats (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Alley Cats, yeah (laughter).  I remember, you know, not really being enthusiastic about getting to the age where I could join the Burch Village Cats (laughter), yeah.  And I was really angry at my parents when we moved away.  I was angry for many years, you know, of, you know, being pulled away from that safe environment and, and not being able to go up to Chicago [Illinois] every summer and on holidays to visit my grandparents and have Thanksgiving dinners and those types of things.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you really enjoyed all that and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486245
Speaker 1: And you were in Champaign [Illinois] until you were about eight?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then, then your family moved to Seattle [Washington] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --which--okay.  Well, tell me this.  Since you grew up in both places, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in both places?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights, I rem- in Champaign, I remember, you know, mothers wringing a chicken's neck so they could pluck it and prepare it for dinner.
Speaker 1: So you had live chickens running around Burch Village [Champaign, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  There was some families that have live chickens.  I remember the--how hot it was and the mosquitoes, and the sounds of jazz, my parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.], you know, listening to jazz and dancing and going out and dancing.  I remember, you know, walking to the store at five years old to get my mother a pack of cigarettes, Pall Mall cigarettes, driving to Chicago [Illinois], up to Chicago to see my grandparents, spending time in Chicago with--at my grandmother's house.
Story_ID: 486246
Speaker 1: I remember brushing my [maternal] great-great-grandmother's [Emma Ely] hair.  She had long black-gray hair and I remember being very close to her and I was her favorite grandchild because I reminded her of, of her son that had died when he was very young.  I just remember having really a strong relationship with my great-great-grandmother.  Even though she was ninety-two years old and I was seven years old, I just remember having a really strong connection to her, you know, and just being really very inquisitive about her wrinkles and her long gray hair and, you know, wondering what she had been through in her life.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know, very few people get a chance to know their great-great-grandmother and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I was very fortunate, very fortunate to have that experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did she tell you anything that you remember now that, that--
Speaker 1: Just, just--you know, just vaguely little things.  You know, most of the things were about what to do and what not to do, you know, and how to behave properly and, you know, those types of things.  And, you know, she always used to tell me about, (clears throat) you know, how important it was to, you know, respect your mother and be nice to your mother and treat your mother--you know, look out for your mother and those types of things.
Story_ID: 486247
Speaker 1: What about Seattle [Washington]?  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of Seattle?  Now, you moved into a specific neighborhood here, right?  The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well I--
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: It was the Central Area [Seattle, Washington].  The, the first thing that I remember about coming to Seattle (laughter) was when we went across the floating bridge my mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] started crying and, and then seeing Mount Rainier and my father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] would--he nicknamed Mount Rainier sugar lump 'cause it looked like a lump of sugar.  And the, you know, the, the neighborhood, the first neighborhood that we moved in, there's one thing that I remember that really stuck with me is that somebody knocked on our door one rainy Sunday evening and we must've been about eight or nine years old and it was a homeless man and he was knocking on the door and he wanted something to eat, and my parents invited him in and cooked him a meal and fed him and then packed a, a meal for him to take with him.  And I just remember, remember that kindness of my parents and, and how they shared what they had, you know, with this guy that they didn't even know, you know, from Adam, and so I just remember that.  And, you know, I remember my mother's cooking and the smell of, of, of--and actually right now I'm thinking about (laughter) those--the kidney beans and the kidneys my grandmother used to cook in Chicago [Illinois], you know, that smell of the kidneys and kid- and, and kidney beans.  You tell people now about eating kidneys (laughter), they don't--they don't have any idea about that.  So, I, I--you know, I, I do remember that about the smell.  I remember that about Chicago.  In Seattle, let me see, just--you know, just growing up and what Seattle was like at that time.
Story_ID: 486248
Speaker 1: My father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] was really--he's--he was an adventurer.  He liked new adventurous things.  And to him, this was an adventure, you know, moving two thousand miles away from where he grew up, you know, to this strange place that was, you know, majority whites.  And he befriended all types of people.  My father loved all types of people.  I remember one of the first people that he befriended was this old--was this Russian guy, this old Russian immigrant, and became very good friends together and they used to drink vodka together.  And, you know, I just remember my father just when he looked at people, he didn't look at them in terms of what color their skin--they were, you know, he just looked at them as human beings, you know.
Story_ID: 486249
Speaker 1: And so I just--I just remember those things.  And, you know, the, the first place we, we moved to was, was pretty rundown place because my parents were, you know, trying to get off the ground in Chicago [Illinois]--I mean in Seattle [Washington].  Then, we moved into a, a, a house that they rented and eventually, you know, we bought a house and, you know, I just remember how proud my father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] was of, of buying that house.  And, you know, he--
Speaker 2: Was, was that also in the CD [Central Area, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 1: It was in the central areas. An area known as Madrona [Seattle, Washington], Madrona neighborhood, which now the houses go for a million dollars in that neighborhood.  My mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] still lives in the house that we bought in 1962.
Story_ID: 486250
Speaker 1: And then as my father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] continued to work at Boeing [The Boeing Company], he started hanging around with--he met some artists and leftists, back then they called them beatniks.  But, you know, they were people who were artistic and who were outspoken in their views of what the government was doing, and so my father became friends with, with a, a lot of these people.  And, you know, they were Jewish, Greek, and, you know, the--most of those friends that he had in that artistic group, I don't think any of them were, were black.  They were all Jewish and Greek and Italians.  And, and then--you know, he had black friends but, you know, black friend--his black friends weren't part of this other group.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is the coffee house set that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --read poetry and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --snapped fingers and stuff when they--
Speaker 1: And actually what they did was they had a, a ethnic dance thing where they went to each--every week or every other week, they went to somebody's house and they learned ethnic dance.  And I just remember them coming to our house and, you know--you know, my mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] would fix wine and cheese and finger foods and they would, you know, learn how to do Greek dance and, and other ethnic dances.  And, you know, my father became real good friends with this Jewish family called the Sussmans and we actually were invited to their house during Passover and we--you know, we celebrated Passover with them, ate matzo balls and all those types of things.  So, that, that was--that was, you know, the introduction of, of diversity that my father, you know, brought to, to our family.
Story_ID: 486251
Speaker 1: I read in the material, your father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] actually was a member of the Communist Party at a certain point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, when did that happen?  Did that happen in Chicago [Illinois] or after he got out here or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in--that was before we were born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he--and I guess it must've been right after he came back from World War II [WWII] and he was part of Paul Robeson's youth security squad at Soldier Field [Chicago, Illinois].  And, so I, I remember the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] coming to our house in Champaign, Illinois, to question my father and he wouldn't let them in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your father have any--ever share with you any observations about Paul Robeson or stories about him?
Speaker 2: You know, he didn't.  He, he, he didn't.  But we listened to Paul Robeson all the time.  You know, he played his music all the time.  But, you know, I--my father passed away in '83 [1983], and so I never really got an opportunity to--you know, when, when you're--when you get older and your parents get older, the relationship starts to change and then you have an opportunity, you know, to--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I just--my, my father died before I had a chance to really ask him a lot of those types of questions.  But I just remember that Paul Robeson, you know, being a early part of our family history, you know, his, his record, his music, and all those things.
Speaker 1: What, what were some of the songs that--do you remember?  I mean, what, what comes to mind, you know, the Robeson music?
Speaker 2: There's so many.  'Ol' Man River,' 'Ol' Man River.'  Just can't think of any right now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I remember they used to play 'Joe Hill' is one of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --big hits and--yeah.  Now, was he ever a part of the--what did they call it?  The--oh, I can't think of the name.  I'll--when I think of the name, I'll ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a group in Chicago and they're like old--they're like a old group of--a lot of old people, mostly old white people, Jewish people and there's some blacks in it too that have a root that goes way back to the Paul Robeson days, the Communist Party, and then they had a, a National Alliance Against Racist Repression [sic. National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression], I think, like it's National Alliance, it's called.  But I--you know, I've seen their meetings and they, they do, they play a lot of Paul Robeson.  They have very, you know, direct links to whatever Robeson was doing in those days.  Yeah, National Alliance Against Racial Oppression, I think is what it is, yeah.  Anyway, so, so did you--so, had, had--was he still involved in Communist Party when he got to Seattle [Washington] or was he not--
Speaker 2: No, no, he wasn't.  He wasn't involved.  You know, some of the--I think some of the--those people that he hung out with had--probably had been involved in the Communist Party in, in, in some loose form.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Out here, but not as a formal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause I know a lot of people in the Communist Party caught a lot of grief when the government, you know, when they started investigating (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it wasn't a good idea to say you were in it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if--even if you were--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You know, after a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that probably had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: Though it cooled off a little bit after '54 [1954] when McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] got in trouble, but still was not the health--the healthiest thing to say you were in.
Story_ID: 486252
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear any of your father's [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] poems or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He wrote a poem about Emmett Till.  That was really, really beautiful poem.  My mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] still has that poem.  And I, I had that poem memorized for a long time.  I can--I know the--about the first few lines.  Deep in the heart of--deep in the heart of Mississippi where the cotton blooms in June, an old black man till--tills his farm singing a sad, sad tune.  And then he goes on and talks about Emmett Till.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were very young when Emmett Till was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was '56 [sic. 1955].
Speaker 1: --was killed.  Yeah, you were like six years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Five or six.  And do you have any, any memory of people talking about that then?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I don't.  I, I don't remember anything about that at that particular time.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I was too young.
Speaker 1: But did your family in general talk about the Civil Rights Movement, you know, a lot or you think--you think as much as other families or not as much or?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  They, they--you know, they talked about it.  You know, they talked about it, not in great detail.  It wasn't until we got older.  As we got a little bit older, then, you know, they started talking about it.  And, you know, we would have discussions in the kitchen.  That's where all the discussions took place, in the kitchen.  And, you know, I think our, our, our--my father, our parents were trying to shield us as well from, from a lot of the real negative things that were taking place.  You know, one of the things that I do remember is that--is the reaction to certain things like, you know, they used to have the Friday night fights and it seemed like those Friday night fights it was always a black fighter and a white fighter, and invariably, the black fighter would always lose even though he, he actually won the fight.  You know, the decisions were always given to the white fighter.  I, I remember my parents' reaction.  I remember my mother crying, you know, when--I can't remember who that was, who lost that fight.  It was about fifty--must've been around '58 [1958], '59 [1959] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those early days, I remember some of those fights.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We're the same age--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as we do this interview, but I remember Archie Moore lost to Rocky Marciano--
Speaker 2: Marciano, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on national TV.  Archie Moore is much older--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and probably shouldn't have been fighting at the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Joe Louis, the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He tried to make a comeback.  I think that was much earlier, though, and lost--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --lost to Marciano, too, just couldn't--didn't have the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then we had like Floyd Patterson and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, the fight- fighters that I remember were like middleweight and like lightweights, Emile Griffith.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Then before Emile Griffith, there were some, some fighters and there was Sugar Ray Robinson, and there's one on the tip of my tongue, I just can't--
Speaker 1: There's Kid Gavilan and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There was some other--
Speaker 2: Just can't think of it.  But, you know, I just remember, you know, my parents really being upset, you know, about, about how those fights came out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, it was just little things that I saw their response to, you know.  For example, when my mother tried to find a job, not being able to find one, my father coming home from work at Boeing [The Boeing Company], being very angry about something that happened on the job.  I remember one story where he came home and he said somebody--he was in traffic on the--on the road and somebody called him a nigger.  And my father had really a bad temper and he got out of his car.  He stopped his car and got out of his car and started throwing rocks at the--at the man.  And my father never allowed any weapon--he didn't have any weapons.  All those weapons he brought back from the war [World War II, WWII], he gave those away because he knew that he was the type of person that, you know, if somebody did something or anything like that, you know, he would just snap, so he, he never allowed any weapons around him or in the house at all.
Story_ID: 486253
Speaker 1: You were just saying that your father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] knew Buddy Young just for--just the sake of putting it out here, was a good friend of Buddy Young's.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Football pioneer and early black pro football player--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who played at Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, continuing the story, we--now, was--we were talking about television a little bit.  Did--was, was television a big thing in your household growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, our, our parents didn't let us watch a lot of television, but like, like we were talking about whenever a black person came on TV, you know, everybody came to the TV 'cause that was a big thing.  So, you know, if--whenever there was a black person on TV, we all came--excuse me, came around to watch TV.
Story_ID: 486254
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of music played in your home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was.  I've--my, my--both my parents were music lovers.  I'd say--even though my mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] was a pianist, my father [Elmer Dixon, Jr.] was the biggest music lover and he loved all kinds of music.  I mean, there were certain days certain music was being played.  You know, he loved opera and classical music, so we listened to a lot of operatic music, 'La Boheme' [Giacomo Puccini], 'Tales of Hoffmann,' ['The Tales of Hoffmann,' Jacques Offenbach] and, you know, Tchaikovsky [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] and Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven].  You know, we had a bust of Beethoven on our piano and everybody had to play a instrument in our family, so I played the violin and my brother played the trumpet and I had another brother that played the violin, my sister [Joanne Dixon Harris] played the piano, and my mother continued to play the piano at that time.  So, yeah, music was, was a big part of our family.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind why she, she stopped?  She was a prodigy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, did, did--is there a reason why she stopped playing or what, what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it, it was--it was--it was the same thing that--why a lot of kids who are pushed into something and are made to do this thing all the time at a very young age and when they get to the age that they're free, they don't want anything to do with it anymore.  So, that--that's what it was with my mother.  I mean, all through her childhood, you know, that's all she ever did was play the piano.  You know, her mother [Josephine Sledge] was determined that she was going to be a famous pianist.  And so--and her mother was very dominant, too, very controlling and very dominant.  And so when she, you know, left home, she just was tired of it.  She didn't wanna do it anymore.
Story_ID: 486255
Speaker 1: Now what were you interested in the most growing up?  What, what were you like?  What was your personality like?
Speaker 2: I was--I was a--I was kind of a, a quiet kid.  I was--I wasn't really outgoing, you know, like my other--my brother who was under me [Michael Dixon], he was very outgoing.  I wasn't very outgoing.  I was kind of a quiet, shy kid.  But I did like adventurous things.  I liked to do adventurous things, things that often times got me in trouble (laughter).  You know, I remember when we lived in Burch Village [Champaign, Illinois] and we were, must've been like five or six years old, we lived next door to a rock quarry in Burch Village.  And one day my brothers and I--and I, I, I lead them on this journey where we went around the fence into this rock quarry.  And, you know, you had these mountains of rocks and all types of gravel and stuff and tar, and we, we got--we got stuck in tar, you know.  We got stuck in some tar and we came home and our--you know, our mother [Frances Sledge Dixon] was really worried about us and we had tar all along our--I mean--I mean we could've died, you know, in that rock quarry, you know.  But--and then I remember in Champaign [Illinois] hanging around with these guys.  We used to--on the way home, we used to stop and go through this baseball field and there was a black caretaker and--who would--he would chase us every, every time we walked across the field, and so I just remember, you know, always taking this chance of getting chased and having to climb over the fence and barely making it.  So, that was the type of child I was.  Even though I was kind of quiet and shy, I liked to do dangerous, adventurous things, things that often times got me in trouble.  Also as I grew up, I was really--loved music.  You know, I loved all types of music.  And even though I, I wasn't really a good violinist.  I didn't really learn how to read music very well, so my parents cut me off from, from, from music.  And I remember being very sad about that, about not being able to take a instrument.  And in high school [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], I discovered writing.  You know, I discovered writing and started writing poetry, became really a good poet.  And I don't know if you ever heard of the Watts Writers Workshop?  I came out of the Watts Writers.  They were really some very dynamic writers.  But whenever they came to Seattle [Washington], they used to perform at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], and I was the only local poet that they asked to, to do readings with them.

Speaker 1: Now where did you start grade school?  You started in Champaign [Illinois], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, at--yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your--?
Speaker 2: Washington Elementary School [Booker T. Washington Elementary School, Champaign, Illinois]. Yes.
Speaker 1: Washington Elementary School.  Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Did I like school?  Yes and no.  I liked the--I liked school so that I could hang out with my friends and play basketball and get into trouble (laughter), but as far as the academic side, no, I didn't.  I didn't.  I didn't like it until I had a black teacher in high school [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] who was very old fashioned and really believed in bringing out the best in you.  She hardly ever smiled.  She really, really got me into, into reading novels and, and really writing.
Speaker 1: Now, is this in grade school, do you remember?
Speaker 2: This was--actually, this was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, in grade school, now, were all your teachers white at Washington or were there some black ones?
Speaker 2: I think most of my teachers, most of the teachers were white at Washington.  And when we came to Seattle [Washington], I had--there was--I remember one black teacher and I, I remember her as being one of the best teachers I ever had, Mrs. Green, 'cause she was another one of those old school, very strict, demanding teachers.
Speaker 1: To get a job, she probably had to be very, you know, extremely competent to get a job in an all-white system, I would imagine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was always immaculately dressed, too.  She was, you know, from that old school where you just always look your best.  You always put your best foot forward, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the grade school here in Seattle?
Speaker 2: That was Colman elementary school [Colman School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your attitude about--well, it didn't change until you got to high school, right?  And got--had teachers--
Speaker 2: Actually, you know, it really didn't change until I really got to college [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], actually.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school, even in grade school?
Speaker 2: History. History, yeah was always my favorite, history and geography.
Story_ID: 486257
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Well, the first high school I went to was Queen Anne High School [Seattle, Washington] and it--which was an all-white school.
Speaker 1: Queen Anne?
Speaker 2: Queen Anne.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when they instituted the voluntary busing program here in nineteen sixty--I'm saying it must've been 1964, 1963, actually, it was 1963, I was one of the first volunteers to--excuse me, volunteer for the--to integrate the schools, so that's how I ended up to this all-white school, Queen Anne (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was it, it called?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: Queen Anne.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you--
Speaker 2: Queen Anne.
Speaker 1: --started at another school.
Speaker 2: I started at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Denny-Blaine--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was an all-white school in Magnolia [Seattle, Washington].  That was a junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Denny-Blaine Junior High School [sic. David T. Denny Junior High School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then, then they instituted--okay.
Speaker 2: Then the--
Speaker 1: So, you started high school at the--at the school where they had--they initiated the busing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: The voluntary busing.
Speaker 2: Denny-Blaine, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, Queen, Queen Anne High School.  Okay, and this is a public school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --named, named Queen Anne.
Speaker 2: Queen Anne.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a reason why--is there a story behind the name?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I never thought about that name until just now when I told you about it.  I was thinking, said, Queen Anne, where did that come from (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, that's something for somebody to look at if they want to--yeah, that raises some curiosity here.  So, it's mostly a white school and is it outside of Seattle [Washington] or, or?
Speaker 2: No, it's, it's in, in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's in the city.  It's on Queen Anne Hill [Seattle, Washington].  It's on the top of Queen Anne Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's not a school anymore.  They turned it into condos.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and that's where you had the black teacher who, who taught you something about creative writing?
Speaker 2: No, that was at Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington].  Because what happened at Queen Anne, I was only there for one year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because the racism got so bad that I decided that, you know, this integration stuff wasn't, wasn't for me and I went--I, I transferred (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well what happened?
Speaker 2: --to Garfield.
Speaker 1: What did they do to you there?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very subtle.  It, it, it was mainly with the teachers because my grade point average--I always had at least a 2.5 grade point average.  At Queen Anne, my grade point average was a 1.5.  I was playing on the football team.  I was playing on the sophomore football.  That was the other thing I loved was sports.  I loved playing football.  And I went out for football at Queen Anne.  And I, I broke my hand--or I fractured or sprung my wrist and I was taking a typing class, and when I told, you know, the teacher that I had sprung my wrist playing football, she flunked me.  She gave me an E (laughter).  So, there was a lot of subtle stuff like that, but the thing that really broke the camel's back was Queen Anne ended up playing Garfield High School which was a predominantly black high school where all my friends went in the city championship and I sat on the Garfield side during the game, but it was one of those typical games back then where Garfield was ahead by three points, somehow there was a mysterious foul, more time was put on the clock, and Queen Anne ended up winning the game.  It was so obvious to everyone what had happened.  And after that game, the black, black students from Garfield High School just went on a rampage and, and, you know, fights broke out.  So when I went to school the next day, I got some of the dirtiest looks and people that I thought were my friends were no longer my friends.  And so at that point, I, I decided that, you know, hey, this is not the place for me to be, so I transferred back to Garfield.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] think about you transferring back?  Were they--were they for it or against it?
Speaker 2: I think they were for it.  They were for it.  They, they didn't try to stop me or anything because they dealt with it every day.  They dealt with that racism every day, much longer than I had dealt with it, so they understood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--were they the ones that initiated your--you going to, to Queen Anne in the first place or did--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was your idea?
Speaker 2: I did that myself, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, you know, it's, it's rare that somebody that young gets an idea that I'm gonna integrate a school and voluntarily--but, what inspired you to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my, my father's influence, you know, all the different races of people that came to our house and that became friends of our family.  And when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Seattle, I got a change to march with him when I was in junior high school, and that was something that I initiated.  You know, I was the only one in my family that was on this march with Martin Luther King, so that was something that I asked my parents about and was able to, to, to participate in.
Story_ID: 486258
Speaker 1: Did you have any--have any other mentors besides your parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Let me see, my grandfather.  You know, my--both my grandfathers, you know.  Yeah, both my grandfathers were, were my mentors.  And, you know, just the little things that they taught me, particularly my grandfather on my mother's side [Roy Sledge] who was a fastidious dresser.  He dressed really nice.  He wore a suit to work every single day.  And when he came home, you know, he went straight upstairs and changed his clothes and put his work clothes on and got his Bible and sat in a very quiet space and read his Bible.  But, you know, he, he taught us how to shine our shoes, the proper way to shine your shoes, the proper way to fold your pants when you take them off and just a lot of little very, you know, simple, important things that he taught us.  You know, and he very rarely smiled, you know.  He, he smiled when we did something that made him happy, but other than that, he really didn't smile very much.  My father's father [Elmer Dixon, Sr.] on the other hand was, was, was--he seemed to be a very happy-go-lucky person, you know, but, but deep down inside, the fact that his father had never acknowledged him, you know, I could--I--looking back, I could tell that, you know, he had a certain sadness about him.  And he drank.  You know, he drank when he came home from work every day, you know.  And when he eventually did retire, he, he pretty much drank himself to death.  But, you know, those were the other mentors that I had, you know, just really remembering them and the things that they taught me and the things that I learned from them.  The only other mentors that I can think of was, you know, some of the older guys in the neighborhood, you know, who were--you know, back then, you had these continuous layers and layers and layers of mentors.  You know, there were so many people in the neighborhood and the community that, you know, always taught--were teaching you different things and saying, you can't do this, you can't do that.  This is how you do it.  This is how you shouldn't do it, you know.  And--but my father was, was the main mentor in my life.
Story_ID: 486259
Speaker 1: Now, in high school, were you involved in, in high school activities and clubs and that sort of thing?  Or did you kind of stay to yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, besides playing football and intramural, I was on the debate team and that's something I really, really enjoyed.  That was--that was really the only high school activity outside of intramural sports that I participated in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The debate team, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting thing for a shy person to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to be in the debate team.  Now, what, what inspired you to get involved in the debate team?
Speaker 2: Well, I--you know, I, I wanted to be a lawyer.  I wanted to be a lawyer and, wow, this kind of--well, that's, that's a good question (laughter), why I wanted to join the debate team, somebody who was shy.  But I think I did like getting up and talking, you know, even though I was a little nervous sometimes.  I did like being able to get up and explain things and talk about things 'cause I did a lot--we did a lot of that at home when we, you know, had these discussions at our, you know, in, in the kitchen of our family home.
Story_ID: 486260
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually did.  You had, had, had real, real good discussions at home where you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you have to hold your ground and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you did.  And sometimes it would get a little heated (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, can you think of something that was really a controversial subject at home?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can--yeah, I can think of several things.  I, I remember telling my parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.]--and actually, this wasn't a debate, but I just blurted this out that I was gonna be a policeman.  I, I was about thirteen years old.
Speaker 1: That you weren't?  Were--
Speaker 2: That I was.
Speaker 1: Was.
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a policeman and my parents were so angry that--and they told me, you're not gonna be a policeman and we had this--I--you know, I, I really couldn't understand, you know, why they were so mad at me wanting to be a policeman, you know.  It took me a while to understand that.  Then when I was sixteen, I told my father I was gonna join the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and he got extremely mad and he told me, he said--he said, "No son of mine is gonna go over to that war [Vietnam War] and fight people who never called you a nigger."  And, so, he was very upset.  He was--he was very adamant that I was not gonna join the Marines because he had already experienced that.  And it--that's probably what kept me from going to Vietnam like a lot of my friends who eventually ended up dead going to Vietnam.
Story_ID: 486261
Speaker 1: How were your grades in high school?  Did you do pretty good after you got to go--went back to Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my grades were just average and I, I barely graduated.  You know, I, I, I--actually, my high school counselor called me in the office.  She was a black woman, Mrs. Woodson, and she called me in the office and she told me that I wasn't going to graduate and that--well, I told her I wanted to go to college.  She said, "Well, you're not college material" (laughter).  And when she told me that, that made me very, very angry 'cause that was something our, our parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] had always put into our heads, that we were going to go to college.  So, when she told me I wasn't going to college, it, it really lit a fire under me and so I--you know, I, I started doing my homework and I did graduate.  I graduated with a 2.5 [grade point average] and I did, you know, start--got a scholarship to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you got a scholarship?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To University of Washington.  That's right here in Seattle [Washington], right?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, what, what was that experience like?  You, you started in the fall of '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: No, actually I started in the winter of--actually, yeah, I did.  I started in the fall of '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was--it was a--it was really, probably one of the best feelings I ever had, you know, best feelings I ever had.  Because at that time, there were only a handful of black students on campus and I was a far, far better student in college than I was in high school.  And what made it even more special was the, the, the best teacher that I had in high school, when I walked into my English class at the UW, she was my English professor.
Speaker 1: Now, what's her name again?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mrs.--oh boy, gosh, her name.  How could I forget her name?
Speaker 1: Don't strain right now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --but she was the--she was at Garfield.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She was the one you were talking about at Garfield.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And here she is at University of Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it got--I mean, that's gotta be a good thing.  And she--so did you just kind of pick up where you left off with her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: And you said she encouraged you to write and to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and I, I really--I really started doing a lot of writing in, in college.  You know, I really started really writing a lot of poetry.  And I--actually, I got a scholarship from The Links [The Links, Incorporated], a creative writing scholarship from The Links Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, and was your--was, was your mother a member of Links or anybody (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, my mother was not the type of person that would be--join a organization like The Links.
Story_ID: 486262
Speaker 1: So University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  Now, in those days, I know on campuses all over the country, there are black student organizations being formed on campus.  Did, did that happen at the University of Washington when you were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it did.  I, I was a part of the organizing the first black student union at the University of Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how, how did that come about?  I mean, there, there are how many black students out of--
Speaker 2: About thirty.
Speaker 1: Thirty.
Speaker 2: Yeah, out of about twenty thousand students.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can you remember how, how you all initially came up with the idea for it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, we, we used to gather in the cafeteria, in the HUB [Husky Union Building, Seattle, Washington] and the cafeteria, and we had--you know, we would all gather for lunch and after our classes and, you know, just talking and dialoguing and seeing all the things that were going on all across the country and black student unions that were forming across the country and, you know, just kind of deciding that we were gonna start a black student union, you know, and the--we, you know, about what we were gonna do and the types of the things we were gonna do, and--
Speaker 1: Now, in those days, was the--was--did you call it black or Negro?  'Cause I know--
Speaker 2: No, it was black.  We were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were--
Speaker 1: 'Cause there were Negro groups--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --started in the--yeah.
Speaker 2: We were--yeah, yeah.  Well, I, I think--because that was the beginning of the--of the whole black thing, you know, so, it--no, I don't remember the word Negro at that time.  We were--had moved way past that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was organized as a black student organization.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Well, just the Black Student Union.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: You know, University of Washington Black Student Union.
Speaker 1: And who, who was the initiator of, of it?  Was there--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: --any one person or just--
Speaker 2: It was Larry--there was a lot of us but, you know, there was Carl Miller and [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett and Infanta Spence, and, you know, there, there were quite a few.  There was a--there was a--a documentary that's been produced about that organizing and that effort that is pretty good.  We used to bring Jimmy--he organized the Black Student Union at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California].  Jimmy--I can't remember his last name.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Garrett?
Speaker 2: Jimmy Garrett.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's it.  We used to bring him up here all the time.  And so he was--he played the key role in helping us bring things together and, and organizing.  And Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums].  We used to bring Ron Dellums up here.  He was--had just won the city council, Berkeley City Council seat.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  We are trying to complete an interview that we started last October.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Aaron Dixon, Aaron Lloyd Dixon, A-A-R-O-N, Lloyd, L-L-O-Y-D, Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is June the (laughter), June the 6th, 2008.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Seattle, Washington, on 8504 Wallingford Avenue North at Central House transitional housing program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your occupation?
Speaker 2: Executive director.
Story_ID: 486264
Speaker 1: We're finishing up an interview that we started in October and I think where we left off, we had you at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --and you were--from what I understand, you, I think [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett, and some other--
Speaker 2: Carl Miller.
Speaker 1: Yeah, your brother I think, Elmer [Elmer Dixon III], I think and others were in the process or organizing themselves as students, as black students at the University of Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I got Jimmy Garrett, Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] had something to do with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Helping you all organize.
Speaker 2: Actually, my brother, he wasn't--he wasn't actually--he wasn't part of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause he was still in high school.  But there were a lot of other people that were involved.  There were--it's Eddie Walker, Eddie Demmings.  There were a lot of students who had already been there for a year or maybe two and I was--had just came on campus, so I was probably the youngest of, of most of those people that I was working with in the BSU [Black Student Union].  Matter of fact, I was--I was I think the youngest person.  So, you know, we, we were--had been--you know, whenever you saw a black student on campus, you know, you immediately started talking and if you didn't know them, you got to know them.  We all met at the same place for lunch in the HUB [Husky Union Building, Seattle, Washington] every single day, you know, and we were--
Speaker 1: I just want to establish the date.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], I guess, right we're, we're talking about?
Speaker 2: This was--
Speaker 1: Or would this be later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1967.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  All right, go ahead.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And, so we would meet in, in the cafeteria in the HUB [Husky Union Building, Seattle, Washington] and through conversation and talking, we began to organize ourselves into a black student union organization.
Story_ID: 486265
Speaker 1: Did the call for an organization call from within the, the black student group [Black Student Union] itself or did--or did you--did somebody come from the outside and say, hey, you all have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --should have a black student union or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, it definitely was not from the outside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was from within.  It was from us and from our conversations that, that we began.  And there was a group of them who went down to the first West Coast Black Student Union Conference in Los Angeles [California].  I, I didn't go to that, but [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett and some of the other older members had gone down to that.  And a year later in '68 [1968], we went down to the second West Coast Black Student Union Conference in--at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when you all organized at the--at Washington, University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], then it was the first time there was a black student--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --organization on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any--how many black students were on campus?  Or, or--
Speaker 2: I think there were about--
Speaker 1: --what's the percentage?
Speaker 2: There were about thirty.  There were about thirty.
Speaker 1: About thirty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Out of how many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About thirty, thirty-five.
Speaker 1: --students?
Speaker 2: It was about maybe percentage wise, I guess you could say 1 percent, one, 2 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And what were the issues?  I mean, what--that you organized around?  I mean--now, these are the days when a lot of black student organizations are being formed, black professionals were organizing, the black police were organizing, black teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the black social workers, black psychologists--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black historians, you know, so, what issues did you--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --organize around and--
Speaker 2: I'm gonna try to remember if I can.  I think one of the main issues that we were organizing around was what was being taught and how it was being taught, and that there weren't really any black professors.  There might've been one black professor, Dr. Jones [ph.], but there weren't really any black professors that any of us had.  The curriculum and what they were teaching was really outdated and very colonial, and, you know, those really were the main issues that we really began to determine in our minds that we wanted to have a black studies program and where we wanted to have black professors and we wanted to be taught a curriculum that really was more relevant to African American history and who we were and what we were about.
Speaker 1: I think if I remember correctly, I've met Dr. Jones in Chicago [Illinois] when we came, the Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois], and introduced himself and he'd written some books (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about black history?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that the same one?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, same one.
Speaker 1: And he had a--an emphasis on classical history--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and blacks' participation in ancient Greece and Rome--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: I think that was what he--he, he was very conservative kind of guy, though.  I--not--I mean, that was my impression of him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But--so, was--did he relate well with the black students or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was he just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did.  He did.  He did, definitely.  Many of us, you know, were taking classes from him.
Speaker 1: But he was the only one in--
Speaker 2: He was--there--yeah, there was--there was one other, Mrs. Hundley, who I think you interviewed 'cause she--she's up north at Western at a school in Western, but she was my English teacher at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington].  And when I took English at the UW and I walked into the classroom, she was there as well, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, she--is she from Chicago--
Speaker 2: She just came.
Speaker 1: --originally or?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not sure where she's from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure where she's from, light--light-complected woman?
Speaker 1: No, that's not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --the same woman we're talking about.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Her name is now J.B., J.B. something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No, that's not--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's not her.
Story_ID: 486266
Speaker 1: How was the response from the students [at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington]?  Did just a few students get involved or was there a, a--
Speaker 2: No, I'd say most, most of the students got involved.  Most of the students on campus got involved because we were--you know, we were a very small group, so we would naturally--you know, most of us band together.  Most of us were interested and, and concerned about, you know, the issues on campus.
Speaker 1: Was it--was it hard for black students to stay in the student population in those days?  I mean, were they flunking out faster than the white students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --or were they--
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  You know, most of the students, you know, were pretty serious about school.  Now, I came in on a special program with about, I think it may be four other students were part of this Urban League [National Urban League] program to get minority students to come on campus and we got scholarships and everything.  Now, I was the only one out of that group that stayed in school after the first year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the Urban League in Seattle [Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, Seattle, Washington] seems to be pretty active, you know.  I've--
Speaker 2: Back then, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think they--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, back then they were--they were very active.
Story_ID: 486267
Speaker 1: What was the first big issue and how was it resolved, you know, I mean with the campus administration?  Or, or was there a big issue with the campus administration?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the big issue was the need to have a black studies program at the U [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] and the need to have a relevant curriculum for us.  And, so we met with the president of the school, Odegaard [Charles Odegaard] and gave him our demands, and when he didn't act on it, we occupied the building and his, his office and we actually took, took the building over.  We took the building over.
Story_ID: 486268
Speaker 1: Now, by this time, when we did this, I was a member of the Black Panther Party and there--this was a year later and--
Speaker 2: Would this be like '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: This would be--yeah, '68 [1968], and there were--
Speaker 2: Well maybe I--we, we should--I should go back and, and have you--how, how you became a member of the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, just, just tell us about that first, how, how you--you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I know a lot of people were exposed to it at a certain point, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --not everybody was in it.
Speaker 1: So, I'll ba- go back.  So, one of the first things we did in the BSU [Black Student Union] was we organized a BSU on some of the high school campuses.  And one of the high schools that we were doing some organizing on was Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington].  And there were a number of issues at Franklin that we were looking at.  One of the issues was that they had large Asian and African American population, but they had no administrators of color and only one teacher of color.  But there was an incident that lead us to, to move on that school.  There was a black student who had been kicked out of school for fighting a white student and nothing happened to the white student, but the black student was suspended from school.  So, we organized ourselves into a contingent, maybe about thirty, thirty of us, went to Franklin High School and we marched on the principal's office (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --to demand--
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: --that they let the other student in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did you--did you organize yourselves as a black student union from Washington--I mean, from, from, from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] or were you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were-
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: We were organized contingent from the University of Washington as the Black Student Union.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we also were joined by black students from Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] that we had organized and some of the black students at Franklin High School that we had organized.  So, we all went together to march on Franklin High School.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, when you marched over there, did you demand to see the principal or the superintendent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we--
Speaker 2: --of the schools or?
Speaker 1: We demand--we had--we had tried to talk with the principal before.  We had tried to arrange some, some meetings with him.  He refused to meet with us.  So, we decided that, you know, we had to take some action.  So, we just marched on, on the school and we went into the--to the office and then we eventually went into the principal's office.  And, you know, there was about thirty or forty of us yelling our slogans.  You're from those days.  You remember the picture.  We were yelling ungawa, black power, and, and all the other slogans that were part of the day.  We were all young and enthusiastic and idealistic, and we took, took the office over.  And so what the principal did was he excused his staff from the building.  All the teachers, all the administrators were told to leave the building.  And so we--actually, what we had done, we had forced him out of his office, forced him out of their office and, and they, they left the building to us, to the black students.  And we, we had a victory.  We felt--we felt that was a victory and felt really very powerful, very empowering at that time.  And we--I remember us going into the auditorium and having a big rally in the auditorium lead by [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett and Carl Miller and just, you know, talking about what we were gonna be doing and, and just feeling really very good about what we had done.  So, that was really one of the first things that we had done as the BSU.
Story_ID: 486269
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the upshot of that?  Did they--did--were any of the reforms that you suggested implemented or did the--did things go back the way they used to be or what happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did let the--let the black student back in.  That was--that was the, the upstart.  The down part of that was that a year later, the five of us were arrested, [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett, Carl Miller, myself, my brother, Elmer [Elmer Dixon III], Anthony Ware from, from Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], we were all arrested and charged with unlawful assembly.
Speaker 1: At--you mean from the previous march on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were--
Speaker 1: --Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, there was nothing going on when you all were arrested.  That, that had--that was a year before, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was maybe about maybe, maybe about four or five months later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are like posthumous charges.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --brought up after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, about four--
Speaker 1: --way after the incident.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because we were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were getting stronger and I guess they--I guess they felt, well, we need to go ahead and, you know, arrest these guys and bring them in.
Speaker 1: So you all were doing other things after the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you acting then as the--as the Black Student Union of the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: So, you hadn't start--started as--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --a Black Panther yet at that point.
Story_ID: 486270
Speaker 1: So, when, when we were arrested, we were arrested on--what day was Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] killed?
Speaker 2: April 4, 1968 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the day we were arrested.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were arrested April 4, and while I was sitting in jail, we heard the news come over the broadcast, Walter Concrite [sic. Walter Cronkite], announcing that Martin Luther King had been assassinated.  Of course, we were--we were stunned as everyone else was.  Then, we saw the reports about the riots breaking out all across the country and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] getting on TV in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and holding up his little .22 saying burn baby burn.  And at that point, it seemed like the whole country was, was, was, was rioting, was coming apart as a result of the murder of Martin Luther King.  And we felt really frustrated and really angry that we were locked up and we couldn't be out there participating in the--in the rebellion that was taking place.
Speaker 2: Now, let me just ask this?  So, there was no, no collusion on the part of the police to lock you up--they, they didn't know that Dr. King was--had been shot and didn't know that there were riots in other parts of the country.  They just happened to lock you all up on the day that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that they--that riots sprung up all over the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because of the murder of Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, this is really a interesting confluence of things here.
Speaker 1: Of events, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of events, yeah.
Speaker 1: It is, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you all are locked up and you find out about it.  And were there riots in Seattle [Washington]?
Speaker 1: No.  No.  There, there wasn't riots in Seattle.  You know, there--I think there was some--there was some disturbances.  There were some fire bombs that were thrown and there was some disturbances that were taking place, but--
Speaker 2: No riots.
Speaker 1: No, no--not a real riot.
Speaker 2: Now, there's a Dr. McKinney [Samuel McKinney] or a Reverend McKinney here that was--had been a student with Dr. King at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --who was very close to Dr. King, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: That you all marched with, you know, when you were--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in--still in middle school I think or early high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, middle school.
Speaker 2: Right?  Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did he--was, was he still around then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was still around.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was still around.
Speaker 2: And do, do you remember what he had to say about, about it or--about Dr. King's assassination (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I don't.  I don't--I don't remember.  I don't remember 'cause, you know, at that point, things started really, really moving very fast.
Story_ID: 486271
Speaker 1: The events started really moving because we had a hearing the next day to determine whether we would be let out on, on personal recognizance.  And I remember the courtroom being packed with people, full of people, you know, a lot of students and people from the community.  And, and then each of us was eventually PR-ed.  About a week later, we rented cars and about twenty or twenty-five of us went down to the Black Student Union Conference [West Coast Black Student Union Conference] in San Francisco, California, San Francisco State University [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, once again, that's called the Western Black--
Speaker 1: West--West Coast (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) West Coast, okay.
Speaker 1: --Black Student Union Conference, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it just so happened that when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, the Black Panther Party in Oakland [California] had gone out on the streets to stop rioters and in the process of everything, there was a shootout between the Black Panther Party and the Oakland Police Department, and a young Panther named Little Bobby Hutton was killed.  I think he was killed April 5, the day after Martin Luther King had been assassinated.  So, when we got down to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], we heard about they were having his funeral, the Panthers were having his funeral in Oakland.  And so we went over--there were--a carload of us went over to Oakland to Little Bobby Hutton's funeral, the first Panther to be killed.  Excuse me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the Panther papers from those days and about the--you know, the murder of Bobby Hutton.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--yeah.  In subsequent, you know, weeks--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, months and months it was discussed in the Panther paper (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I didn't realize until just now that it was April the 5th.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think even in those days I knew he was killed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the day after the assassination.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was--yeah, it was very much connected--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to Martin Luther King's assassination.  And so, you know, we saw all the Panthers in the in- interior of the church with their leather jackets on, black berets, saw Bobby Seale standing out front talking to Marlon Brando.  Marlon Brando had a beret on and a black leather jacket on.  And we were all extremely moved by what we saw in terms of the Panthers and also moved by the emotions that took--that came out during the memorial service for Bobby Hutton and the speeches that were made and especially, particularly for me was Mrs. Hutton [Dolly Mae Mitchner-Hutton], you know, her, her moaning and crying and her reaching out to her dead son in that casket.  And we all walked around.  Everybody in the church walked around and we viewed the body of Little Bobby Hutton.  He had--he was only sixteen, seventeen years old and he had been shot about maybe twenty-five, thirty times by the Oakland police.  So, it was a--it was a very--for us who were all, you know, very young, it was very moving and very emotional.  We left there and went back to the Black Student Union Conference and waited for Bobby Seale 'cause Bobby Seale was to give the keynote speech.  And we waited for it seemed like hours until finally Bobby Seale walked in with Kathleen Cleaver and, and six or seven other Panthers including one of the Panthers that had been injured, wounded in that shootout that had taken place.
Speaker 2: Now, now at this point, was this the time period Huey P. Newton was incarcerated, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'cause I know there was a Free Huey campaign going on in those days.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, the Free Huey campaign hadn't quite started yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Had it just been?
Speaker 1: It was just getting ready to get off the ground.  So, now, there were ninet- eighteen Panthers that had been arrested along with Eldridge Cleaver in that shootout when Little Bobby Hutton was killed and there were maybe three or four Panthers that had been wounded.
Speaker 2: Was, was, was--okay, so Eldridge Cleaver had been arrested at this point, but was Huey Newton in jail or was he free?
Speaker 1: No, Huey had been in jail.
Speaker 2: He had been--okay, he had been there for a while (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he had already been in jail--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for almost--
Speaker 2: Since--
Speaker 1: --a year.
Speaker 2: Since '67 [1967], I guess.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: So, so it was a very tense situation because this was the first shootout, first loss that the Black Panther Party had and a lot of their members had been arrested, so it was very tense, very intense period, moment.
Story_ID: 486272
Speaker 1: And so Bobby Seale gave his speech and he gave one of the most dynamic speeches that I have ever heard, even to this day.  I can't say that I've heard a speech that was as profound and as emotional as that speech was.  As soon as he concluded, I made a bee line to where he was standing and so did my brother [Elmer Dixon III] and Anthony Ware who was standing in different parts of the auditorium, and we told Bobby Seale we wanted to have a Black Panther Party chapter in Seattle [Washington].  So, a week later, him and George Murray [George Mason Murray] who was the administrator of education flew to Seattle and we met at my mother's [Frances Sledge Dixon] house, my parents' house.  About twenty-five other people came up there and we met over a two-day period and we formed the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party, which was the first chapter outside of the State of California.  And Bobby Seale at that point asked me to go on tour.  Now, he, he was beginning his campaign, his Free Huey campaign and, and what he was doing was opening up chapters and branches all over the country and, of course, we were the first.  And he was on his way to the East Coast to open up more chapters and branches, and he asked me to, to travel with him and I, I wasn't really--I wasn't ready to, to do that.  You know, I, I just had been appointed as the captain and, you know, I was getting ready to step into something that was extremely different from where I had come from, my family, my community, and all of the comfort that all of that brings, I was getting ready to leave all of that behind and take on a new life.  And I had some ideas of how serious it was, and so I think I just needed a little bit of time to think about what I was getting into.  So, I always wished I had gone with, with Bobby Seale on that, that, that, that organizing tour.  I think I probably could've learned a lot, but I didn't.
Speaker 2: So, you're, you're, what eighteen, nineteen?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Nineteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, so are you--were you the, the, the head of the--
Speaker 1: I was appointed--
Speaker 2: --Seattle chapter?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bobby said, "Okay, who's gonna be the captain?"  After the meeting he said, "Okay, who's gonna be the captain?"
Speaker 2: Okay, so they called you the captain.
Speaker 1: Everybody--you know, most of the people point--pointed to me, which was a surprise for me.
Story_ID: 486273
Speaker 1: So Bobby [Bobby Seale] went on to tour the country to, you know, form other chapters.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Now, this is significant here as I know in, in Dayton [Ohio] by 1969, we had a Panther [Black Panther Party] affiliate group that they were telling us is Richard Lashley [ph.] and I didn't know, know Skip Hayden [ph.], some others, but they, they were saying that they couldn't really be members in, in '69 [1969].  By '69 [1969], there was a moratorium on new members.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so I know--
Speaker 2: Unopened chapters--
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush came to Dayton and spoke--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the Courthouse Square.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the brothers that were in it, you know, they couldn't really form a real chapter because there was a moratorium on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on getting it.  So, you, you, you all were the first new chapter and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess the subsequent ones in Chicago [Illinois] and other places all happened within about a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it like, like wildfire.  It just spread like wildfire all over the country.  And then, you're right, by nine--1969, late 1969, there was a moratorium, and what they were called was organizing--you couldn't be a Panther chapter, but you could be what was called a National Committee to Combat Fascism--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Which essentially was the same thing.  So, that's what they organized in Dayton was a National Committee to Combat Fascism.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the--but they were--they were still Panthers.  They were all Panthers.
Story_ID: 486274
Speaker 1: You were just appointed captain of the Black Panther Party in Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 2: Yeah, April, April (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, the first, first new Black Panther Party chapter in the country.  That--that's surprising to me that there weren't other chapters around the, the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know initially, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think Black Panthers, the idea, though not the official party, came out of Alabama, Lowndes County--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lowndes County (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with Stokely Carmichael.
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or late Kwame Ture.  He changed his name, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was Stokely Carmichael then, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the idea of it and the logo, that inspired the brothers in Oakland [California] who formed the Black Panther Party for Self Defense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is different from the voter registration project in, in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Alabama, but used the same log.  But then there was interaction between Stokely Carmichael and what he was saying and, and the brothers in Oakland.  He actually went out and talked to them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and became like a, a--an organizer I guess of the Panther Party in Oakland.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486275
Speaker 1: Well, you know, as I said, things was getting--things were getting ready to pick up.  After that Franklin [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington] sit-in, things just started moving so extremely fast.  It's just mind-boggling.  Because after the chapter was formed in Seattle [Washington], Bobby Seale went through--went throughout the whole country, Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York].  He was focusing on the big cities, Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Those were the first chapters Midwest, East Coast, and Denver, Colorado.  A week later after he had came to Seattle, I was called down to Oakland [California] and I went down there as my first time as a member of the Black Panther Party.  And that was (laughter)--this was still only two weeks after Little Bobby Hutton had been killed.  So, there was a lot of intense--there was a lot of--a lot of--a lot of tension, particularly between the Black Panther Party and the Oakland Police Department.  And, so when I first, first arrived, I met Captain Robert Bay, who was a former Vietnam vet [Vietnam War veteran].  He was living in a house with Captain Landon Williams and Captain Randy Williams who were also former Special Forces [U.S. Army Special Forces] in the U.S. military.  They all had just returned from Vietnam.  And so they were welcoming me into the party.  And, you know, they were show--showed me all their weapons.  Each of them had their own armament.  You know, each of them, they had their own bullet-making equipment, you know (laughter).  They were showing me their arsenals and, you know, the M-16s, their rifles and shotguns and, and just running down to me about the party and what the party was about, and--
Speaker 2: Now, let me just, just make a point here maybe if I could that, and correct me if I'm wrong again, is that the black--one, one of the key planks in the Black Panther Party was that black people have the right to carry guns and arms, right?  Just, just as the second amendment, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody in America (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 2: --can be armed to their teeth if they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they want to be, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And previously, black people had always been told that they should be nonviolent or docile, don't--you know, you shouldn't be brandishing weapons, especially against authority or in defense of your community.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so one of the things that the Panthers did was just show that they--they walked down the street with guns.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And to show--and, and, and under--I mean, for the purpose of the protection of the community against--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, and, and the, the main--really, the main reason was to educate people and to show people that they had a right to defend themselves.  They had a right to, to challenge the authority because police brutality was rampant in America.  It was really rampant in the L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Chicago because you--I mean, L.A. and the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] because you had a lot of police officers that had been recruited from the South that came to L.A. and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and L.A. was--
Speaker 1: Oakland, California.
Story_ID: 486276
Speaker 1: Now, there was a case in '65 [1965], the Robert L. Reese case here in Seattle [Washington], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --where a--quote a police officer, off-duty cop was sitting in a restaurant and in a conversation said, "Just show me a nigger, any nigger in here and I'll kill him.  I got a gun."  I mean, he, he says this and then he ends up shooting Robert Reese.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is the atmosphere.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  This, this--these, these are the things that we--that my generation grew up watching and knowing that a white person or a white police officer could at any time kill a black person and get away with it.  Well, they can still get away with it, but at that point--at that time, it, it was so prevalent and there was always this feeling like there was nothing that we could do about it.  Then finally comes an organization and, and some people in this organization that say, no, you got a right to defend yourself and, and, at--and we're going to put a end to this police brutality and, and, and protect ourselves, defend ourselves and defend our community, and so that's what the Black Panther Party exercised.  And when they first formed, they called themselves the Black Panther Party for Self Defense.
Story_ID: 486277
Speaker 1: Now, just before we move away from that point, I just wanted you to talk about, maybe you could address or compare, I mean, what the Panthers [Black Panther Party] are doing then with the--you know, they--you see the posters, people standing out.  They were actually going down the streets with bandoliers of bullets on them and--in a display of self-defense, and how is that different from now, the kids are riding around armed to the teeth, but they're not necessarily showing their guns, but there--there's a--just kind of--just talk, talk about that 'cause I think people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --would think, well, because you have guns you're doing something positive or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, for us, first of all, it was an exercise in our constitutional rights in the face of overwhelming oppression and overwhelming police brutality.  We have to remember that Jim Crow, which started in the 1900s went all the way up until the 1960s where it was legal, pretty much legal to lynch black people.  Black people were, were being lynched all over this country for, for fifty years.  And the Black Panther Party really came about out of that whole Jim Crow era where, where black people were being tired of being brutalized and tired of being killed.  Everybody in my generation, we had someone who had been a victim of Jim Crow.  You know, it was part of our history and we heard these stories.  We heard this--we had relatives that we lived in a house with that were slaves, that had, had came out of slavery, so we were very really close to the whole history of slavery, my generation.  And so when we said that, okay, we're tired of this.  We're not gonna take this anymore, that we're gonna organize ourselves, and that's what the Black Panther Party did.  They were an organization of young people and older people that said we got a right to defend ourselves, we got a right to address these issues in our community and we're gonna do it in a very forceful manner.
Story_ID: 486278
Speaker 1: But, mostly young people, though.
Speaker 2: Mostly young, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think--and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the older, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mostly, these are--the Panthers [Black Panther Party]--
Speaker 2: Mostly young people.
Speaker 1: --are young people.
Speaker 2: Bobby Hutton was only fifteen years old--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when he joined.  When I went to Oakland [California], I met a brother who was sixteen years old.  His name was Orleando Harrison [sic. Oleander Harrison].  And Orelando was--now, if you--when you look at the, the footage of the Panthers in Sacramento [California] because in 1967, because the Panthers had been walking and patrolling the police with their rifles and shotguns, the state decided that they were going to create this law to make it illegal for them to carry their weapons out in the open, so they came up with the Mumford--I think it was the Mumford Act [sic. Mulford Act of 1967], and in response to this legislation, Huey P. Newton sent a delegation of thirty armed Panthers to Sacramento to protest this gun law and this would be the last time that the Panthers in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] would be able to carry their weapons out in the open.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that prohibited.  But the age of the Panthers--Huey Newton was still in his twenties, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: I mean, he was in jail when--
Speaker 2: He was twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven.
Speaker 2: He was twenty-seven, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the--you know, Bobby Hutton being sixteen, Fred Hampton in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Was nineteen.
Speaker 1: --I think when he was--when he was killed, he was nineteen.  He wasn't even--he didn't even--
Speaker 2: He was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Twenty-one?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was nineteen when--
Speaker 2: 'Cause we were the same age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Me and Fred Hampton were the same age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this brother, Orleando Harrison, if you ever see any of the footage of the Panthers in Sacramento, you see this young guy with a, a cigar--a, a cig- cig- a cigar in his mouth holding a shotgun with a, a military jacket on.  Now, he was only sixteen years old, Orleando Harrison.  But I got--when I went to Oakland as a--as a Panther, I--he was one of the Panthers that I hung out with in, in April '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 486279
Speaker 1: (Background noise) How did the Mumford Act [sic. Mulford Act of 1967]--I'm--I guess I'm--you know, California is a, a state that--where, where the, the--what do you call it, the, the gun lobby is very powerful and the National Rifle Association [NRA] is usually lead by Hollywood actors like Charlton Heston and other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Charlton Heston, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] was very--
Speaker 2: Ronald Reagan.
Speaker 1: --very much in favor of that.
Speaker 2: He was the governor at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, governor at the time.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, when the delegation got out of their cars with the rifles and shotguns, Ronald Reagan was giving a talk to a group of Boy Scouts or I think they were young members of the National Rifle Association, and they saw these Panthers getting out with these rifles and shotguns and all the kids ran over there (laughter) 'cause they were interested, said, oh, who were these guys with all these rifles and shotguns?  Of course, Ronald Reagan ducked for the bushes (laughter).
Speaker 1: But this is not--now, this is--to me, this is a classic confluence of American values, you know, so here's black people--I mean, everyone who reads American history knows that Negroes with guns are, are the biggest terror that, you know--I mean, could be conceived of, I mean, in American history.  I mean, they--the black people armed in, in public with guns scares the rest of America to death (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so here you all come out with, with guns.  I mean, here's the Oakland [California] Panthers [Black Panther Party] with bandoliers of bullets and they--
Speaker 2: Bandoliers, black berets.
Speaker 1: They're, they're dressed uniformly with berets.
Speaker 2: Uniform.
Speaker 1: And, and they actually have some, some Vietnam vets [Vietnam War veterans] who know how to use them with them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And guys that can make bullets and have an arsenal at home.  And all this is as American as apple pie.
Speaker 2: American as apple pie.
Speaker 1: And, but--
Speaker 2: American as apple pie.
Speaker 1: So, how can the right wing even criticize it and how--and how did the Mumford Act work to keep--I mean, how, how could they phrase a--how was a law phrased to keep black people--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --from doing what any--
Speaker 2: Let me tell you--
Speaker 1: --American can do.
Speaker 2: --how it was phrased.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was phrased that no person could carry a weapon adjacent to public property.  That means you couldn't walk down the street and carry a weapon any longer out in the open.
Speaker 1: Adjacent to public property (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Public property (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that means especially--I guess it would especially mean if you brought it to a seat of power like a courthouse or a jail or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the legislature or something.  You know, you definitely shouldn't be there with it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it, it, it basically meant anywhere except for your home or maybe on your lawn, but you could no longer walk down the street.
Speaker 1: Was it just for the urban areas or, or was it for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think--I think it might've been for the cities.  I think it--yeah, it was the city--it was a city ordinance, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know we always have the image of ranchers with their shotguns mounted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the back of their pickup trucks and all that sort of thing.  But that--and they didn't--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It didn't apply to them.
Speaker 2: No, it didn't apply to them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 486280
Speaker 1: Huey [Huey P. Newton] was really very organized and, and he organized, when they did go out on the streets with their weapons to patrol the police, they were extremely organized and they knew how to hold their weapons.  You know, the weapons either were held straight down or they were held straight in the air.  And there wasn't--there weren't any bullets in the chamber.  People had to learn how to hold their weapons, they had to learn how to clean their weapons, they had to learn the laws of engaging and talking with police officers and only one person could do the talking.  Only one person was in charge.  Everybody had to follow the--whoever was in charge and it--and, and at that point, and Oakland [California] it was always Huey Newton.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, they were extremely organized organization [Black Panther Party], which is much different from what we have today in terms of young people that don't--do not have a older leader, do not know about gun laws, do not know, know, know about weapons, how to hold their weapons, how to clean their weapons, don't know about the laws, and don't have any real purpose when carrying their weapons other than to do harm to someone else who is usually someone who looks like them.
Speaker 2: But it's not a political purpose, anyway.  It's a--
Speaker 1: It, it wasn't a political purpose.
Speaker 2: I think most of the, the violence in the black community is caused by business arrangements that have gone sour.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When people are trying to collect money--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from somebody or somebody owed money and didn't pay it, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And not--but not to show a political show of strength or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a political or protection of the community.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486281
Speaker 1: Were you ever personally involved in a, a display of, of fire power in Seattle [Washington] or in Oakland [California] where, where you marched with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let me--let me tell you about this story in Oakland.  Now, so I met Landon [Landon Williams] and Randy [Randy Williams], Robert Bay, Tommy Jones who was also a ex-[U.S.] Navy offi- Navy person.  He was also--he was from Tacoma [Washington] but he was residing in Oakland.  He joined the party in Oakland.  He was also a captain.  And so all of these guys kind of took me under their wing and were showing me around Oakland, and Tommy gave me my first--he asked me if I had a piece.  I said, no, I don't have a--I got a carbine at home.  He said, well I'm gonna get you a piece.  So, he, he went out and got me a 9mm Llama, which was my first handgun and he, he gave me a shoulder holster for it and everything.  And so one day, they also, one day we were at, at their house, at Landon and Robert Bay's house, and we were all in the kitchen and they introduced me to the Panther drink, which was called bitter dog, which was dark port and lemon juice and it was also called Panther piss.  That was the Panther drink, bitter dog.  That was the drink of the--of the guys on the streets.  And so--
Speaker 1: Dark port and--
Speaker 2: Dark port and lemon juice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And take the dark port, pour out a little bit of, of, of the top of it 'cause they said that was the poison and--but they also said this is for the ancestors, poured it out a little bit and then put lemon juice in it.  You know, you used to be able to buy those little lemon things, plastic lemon things with lemon juice in it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Put that lemon in it, shake it up, and that was the bitter dog.  It was called the bitter dog (laughter), which was later called Panther piss.  It was the official drink of the Black Panther Party.  So, we were all sitting in the kitchen, standing in the kitchen drinking Panther piss, smoking some marijuana, and we heard a big bang, and we all ran into the living room, and Landon Williams was sitting in his chair with a .44 Magnum, and he said I'm tired of those damn--I'm tired of the white man always killing the Indians [Native American].  He was watching a cowboy and Indian movie and he got mad and shot his TV out 'cause he--'cause he was tired of the Indians getting wiped out by the--by the white man.
Speaker 1: Well, I take it he wasn't sober at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, Landon didn't drink or smoke.  That's why he was in, in the living room, we were in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was just--that--that's the way he was.  He was just a very serious guy.  He had been in Vietnam Special Forces [U.S. Army Special Forces].
Story_ID: 486282
Speaker 1: So later that day, we all--there was five of us, we went down to West Oakland [Oakland, California], to 7th Street, 7th and Wood [Street], and went into a restaurant and got something to eat.  Now, this was the same corner that Huey [Huey P. Newton] had his shootout where he was--two policemen were killed and he was wounded.  So, after we finished eating, me and Orleando Harris [sic. Oleander Harrison], the young guy, we went out to the corner to smoke a cigarette and smoke our Kool cigarettes 'cause everybody smoked Kools.  So, we're standing--
Speaker 2: All over the country.  That must've been the national smoke for black people.
Speaker 1: The movement, the movement.  That definitely was the movement smoke.  So, we're smoking our Kools and a police car drives by and Orleando starts yelling at the--at the--at the cop, and starts yelling, "You pig, you better stop at that corner, you pig, you motherfucking pig."  So, I chimed in, too.  I start yelling, "Pig, you better stop."  Police goes around the corner, comes back, and he's got about four or five more police cars with him.  They jump out of the car.  By this time, Robert Bay, Orleand- Landon [Landon Williams], Randy [Randy Williams], and Tommy [Tommy Jones] have came outside to join us.  And so more police come.  And so Robert Bay says spread out.  And Tommy Jones who was nonfunctional at the time.  He had taken some, some pills or something, he didn't hear the order to back up and spread out, so the police surround him and they arrested him and took him down.  More police came.  And so there is--there is Landon, Randy, Robert Bay, Orleando, and myself, we were all armed.  And so by this time, the, the businesses--this was at, at--when we got there, this was a vibrant Friday afternoon in the ghetto, barbecue shops, restaurants, clubs, everybody all on the street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The, the eagle just flew, right?
Speaker 1: The eagle just flew.  When the police came and we took our, our stance, every--everybody started rushing, rushing home.
Speaker 2: Man, this sounds like high noon.
Speaker 1: Shops, shops start closing down.  Within a matter of minutes, there was nobody else left on the street except for the prostitutes.  They said, we ain't going nowhere.  We're gonna sit here and watch and see what happens to our brothers.  I remember, you know, standing there spread out with my hand on my--on my weapon and this young guy, he was--he had to have been no, no--not much older than I was, and he had a bag of groceries.  He had a McClymonds High School [Oakland, California] jacket on, McClymonds High School where Bill Russell went to school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He had that jacket on and I remember seeing the M.  And our eyes met and he, he probably saw the fear in my eyes 'cause he said to me, he--I, I didn't even say anything to him.  He said, "Brother, I would stay here to help you, but I gotta get home," and he was gone.  And I just remember that feeling like, wow, he's gone.  And so, you know, there were about twenty-five police out there now and they're all bunched together and they're scared, too.  They're probably more scared than we are.  We're all spread out.  And so Landon was kind of in front, and so this, this lieutenant police officer had his hand on his gun and he started walking towards Landon and said, "I'm gonna search you."  Landon had his hand on his gun and he said, "No, you're not gonna search me."  And so Landon--he started walking towards Landon and Landon started backing up, slowly backing up, saying--and the police saying, "I'm gonna search you."  Landon said, "No, you're not gonna search me."  And we all thought that that--we were gonna die that night and we were prepared to die that night.  And I just remember all these memories of my family running through my mind and saying, you know, okay, this is--this is my time, that I'll probably die tonight.  And then what happened was--and, and the tension was so--I'd never been in a--such a tension-filled moment as I was at that point right there.
Story_ID: 486283
Speaker 1: As Landon [Landon Williams] was backing up, he tripped over a garbage can top and it reverberated and, you know, made that vibrating noise off the concrete and he, he jumped right back up.  But when that happened, it--that, that sound of that garbage can did something because the police stopped, they turned around, they got back in their cars, and they drove off.  And the prostitutes came over.  They knew some of the Panthers, so we gave our weapons to them because we were assuming that the police were gonna come back in full force, and so we gave our weapons to the prostitutes and, and we all went home.  So, that day, you know, the word spread through the party about this stand-off--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --with the police.
Speaker 2: Now, why--now, just--I have a question, I guess, as somebody listening to this would--why did you give your weapons to the prostitutes if the police were coming back?  I mean, it wasn't illegal to have a weapon, was it?  I mean, what--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: And if they were coming back, they'd be looking for you, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.  But they were gonna come back with over--overwhelming force.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, at that point--
Speaker 2: So, had the idea (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we, we, we--
Speaker 2: --of defending yourselves been--
Speaker 1: --didn't want to give our weapons up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We, we didn't--we had weapons on us.  We, we did not want to give our weapons up.
Speaker 2: Oh, you didn't want them to get them?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And plus, it was illegal to carry a concealed weapon.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Our weapons were concealed.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  All right.
Speaker 1: And the law [Mulford Act of 1967] had been passed where you could not carry weapons out in the open, so it was illegal.  So, so that--that's why we, we gave them up at that time.  And so, the very next day, we had the Black Panther Party general meeting for all the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], and Panthers came from all over the Bay Area, Palo Alto [California], Sacramento [California], San Francisco [California], Marin County [California], and we met at the St. Augustine's Church [St. Augustine's Episcopal Church] in West Oakland [Oakland, California].  There maybe--must've been about two hundred Panthers there and, and so I, I was introduced and I felt like I had just been adopted into a, a new family.  And all these people treated--when they picked me up from the airport, they treated me like I was the long lost relative, you know, like I was distant a distant relative or something.  It was just such a warm feeling of camaraderie that I had never felt before and never would ever feel again, was being welcomed into the Black Panther Party.  And I met all these people at this meeting, and I met this one guy named Sam Napier.  He was--after the meeting, he was standing out on the corner, out in the streets selling Black Panther papers [The Black Panther Community News Service; The Black Panther Intercommunal News Service].  He was the only one out there selling, hustling his butt off.  He later became the, the national circulation manager of the Black Panther Party.  So, after the meeting was over, I got in the car with Robert Bay and Tommy [Tommy Jones] and we drove back to the house in West Oakland.  We walked into the house, all the lights were out and the phone--Tommy's--Rand- Robert Bay's phone was ringing, so he ran for the phone.  He picked the phone up and he slammed it down and he ran into the room and started grabbing some rifles and he handed me a, a rifle, which was a .44 Magnum Carbine and a box of ammunition.  He said, "They're vamping up some comrades at the church, let's go."  So, everybody's grabbing the rifles and shotguns, we jumped in the car, we speeding down Grove Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Way] going about sixty, eighty miles an hour, and I'm, I'm trying to load this weapon.  I, I had never seen this .44 Magnum before, so--but I did know how to load it.  So, we, we load it and when we got down to the church--
Speaker 2: Is this St. Augustine's, the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) St. Augustine Church.  When we got--
Speaker 2: Now, what, what denomination was that and--
Speaker 1: I think that was Episcopal church.
Speaker 2: Okay, and it was a--who was the--
Speaker 1: Father Neil [Earl A. Neil].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was this a black--
Speaker 1: He was the--
Speaker 2: --church?
Speaker 1: --official Panther--he was on the Panther advisory committee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was official Panther spiritual leader.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I guess you could say.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's still very close to the party. (Background noise) So, when we got down to the church, there was nothing there.  Nobody was there.  So, you know, this again, I thought, okay.  While I'm--while we're speeding in that car, I'm thinking, okay, we're--there's gonna be a shootout this time (laughter).  So, those are--those are my two introductory days into the Black Panther Party and I, I only--I only had been there for two days and, and I got a taste of what the party and the revolution was all about.
Speaker 2: Did you get a sense that that happens every day there?
Speaker 1: You know, yeah.  Because Little Bobby Hutton had only been killed two weeks prior to that and there was still a lot of tension, a lot of anger around Little Bobby Hutton's assassination.  And, and, you know, there were even people who weren't in the party who came around who had weapons.  You know, they, they knew people in the party and this, this, this happened a lot.  There were people who didn't join the party but they had the same feelings and sentiments and their friends were in the party, so they were involved on the peripheral.  So, I just remember these guys coming around with the rifles and shotguns and, you know, saying, what's going on?  And talking, and--
Story_ID: 486290
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is a--this fast two days of initiation that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, now--so, you were in the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] before--oh, that's--it's--that's after the BSU [Black Student Union] was established, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, when I--when we came back to Seattle [Washington], we had opened up our office and we had--we had--in the two-week period, we had--well, let, let me just--I, I flew back to Seattle after this, this very intense time that I spent in--
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, wait.  Here's a question I have--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that I think would be of interest to everybody.  How did your parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] feel about this, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or did they know?  Like--I know--I think most parents don't know what their kids are doing on--and, and you were a kid then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and I'm sure--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a kid.
Speaker 1: --they say you as a kid--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if you saw yourself--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a grown man, they--I'm sure they saw you as a kid.  So, what did they think about this?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents were really very, very political and they raised us to be very political.  I remember when I was about thirteen years old telling my parents that I wanted to--announcing to them that I wanted to be a policeman and join the police--be--become a police officer, and they (laughter), they got so mad.  They said you--or--, "No son of mine is gonna be no police officer."  When I was sixteen years old, I said I was gonna join the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and go to Vietnam [Vietnam War] and my father got really angry and said, "No son of mine is going to Vietnam 'cause those people haven't called you a nigger."  So, and my father had been a member of the Communist Party when he was young.  He had marched with Paul Robeson at Soldiers Field [sic. Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois].  He was part of the security.  Whenever Paul Robeson came to Soldiers Field, he was part of the U security that they had, so--and my father had went through a number of experiences in Mississippi when he joined the [U.S.] Army and went down to Mississippi.  And, you know, so we grew up on, on these stories of, of, of, of my father and, and my mother's stories.  And so we were already very political.  And my parents, they, they went right along with it.  They, they, they didn't disagree, they didn't say no, they didn't say we're afraid for your life, didn't show any fear whatsoever, they just supported everything that we did 'cause my brother [Elmer Dixon III] joined and my younger brother [Michael Dixon] eventually joined.  So, they had three sons that were in the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, that's--so, they were largely in support (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were--
Speaker 1: --of--
Speaker 2: --in support.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, they--when Bobby Seale first came to town, you know, we--Bobby Seale and George Murray [George Mason Murray], they stayed there at my parents' house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and we--and we met there at my parents' house.  Some of the people came with rifles and shotguns to that meeting.  You know, my parents, you know, they didn't--they didn't say anything.
Story_ID: 486292
Speaker 1: So, you know, I had a lot to think about on that plane ride back home back to Seattle [Washington], but I--at that point, I was--I, I was--I was ready.  I was ready to be a part of this revolution and ready to be a part of this movement.  And I had a better idea now of what I was in store for and, and how dedicated and serious this whole thing was.  So, when we got back to Seattle, we opened up our office and over three, four hundred people came by and signed up to be members of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you--how, how did you get your office open?  I know it takes money to do these things and so I just--and resources.  I mean, what--how, how did you get your office?
Speaker 1: Well, it's interesting that you would ask that because the, the storefront that we picked out, we wanted this to--because in the early days, that's what we were told we, we, we should have is a storefront office.  So, we picked out this storefront not far from my parents' [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] house and we went and approached this Mr. Brill who was a realtor who owned a lot of property in the community.  His office was next to this storefront that we wanted and we--there was about three or four of us.  And he looked at us and said, "No, I'm not gonna rent to you guys."  And so we said, okay.  So, a, a day or two later, a firebomb was thrown into the storefront and so--
Speaker 2: The one that you were gonna rent?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so while he was fixing it up and painting it, we came back and asked him, we said, "Can we rent this?"  He said yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, was there any connection between the firebomb being thrown through the window and the--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, there was.  There was a connection.  So, that's how we got our first office.  And we plastered that office with posters and his office with posters.  Actually, it was his office that we had firebombed because he had boarded it up with boards.  And so that's how we opened up our office.
Story_ID: 486294
Speaker 1: We had over two, three hundred people come over and sign up to be members of the party.  We had a lot of Vietnam vets [Vietnam War veterans] that came and joined and signed up, a lot of guys that just came from Vietnam, had a Japanese guy who joined, Mike Tagawa, who had just returned from the [U.S.] Air Force in Vietnam, and he became--
Speaker 2: So--okay.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Go, go ahead.
Speaker 1: He became the, the, the, the couple--the two Vietnam vets that came, they became our drill instructors and weapons instructors.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, the point I was gonna make was that--so the Black Panther Party wasn't necessarily all black.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You could--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --join if you were Japanese.
Speaker 1: Well, in Oakland [California], there was--the original field marshal was Japanese, Richard Aoki, and here in Seattle [Washington], we had two Japanese and one, one Filipino that joined.  Now, in Seattle, because of segregation, Japanese, Filipinos, and Chinese, and, and black people, we all lived right together in the same community.  We all went to school together and we were really almost melt together.  We--there was really--wasn't really any differentiation between--and as far as we're concerned between the Filipino and the Japanese.  The Chinese maybe a little bit more, but, but most--but, but we were all like one, you know.  It was--that's the way it was back then.  So, when, when, you know, these guys came and joined the party, they were our good friends growing up, there was no question, well, they're not black.  You know, as far as we con- were concerned, they were black.

Speaker 1: One of the first things we started doing was patrolling the police.  You know, we started carrying our rifles and shotguns on the street because there wasn't any ordinance that said that we could not do that.  Of course, a year later there would be.  But we became really a, a, a, a tremendous force with the- with just a very short period of time.  As soon as we turned our phones on, we started getting just calls from the community, you know, about police brutality, police harassment.  We got a lot of calls from women who were saying that they were having problems with their husband or their boyfriend, you know, and then, you know, we'd have four or five armed Panthers show up and, you know, squash that.
Speaker 2: So, there was--now, that's interesting because--now, that's something that the, the police routinely don't do--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I've heard lots stories from women--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --who, whose man or husband would beat them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on a regular basis and calling the police--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --didn't do any good.
Speaker 1: Didn't do the job.
Speaker 2: 'Cause the police were beating their wife at home, too.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, it's been subsequently shown--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --there's a higher rate of, of domestic violence among police officers than, than almost any other group.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  So, that's one thing we didn't tolerate because in, in the Black Panther Party, we did believe very strongly in women's liberation, women being equal, women having the same role.  We had all these strong women in the party.  They carried weapons.  They were involved in the weapon's classes.  And so, you know, being violent towards your wife or your girlfriend was something that we didn't tolerate in the party and we certainly weren't gonna tolerate it in the community.  So, we got a--I remember we did get a call from a woman who had seven kids.  The landlord had taken her door off the hinges.  So, we sent--because she hadn't paid--got behind on her rent.  So, we sent some Panthers to the landlord's house, they got the door from him--I don't know how they got it, but they got it from him, they carried the door down the street and put it back on the hinges.  [TW1]So, these are the types of things that we were--that we were dealing with, you know.  It, it seemed like all of a sudden when we got our, our office established that all these problems start appearing in the community and they finally had someone that they could call to address these problems.  Before, there wasn't anyone that they could call.  Now, they had someone that they could call.
Story_ID: 486297
Speaker 1: Someone listening to this might think, well, why didn't they call the police?  But, the, the police presence in the black community was different, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the police presence in the community was always looked at as Huey [Huey P. Newton] said as a--as a occupying force.  They really had no real interest in, in--or concern about the people in the community.  They were really there to protect the interest of the people downtown and the businesses, the corporations out there operating.  They could care less what was happening in the community.  And, and at that time, there were no black police officers even on the police force.
Speaker 1: Even here in Seattle [Washington]?
Speaker 2: Even here in Seattle.
Story_ID: 486298
Speaker 1: This was April, moving into May, towards the end of May, we got a call--and, and we were sending in--I was sending in weekly reports to Bobby Seale, was talking to him on the phone almost weekly, and he had told me, he said, "Dixon [HistoryMaker Aaron Dixon], you guys are acting too much like the police.  You're doing too, too many community calls, you know, going out responding to all these requests from the community."  He says, "You gotta do more organizing.  You know, you gotta do more other things, so I want you guys to cut back on that, you know." I said, "Okay," I said, "Right on."  So, then we get a call from this mother who had a student, a black student at Rainier Beach High School [Seattle, Washington].  Rainier Beach was a all-white high school at that time, and she called and said that her son had gotten beaten up by some white students and she asked the principal to, to intervene and he wouldn't do anything, and so she wanted us to come out to the high school.  And I said, "I'm sorry ma'am, we can't do that 'cause I just talked to Bobby Seale."  So, but she called Tuesday, same thing, Wednesday same thing, Thursday same thing.  Then, she called back on Friday and it just so happened there were about maybe twelve, fourteen Panthers [members, Black Panther Party] in there where everybody had their rifles and shotguns.  We're just sitting around talking, drinking some wine, and then she called crying, saying her son had gotten beaten up.  And then three or four other black mothers called, said the same thing.  Their sons had got--kids had got accosted by the white students, white students brought chains and knives and bricks to school.  They were threatening the lives of the black students and nobody would do anything about it, could we please do something?  So, at that point, I said okay, it's time for us to go.  So, we all got in our cars, we got in our cars, we got in about three cars.  We drove out to Rainier Beach High School.  We took the side streets.  When we got there, there were about twenty-five police officers out there 'cause I guess they had been called out there, too.  And so we got out with our weapons and we crossed the street, and when we got to the front of the building, there was a white police officer, a very fat, belly hanging over his belt, and we--he knew us and we knew him because we had had many other run-ins with him while we were doing our patrolling.  And he said, "Dixon, you can't take those loaded weapons in there."  And I said, "They're not loaded." Because I, I understood the laws, that if, if you're carrying a weapon and if there's not a bullet in the chamber, it's not considered loaded, and if you know there's not a bullet in the chamber, it's considered to be not loaded.  But the, the bullets were not--the weapons were not chambered but they were loaded.  So, we, we walked right into the school.  He didn't try to stop us or anything.  We saw the principal or he saw us and he took off running, had--we sent some Panthers after him.  They went and got him, they brought him back to the office and we sat him down and he was vis- vividly shaken, as you can imagine.  And we told them if he didn't start protecting those kids that we were gonna protect them.  We would be out there every day to protect them.  And he said, you know, from now on, I will--I will protect the kids.  And so we left out of the building, we backed our way through the police cars, we got in the police car, and we drove off.  [TW2]The police followed us back to the Central Area [Seattle, Washington] but they never stopped us.  We got a call when I--as soon as I walked into the house, we got a call from our attorney that the police were preparing indictments against us, but the indictments never came because there wasn't anything that we had done that was illegal.  Because, I guess at that time, there was no law that said you not--could--you couldn't carry a weapon onto school property.
Speaker 2: So, this is a--this--I mean, it sounds like--as I'm listening to this, I mean, it really sounds like a victory for the community.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, there was no doubt (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For everybody involved.
Speaker 1: There was no doubt.
Speaker 2: And the, the harassment of the students stopped?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it stopped.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we got no more calls after that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At least the physical part stopped.
Speaker 1: We got no more calls after that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you--
Speaker 1: So, this was a victory.
Speaker 2: --were able to go in there and do that and get out and nobody's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --hurt and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And we had a lot of little victories like that, you know, early on.
Story_ID: 486299
Speaker 1: Let me see, abo- a week later, I get a call from Bobby Seale.  He says that they're taking a, a contingent to the UN [United Nations].  And he wanted me to meet him at the Oakland Airport [Oakland International Airport, Oakland, California], fly down to the Oakland Airport, when I got down there to call him from the airport.  So, me and my bodyguard, we, we flew down to Oakland, we called him from the airport, and a couple hours later, we were joined by Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver, Carl- Captain Banks [Shermont L. Banks] from the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] chapter [of the Black Panther Party], Emory Douglas, one of Huey's [Huey P. Newton] brothers I think was Walter Newton, must've been about ten or twelve of us and we hopped on the redline--red light [sic. red eye] flight to New York [New York].  And when we got to New York, Eld- Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] picked us up from the airport and took us to his house and enter--and we were at his house meeting and talking, and we were being served by his wife, Miriam Makeba, who I'd grew up listening to as a child.  And I was just blown away that here I was in a room with Miriam Makeba let alone Stokely Carmichael.  I was more impressed with her than I was him 'cause my parents [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] really loved her.
Speaker 2: Right.  She was a tremendous international star--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and one of the first women I ever saw with a natural (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --hairstyle on television.
Speaker 1: And, and, and very outspoken woman against apartheid in her country [South Africa] at that time.  But what I was struck with was how submissive she was acting, you know, with all of us and the way that Stokely Carmichael was treating her.
Speaker 2: It just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: It just didn't seem right to you, did it?
Speaker 1: It, it didn't seem right to me, you know, didn't seem right to me.
Speaker 2: I think she was older than him, too--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --by about maybe five, six, seven, maybe ten years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I would learn later that he was very abusive to her.  So, that--the, the next day, we went to SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] office to meet with [HistoryMaker] James Forman because James Forman had the plan.  The plan was to go into the UN.  The plan was to have, have Panthers with Free Huey flags and Panther uniform stationed in front of every flag of the United Nations, and as the delegation would go into the UN and meet with the UN to ask the UN to intervene in the trial of Huey P. Newton because we felt that he could not get a fair trial, and we felt that the UN needed to intervene into the plight of African Americans in this country because the, the tremendous amount of, of brutality and oppression that was taking place in the black community.
Story_ID: 486300
Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] James Forman and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], and H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] had just been recruited into the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And each of them had their positions.  I can't remember what their pos- what their titles were, but they had been recruited into the Black Panther Party, and so SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]--at that point, SNCC and the party had, had began to, to somewhat merge.
Speaker 2: I think a lot of people are not aware of that.  Now, today, when you talk--when people speak of James Forman who just passed away last year, they'll think of SNCC primarily but not, not of his association with Black Panther Party.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Same with--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --H. Rap Brown.  They don't--people see him as, almost like a renegade unattached to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, he was with SNCC at one time, I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but he--he's seen as almost like without an organizational affiliation.  But, this is 19--is this '69 [1969] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was--no, this is '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968] still, okay.
Speaker 1: This is June '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I'm sitting out in the lobby of the SNCC office with Emory Douglas and Walter Newton, and Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] and Bobby Seale and Huey's [Huey P. Newton] older brother are in James Forman's office meeting with him.  And an hour went by, then we started hearing this yelling and we hear the--a loud bang.  You know, Eldridge had, you know, banged his fist on the desk.  Then, they all--then they came storming out and said, "Let's get the fuck out of here."
Speaker 2: Now, this is--who's office is this now?
Speaker 1: This is James Forman's office, SNCC office (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, SNCC office, okay.
Speaker 1: --in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And so we left out of there and Eldridge and Bobby were all vividly very angry.  And what happened was, they had gotten into an argument with James Forman.  James Forman was trying to make a power play because he was older than these guys.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was more established than these guys and he wanted to make this play where SNCC was in charge 'cause we had noticed that he had brought some of his people from L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  I don't know if you remember a guy named Crutch [Wilford Holliday].  He was a SNCC field marshal.  Well, he, he had brought him from L.A. and some of the other field marshals from around the country.  They were there.
Story_ID: 486301
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: Probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] James Forman was trying to make some kind of power play that didn't sit well with Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] and Bobby Seale.  And, and so we went to find someone else who could get us into the UN [United Nations].  I don't know if you ever heard of Mae Mallory.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: She was concerned like--concerned--she was known as the mother of the Black Power movement, of the African movement.  I'm not exactly quite sure, but she was a really very influential woman, older woman in the movement.  So, we went to her house.  I just remember her being dressed in a dashiki and the headband and everything.  And so she said that she would--she would be able to get with us to meet with the Tanzanian- Tanzania delegation.  And so at this point, we were just trying to keep this plan to get back into the UN together because now, the split between SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and the Black Panther Party was beginning.  So, the very next day, we--the Panthers with the Free Huey flags were stationed in front of all the flags of United Nations and the delegation.  We all went into the UN.  We weren't able to meet with the UN General Assembly [United Nations General Assembly], which is what we wanted to do and be able to address them.  The best that we could do was meet with the Tanzania delegation, which in--you remember Nyerere [Julius Nyerere]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was a Marxist revolutionary leader of Tanzania.  And so--and then we left the UN.  So, we were really angry--
Speaker 2: So, did, did you meet with--was Nyerere there or was he--
Speaker 1: No, he--no, he wasn't there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I figured he wasn't.
Speaker 1: We just met with his delegation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, we were all extremely disappointed and angry at James Forman and SNCC and what had transpired.  So, we--everybody--you know, we went on back to--I went back to Seattle [Washington] and they went back to Oakland [California] and, and L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and to prepare for Huey's [Huey P. Newton] trial 'cause his trial was coming up in July.
Speaker 2: So, just before we leave that, now, did, did James Forman and the SNCC people go to the UN, too?  Or was just the--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --just the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: --the California--
Speaker 1: They didn't go.
Speaker 2: --Panthers.
Speaker 1: They--it was just--it was just the Panthers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because at that point, the, the merger was fractured--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I remember seeing some, some--there was a article of--there were some articles of demands that James Forman put together and actually did bring the UN at some point, but I don't know--but it wasn't at the same time that you all were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, no.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486302
Speaker 1: So, you know, so we all begin to prepare and organizing to bring people down to Oakland [California] for Huey's [Huey P. Newton] rally.  And also, our slogan was the sky is the limit.  If Huey is not fret- set free, the sky's the limit.  And so the word that was kind of going around the party was that, you know, if they don't set Huey free, you know, it--it's gonna be guerrilla warfare.  So, we were all in our minds kind of preparing for that, you know, kind of preparing for war.  When I got back to Seattle [Washington], about three days later, I'm walking down to the office and I see all these police out in front of the office.  And when I--I, I started to turn around and go back home, but I said, no, I better go down there and see what's going on.  So, I went down there and they said, "Are you [HistoryMaker] Aaron Dixon?"  I said, "Yeah." "Well you're under arrest."  So, they arrested me and they arrested another Panther named Curtis Harris, took us downtown, and charged, charged me with stolen property.  They said that I had carried a stolen typewriter into the Black Panther Party office.  Now, when I was arrested, this word spread throughout the whole community, and by three, four, five o'clock, there was a big rally at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], and the media was there.  They marched down to the jail and I could hear them while I was sitting up in--they had--they had put me in, in--up on the isolation section.  I was the only person on this wing, on this floor, you know, the--I, I was surrounded by all these empty cells.  You know, there was nobody else up, up there.  And I could hear the, the demonstrators yelling, you know, "Free Aaron! Free Aaron!"  And, so I, I had gotten--I was able to talk to my attorney and he was telling me how tense things were, were out there on the streets.  And a, a riot actually broke out at Garfield High School, and this was Seattle's first full-scale riot.  This riot lasted for three days, helicopter was shot down, police cars were overturned, firebombs were thrown.  It--like I said, this was Seattle's first major riot.  It--despite me sending out a note to be read at the rally, you know, to keep things cool, you know, things interrupted, this turned out to be on the front page of the Chicago Tribune.  And when my grandmother saw my picture and my brother's [Elmer Dixon III] picture, she disowned us at that--at that moment, she disowned us because she always wanted my brother to be a doctor and she wanted me to be a lawyer.  You know, she had these high aspirations for us, and here we were, you know, involved in this, you know, this thing (laughter).  So, at that point, we, we wouldn't talk to our grandmother for a very long time.  But, they finally released me at midnight that, that same night.  They released me at midnight on, on personal recognizance 'cause I guess they felt if they released me from jail, things would quiet down in the community, but that wasn't the case.  When I got out, the streets were all barricaded.  We had to go around the long way to get to my parents' [Frances Sledge Dixon and Elmer Dixon, Jr.] house.  When I got to the house, there were like ten, fifteen Panthers there with their rifles and shotguns.  This was twelve at night.  The riot's still going on.  They said, "Aaron, we got to do something.  We got to do something because those are our, our, our, our brothers and relatives down there rioting."  And so I said, "Okay, all right.  Let's, let's try to get on down there."  So, we left out of the house with our rifles and shotguns and we were gonna try to go down there on foot because we couldn't do it by car.  And we got maybe a block away and a helicopter flew over and it shined its light on us and one of the Panthers' comrade shot the light out.  And so we knew that within seconds, that whole place was gonna be surrounded by police.  So, there was a guy who came out on his porch who knew us who was--had joined the party and he called us.  He said, "You guys come on in here."  So, we ran in to his porch, his covered back porch.  And by the time the last man got in there, the whole place was surach- saturated with police.
Story_ID: 486320
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about you all shot at the helicopter and then ran into the--
Speaker 2: Ran into the house (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) house, okay.
Speaker 2: So, the next day--and, and this riot was still continuing.  And what happened was is that, that the whole raid on the office, the arrest, the riot lead to the beginning of a continual confrontation between the Black Panther Party in Seattle [Washington] and the police department.  So, so the very next night, the riot was still going on, parts of the riot were still going on, sniping and firebombing.
Speaker 1: Did the community know that you were free?
Speaker 2: Probably not.  Probably not.  Probably the next day, you know, probably word had gotten out.  But this was a lot of pent up--it, it wasn't necessarily about me.  I was just the catalyst.  There was a lot of pent up anger that had happened for a long period of time just like it was everywhere else.  You know, all we--all, all black people needed was just a reason, give us a reason for us to take to the streets and insurrection, and, and, and that was just the reason to do that.  So, you know, the next night, you know, we went out.  You know, we split up in different groups and we went out to engage the police, you know, in, in, in urban guerrilla warfare.  So, I mean, this continued through the whole summer.  You know, it, it, it got to where, you know, firebombings, snipings was constant, was almost every night, and it was happening all across the country.  Time magazine did a chart of the cities that had the highest rate of firebombing and the highest rate of sniping.  Seattle had the highest, was number one in the country in firebombing and number two in the country in sniping.  So, the Seattle Police Department had put a--
Speaker 1: So, in the--wait, just stop for a minute, but the--you're saying that the sniping was basically--who was firebombed and who was sniped?  Who--are you--are we saying that if, if say the police came into the black community, they were subject to be shot from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they could--
Speaker 1: --by a sniper?
Speaker 2: They were subject--they were subject to be--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --sniped on.
Speaker 1: --whose, whose place would be firebombed?
Speaker 2: All the businesses that were racist, that we remembered as being racist institutions, they were being firebombed.  And unfortunately, there were a lot of businesses that weren't racist that were mistakenly firebombed.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you--how did you resolve that sort of thing with people?  I mean, that's, that's one of the--you know, when you--when you take those kind of actions, there's always somebody that's, that's gonna get hurt that's not necessarily (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's gonna be--
Speaker 1: --in it, you know.
Speaker 2: --victimized, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and--
Speaker 1: So, how did--
Speaker 2: And at that time, we didn't resolve it, you know, and I would find out many years later that this place, this place was firebombed as a result of, of those actions.  So, you know, those were--you know, they, they say those types of things are casualties of war because that--we were at war.  But, but that's, that's exactly what happened.
Story_ID: 486321
Speaker 1: I know in those days I know there was a lot of rhetoric about--rhetoric about a revolution, a revolution's gonna come, a lot of records are made, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --The Last Poets had a album out and, you know, and Gil Scott-Heron was writing about it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the revolution would not be televised.
Speaker 2: Did you--did you really see the country heading towards a full scale revolution yet (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That, that--that's what we felt.  And, and it wasn't just us, it was a lot of other people because you had so many other things taking place.  You had the Vietnam War and all the demonstrations.  You had Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio].  You know, it was just one constant event after another that was taking place in this country that would lead--you know, then you had the, the, the summer of '68 [1968] in Chicago [Illinois] with the--with the Chicago Seven and the--
Speaker 2: At the Democratic Convention [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois], right.
Speaker 1: --trial--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Democratic Convention and what Daley [Richard J. Daley] did.  So, we--yeah, we, we, we felt that '68 [1968]--we felt that, yeah, there's gonna be a revolution in this country.  It was--it was in the air.  It was in the wind.  A revolution was taking place in, in South America and Africa and everywhere else.  So, we were definitely poised to have revolution here in this country.
Story_ID: 486322
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But in reality, it really wasn't the case.  But--so, anyway, in order to the, the--put a end to all this firebombing, the police were really under a lot of pressure, and so they put out a contract out, a twenty-five thousand dollar contract out on my--on my head, and we would learn about this later on.  So--
Speaker 2: So this isn't a reward for your arrest, this is a contract.
Speaker 1: To have me killed, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  They, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To have you killed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wanted to have me killed.  And so, there was a--this guy, young guy who actually was a year older than me.  He just returned back from Vietnam.  He wanted to join the Black Panther Party, so was asking around, asking how can I join the party?  And at this point, the Black Panther Party was heavily infiltrated by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and local police authorities.
Speaker 2: Now, you say that and we know this to be true--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, from history, but at the time, did you have any idea who was with you, was a, a agent and who wasn't or did you have any--
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: --clue?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had these paranoid--you know, we were all--we were very paranoid and so, you know, we always had suspicion about somebody.  There was always some, you know, throwing this thing around, I think So and So is the police.  You know, so, there was always this suspicion, but we could never--we, we really didn't have any intelligence gathering.  We didn't have any way of checking out whether somebody was really an agent or not.  So--
Speaker 2: It should've made it--I've often wondered, you know, and--I think about those times, how people functioned, you know, in an organization when you thought that somebody--and I was never in a paramilitary organization, but how do you function when you--especially in that kind of organization when you think somebody might be, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in there--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was very--
Speaker 2: --how, how do you operate day-to-day when the people, the very people you're dealing with, some, some of them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --are obviously--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --not on your side or, or--
Speaker 1: There's a lot of paranoia, a lot of mistrust, a lot of mistrust.  You didn't necessarily always know if the person next to you trusted you, you know.  So, it was--I was often times a leap of faith.  So, it was really a very, very--you know, outside, we had this thing going on with us and the police, but inside, we also had this thing going on where we really didn't know who to trust.
Story_ID: 486323
Speaker 1: I remember one night, there were three, four Panthers who waited with me for the office to close down and so they said, "We're gonna walk you home," and these are the guys I went to high school [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] with, you know, I knew them.  But they weren't political.  They weren't political.  They were all kind of like involved in the criminal--that was always what they were really more interested in.  So, they say, "Okay, Aaron [HistoryMaker Aaron Dixon], we're gonna walk you home."  So, at that time, things were so bad where our office was, we called it Pork Chop Hill 'cause we were on, on the hill.  There was a fire station around the corner, and we used to snipe at the fire station almost nightly to keep the fire trucks from going out to put out the firebombs that we had thrown.  So, the police would only come up there three cars deep, four in a car, shotguns hanging out the window.  We called it Pork Chop Hill.  That was a famous battle in the Korean War.  So, these guys say, "Okay, we're gonna walk you home."  So, we're walking home, we turn the corner, we're walking down the street late at night, about 10:00, 10:30 at night, and all of the sudden a police car drives by and one of them pulls his gun out and starts shooting.  And the next thing I know, I'm by myself.  These guys have like scattered and disappeared.  I said, shit, I, I better get out of here.  So, I--I'm looking for somewhere to run, so I run up in--up these stairs in--into these people's backyard that I know.  They lived down the street from me.  I, I run in their backyard and I get in the backyard.  I forgot it's, it's a backyard where they have these fifteen feet high bushes around the whole perimeter, there's no way out.  So, I'm in there and I hear the--I hear the police out front.  I hear them getting out of their cars.  I hear them talking.  Then, I hear them start coming up the stairs and I pull out my, my 9mm.  And I said--I was--I said, they got me.  I'm, I'm gonna die tonight, you know.  And just when I thought I was doomed, this man comes out on his porch, his name is Mr. Melinson and he does like this, (gesture) you know, he signals me to come in.  So, I ran into his house and just as he closes the door, the police are all in the backyard looking around.  So, I'm sitting up in the window with him and his wife and his kids and I still got my 9mm in my hand and the police are going through all the bushes, looking under cars.  So, somebody told him I ran into that backyard, you know.  And so they're scrounging all around looking for me, you know.  So, finally, they give up and they leave and I leave and I run home.
Speaker 2: So, they never knocked on the door or anything or tried to--
Speaker 1: No, they didn't knock on the door.  So, this Mr. Melinson, he was--he was from Texas.  He was very light-skinned and he was very conservative.  His kids were all in Catholic school.  We grew up with his family with his kids.  And when we joined the Black Panther Party, he told his kids that they couldn't have anything to do with us anymore 'cause he, he was afraid for their safety, which was understandable.  But, you know, he had--he had the courage enough to, you know, come out there and let me in his house and save my life, you know.  So, it was something that I always--would always be very grateful to him for.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's like counter what used to be some of the rhetoric in those days about middle class being so against (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, the, the cultural revolution and the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the paramilitary people like the Panthers and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and others, RNA [Republic of New Afrika] and being afraid of so-called black militants not being able to get along with them and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but, here's somebody that actually didn't want to do what you all are doing, didn't want his kids doing it, but he understood what you were doing or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 486324
Speaker 1: That summer (laughter), it, it continued to be--you know, there were many, many moments like that where there was--where they--they would surround our office or, you know, there--you know, in November the first Panther would get killed.  Actually, the first Panther was killed in August.  It was a young Panther, seventeen-year-old, who was trying to defend his mother against his stepfather 'cause his mother was beating up his step- his stepfather was beating his mother up, so he went and got his shotgun and the stepfather shot and killed him.  So, he was the first Panther, Henry, Henry Boyd [ph.].  That was in August.  November, Welton Armstead, seventeen-year-old Panther got cornered in his backyard and was killed by the Seattle Police Department.
Speaker 2: What was the charge against him?  What were they trying to--
Speaker 1: Well, well--
Speaker 2: --track him down for?
Speaker 1: --he had--he was one of these young guys--he was involved in some criminal stuff and so he was still working with the party [Black Panther Party].  He was like in, in our underground.  He would bring us weapons, bring us money, and different things like that.  The police, I guess, had followed him to his house one morning after something had happened and he was up in the window and he saw the police down in the yard questioning his mother.  So, he grabbed his rifle and he ran down.  And, you know, the police shot him, shot him, and shot him in his back as a matter of fact.  So, we retaliated as a result of that against the police.  So, you know, this, this just kind of went on for a while.
Story_ID: 486325
Speaker 1: So we start organizing for my arrest because I had been charged with grand larceny, and so we started a whole campaign organizing for that.
Speaker 2: Oh, for that typewriter?
Speaker 1: For the typewriter.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And, and as part of that organizing, the freedom--the--I think it was the Freedom Socialists [Freedom Socialist Party] had--were organizing the, the Free Aaron Dixon campaign, and they organized these speaking engagements in Illinois, so I went back to Chicago [Illinois] in December of '68 [1968] and I met Fred Hampton.  Me and Fred Hampton spoke on the same stage at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I met all the--[HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush and Choka Walls and Che, Che, Billy "Che" Brooks, and all those guys.
Story_ID: 486326
Speaker 1: Just a second on Fred Hampton maybe to--now, Fred Hampton was a--one of the younger, I guess, members of the Panther Party [Black Panther Party], just a couple years younger than you, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, Fred Hampton, we were the same age.
Speaker 1: Same age exactly?
Speaker 2: We were the same age--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess so.  Now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, you and I are the same age, but I always thought--thinking of him as being younger for some reason.
Speaker 2: No, no.  He, he just died young.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 2: At twenty-one years old, you know.  That's--he, he just died young.
Speaker 1: So--and so, it--it's not--wasn't unusual for someone in their, basically just in their late teens to be a leader of the Panther Party?
Speaker 2: No, matter of fact, in Ch- New York [New York], the first head of the New York chapter was Joudan Ford, who was only eighteen years old.  And I got a chance--I stayed at his house when we went there to the UN [United Nations] and got a chance to meet him.  He didn't last very long, but, but he was captain of, of, of New York at eighteen years old.
Speaker 1: Joudan Ford?  How, how, how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Joudan Ford.
Speaker 1: How did he spell his name?
Speaker 2: J-O-U-D-A-N.
Story_ID: 486327
Speaker 1: You went to Chicago [Illinois], you spoke on the same stage with Fred Hampton.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and came back and my trial began, and it--the trial went through its course and it--they--the prosecution had called a secret witness.  And the secret witness, everything was hinging on this secret witness.  And so they, they, they recessed the court to wait for him to show up, and we must've waited for hours and 'cause we wanted to see who this secret witness was 'cause we knew this secret witness was going to be somebody who was an informant in the BPP [Black Panther Party], and he never showed up.  The secret witness never showed up.  And so I was found not guilty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is--this is still in '68 [1968] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is December '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: December '68 [1968], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, by this time, I suppose all the street violence had subsided.
Speaker 2: Yeah, be- bec- when the winter came--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, it seems like it's always--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when winter came (laughter), it always subsides.
Story_ID: 486328
Speaker 1: So, then January came and we get a call from central headquarters that Alprentice "Bunchy" Carter [Bunchy Carter], the head--the deputy minister of defense of the Southern California chapter along with the deputy minister of information, John Huggins were assassinated in Los Angeles, California, by--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the US Organization [The Organization Us].
Speaker 2: Now, now that's a story that--I know that's gotten a lot of coverage over the years and from the story, I know the US Organization tells that there actually was a shootout over a disputed election in the--for the black student union head--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at the University of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at the--was it--
Speaker 1: At UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: UCLA.  And two faction--the, the Panthers and the US Organization both showed up, one backed--one, one, one group backed a candidate, the other group backed another candidate.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there were words and there was actually a shootout on the campus (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's how--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Bunchy Carter--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was killed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It, it wasn't really a shootout.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different stories behind it, but someone said something about someone.  You know, I, I heard Elaine Brown's name was thrown in there.  And these guys from the US Organization pulled their guns out and just started shooting, you know, and they killed Bunchy and killed John.  And the Panthers went back to organize themselves and retaliate and they were all arrested by the L.A. Police Department [Los Angeles Police Department].  There was about fifteen to twenty of them were all arrested by the L.A. Police Department while they were trying to recoup to retaliate against the US Organization.  But, it was a tremendous blow for the L.A. chapter because Bunchy Carter was head of the largest gang in, in Los Angeles called the Slausons and he was considered the most important figure in the Black Panther Party as a whole next to Huey [Huey P. Newton] and Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] and Bobby Seale, and for him to be assassinated, the--it would really send the Southern California chapter on a demise.  Geronimo Pratt would eventually take his place as head of the Southern California chapter.  But we all went down to his funeral.  This was in January of '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 486329
Speaker 1: There have been some dis- some things written about the affiliation or affiliations or the gang related affiliations of the Panthers, especially when--after Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] was killed, you know, that was, what, maybe twelve years ago or something?
Speaker 2: That was about '87 [1987], '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Oh, it was longer than that then.
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, almost twenty--gosh, it's twenty years (laughter) ago.
Speaker 2: Long time.
Speaker 1: I'm getting old, I guess.  But, when he was killed, there was a lot of ink in the papers and then articles and magazines about his ties with gangs going all the way back to the beginning of the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] to street gang basically activity and not where many people would see the Panthers as a political organization, some of the articles suggested that really like just a, a outgrowth of, of street gang activity amongst--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, youth in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Oakland [California] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, the, the, the gangs were--before the Black Panther Party, the gangs were at their zenith in America in '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], you know, Blackstone Rangers--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --Black Gangster Disciples, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], they had the--they had numerous gangs.  They had the, the Slausons and the Farmers and many other big gangs, and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York [New York].  So when the Black Panther Party did come on the scene, that whole gang problem in America subsided.  It really stopped.  It was really at its lowest point during the era of the Black Panther Party.
Story_ID: 486330
Speaker 1: Now, 1971, Huey [Huey P. Newton] gets out of prison and, you know, it was a--just a small local organization when he went into prison.  When he gets out, it's a international organization.  He's a international hero.  He's a poster child for the revolution here in America and he, he is anointed with power, influence, and access to large amounts of money.  And so he didn't know any of these people who are now calling themselves Black Panther Party members in Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], and all these.  He didn't know any of these people.  He didn't know if he--even if he could trust any of them.  He didn't know who to trust.
Speaker 2: 'Cause all this had kind of grown when he was in jail.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he didn't--he didn't create it, basically, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he didn't create it.
Speaker 2: --inspired it by--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --inadvertently in a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was just a local, local--was trying to do something local for his community.  I don't think he really every envisioned, you know, being this international figure.  So, while he was very bright and very articulate and a genius, he was also very--he wasn't a person that really liked to be around crowds and be around a lot of people.  And, you know, when he spoke, he spoke like a college intellectual.  Many people thought he was very boring when he spoke, even people in the party, and the things that he was talking about was, was way above the heads of a lot of the people, but he did make an attempt to bring us up to his level intellectually and help us.  He created these intellectual institutes where--ideological institutes where Panthers had to come from across the country and, and study dialectical materialism.
Story_ID: 486331
Speaker 1: But, backing up a little bit to December, December 4th--December 6th, I think it was, when Fred Hampton was assassinated.  Now, in January of '69 [1969], Bunchy Carter was--he was the most important figure to be assassinated in the Black Panther Party.  A year later, Fred Hampton, who was getting ready to be appointed to the central committee, which would have been the first person outside of California to be appointed to the central committee, he was also a rising star.  He was traveling all over the country, all over the world as a figure.  So, he was--here you got this person now who's emerging as this new tremendous leader, this person who organized the Rainbow Coalition in America in Chicago [Illinois] with, with the poor whites, the poor Latinos, and the black community became a threat to Mayor Daley's [Richard J. Daley] machine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now he was also like tremendously articulate and--
Speaker 1: Tremendously articulate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was probably what people were expecting when they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --were expecting to hear Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton].
Speaker 1: From Huey, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but Fred Hampton was really--had the, the charisma and the--
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 2: --command of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He could relate--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to the common person--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and speak--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on a high level.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Now, Huey could relate to the common person, but he, he didn't speak--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't have the--
Speaker 1: --that way.
Speaker 2: When you heard his voice--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --he almost sounded like a rural white guy--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from the, the--
Speaker 1: Like, like--
Speaker 2: --Arkansas or something.
Speaker 1: Intellectual or somebody.  And, and Fred Hampton, you know, he could speak like a Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Malcolm X all rolled into one.  So, then he gets assassinated and this, this is in January.  This is a year later after Bunchy Carter is assassinated.  Now, you got two of the most important figures in the party assassinated and you got Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] living in exile.  A number of other Panthers have already gone into exile, Bill Brent [William Lee Brent] in exile in Cuba.
Story_ID: 486332
Speaker 1: Now, let me pause here for a minute and just, just kind of surround this.  The, the--you say assassinated and it's--now, it's well known the Chicago Police Department did assassinate him [Fred Hampton]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --under--with a program that they called the Red Squad--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that some called the Red Squad, which nominally was supposed to be anti-Communist, but was really used to stop any organization that wanted social change in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was part of the COINTELPRO [Counterintelligence Program].  And, and what happened was, J. Edgar Hoover sent out a memo to three FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] officers that he wanted these three chapters of the Black Panther Party destroyed, that was Chicago, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and Chicago.
Speaker 1: Chicago, L.A., and--
Speaker 2: Seattle [Washington], L.A. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seattle.
Speaker 2: --and Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, in September of '69 [1969], my brother [Elmer Dixon III] and I got a call from this black guy who worked for the justice department and he wanted to meet with us.  We said, "Man, we don't want to meet with nobody from the justice department," you know, so we said no.  So, he kept calling back, he said, man, it's a matter of life and death.  So we said, okay, we better meet with him.  So, we met with him on the corner downtown by the federal building.
Speaker 1: Is this a local justice department person?
Speaker 2: Local justice department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he tells us that they are going to raid our office and, and kill us, and assassinate us.  Now, we didn't know when he told us that that this was part of this memo that came from J. Edgar Hoover that went to Chicago and went to L.A.  So, we immediately start fortifying our office with sandbags and steel and this is what all the chapters and branches were doing, were fortifying their, their community centers with sandbags and steel.  We got bulletproof vests.  We ordered bulletproof vests, we got gas masks.  So, we were really redesigning our headquarters to withstand the onslaught of a police raid.
Speaker 1: You were preparing yourselves to meet it with resistance as well.
Speaker 2: We were preparing ourselves to meet it with resistance (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Meet that with full scale resistance.
Story_ID: 486333
Speaker 1: And we had Geronimo [Geronimo Pratt] and other Panthers were--went all over the country helping to fortify headquarters.  And we have one of the most fortified offices in, in, in the country of all the Panther [Black Panther Party] chapters and branches.  So, on this morning of December 4th, actually it's very--December 4th is--what happened was the, the ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearm [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] were a part of this assault on Fred Hampton's house, and Fred Hampton had been, the night before been meeting with his, his coordinators and they, they--you know, this is part of what we did.  We worked all day, worked all night, and we met during the course of the night.  When it was time to go to sleep, we just went to sleep.  And so Fred Hampton went in his bedroom with his wife [Deborah Johnson] and the Panthers--just--everybody just went to sleep on the floor in the living room.  And his security head had given the layout to the ATF of Fred Hampton's house, and he had also put Seconal in Fred Hampton's drink.  So, four o'clock in the morning, they knock on the door, Mark Clark goes to the door with his shotgun, captain of the Peoria, Illinois, says, "Who is it?"  Police shot through the door, killed him instantly.  They burst through the back door with machine guns.  They run in to the living room and just start shooting the Panthers on the floor.  They go into Fred Hampton's room, his wife tries to wake him up, they lowered the machine guns, she can't wake him up 'cause he's drugged, and they machine gun him while he's in his bed asleep.  She rolls out of the bed.  And so the very next day, the Panthers opened Fred Hampton's house up and over one thousand people go through that house to see that it was the police that instigated 'cause the police tried to say it was the Panthers that shot first, but they showed that it was opposite.
Story_ID: 486341
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about the murder of Fred Hampton--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --December of 1969.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the revelation later on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --subsequent revelation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all the shots came from the outside.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the shots.
Speaker 1: Yeah, none from the inside.
Speaker 2: And I, I remember getting a call from central headquarters, June Hilliard, the chief of--assistant chief of staff, he called me--I had--we had just gotten up, everybody had left for the breakfast program [Free Breakfast for School Children Program].  I was the only one at the headquarters [for the Black Panther Party], and the phone rang, June Hilliard on the other line.  He said, "Fred Hampton has just been killed."  Now, we had already had probably about ten Panthers that already had been killed.  I had already been to about three Panther funerals, but none was hit as hard as the murder of Fred Hampton because anybody who met Fred Hampton knew that this--he was really something special.  He was really the next great leader of black America.  And just to hear that his life was snatched away like that was--it was--it was so devastating.  It was so devastating.  So, I remember putting on a bandolier of my shotgun shells and jacking a round off on my shotgun and just looking out the window and wishing that the police would come up and try to do something and just really being angry.
Story_ID: 486342
Speaker 1: It was two later--two days later the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] and the Los Angeles Police Department attempted to raid the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] chapter headquarters.  And, you know, the L.A. Panthers [Black Panther Party] were the most military minded chapter throughout the whole country and that was because of the L.A. Police Department.  And we were talking about who was worst, the most corrupt or the most para- paramilitary.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: There's no doubt it was the most--it was the paramilitary.
Speaker 2: The police department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The--it was L.A.--
Speaker 2: --L.A. versus the--
Speaker 1: L.A. Police Department was--
Speaker 2: --Chicago Police Department.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were saying that the Chicago--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Police Department was the most corrupt.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: L.A. was, was, was, was the most difficult to deal with because they were paramilitary and they--more Panthers had been killed in L.A. than in Chicago [Illinois], so this raid on the--on, on, on central headquarters in Los Angeles, the Panthers had built a bunker inside their office.  This was under the leadership of Geronimo [Geronimo Pratt].  They built a, a sandbag bunker inside their office.  Then, they took all the chairs and tables and lined them up on both sides of the wall because they knew when the SWAT [Special Weapons and Tactics] team came in, he liked to go to the right and then liked to go to the left.  So, they put these barricades so--and they had a, a machine gun nest on the second floor, the Panthers did.  So, when this raid began, the police had cordoned the area off for like three or four miles.  They kicked people out of their houses.  They blocked the whole--all the streets off so nobody could get in, nobody could get out, and they began this raid.  They had--they had a tank, they had helicopters, and so five SWAT team members burst through the front door, and when the burst through the door, this bunker was in front of them and the Panthers just cut loose with the M-14s and blew them right out the door, and the shootout lasted for six to eight hours.  And there were several Panthers that were wounded in that shootout.  And eventually when daylight came and a lot of people were--finally came out on the streets, they put up the white flag and they surrendered.  And, and eighteen of them were arrested and were charged with attempted murder.  Also--
Speaker 2: So, none of the police were killed.
Speaker 1: None of them were killed but some of them were wounded.  Also, they had raided the house where Geronimo and Elaine Brown were in, some, some of the other officers of the party were at.  And they actually machine gunned the whole house at this level.  If anybody had been standing up or awake, sitting up, they would've been dead.
Speaker 2: Were they present at the time when the house was--
Speaker 1: They were in the house.  They were all arrested and taken down and charged with, with attempted murder.
Story_ID: 486343
Speaker 1: Three days later, the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] comes to Seattle [Washington] and they go to Mayor Wes Uhlman's [Wesley C. Uhlman] office and they ask--tell the mayor that they have information that we have illegal weapons in our office and they, you know, want to conduct a raid along with the Seattle Police Department.  Well, Mayor Wes Uhlman, you know, was, was fairly progressive mayor and he had just heard about what happened in Chicago [Illinois] with Fred Hampton and in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and there was no way that he wanted to have our blood on his hands.  Seattle was a small town, small community, you know, and, and we were well-known throughout the whole community, throughout the whole city, so there was no way that he was going to allow this to happen.  So, he actually, he told them, he said, well, my informant tells him that they don't have any illegal weapons in the office, so I'm not gonna let you--I'm not gonna give you the use of the Seattle Police Department to go up there.  And so we feel very fortunate that he took that stance because there's no telling, you know, who, how many people would've died had they made that attempted raid at our office.  As a result of him taking that stance, when he would go back to the mayor's conference [U.S. Conference of Mayors] two or three years later back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], he was met by Ehrlichman who was Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon]--
Speaker 2: Oh, John--
Speaker 1: --chief of staff.
Speaker 2: John Ehrlichman.
Speaker 1: John Ehrlichman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was met at the door and told him that you're not welcome in here, you're not welcome here (laughter) because of that position that he took.  So--
Speaker 2: So, this is Mayor Welman?
Speaker 1: Mayor Wes Uhlman.
Speaker 2: Wes Uhlman.
Speaker 1: Wes Uhlman, yeah.
Speaker 2: Uhlman.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: I think it's U-L-M-A-N [sic.].
Speaker 2: Ulan.
Speaker 1: Uhlman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: U-L-M-A-N.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Uhlman, yeah.  And Wes is W-E-S.
Story_ID: 486344
Speaker 1: And so after that incident, there were several more attempted raids on the--on our office.  There were three police officers that were assigned to follow us and harass us all the time and the party also began what was called the purge because there were--there were some criminal behavior that was taking place in the party because a lot of the early members who did join the party had been involved in street gangs and other activities, and we didn't really have any way to really take care of--to pay party members, you know, give them money to live off of.  So, you know, they would just go take their money, rob a bank, rob a store.  And so Huey [Huey P. Newton] had given the order from prison that we needed to have a purge and purge the ranks of all of the--these people who were involved in these criminal activities.  So, you know, we had--our organ--we, we shrunk from, you know, maybe a hundred members, 150 members down to about twenty-five dedicated members.  This happened all over the country and in most places anyway--
Speaker 2: This is the--
Speaker 1: --where a lot of these elements were purged, a lot of these people were expelled from the party.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is this why there was a moratorium on Panther [Black Panther Party] membership (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was why there was a moratorium on--that and because we were being infiltrated by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and so that was--that was the reason for both.
Speaker 2: So you kind of kept a buffer--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, even new members that might be sincere might be kept at, at like arm's length--
Speaker 1: Yeah and the--
Speaker 2: --from core.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they would--they would just be members of the National Committee to Combat Fascism.
Story_ID: 486345
Speaker 1: And as it turned out--and, and also, you know, when we started the breakfast program [Free Breakfast for School Children Program] 'cause we started our breakfast programs in '69 [1969], a lot of the guys felt that, you know, hey, I'm not gonna go serve no breakfast.  I joined the Black Panther Party to shoot police not to serve breakfast to little kids.
Speaker 2: Now, how did that occur?  How did that come about, the breakfast program?  Because that's one of the enduring legacies of the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Well because we realized that, that we had to do something for our community other than just walk around carrying guns, that there were a lot of other very important serious issues that were happening with, with the community, particularly because the Vietnam War was taking place and there was a--it was a economic down--it was a period of economic downturn where a lot of people were on food stamps, there weren't a lot of resources that weren't--resources going into the community.  These resources were going for the war.  So, there was po- a lot of poverty, increase in poverty.  So we said, okay, so, you know, this breakfast program concept was created in Oakland [California] by one of the Panthers that came up with the idea.  There's a debate around who exactly came up with the idea but it was a good idea, you know, serve these, you know, poor kids who are on their way to school who most likely haven't even had any breakfast.  So we said, okay, how can little Johnny learn that five apples and four apples equals nine apples, he ain't even had the apple.  So, we went to churches and community centers that were located near elementary schools and we set up these free breakfast programs.  We set them up all across the country.
Speaker 2: Now, now that--the breakfast program seemed to be a way to channel, correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of the heartfelt donations of people nationwide.  I mean, a lot of people donated to the Panther Party.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Students, Hollywood actresses--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --millionaires, other people donated.  They wanted to do something for the Panther Party 'cause they saw the Panther Party as a legitimate expression of the communities, you know, resistance to oppression and its, its desire to do something for itself.  So, so the breakfast program, did you ever have to worry about where the food was coming from here in Seattle [Washington]?
Speaker 1: Well, not, not really, not really.  I mean, yes and no, but, you know, we, we went to the businesses in the community, small businesses, big businesses, you know, the big bakeries, the big meat companies.  We went to people so, you know, we had persons who were in charge of coordinating the breakfast program and we had persons that were in charge of, of procuring contributions, and this was their job all day, every day, was, was procuring donations, setting up the breakfast program, making sure there's people there that are working the breakfast programs.  So--
Speaker 2: So, where did you set up initially?  Did you have to--did you--could you set up in a school or, or was it done at the church or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, we couldn't do it at the school.
Speaker 2: --or where was it?
Speaker 1: We had to do it at the community center--
Speaker 2: Was, was--
Speaker 1: --near a school or a church near a school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, what was--who was your first partner here in Seattle?
Speaker 1: Our first partner was the Madrona Presbyterian Church [Madrona Grace Presbyterian Church, Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which was up in Madrona [Seattle, Washington], which is where our headquarters was located.  Initially, none of the black churches would let us have a breakfast program.  The, the first one to really jump up and allow us to use this breakfast program was a Japanese guy who ran a--the Atlantic Street Center [Seattle, Washington], which was down the street from Colman elementary school [Colman School, Seattle, Washington], and we had our really first strongest breakfast program there at the Atlantic Street Center.  And then we--then we opened up breakfast programs in all the housing projects and eventually we got the mothers to come take over the breakfast programs.  All we had to do was make sure the food was there and the welfare mothers came in and they cooked the food, they cleaned up, and they ran--you know, they, they just--they made sure everything was taken care of.  But, in Chicago [Illinois], we were feeding thousands of kids, New York [New York], thousands of kids, all over the country, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], hundreds of kids.  And, in, in Chicago and L.A., the police actually came into the breakfast program with guns drawn to try to scare and intimidate the kids.
Speaker 2: Now, now was there a resistance on the part of--I know at one, one point, you said that Bobby Seale was--seemed to be comfortable with the fact that you were doing so many community activities, acting--serving as the police in some cases--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in, in neighborhoods that had no police (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --protection and such.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How did he feel about the breakfast program?  Did he--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, he, he, he believed very strongly in the breakfast program.  Now, the breakfast program was different from, you know, somebody calling up and saying can you come out here and do this?  That was very different.  This is what we were supposed to be doing, working in the community.  This is what Bobby Seale meant, is what he wanted us to be doing actual work and, and organizing in the community, not constantly--
Speaker 2: Not just responding, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) answering to all these calls--
Speaker 2: Answering calls.
Speaker 1: --from the community because a lot of these calls weren't really legitimate, you know.  They were--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --petty, petty.  A lot of them were just petty things.
Speaker 2: Okay, so rather than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A number of things.
Speaker 2: --reactionary, he wanted--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --you to take a--take the initiative and do--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --things, okay.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Story_ID: 486346
Speaker 1: So along with the breakfast program [Free Breakfast for School Children Program], we began to open up a lot of other programs.  We had the--now, you asked me about the donations.  One of the things that we did that was significant was that Safeway [Safeway Inc.] refused to donate to the breakfast program.  This was all over the country, so we got a order to boycott Safeway.  In Seattle [Washington], we had two Safeway stores in the black community and we closed those stores down.  We successfully closed them down, ran them out of the community.  And it wasn't up until about six years ago that Safeway came back into the community after all these years.  But, as a result of us running Safeway out, there was a, a small Jewish grocery store that used to give us a lot of donations.  You know, we, we, could come in and get whatever we needed.  But he--because he was the only store in the community, his, his business really grew.  And, you know, we, we, we became lifelong friends, this Jewish store owner and the Black Panther Party (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What, what was the name of the store and who was the owner?
Speaker 1: His name was--oh, god.  I, I, I should know it.  I should know his name 'cause I had lunch with him about five years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, it--it'll come.  It'll come to me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what was the name of the store?
Speaker 1: The name of the store, it was his name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I can't think--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of his name--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --right now.
Story_ID: 486347
Speaker 1: So, you know, we started the, the free busing to prisons program.  We started free shoe program.  We started free clothing program.  We started the legal aid program where people could come by three times a week and meet with a, a lawyer.  We started the--a free medical clinic.  We opened up our first free medical clinic in December of '69 [1969] here in Seattle [Washington] and San Francisco [California] had a free medical clinic.  Chicago [Illinois] opened up their medical clinic.  Boston [Massachusetts] opened up a medical clinic.
Speaker 2: And I hear your medical clinic is still going on today (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, our--
Speaker 2: --here in Seattle, right?
Speaker 1: Our medical clinic is still open today.
Speaker 2: And what--what's the name of it now?  It's--
Speaker 1: Carolyn Downs Medical Clinic [sic. Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center, Seattle, Washington].  It used to be called Carolyn Downs--it used to be called the Sidney Miller Free Medical Clinic 'cause Sidney Miller was a Panther [member, Black Panther Party] that was killed here in Chicag- here in Seattle.  He was originally from Chicago but he was killed, so we named the clinic after him.  There was a sister named Carolyn Downs who worked in the clinic and she died of cancer, so we named it after her.  So, our, our busing to prisons program went to five prisons every month.  Somebody donated a huge thirty-five passenger bus to us.  Chicago, somebody donated a Greyhound [The Greyhound Corporation; Greyhound Lines, Inc.] bus to the Chicago chapter.  So, we, we actually had over sixty programs that we were doing in the community plus the liberation school which was the first summer, summer, summer school program.  You know, there, there weren't any summer programs for kids back in those days.  We started what was called the liberation school.  That was the first summer program.  And Chuck D was in that program in New York.  So what--it essentially was--
Speaker 2: So, he, he was a kid in it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was a kid.
Speaker 2: --you're, you're saying?  Yeah, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Essentially--
Speaker 2: --people watching this now, they hear Chuck D--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they think of him as big Chuck D.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're talking about Chuck D as a little kid.
Speaker 1: Little Chuck D as a kid.
Speaker 2: That's--yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And--Shakur's--Tupac Shakur--
Speaker 1: Tupac Shakur, yeah.
Speaker 2: --was a little kid involved with--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --those programs, too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486348
Speaker 1: The more of these programs we start implementing, the more really the Black Panther Party came under attack.  And so it wasn't 'til, let me see--and then--and then, Huey [Huey P. Newton] gets out of prison in '71 [1971] and we had a revolutionary constitutional convention at Temple University in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that we--a lot of us from here went back to but everybody came from all over the country.  That was a tremendous event.  That was the first major speech that Huey gave when he got out of prison and then they followed that up with a--with a constitutional convention in Washington, D.C., to rewrite the constitution.  And it was right around after that time that the split occurred within the Black Panther Party, and it had--Huey--Eldridge [Eldridge Cleaver] was in exile in Algeria.  The Algerian government had given the Black Panther Party diplomatic status, had given them a, a compound.  Arafat [Yasser Arafat] had actually came over to visit Eldridge and some of the New York [New York] Panthers who were in exile, D.C., Don Cox [Donald L. Cox], who was a former organizer in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] but had became the--one of the field marshals of the Black Panther Party.  He was living in exile with Eldridge.  Arafat came over to meet with them and left them with a couple of cases of AK-47s.  Then, we also had diplomatic status with North Korea.  So, you know, the Black Panther Party had really had turned into a international organization.  We also had organized support organizations in every major country in Europe as well as in Israel as well as in India and Japan and South Korea, in the Philippines, in Palestine, all these--all--we--all these people were looking at the Black Panther Party as the vanguard of this new international worldwide movement to overthrow the colonial rulers.
Speaker 2: Now, Eldridge Cleaver, he was in, you said, Algeria.  I know--now, Pete O'Neal was in--had to get out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Pete O'Neal--
Speaker 2: --from Kansas City [Missouri] to go to--
Speaker 1: Pete O'Neil and his wife [Charlotte O'Neal]--
Speaker 2: --Tanzania, right?
Speaker 1: --went to Tanzania.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there were other Panther leaders in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, in, in Africa and all--other parts of Africa.  So, and, and they are still about maybe seven or eight Panthers still in Cuba at that time.
Speaker 2: Now, did you have a, a plan yourself on how to get out of here in case things got hot?
Speaker 1: You know, we had a--we worked very closely with the Communist Party here and we had a--developed a underground railroad to Vancouver, Canada, and we smuggled, you know, a handful of people who were mainly dodged--draft dodgers out of the country to Canada.  So, we did have a way to get out of here if we had to get out and there was--you know, to go through Canada.
Story_ID: 486349
Speaker 1: We're talking about 1971, right, where we're at right now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: In those days, there was the--did you feel that most people in the City of Seattle [Washington] felt positively about the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] or hated it or what?  I mean, what--how did you feel--think?
Speaker 2: No, no, we--no, we, we--oh, man, we, we got--we were really--you know, this is what the Black Panther Party represented to the community and this was wherever there was a Black Panther Party.  If there was ever any kind of entity, any type of legislation, any type of threat aimed at the black community, the Black Panther Party was there to stop it in its track, stop it.  Anything that was gonna harm the community whatsoever, we were there.  We stood between the black community and anything that was gonna do it--do it harm, you know.  And so that's how the people really looked upon us, as, as their saviors.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember there was a story in the daily news of a little kid, a black kid who was going to a--bussed to an all-white school and was harassed and he, he said, I'll, I'll call the Black Panthers, and it--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --it seriously frightened the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --white parents--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, of the school, though (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I don't know who he was gonna call--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but he--that, that was the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, just the name--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sent--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, so, so--now, we were--I think in the early days, there were a lot of people that were scared of us 'cause we were walking around with guns and our main focus was confronting the police and there were shootouts and all this stuff.  And so, you know, by 1969, we had actually taken our uniforms off.  And in 1969--
Speaker 1: Meaning that people would not wear black leather jackets and berets--
Speaker 2: They weren't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they weren't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and field jackets and combat boots.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're ordered to start wearing--dressing like the people because we, we were separating ourselves from the community by wearing the uniforms on, carrying the guns, and talking all that rhetoric, and it made it easier for the police to come down upon us and isolate us and wipe us out.  So, we realized we had to be more of a--of a community.  We also stopped any storefront offices.  We put our offices in houses in the middle of the communities so that we could be more a part of the community and if they tried to raid us, hopefully they would not be able to use an all-out assault on us.  So, you know, the, the really important part about the party is that we read a lot, we studied a lot, and we understood the concept of change.  We understood that nothing stood outside of change.  And so we were a organization that was always changing because, because we read a lot.  We were always changing.  We knew we had to change.  We weren't like, like the Nation of Islam that stayed the same way for twenty, thirty years or some of the other organizations that came along and stayed the same way for five or ten years.  We were constantly adapting, constantly changing 'cause we knew we had to do that in order to survive.
Story_ID: 486350
Speaker 1: Well what was your relationship with the Nation [Nation of Islam]?  I, I remember one incident in Dayton [Ohio] where I got to the corner of 5th Street and I think Broadway [Street] and there was a building there and, and I was confronted by two paper salesmen.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: One brother had the Panther paper [The Black Panther Community News Service; The Black Panther Intercommunal News Service] and the other brother had the, the Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they were both--they, they both hit me at the same time.  And I looked, I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this, this should be in a movie, is what I thought--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the time 'cause they were both there at the same time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, what, what was the relationship with the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, we, we, we respected them.  It was kind of a hands--like a arm's length relationship.  We respected them, they respected us as long as they didn't do anything to infringe upon our territory or whatever.  We didn't have any kind of working coalition with them or anything like that.  But, it was always a tenuous relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it wasn't one 'cause the--in the community, the--most black people respected the organizational capacity of the Nation of Islam and that they ostensibly at least were respectable and treated people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the community with respect and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, usually would do what they said they were gonna do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, though, they, they weren't known for--as you said, they didn't change their ideas much.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the same ideas constantly.
Story_ID: 486351
Speaker 1: But at this time, though, I remember that there was a lot of criticism within the Panther [Black Panther Party] ranks around Eldridge Cleaver's activities and some people were saying that he was just an adventurist and maybe more self-absorbed than perhaps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, was desirable.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that pretty accurate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  There, there, there was--there was--yeah, there was criticism around Eldridge, but, you know, the thing about the party was, you had these--such strong figures that there was kind of a, a, a cult--I don't know if that's the right word, but it was kind of cult around each figure.  There was a, a cult of people that would follow Eldridge to the grave and believe in everything he said, and there was people that felt that way about Huey [Huey P. Newton], and there was people that felt that way about Bobby Seale.  So, when the--when, when Eldridge got on, on what's his name's TV show?
Speaker 1: That--'Meet The Press' or something or?
Speaker 2: No, what's his name?  He--Larry King.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Larry King.  When he got on Larry King show, Eldridge was in Algeria, Huey was in Oakland [California], and they had them both on the phone.  And Eldridge came out and started criticizing Huey about David Hilliard and June Hilliard and about some other things, and he wanted Huey to expel them, and Huey said, "No, I expel you." 'Cause Huey was very upset that he would voice those things in the media.  And, and so, you know, they got into a big argument on, on, on the day--on the Larry King show, which lead to the split of the Black Panther Party.  And a lot of the East Coast Panthers and the--some of the San Francisco [California] Panthers, some of the Berkeley [California] Panthers identified with Eldridge and they went with Eldridge.  Most of the Midwest, most of the East Coast, Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], they sided with Huey.  And so you had this split in the Black Panther Party.  One faction, Eldridge Cleaver wanted to wage guerrilla warfare.  They weren't really keen on the breakfast program concept [Free Breakfast for School Children Program].  They wanted to go out and start waging guerrilla warfare.  That's where the Black Liberation Army was formed and they actually did began robbing armored cars and robbing banks.
Speaker 1: Assata Shakur and--
Speaker 2: Assata Shakur and all that stuff.  And, and there was a little war that took place between the two factions.  There were people that were killed on both sides.  This guy named Sam Napier who I mentioned early on--
Speaker 1: Who sold the papers who is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) who, who--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --brought the circulation of the Black Panther newspaper [The Black Panther Community News Service; The Black Panther Intercommunal News Service] up to 350,000 papers per week around the whole world, and that was astonishing for a alternative newspaper to have that big of a circulation worldwide and, and this guy, Sam Napier, was a big part of that.  But he was--he became one of the victims of this.
Speaker 1: Was he killed by--
Speaker 2: He was killed by the New York [New York] Panthers, by--I don't--I guess I don't need to name names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, he was killed and there was a, a Panther who was from San Francisco who was killed in Oak- in San Francisco.  There were people killed on both sides.  So, in response to that, Huey wanted to consolidate and bring everybody to Oakland for several different reasons.  He wanted to bring everybody to Oakland so that everybody really had a full concept of what it was to be in the Black Panther Party and bring all the forces together.  Number two, he wanted to make Oakland a base of operation.  He had a plan to take over Oakland, take over the mayor's seat, take over the city council.
