 Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Today is August 6, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Today we   re in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to speak with  Kent and Carol Olson regarding their memories and experiences with  former governor and U.S. senator, Henry Bellmon. Thank you for  having me in your home today. Let   s start with you, Carol. Tell us a little  bit about yourself, where you were born, where you grew up, that type of  thing.  Okay, I was actually born in Washington, D.C., in 1943. My dad was  stationed there getting ready to be sent overseas in World War II. So  Mother was there when she was ready to have me, and we stayed for two  or three months after I was born and moved back to a little town in the  panhandle of Oklahoma, Hooker, Oklahoma, which is in Texas County.  I went to primary school and high school there, moved my senior year to  the panhandle of Texas, a little town called Perryton. My father was in  business by that time. I got married after I got out of high school and had  my three children, and that marriage didn   t last. In 1975, I moved to  Stillwater to finish school. In 1977 I received my bachelor   s degree in  sociology and my master   s in    79, and my doctorate in    82. I was on the   adjunct  faculty in sociology  with  a joint appointment, for the next   several  years, in central administration, in Whitehurst Hall. I was the  graduate academic services director for a long time, then in the research  administration in various capacities for a long time. I retired in 19     No, you retired in 2000-something. (Laughs)  2000-something. Subtract seven years from that. (Laughs)  Five   six, I think.  Yes, six years ago.  5  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  2005, I believe.  2005.  Why OSU?  That   s an interesting question. I said it was my last formal act of  rebellion because all of my family were OU  University of Oklahoma   graduates. But I think it was because I had three little children, and I  thought Stillwater was a healthy place to come as a single parent. And I  met Kent when I was a senior. We got married in    77. I went through my  undergraduate, finished that in two   what I had left in two years. He  was on the faculty in economics. He had two children, I had three, so we  had five, and we had all five of them   all five of them were in college at  the same time. So that was an interesting decade.  Well, as a matter of fact, there were six of you in college at the same  time.  That   s true. (Laughter) That   s true. I was finishing my dissertation.  We could   ve easily won the blanket at Homecoming, I   m sure, because I  don   t think anybody else had six kids going to school at OSU   or six  members of the family.  Yes, my last   when my daughter was taking courses as a senior in high  school     Yes, yes        the semester I was finishing my dissertation.  Six of them were actually taking classes     The other four were full-time college students.  And no price break at that time, was there, on tuition?  No, there was not  (Laughs) Is there now?  No, we always said every raise went into tuition.  Yes, the biggest raise we got was the year the last kid went off the  payroll.  6  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  K. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  So we just cycled it right back into the university.  Yes.  You were motivated quite a bit to finish, just bam, bam, bam.  I sure was motivated. I just told you why. (Laughter)  Your turn, Kent.  Oh, I was born in Hudson, Wisconsin. You get me on an airplane and  head back to Minneapolis, the accent comes back. But around here, I  don   t think it does. I actually finished high school in Phoenix, Arizona  and undergraduate school at Arizona State University, where I met the  future dean of the College of Business Administration at OSU. So after I  got a PhD in econ at Oregon, I was in the job market, and they had an  opening at OSU. And I knew somebody on the faculty, and so I ended  up here in 1974 and went through the ranks and finally retired in 2009.  That   s pretty much the career. Most of my academic career was here at  Oklahoma State as professor of economics.  Okay. We   ll transition into the reason we   re here. We   ll start with you,  Carol, if you want to share the first time you ever met Mr. Bellmon.  I probably had met him when he was in office, and I had been a  spectator at things, and you go through and you shake hands. But the  first time I met him, which became kind of a lasting professional  relationship that was a good ten years was   this may be his birthday.  It   s nearly September, the 6th or the 7th.  It is, but I   m not sure.  Tom Collins was the vice-president for research. He had come from the  University of Tennessee, and so he really didn   t understand Oklahoma  politics and Oklahoma culture. It was the same time that Governor  Bellmon had just finished that term and was going to do some teaching  in the poli-sci department at Oklahoma State. So Dr. Collins called him  and asked him if he would come over and visit with him, and just kind  of would he be willing to mentor him about Oklahoma politics and  culture. He needed to raise money and learn the people who were the  ones to be friends with and the ones to watch your back with and all  those kinds of things. So he came over. And at this time, I was still the  director of Graduate Student Services   Academic Services, but when  they merged, the graduate dean at that time and the vice-president for  research, that was the first time there had been a vice-president for  research as a stand-alone position, but he got no new staff. So I got  7  K. Olson  Finchum  K. Olson  C. Olson  transitioned from that job to I think it was called Director of Planning  and Operations or something like that. So I was sitting in on all of these  meetings, knowing that I was going to sort of be the right-hand person to  Dr. Collins. So Governor Bellmon was there, Dr. Collins was saying  what help that he needs. Governor Bellmon is excited about doing this.  He   d be glad to and they talked more, and they sat about and visited.  Governor Bellmon got up out of the chair, walked to the door, turned  around, and smiled. He had this half-smile and said,    This is my  seventieth birthday.    And he says,    I   m really glad to be here.    So that  was the beginning of doing a lot of projects with Henry Bellmon.  I was sitting here trying to think of the year when I first met Henry  Bellmon. It had to be the late    70s, maybe the very early 1980s. I was  sitting in my office one day, and somebody knocked on the door and it  was him. He was a U.S. senator at the time, still. Of course, I knew who  he was, but I had never met him before, and I had no idea why he was  there. Well, it turns out that there was a project being considered by the  Corps of Engineers called the Arkansas Chloride Control Project. They  had this big engineering project on the books to basically desalinate  Keystone Reservoir. Bellmon was, at the time, a champion of the  project.  About two weeks before that, I had just finished a study for the Corps of  Engineers on this project, in which I got drastically different, more  unfavorable results than their consultants did. As a matter of fact, so  unfavorable that it looked like a project that had, in economist   s terms of  positive benefit cost ratio, turned out not to be. The Corps, I think, it was  to their credit, contacted the senator and told him what I had found out,  and so he didn   t waste any time. He just showed up and just had one  question. He said,    Are you confident of your results?    I said,    Yes, I  am.    And the next day he withdrew his support for the project. But it  was really a testimony to him. I mean, he had constituents, I   m sure,  who would   ve loved to have the project move forward. But that didn   t  matter to him. He did what was the right thing to do.  Made a personal visit, versus a phone call.  Yes, oh, yes.  That   s the reason I wanted him to be able to tell you that story because  this is legion, in my experience, where he usually would have an  appointment  with  the faculty  member . But the faculty  member   would   ve been happy to have raced over to the office to have an  audience with the former governor. He would call and make the  appointment with the secretary,    Could I come and see professor so and  so?    And he would walk over to some little dingy office in a department  8  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  on campus and sit down, face-to-face with the faculty. The reason I  would be in a lot of those is because he didn   t really like to take the  notes, and so I would get to kind of be the scribe, which is what he  would call me, the scribe. These might become projects that moved  forward or things that become research collaborations with a bunch of  departments. But that humility, to always walk over to the other person   s  office, and then to trust that intellect   what do I want for a word? The  feedback that he got and act on that, rather than thinking his answers  were going to be best. That just happened over and over and over. The  one thing about him I admired the most is he never lost that humility.  And you don   t see that in politicians these days very much.  No, I don   t think he ever made a decision without complete information  or as complete as it could be.  I don   t either. I just saw that over and over. And he would change his  mind. He didn   t go in with a fixed position like that. It was just  illustrated.  I think that   s right.  I noticed you still refer to him as Governor. (Laughter)  You finally could say Henry.  Yes.  I think if I said    Henry,        I never said it to him, though. (Laughs)  I didn   t even call him that talking about him. I think I would   ve choked  on the word. I can maybe a little bit now, years later, but it was just, yes,  the governor.  As a matter of fact, most people called him Governor. I think all of us  who knew him and people we knew who knew him all called him  Governor, even long after he wasn   t.  But the people that he grew up with around Billings, it was Henry.  You   d see that all the time, too. He understood that being true to himself  was the way he was going to be a good leader. So there just really  wasn   t going to be any pretense about it. It just was the way he is.  Did he actually have an office?  9  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Yes. Yes, he had an office right after that. I never officed right by him.  Karilyn  Tevebaugh  did. His office, I think, for most of the time was on  the third floor of Whitehurst, and that suite had   General Goodbary,  who became very close in this group of administrators, was not here  quite yet, but he came soon thereafter. And so Karilyn was really the  administrative assistant to Governor Bellmon and to General Goodbary  through that period. He had a nice office, but he didn   t want that,  necessarily. I mean, he was going to be given a nice office. He would   ve  taken half the size of it.  I understand he didn   t much care for wearing suits. Would he wear suits  to work?  Yes, he wore a suit, but it might not have been one that was freshly  pressed. (Laughs) But what he would do, he had this nasty briefcase that  he probably had his entire career because the office gave him a new one  on his seventy-fifth birthday, and he was really kind of happy to have it.  But we traveled to Washington or something, and that   s all he   d bring.  And he   d open up that old briefcase and shove his pajamas over and take  out the papers. (Laughs) There just wasn   t a thing about him that was  pretense.  Yes, no pretense whatsoever. He always remembered people. You can  tell her about your experience with him in the Senate cafeteria.  Yes, I made a lot of trips to Washington with him because a lot of the  projects   the role that he played would be to, actually, frankly, to get  money   to get pork, as we liked to call it, for research collaborations  that would include more than one state. Like you were calling it clusters,  this would be clusters on campus, but they would be with multi-universities  and with industry and military research laboratories. They  were huge projects. The bio-fuels is one that you   ll still hear about. That  was one of the first ones. I don   t even want to try to remember the  names of the states that had parts in them. But we   d go to Washington,  my job primarily would be to have one-page white papers written. He  would obviously do the talking, and he   d be the one who knew who to  see for various things that he wanted done. And then General Goodbary  would typically give the PowerPoint presentation. So we kind of had a     what do you call it when one plays off the other? Thing going on.  Tag-team, I guess. (Laughs)  Tag-team, yes. But he took me to the Senate dining room one day, the  first time I went up there with him. We got there at about eleven when it  first opened. And there were a few people there, but primarily it was  empty, just the staff people that were the waiters and waitresses. And he  10  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  hadn   t been back up there in a long time, for most of the time he had  done his   last time he was governor he hadn   t been back to the Senate  dining room. But the people see him and they say,    Senator Bellmon   Senator Bellmon     And he walks over to this group of waitresses getting  ready for the noon rush, and he called them all by name and asked about  their family members by name. And that impressed me so much, that he  had ever even learned of that, even taken the time to see them as people,  not just somebody who was going to bring him lunch, so they   d have  their business going on. He had known who they were. And you could  just see that the people who came over to see him just idolized him.  And that   s another thing that you saw going through the halls of the  Senate, people would come from both sides of the isle,    Henry, how are  you?    They   d slap him on the back and shake hands. He was really,  really, really, respected byDemocrats and Republicans. And you saw  that everywhere you went with staffers who   d been there a long time.  It   s hard to tell that. Seeing and being able to experience that with him  was just one of the most wonderful things of my professional career. As  you can see, next to my dad and my husband, I probably idolized him  more than any man I   ve ever known. (Laughs)  Well, you mentioned one project. Can you name a few more?  Sure. We had another one that lasted for many, many years   it may still,  in some form. I think it has a different name, but it was referred to on  campus as the CATT Project, C-A-T-T, computer assisted technology  transfer. I managed that one in its early years, and it was designed to   assist small businesses procure federal contracts to make machine parts  for the aerospace industry . Kent was a part of that, too, at one time, but  we probably had close to thirty graduate students funded by it over a  variety of departments.  Oh, we did, yes, over thirty.  And probably fifteen to twenty faculty?  Yes.  Just at OSU.  Yes, and three or four colleges.  And there were several universities, because the way the politics in this   arena  work, if a politician from some state is going to support  the  project ,  his/her  university  generally  gets  an opportunity  to be a part  of it. That   s fine because the whole point of it was to  increase  11  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  collaboration . I mean, it was almost designed to need that. So it wasn   t  that it was exploiting the system. It was really taking advantage of being  able to get to those markets quicker. Then you began to see these little  companies successfully bid for work, little mom and pop shops that had  not been able to at all because they couldn   t work through a   if you   ve  ever tried to write a federal grant, then you know what I   m talking about.  First of all, they didn   t have the time. They were trying to get the  product done. They didn   t have time to do the paperwork for that, and so  we had ways to try to make that online. So there were a variety of things  that the graduate students did. It just depended on the department, didn   t  it? In the College of Business, it was in the Management Information  Systems. And there was another one called Exercise and Hard Choices.  You were the PI on that one so you could describe that one.  Yes.  Tie that into the     Well, after Governor Bellmon basically retired from the Senate, he  and   oh, I can   t remember the other principal   somebody from the  House, who had retired at the same time, established a group called the  Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, which is still in operation in  Washington, D.C. It was a bipartisan group of basically former senators  and congress people that   really, bipartisan. I say in the truest sense of  the word, no one had a political agenda. But they thought that federal  budget, then, as some people do now, was a little bit out of control. And  so, they basically didn   t champion any policies. They just wanted to start  a dialogue on the problems of budgeting for a huge government. And  maybe through that dialogue, why, find some solutions. But we got a  contract at Oklahoma State, I think, primarily through Bellmon   s  influence. They would take this around the country to small groups, and  they   d sit people down at this table, and you   d have to make these hard  choices. You   d have to decide and design what the budget was going to  be, so you   d have to make trade-offs. They were taking this around the  country to relatively small groups, fifty, sixty people.  The committee was. The Responsible     Yes, the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. What we did at  Oklahoma State University was we basically didn   t put it online, we put  it on CDs. So you could get a form together and you   d flush out the  budget for each group on a CD. I suppose we were using something like  Excel spreadsheets to make those choices right there. Then you could  flash all this up on a screen to see what every group was doing. It was a  much more efficient way to do it. Everything used to be paper, and we  kind of turned it into an electronic exercise.  12  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  And this was before it was so easy to put it online.  Yes.  This, sort of, would   ve transitioned to online. That was its ultimate goal.  Yes, it is now online. They   re actually using most of the formats that we  developed. This is another example of Bellmon   s statesmanship, I think.  He could   ve taken a Republican line on the budget. He never did. He  was more concerned that we talk about it and deal with it in a  responsible fashion.  And it started out that it went to political leaders at a pretty high level.  And as it continued, also, his hope   and that   s where it was kind of  moving along   is that it would get down even in the school system, and  maybe   what was that economic education forum that we were going to  try it with, that you were the director of it for a while?  Oh, I can   t remember now. (Laughs) That   s twenty-five years ago.  (Laughs)  We had about ten people around. Can   t finish a sentence when you get  to be our age. (Laughter) But, again, the point of that was he had been  on the board of directors for that for a long time and saw this as an  opportunity to put universities together. And this was one that really  didn   t go so much with military and industry. It was just designed for  other universities to collaborate and do it by distance learning in a  variety of way. And didn   t that end up moving to another university?  Oh, it did. Their politics did take over because we had a contract for, oh,  I don   t know, three or four years in all. Most of the materials we   re still  using, but it moved to Kent State University, just simply because there  was one of their senators, I think, who was willing to champion the  project.  But, again, that was Governor Bellmon believed in the project enough  that this might be one Oklahoma State couldn   t have forever, but you   re  not going to lose that support of that politician for later projects. We had  sort of had it, we learned how to do it, been there, done that, let   s move  on to something else. Good gosh, if I sat here long enough   when you  talk to General Goodbary, you   ll get a lot more of them.  Let me give you another example of Bellmon   s statesmanship. He   s  never been unwilling to take an unpopular stand. If he thinks it   s right,  he would champion the cause. When he was elected the governor the  13  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  second time, the state had some real serious financial problems. We had  just come through, basically, a collapse of Penn Square Bank and the  state   s revenues were down. We were going to have to cut down pretty  drastically on state services in the absence of a tax increase. Although it  was extremely unpopular to do it, he championed the tax increase. I  think he, basically, is personally responsible for what we call today  House Bill 1070 which provided the extra funding     1017.  1017, yes, which provides extra funding for elementary and secondary  education. I think without his influence, it probably wouldn   t have  happened. I had a hand in designing something else for him that never  went anywhere, and there are some of us that still think the same thing  today   that the most underutilized tax at the state level in Oklahoma,  and a lot of states, is the sales tax. We don   t tax any services, basically.  We tax goods but not services. I did a series of estimates on it for him  while he was governor. Although it would   ve been extremely difficult  politically, he was willing to carry that forward in the legislature. There  was so much opposition to it that it never went very far. But, again, it  wasn   t the politically popular thing to do, not with his   with nobody,  really   his party or the Democrats as well, but he understood the need  for additional revenue and was willing to push it through regardless of  the consequences.  And you learn just by being a part of any meeting that he was in, that  you don   t go screeching for your way, like you tend to see on television  today. (Laughter) There   s compromise. And you may not get all your  way this year, but there   s the next time. But you stay civil. I just think he  would   ve been sick to have been a part of the whole system today.  Nothing I ever saw in him made me think that he   d be a participant in  today   s political climate.  But he never lost his curiosity. A couple years before he passed on, we  had several occasions to be together with him. He   d get me over in a  corner, and he would ask me about the issues of the day and what I  thought about them. It wasn   t that he was just trying to make  conversation. He was deeply interested in what was still happening. He   s  kind of childlike in that sense. He was always, always, interested in it  and always thinking about something that might be helpful.  I bet I could take a look at the multidisciplinary projects that are going  on on campus now, if I just could see them, and whatever they   re going  to tell you, there probably will be a large number of folks that got their  impetus, sitting around the table at Whitehurst Hall with him talking. He  got ideas he wanted to bring to the college campus to start with, but he  14  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  had also things   just like Kent said   that he wanted to champion. But  he would sit and want to talk to somebody in research and with faculty  who could see how that could become research projects. We spent quite  a bit of time on another one where we weren   t as successful in getting  the final funding is the University of Oklahoma in going down to     where is it Mike Collie is at Ardmore?  Kerr Lab?  I guess so   yes, and talking about projects there.  This is a test for us. (Laughs)  The only one I can think of is Noble, but that   s not it.  It is.  It   s Noble.  Noble Research Center, that   s right. See? It helps to have some more  people around. But we went down several times with that trying to work  on some plant research that I think OSU is still a part of. But I think,  with the help of all of us, that we would have a bigger share than we  ended up getting because there are just other political factions that are  out there. But, again, they were always big projects, they were going to  be big multidisciplinary things that went on for a long time and could  really do more than the single, typical investigator project. It   s good for  your own career ladder, but sometimes getting to be part of a   well, I  think   this, again, is twenty years ago. I think you   re seeing more and  more now. Collaborative research is more the way it   s going, but that  wasn   t the case. And it really took a paradigm shift, I think, to get a lot  of the faculty interested in being a part of one, part of their own  department   the patience, too. I wasn   t born with that so I learned a lot  about patience by being around him.  He seemed to have quite a bit, from what I can gather.  Yes.  Yes, he did.  And maybe that was his farming background?  Could be, could be.  Well, you said you were there on his seventy-fifth birthday. How long  15  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  did he actually hold this position?  Oh, golly. Fifteen years, probably?  So if he came in when he was seventy     No, ten, a good ten.  So he was eighty?  Yes. I can   t tell you that for sure. After about the first, probably, five to  seven, I ended up having to gradually move more and more into research  compliance. He gave less and less time in his later years to come into  OSU. But as long as he was able, he was still coming in.  In the early years was it a forty-hour week?  No, probably sixty. (Laughs)  Sixty?  No, no. I think he really didn   t intend it to be full-time, but it was. And  during wheat harvest, though, he was still out there running the tractor  and combine.  Oh, I know he was still driving the tractor at eighty-five. What, was he  eighty-eight when he died?  Or close to it.  Yes, just two or three years before he died, he was still doing harvest.  Did you ever visit the farm?  I actually didn   t visit the farm. I took him home one time when we   d  been to Kansas City. And I don   t remember why I was driving back, and  I just took him to the farm, but I never actually visited him at the farm.  We visited him after he had really retired and had married his second  wife, Eloise. We   d go to     Go to Kingfisher        go to Kingfisher and have a picnic or something at their house and  visit.  Well, traveling with him on the road, are there any stories there,  16  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  something fun?  Well, there   s one kind of a fun story. There was one several years ago,  where we were coming   we went to Oklahoma City and back all the  time, because he didn   t really like to drive. So he would take somebody  a lot of times just because he didn   t really want to drive the state car.  There was a forest fire bad enough on I-35     Grass fire.  Yes, grass fire. (Laughter) I was thinking of the forest fires, the grass  fire. But it was bad, and so he says,    Turn to the left,    or whatever, I  turned. We went zooming down some of these back roads and got away  from it and got back on the highway, clear down by Seiling, and I said,     How in the world did you know these roads were there?    And he said,     I   ve been down every one of these roads in Oklahoma when I was  campaigning.    Probably with anybody else, I don   t know how   we  might   ve been caught in it. It was one of those that was just bad fast.  And you found out in a hurry that you don   t outrun a forest fire.  Or even a grass fire.  Or even    (Laughter)  Maybe especially a grass fire. They can move pretty fast if the wind is  blowing hard.  I concede. (Laughter)  That was before the days of GIS and     That   s right. This wasn   t that long ago. And let   s see if we have any  other funny stories from traveling. I   ll probably think of them the second  that you leave, but they don   t come to my mind right now.  Did he have any common or favorite sayings that he liked to say?  I   m sure other people can think of some of those, but I can   t.  I can   t think of anything.  There may be some Bellmon-isms, but I can   t think of them. No, I can   t.  No, I can   t either.  Well, I   ve been told that when he would meet with people, he preferred  17  C. Olson  Finchum  C.

Olson  Finchum  to do it around the table, rather than having him on one side and the  people on the other.  Yes. Well, I don   t remember. Even when you   d go see him at his own  office, just as a staff person, he   d sit at his desk, but he always had stuff  scooted away so there wasn   t anything on his desk that would be  between   he would minimize space any way that he could,  psychologically or otherwise, while he was talking to somebody. But,  yes, he preferred, always, if he were visiting with faculty or people about  something, to sit around the table, like this. Now, I   m seeing that table in  Dr. Collins    office that we sat around a lot.  When he actually retired from that position, was there a party or  something to signify that?  I   m sure there was something. He wouldn   t have wanted it.  No, he would not have wanted it. He didn   t really want anything  commemorating him until he died.  We surely did something. But, see, it wasn   t such a big banner day that I  could just tell you I remember it.  Well, would Shirley have been on campus very much during those early  few years?  No.  I don   t think so.  Just him.  Yes, he would just come in     How early would he get there?  Early.  Typically?  Yes. I was always there by seven-thirty. That   s a Karilyn question,  again, because I wasn   t at the same office. I   d see him whenever I was  scheduled to see him.  Well, I know he was an early riser from what other people say.  18  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  Yes.  Yes. He never forgot where he came from, and I think that showed up in  everything he did. He just didn   t think he was any better than anybody  else. That   s why he was always so informal when you   d meet with him,  and that   s why he would come to you and didn   t expect you to drop  everything you were doing to come to him, just no airs, whatsoever.  He liked to talk about his grandsons. Didn   t one of his grandsons major  in econ?  Yes, he was one of my advisees. (Laughs)  He would talk to you a lot about his grandsons.  Yes, Elliott Wynne, a good kid. Yes, that   s something else that we had  in common, I guess. Elliott may have been the oldest grandson, I think. I  think Elliott went to law school, very successful. He was proud of his  grandkids, too.  I remembered one other thing that we did together. I mentioned a  committee for a responsible federal budget, and we decided to have a  conference at OSU. And this was fine with the committee as long as we  raised the money to hold the conference and to pay for airfare for  various people. Well, we had Leon Panetta, for example, who is now the  secretary of defense, as one of the speakers, and Senator Nancy  Kassebaum from Kansas, at the time. Let me see, I   m trying to think.  I can just barely remember the conference, yes.  Yes, some other folks will probably come to mind, but     The APA person   anyway.  Yes, we had the director of budget   oh, just really high-profile folks,  either senators or people with responsible cabinet positions in  Washington. Those are the kind of people that he could attract. But we  had to raise money for that so the governor and I basically talked to a  number of heads of businesses, corporations around Oklahoma to raise  the money. We didn   t have any difficulty doing it. I did go with him to  see Burns Hargis, when Burns was at the Bank of Oklahoma. Is that  right? Vice-president, but Burns had already exhausted his budget. I  could just tell, it just tore him up that he had to tell Governor Bellmon,     No, I can   t help you.    But that was fine. That was fine. I mean, that   s  the way it was, and we just went on and raised money elsewhere. So I   ve  met Burns one time, and that   s the time. (Laughter)  19  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  Well, that reminds me of another project, and it was one with the private  sector. We would go with one of the earlier, former presidents of  Williams Company, Keith Bailey, and whoever was the president at the  time at Bartlesville, Conoco. But he would just call for an appointment  and people would just make it. It was a heavy experience for me because  I wouldn   t get to probably even go to   I don   t know what level I  might   ve gotten entre, so just to get to be able to find out,    Oh, sure.  Come on Thursday.    Even if it didn   t work out at that time   and I think  this is one that didn   t.  This has probably come up also in your interviews to date, but I   m sure  we would   ve had a viable Republican Party in this state at some point,  but I don   t think it would   ve occurred nearly so soon in the absence of  Henry Bellmon.  Did they tell you how he got to be a Republican?  No.  His mother signed him up for that when he was in the military.  (Laughter) You   ll have to ask one of his kids the real details of that, but  he used to laugh and say he didn   t really realize he was one until his  Momma told him. (Laughter) There   s a saying he   d have. Oh, there   s  probably a better piece of a way that story goes, but I   m giving you the  clue. You can go with it.  I   m not sure today he   d recognize himself as a typical Republican, but  he never was.  That   s true, too.  He seemed to be a great networker.  Yes, excellent. And you know why? He really wasn   t trying to promote  himself. He was promoting whatever he was promoting, and people  wanted to jump on that bandwagon. And you didn   t feel like it was ever  because you were going to see his name splashed in headlines that he did  it. Sometimes that   s off-putting to people. But it was just,    Let   s be part  of this project,    and that person   s ideas were taken seriously and  incorporated. That   s a different way of networking than    me first.     Yes, I suppose there are people around Oklahoma who ask,    Why do  you have a research building named after Henry Bellmon?    because they  think of him primarily as a politician. But I think this conversation  points out clearly that he really was interested in research, and he did a  20  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  lot personally, I think, to further the cause of legitimate research at  Oklahoma State University.  Oh, at one time, we used to kind of know how much money he had  brought in. It was huge. But that money is going somewhere. I mean,  that was another thing, these were legitimate projects that benefitted  faculty and students and a variety of institutions. It wasn   t just getting  something    for my state.    There was always some real meat in what he  wanted to do.  Yes, I think that last dozen years or so of just before he retired entirely  were really spent building up the research enterprise. It was just wholly  appropriate that there   s a new building named after him.  Yes, absolutely.  He did something with bridges.  Yes.  I don   t know what, but people had mentioned it     He wanted to do smart bridges. I forgot about that one. Where bridges  freeze over first   and please get somebody that can tell you this more  scientifically, but it was to get sensors so that you would   it would turn  on whatever it turned on so that it would heat or not freeze over. The  concept of that wasn   t that difficult, I think, but it was, again, getting  people on board. That   s over in the engineering school. It may still be  going on.  I   ll have to do some checking.  Yes. I forgot all about that one.  He played a big role in the pike pass.  Well, and the ground-source heat pump. That   s so big on campus, and he  had the capitol retro-fitted for ground-source heat pump technology,  back when he was governor the first time. I think it was the first time.  Oh, yes. It would be the first time. But Jim Bose is another   he hasn   t  retired yet. He   s on campus in engineering technology, and he was  working with him very closely on that huge project and had all these  years with him on that in various capacities. In fact, I   m not sure, but  what the smart bridge stuff was dove-tailed into that some way.  21  Finchum  C. Olson  Finchum  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  K. Olson  C. Olson  Always thinking about the bigger picture, too.  Yes.  The better good for more.  Yes, yes.  Yes, always.  Oh, yes. I mean, you talk about a public servant. Well, who was Henry  Bellmon? That   s what he was. I think everything he did, with the  exception of his own farming, which he continued to do, was done for  somebody else.  I usually ask people if they can only say one or two words to describe  him, what would they be?  Those would be my two.  What did you say?  I said public servant.  Me too, I think.  I mean, in a true sense of the word.  A public servant, yes. Yes, I think I   d call it that.  You have used the word statesman. You don   t hear that too much about  other people these days.  No. That   s perfect. I mean, it really fits.  To see the way he was honored when you would walk through, just the  halls of Congress and people would just walk in   they would see him.  And that just never stopped. I was amazed. That had been quite a few  years since he had played an active role in those halls. And the staffers  who still knew him, and    yes, that   s the definition of a statesman. And  he was already beginning to talk about the fact that you just didn   t see  the compromises, the talking, the debate, and then the healthy  compromise happening. That, as he would say, it used to be. That   s what  he would tend to say was,    It used to be.    It   s been fun kind of  remembering.  22  K. Olson  C. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  Finchum  C. Olson  K. Olson  Yes.  I appreciate the opportunity.  We can go ahead and close off unless there   s something else you want to  say.  Well, I can   t really think of anything.  I can   t either.  Well, I thank you for sharing.  You   re welcome.  Oh, you   re welcome. It   s a pleasure.  -------  -------
