 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, July 16, 2007 and I am in Stillwater,  Oklahoma on the campus of Oklahoma State University in the Angie  Debo Room interviewing Della Warrior. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame oral history project. Ms. Warrior was inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 2007. She served as the first and only woman  elected as chairperson and chief executive officer of the Otoe-Missouria  tribe in Red Rock, Oklahoma. She also served as President of the  Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1998  until 2006. With extensive experience and education within Native  American communities, Ms. Warrior continues to advise and assist many  organizations, including serving on the Board of Trustees of the  National Museum of the Native American Indian. Thank you so much for  joining us today, Ms. Warrior.  It   s good to be here.  Let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you tell us where  you grew up and give us a little background on your early life?  Well, I grew up in both very rural settings and very urban settings. I was  born in Pawnee, Oklahoma and my family resided in Red Rock,  Oklahoma. So I spent my early years at Red Rock, Oklahoma with my  mother and step-father. We lived in many other cities in Oklahoma, as  well as California and Texas and Kansas. We lived in Shawnee, Tulsa,  Oklahoma City, Enid and Ponca City. We lived in Dallas and Wichita  and Los Angeles.  It seemed like my family would go and my step-father would be  employed, but my mother always would get lonesome for home, so we  did move around a lot. I grew up in many of the cities in Oklahoma, as  5  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  well as rural communities in Oklahoma and spent a little time in some  major metropolitan areas for part of that. I grew up seeing diversity in  the type of communities where we lived. And, it was difficult at that  time because I felt often just as we got settled and I made new friends, it  would be time to leave. So many of my friends from those other  communities, they   re not lifelong friends, with the exception of those in  Red Rock. And then, the ones that I met at the universities that I  attended.  When you were younger, did you move around from school to school?  I did. I think I averaged two  schools  every year from the first to the  fifth or sixth grade; we moved at least twice a year. I started out my first  time in elementary school at the Pawnee Indian School in Pawnee,  Oklahoma. I attended there for one semester. Then junior high, probably  at least two schools a year. In high school, I remember I went to six  different high schools. So often I think,    How did I ever manage to get  my high school diploma?    But I did.  What were some of your favorite subjects when you were in school?  Well, I liked to read a lot and we didn   t have a TV   I know my aunt  was the first one in the community of Red Rock to have a television. I  was like nine or ten, I remember. So, I got used to reading a lot. Since  we moved around a lot, that was part of my recreation and going into  different worlds was through reading. Every weekend I would check out  three or four books and read those over the weekend. I think my most  liked subjects were literature and history. Those were the favorite ones.  At different times I liked math, depending on how difficult I thought it  was.  Now, outside of school, I know you moved around a lot, but what did you  like to do for fun, outside of reading?  We were always very involved with the church. I went to church a lot.  Then I belonged to the Rainbow Girls but I enjoyed tennis and  basketball, swimming and skating and dancing. I liked to do all of those  activities.  Roller skating or ice skating?  Roller skating. But I did try ice skating in high school and that was a lot  of fun. I tried it when my two older daughters were in elementary  school. I went with them a couple of times and it was a major challenge.  As you started to progress in life, you   re going to school and you   re  6  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  thinking about what you want to be when you get older, how did you  imagine your life? What road did you think it was going to take? What  did you want to be when you were growing up?  I made up my mind early   maybe in junior high   that I wanted to be a  medical doctor. So I was on a pre-college track throughout high school,  preparing to go into pre-med. Growing up, my community was  predominately native people. My elders, my mother, my aunts and  uncles, and my extended family were always encouraging me to go to  school and to get an education, to be able to do something that would  help, something where I could make a contribution to my fellow tribal  members and to help them improve their life situation. So there was  always this big emphasis to get an education, to go to school and to be  able to do something for my people   to help my people.  Do you think a lot of families within the Native American culture try to  impart that to their children, to give back to their community?  Yes, I do. I think that   s a big part of the culture. Because in the native  culture, in the Otoe culture, families help one another a lot. They do a lot  of things together. So they do really stress education.  Can you tell me when you were younger, some of your role models? Or  who you looked up to during that time?  When I was younger, I believe for the most part it was my mother and  my aunts and some of my extended family members. They were strong  women and they were always teaching and advising and counseling  about life. I think it was primarily my family, family members. What I  saw them trying to do and how they struggled and how they managed  with what little they had and that they always wanted a better life for me,  as well as my cousins and others in the family.  So the role your family played in your life was very important growing  up. Tell me about role of family now in your life.  Well, all of those   the elders in my family, I am the second to the eldest  in my huge, extended family. So I am the matriarch now. I   m constantly  talking to the children and grandchildren through our extended family     my cousins, their children and my grandchildren. Now, I find myself  thinking,    Well, I   m not really an elder.    I don   t feel like I   m wise  enough to be an elder, but I am. So I always try to remind myself to  impart something to the younger people coming up and to be  encouraging and to be positive.  What types of advice do you find yourself giving to the younger  7  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  generations now?  Well, that they have to set goals, to think about what it is they want to  be, or what they want in life, and to start thinking about that. To start  planning for their future and that whether they realize it or not, they are  the future leaders, and we want them to be leaders and we want them to  get the knowledge and the skills so that they can help their native  communities. You know, whichever community, if that   s the Otoe-  Missouria tribe or the Poncas. You know, when I was in education, a lot  of that was very similar. Talking to young people and giving them  advice and encouragement and to work hard, that nothing comes easy  and they have to be motivated and they have to really strive and want to  do the best that they can   to their capabilities. Always telling them that  at whatever level you are, just do your best, whether it   s in school or  basketball or home, always try your best and be positive.  Let   s move now to your collegiate years. You went to school in  Tahlequah at Northeastern State back in the    60s. Can you describe  your collegiate experience?  Well, I think my freshman year was the first time away from home, like  many other hundreds of thousands of students that go away to college,  you   re on your own and you go through this adjustment period on how  to be disciplined and how to do your work and when to socialize and to  balance. It   s a balancing process. You   ve got to learn to really balance  your schedule. It was very exciting and I formed some of my lifelong  friends there. I did very well the first year. The second year was kind of  average, and then after the third year I did very well again   the third  and fourth years.  In college, it was very difficult because my family really didn   t have any  resources to help me. When I was in my second year, it got really  difficult with all the pre-med courses and then just not having sufficient  funding and resources. I had to take a job and it was really difficult to  juggle that. I did end up switching my major in my third year, but it  wasn   t only because of finances.  After I finished my second year, I went to this summer workshop at the  University of Colorado. It was a workshop on American Indian affairs.  There were thirty-six young Indian college students from all over the  country   some tribes I had never heard of. Alaskan natives, people from  Maine, the Passamaquaddy, people from California, the northern Plains,  New Mexico and Arizona   and it was just such a diverse tribal group.  We stayed in this fraternity house and we took six hours in social  science. For the first time for all of us, we were given a review of  American Indian history from a native perspective, even though for the  8  most part, only two of the faculty were native. It really talked about  Federal Indian Policy and what happened after European contact and  how this influenced native people. So it was a real eye-opener for me  very early when I was in say ten, eleven, and twelve that in my little  community there, and the surrounding communities, there weren   t very  many jobs.  I wondered why.  The few businesses there, none of them  were owned by native people. And of course, all the teachers and nurses  and doctors were not natives. Only the custodians and secretaries and the  laborers on the farm were from my tribal communities. I used to wonder  about that,    Well, why is that? Why don   t we have native teachers? Or  why don   t we have doctors or nurses?    And my mother would say,     Well, that   s why you need to get an education. Because we   re  progressing and now you need to go to school and you can be one of  those   you can be in business or you can be a teacher or doctor or  whatever. But you have to go to school.     I remember thinking about that,    Well, why is that?    And then I  remember thinking a lot of problems I saw were because of poverty. The  lack of employment and how that really impacted a lot of people. Maybe  I didn   t think about it at that time, but when I went to the workshop, I  could see how this changed and how it impacted the culture. And, at that  time, there was a lot of discrimination against native people   a lot. So it  was hard to be a native person in Oklahoma. You struggled with that and  you struggled with the stereotypes and you had to walk almost in two  worlds, as a marginal person. So just doing that, it was a struggle.  I developed a lot of pride in being a Native American and who I am and  my own family. So that made me a stronger person. I didn   t give in or  give up. I think that   s the problem, a lot of young people give up  because they let others define who they are when they go into the  outside world.  Anyway, my main point is that this experience gave me a different  perspective because I used to think,    What is wrong with us as Indian  people? Why can   t we be more successful? Why are we at the bottom of  the ladder? Why? Why?    So when I went to the workshop, then I had a  better understanding of what happened and why native people were the  way they were. I wanted to try to make a difference and try to change  that. It was this workshop that was very influential and that workshop  went on for about ten years. And probably there must have been, during  that time, close to 400 students that went through those workshops. I  would say 75 percent of them have been in major leadership positions     you know, whether it   s in law and government, health or education,  community service, the academic field. For the majority of Indian  people that went to this workshop it was a life changing experience.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  After Tahlequah, in 1971, you obtained a degree at Harvard University.  Yes.  How did you choose Harvard?  They chose me.  They chose you?  Yes. That was the time when the Office of Economic Opportunity   OEO  had been established. I think that was established in probably    69  or    70. They had what they called an Indian desk out of OEO and there  was a person there, Dr. Jim Wilson who was Oglala Lakota from Pine  Ridge, South Dakota. He funded Harvard and Penn State and the  University of Minnesota   the graduate schools. They realized at this  time, that with all the schools and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other  schools where native students were, there were no professionals as  principals or superintendents and they wanted to try to make an impact  at that upper hierarchy of education. So, Dr. Wilson funded these three  graduate schools in education to offer degree programs. Well, they  weren   t new programs, they were their existing programs.  At Harvard, we had eleven students and I   m not sure how many were at  Penn State or Minneapolis. In fact, when I received a letter, an  application, I didn   t apply because I thought,    Harvard? I can   t afford to  go to Harvard and I   m not academically astute and there   s just no way     I   m not a real brain or genius.    So I didn   t apply. And then I think I got a  phone call and they said the way they invited people to apply was based  on people that had been out of college for a couple of years and who  were doing work that they thought was very   I guess oriented toward  community development, they   d been out in the field for a while. At the  time, my late husband and I, we had run a summer program for middle  school students, native students. We had set that up because we felt that  was a critical time to try to get these students motivated because after  that is when they started the ninth, tenth grade, a lot of them dropped  out. So we started running a summer program and I think at the time I  got invited, I was also running an Upward Bound program at Northern  Oklahoma College. They invited people that were already out there  doing, I guess, educational leadership programs.  I got this call and they said,    Well you should really think about it.    So  then when it came, I got another application, I applied. I didn   t expect to  be accepted but I was and there were eleven university students. They  were a diverse tribal group and it was a very, very wonderful experience  but it was also very, very challenging. I remember thinking   they made  10  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  us feel, we took the regular classes that they had, the graduate programs.  But they treated you so much different than   and of course, it could  have been this way in other graduate programs because when you   re in  college, the classes are so big and so impersonal and you feel a lot of  times that there   s no interaction with the professors. But at Harvard, our  classes were anywhere from ten to fifteen students. So you had time to  interact and to voice your opinions and to be listened to and treated with  respect. And they treated you like you were smart. I just thought,    Wow,  just what would happen to our educational systems if all of the teachers  treated all of the students like they were really smart? We   d have a  wonderful society if you started with a younger group of students.    That  really motivates you because I can tell you, the classes I went to, they  handed out these reading lists   I mean pages and pages and pages,  besides your textbook. I said to someone in the classroom,    Do they  expect us to read all of this?    They said,    You better read them all.     (Laughs)  I had taken preparation classes in the summer as part of that program.  They had us come up for the summer and we took a speed reading  course and a writing course just to get ready for the fall. But it motivates  you because they treat you like you   re smart and there   s no way that  you   re going to fail. The whole attitude is if you   ve been accepted by  Harvard, you   ve got to be smart because they don   t make a mistake. So  it makes you work super, super, super hard and I think now,    How did I  do that at that time?    But my mother was with me and she took care of  my two young daughters so I had time to study and to get my papers  done and meet the requirements. It was quite exhilarating and quite  challenging.  Did the tribal students who went to Harvard with you   did you all hang  around together?  We did. We were our own support group. But we met a lot of other  minority students as well as non-minority students. We interacted with a  lot of other people, too. We spent a summer together in the dormitory.  And then in the fall we lived all over, in different suburbs, wherever we  found a place to live with our families. We still periodically got together  and then we had a house where the American Indian program was  housed. It was called the Reed House. It was one of the first buildings on  the Harvard campus. That was a place we could go and gather, have  lunch together or just meet up with one another and go from there. So  that was good to have that support group.  Plus we had good funding and that made a big difference. My family  wouldn   t have had the funds to send me to Harvard at all. I have to say  that, the Harvard program at the Graduate School of Education and the  11  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  other programs, they trained a lot of Native Americans to go into  education whether it   s at the college, at the university level, or  superintendents or principals, so they   re out there. A couple of them  became people in charge of the education for their state. We had an  opportunity and I think we were individually successful but we were  also successful as native people because there were a lot of firsts out of  that group.  You were able to bring the education back to your own communities.  Yes, yes we were. Several of the individuals started their own Native  American schools. They contracted them from the Bureau and they  developed and had true Indian leadership with native boards and they  influenced the curriculum. So today in a lot of the schools, the students  are doing much better because they have a voice at all levels of the  school systems.  Did you find that there were more males versus females in those  programs?  Let   s see, we had four women and seven males. So there were almost  twice as many at that time.  Do you think that was a barrier? Were women encouraged to step out  there and earn these types of degrees within their communities?  I think that there was more pressure in terms of expectations put on the  males than there were on the females. Now in today   s world I think  there   s   I know that the tribal college presidents, when I first became a  tribal college president, there were four of us women presidents and the  rest, they were all male. There were like twenty-five male presidents and  that was nine years ago, or ten years ago now. At this time I think almost  half of the presidents of the native colleges are female.  You   ve had quite a career. You spent thirty-five years working in  education, governance, community relations. You name it, you   ve been  there. Can you highlight some of the key positions you   ve held over the  years?  Well, my first job was right out of college, I became the director of  social services for Head Start for six counties in Kansas. That was a real  learning experience. You know, working with the community members,  the mothers and the children and the fathers, just trying to make sure that  the students are going to Head Start and deal with truancy. The jobs I  think I had from the time I was out of college were learning experiences.  Then I spent some time doing research and evaluation for programs,  12  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  native programs. But my first really, I think, big job, in quotes big   I  was the Director of Indian Education for Albuquerque schools. It was a  huge school district. We had 117 schools with about 3,300 Indian  students from over 100 tribes. So it was trying to figure out how to get  services to these students who are spread out in these 117 schools. I  remember I was so traumatized when I took that job. I wanted the job  and I didn   t expect to get it. When I did get the job I thought,    Well now  what am I gonna do?    I was just traumatized. I felt all the responsibility,     Well, I don   t know how to be the director of this program and I don   t  know how to do this.    My friend, I   ll never forget, he said,    Well now  Della, you   ve gone to school all these years and you   ve had all this  experience and you   ll know what to do, so don   t be afraid, just go and  do it.     It turned out very, very well and we ended up having some wonderful  success with the students there. Working with the parents and getting  them involved with the school system and running tutoring and having  counseling and a lot of activities for the students focusing on  reinforcement for them and helping them learn to accept who they were  and be very proud of that. I really enjoyed that job. And then, the same  thing, when I was the Chairman of the Otoe-Missouria tribe, I felt,     Well, I   m not trained to deal with roads and transportation and  environmental problems and health and safety       My background is  education and community development. But then after I got in there, it  was the same. You know, you   ve got to develop a plan and you have to  set goals. If you have a plan you just move everything along. But of  course, my very best job was as the president of the college in New  Mexico, The Institute of American Indian Arts. It was just wonderful to  see the growth of these college students from when they first arrived to  when they graduated and to help the school build a new campus and to  move from a two-year to a four-year program   it was just very, very  rewarding. I think the most rewarding part was to just see these students  bloom.  Tell me about some of the most important places you learned the  background you needed for your various jobs.  The most important places    let me think about that. Well, I think when  you   re going to university and taking the various courses, they are not  there to teach you how to really do the job but they give you all of the  foundation so that you can begin to think about how to do the jobs. Then  when you finally start, you   ve got to use everything you   ve read and  learned about or how to research to do your job. Every job that I have  had has been a growth and learning experience. It helped me move to get  a better job   it   s almost like hands-on learning through the different  jobs that I   d had.  13  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  The job that I had as President of the college in Santa Fe, I thought well,  I had never aspired to be a college president but I believe that all of the  jobs that I   ve had before   when I used to do research and program  evaluation, writing grants, coordinating programs, being a counselor     all of these kinds of sets of experiences I had in my jobs, they gave me  all of the skills I needed to be a college president, which was wonderful.  I felt like I   d been training all my life to be a college president, where I  never aspired to do that. I had to do fundraising along the way. I learned  how to do private sector fundraising as well as federal and state side. I  learned public relations, human relations, community development,  grassroots development, economic development   all of these kinds of  things prepared me to be a college president.  How did running for elected office come about with the Otoe-Missouria  tribe?  My mother, my mother. (Laughs) I was still working at Albuquerque  Public Schools and she had moved home and of course, she was getting  up in age. She had said,    Well, you know, you need to come home and  work with your own people. That   s why you went to school, to work  with your own people and you   ve never done that. You   ve been out  there working with other tribes, and other native communities, and  you   re doing some good work but, you know, that   s why you went to  school.    I said,    Well, I know. I know. But I   m helping the students here  and I like what I   m doing and I enjoy it.    So anyway I thought about  that, and I thought about it more and it   s just like a little thing      She   s  right, she   s right, you never did work with your own tribe.     So I moved home and the first term I was appointed as a member. I  served as a member for three years, then was asked by several tribal  members to run for chair and I ran. I ran against four male tribal  members and I was the youngest and I won. So again, I was traumatized.  (Laughs) That   s how I came   I was motivated to move back because it  was like I felt that I set out to do something and I never fulfilled my  obligation and that was a commitment I made. I had always known it but  I just kept putting it off and putting it off. She  Warrior   s mother   planted the seed and it grew. I felt responsible, I had to take that step.  Is it common for women to be put in these types of positions within tribal  organizations?  No, not at all. Within the last ten years, we   ve seen more women in  leadership roles on the tribal council or even being elected to tribal  council but before that, it was not. It was just something that women  should not do. They had their role and place and that was the men   s role,  to be the leaders. So I would say within the past ten years, the number of  14  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  women leaders has probably quadrupled.  What would be the traditional role for a woman to take instead elected  office? What would be the set role that they are supposed to fill?  To be the caregiver and to be the homemaker, and to be in that role. But  not to be in a leadership role because that was the men   s role. I took a lot  of flack for that. I was elected but then I think it   s just part of the  tradition and the culture. There were a lot of people that felt,    Well we  shouldn   t have a woman, it   s not a woman   s place to be leading the  tribe.    So there was always that resistance, as a woman, that it was just  culturally inappropriate.  What were some of your successes working with the tribe?  Well, we had ten goals and we made progress on all of those goals,  which was to increase employment, to have additional programs, to have  more educational opportunities, to increase our land base, and to try and  create employment opportunities. The tribe began to buy land back. We  developed our own water utility company. That was a goal. I left before  it was ever implemented, but that is really a bread and butter project for  the tribe, to have their own utility company and their own water  program. That brings revenue into the tribe. We set up our own tax  commission. And that was doing really well, and it still is doing well but  it took a lot of time for people to understand it. At first there was a great  deal of opposition because it was different and it was new. There were a  lot of misconceptions. People thought that the purpose was to create a  tax program that would tax the needy people on their land and that  wasn   t the intent of it. It was for businesses, that they would be taxed  and that money would come into the tribal government, and support the  government, just like any other city or county or state or federal  government has various taxes for various types of services. So, those  were successful.  I started a lot of things and we made progress. But I was there, as a  chair, for about four years so I didn   t get to really accomplish as much as  I wanted. I do want to say that for future generations that might research  this, that it   s really difficult being a tribal leader, period. Working with  your own tribe is more difficult than working for another tribe. There are  so many more barriers that are set up and a lot of that has to do with  animosities that go back a hundred years   family feuds or whatever. It  goes to a lot of mistrust against the federal government, but also against  their own tribal government because they are suspicious. They feel that  anyone who gets into those positions will  become  corrupt, so you are  constantly having to defend yourself and put out small crises and fires.  That really detracts from your road map   where you want to go and  15  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  what you want to do. You   re always trying to explain and defend.  I had one recall and then when I was just a member, we went through an  ouster. In both cases, I fought back because I felt that the only thing I  had in this world was my name and my reputation. I was not going to be  run off because of a lot of untruths and down-right lies and wrong  information. I felt in order to clear my name, I had to fight. And I did.  So when we went to court, they had no facts. They had no data. It was  all lies and innuendos and they even falsified the recall petition. People  had signed for other people. They put on peoples    names who were  deceased. They didn   t have enough to go through that recall so it was  thrown out of court. It was very expensive, but I felt that if I don   t have  a good reputation, a good name, then I have nothing. So I did fight. It is  very difficult to work for your own tribe.  Sounds like the makings for a very good book.  (Laughter) I should have kept a journal. It was, sometimes I felt like,     I   m not here in America, I   m in some foreign nation here, the way  things are       It was kind of bizarre.  Can you go into detail about a key moment in your career   in any  position you   ve held   where you consider that moment to be one of your  biggest highlights?  My biggest highlights? Let me see. Well I think it   s hard to say which  highlight. I would say     And if you have more than one     Oh okay, all right. Well I think it   s when we  IAIA  moved from these  World War II barracks. We moved our college from these barracks that  they had been in for seventeen years on another campus, renting  substandard space for seventeen years. They had dreamed about their  own campus for years and we worked on that. We were able to finally  raise funds and develop the architectural plans to build our own campus.  So when we had the dedication of the new campus, that was a big  highlight.  It was certainly rewarding to me for the school to get, for the first time,  ten-year accreditation from the accrediting body, which it had not   in  fact when I first took over, the school was on probation. Then we came  off that and we got five years and then we were able to have ten-year  accreditation.  I think in the last year, the most rewarding time at the campus was when  16  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  we received a  16 million gift from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to  build a lifelong learning center. That was a monumental experience to  know that we had been successful in getting that. I think to my  knowledge, that it was the biggest gift that any tribal college, or any  Indian organization, has ever received from the private sector, so that  was quite an experience.  Now at the Institute of American Indian Arts, what is the student  population? And what types of programs do you offer there?  There are just a little over 200 students and we offer programs in  museum studies, creative writing, Native American studies and the arts.  The fine arts.  Moving on to the honor, when you were notified that you were going to  be inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, tell me what was  going through your mind at that time.  Well, I just couldn   t believe it. I thought,    Well, is this for real? I can   t  believe that I   m selected when there are so many wonderful women who  are doing some great things.    I didn   t really think that my work was at  such a level, that I would get the award. So the only thing I thought was,     Well, it must be my life   s work, not just any one huge thing that I   ve  done.    But over a forty year period, I guess I   ve made a few  contributions. But it was quite awesome.  The efforts that you   ve done within your community, and outside your  community, both in Oklahoma and in New Mexico, you give everyone  something to look up to and to emulate. How do you feel now that people  look at you as a role model?  Well, I know that my tribe, they came out in huge numbers for the event.  They turned out and a lot of other tribal people  did . I know that there  were others that wanted to come but the weather was bad. I think that,  for my own tribe, I believe they were just in wonder. You know, and  very, very happy and very proud to know that a tribal member could  receive this honor. So they related to that and I know that. I   ve heard  them tell their grandchildren and children and to say to them, you know,  that I had received this recognition and that I was a tribal member and  that they could too, if they worked hard, they wanted them to be like me.  (Laughs) I   ve heard that a number of times.  Can you tell me about some of the people you would like to thank that  have played an important role in your life?  Well my mother is deceased, but I think it   s appropriate that I mention  17  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  my mother, Katie Carson, and my Aunt Carson, my uncles Sam and  Frank Carson. Also, my grandparents, even though I never knew them. I  am named after my grandmother and she was a traditional healer and she  was a Christian. She brought up her children to be Christians and she  always encouraged education. In fact, I   ve felt often, lately, that I feel  bad that I don   t speak my own native language. At the time, her and my  grandfather decided that they couldn   t, they would not teach their  children the language because they didn   t want their children to be  punished or mistreated. But often I go other places and a lot of people  my age are still fluent in their native language. The lessons that I was  taught by my aunts and uncles and mother was that this is what your  grandparents wanted for you and they are always advising me and  teaching me.  I would also want to thank Dr. Robert K. Thomas. He passed away, I  believe, it was 1995 or somewhere around there. He was one of my  professors that was like a mentor. At different times in my careers, I  would call him and say,    What do you think about this?    And in my  tribal challenges, he would help me analyze and think things through  and some other really good friends that I have. There   s just a lot of  people that have really mentored me and helped me throughout my  whole life.  I have to thank God for all of the blessings that I   ve had in life. He   s  always been there and I   ve always called on him and looked to him for  guidance. That spirituality that was handed down from my grandparents  and parents has helped me be what I am and who I am.  If you could give any piece of advice to fellow Oklahomans, what would  you tell them?  Well, I think I would tell them that they need to pay attention to what  their children are being exposed to and to teach them basic spiritual  values about what it is to be a human being and the responsibilities that  go along with that. And to be positive and encouraging and to work hard  at whatever it is they are doing.  What would be your advice to women who plan to follow in your  footsteps?  To be strong, to have courage. To not let fear overwhelm them. To take  risks because everyone out there, for the most part, many of them feel  the same way that they do but you   ve just got to take that step and to just  do it because you   ll be all right. Everything will fall into place. But don   t  let fear overwhelm you where you don   t take that first step. That   s the  biggest thing that you worry about,    Can I do this?    You question your  18  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  own abilities and the appropriateness of it and the why. And a lot of  times, women talk themselves out of things, but not to be afraid.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  That I was an Otoe-Missouria American Indian, that I was a member of  that tribe, that I was the first one in my extended family to graduate from  high school, the first one to graduate from college. I think the only tribal  member that graduated from Harvard. And so, beyond that I can think I  would like my history to say that I was dedicated to improving the life  situation for, not only my tribe, but all native people and that was my  driving force in life, that I did manage to be a native person but still be  able to get educated and be successful.  I think a lot of times native people feel that they are going to have to  give up being Indian if they go to school and they   re going to have to be  something else, and they don   t want to do that. But that you can be a  native person, you can go to school, and you can go back to your  community and make a difference. And that I tried to go by the cultural  beliefs and values of my people.  What is next on the agenda for Della Warrior? What do you think you   ll  be doing in the next few years?  Well, right now I   m still working on some education and economic  development projects, one for the Ford Foundation. They are  considering developing funding with some seed money, a National  Native Arts and Cultural Foundation, which would support and nurture  organizations and artists that are involved with native arts and culture.  There has been a lot of our culture that has been lost, and languages that  have been lost. So this fund will fund artists as well as organizations that  are trying to maintain the culture, whether it be in language preservation  or protecting cultural rights and helping different organizations and  tribes really have the culture be much stronger than what it is today.  It   s stronger now than it was twenty years ago, but not as strong as it  was fifty years ago. So begin to rediscover what some of that knowledge  was, so I   m working with them on that and helping to raise money to get  the Foundation up to  50 million. I   m working with the Hopi tribe, with  one of the villages out there, on an economic development project. I   m  working with a tribe in Northern California to help them restore their  balance, their sense of community because they were dispersed in the  urban population. We   re trying to help them move in that area and to  rediscover their own identity.  I   m working with Wilma Mankiller and we   re doing some projects  19  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  together. I   ll probably do this for two more years and then I   m going to  move back to Oklahoma. Then I have some projects I want to do with  my own tribe. Not be employed at the tribe, but with the youth in  programs that will help to motivate and inspire them. Also to begin a  language project for my tribe. That   s what I   m thinking about. There are  so many things that I think,    Oh, I would like to do that.    And I don   t  know, I   m always wanting to do more but I   m having less energy.  Well it   s 2007 now, do you feel cultural and social perceptions of Native  Americans have changed over the years?  Definitely, definitely. I have seen so many changes, for example, when I  first went to college, there weren   t very many students at the University  of Oklahoma, native students. I think there were maybe fifty. And now,  today, I am told there   s like over 1,000, maybe 1,500 to 2,000. So more  natives are going to college and getting an education and they   re  learning more. They   re not only going into business and teaching,  they   re going into law. Many of them, they   re in so many different areas,  and you can go to conferences now and a lot of native people have their  own businesses. And they   re using technology and there   s just so much  flourishing with the culture that you see that wasn   t there when I was  growing up. There have been a lot of positive changes in terms of the  culture really, not only just being revived, but actually flourishing.  There have been a lot of changes over the last forty years, Indian people  are also running their own schools and their own programs. Which I  know, when I was growing up, my own tribe, they didn   t run anything.  The only business the tribal council had was to decide which farmer was  going to get to lease their land. And so with the struggles that we   ve had  for Indian self-determination, the Indian Education Act, to get Indians  more in control of their own programs. I remember Clyde, my husband,  saying in one of his speeches,    Let us make our own mistakes. Right  now, the Bureau of Indian Affairs runs everything. We don   t get to make  any decisions, we don   t get to make any choices. We are wards of the  federal government and that   s keeping us disempowered.    So all this  voice went around in the    60s that we needed to make our own choices,  and our own decisions. He said,    After all, we can   t do any worse than  the federal government. And sure, we are going to make mistakes, but  we are going to learn from those mistakes.     Now you go to any tribe in the country and they are running like any  other government. They have a lot of services, they have their own  health programs and law enforcement. And they are building and  growing and more students are going to college so there are a lot of  positive changes. So out of this, the young students that are growing up  have to feel a greater sense of pride in being a native person than when I  20  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  was growing up. I mean, I was proud, but I really didn   t know why and I  had to struggle and to learn why, so most native parents should be more  conscious and consciously teach some of the history of their tribe and  their values. If they knew it, they may have to re-learn it.  There are a lot of professors from the late 1800s and early 1900s that  went out and studied these tribes so the universities have a lot of data.  Columbia University, there were students and professors that came out  and studied the Otoes. Some of the raw data is there and so those tribes  that are struggling with some of their own ceremonies might have to go  and learn from what was researched and documented. Even if it might  not be quite right but it is better than not having anything.  It is important to preserve those traditions.  Right, it is, it is, very important.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oklahoma, you know, I always feel so happy here   it   s home.  Whenever I cross the line, I just feel really happy, happy to be back in  Oklahoma. It   s home. Oklahoma is also very patriotic and they   re very  family-oriented and there are a lot of common values in being an  American and being an Oklahoman. Within our sub-culture, you know,  the native people are proud, as well. So it   s always good to be in  Oklahoma and I   m very happy to be here and I love Oklahoma even  though I don   t always love the weather. (Laughs)  Is there anything else you   d like to add that we have not spoken about  today?  Well, this is 2007 and that even though there   s been a lot of change,  across the state and in the various communities, I think that there   s still a  lot of prejudice in the state against American Indians. I think a lot of that  has to do with several things. One, it hasn   t been that long since we had  the Indian Wars and people   s grandparents can still share stories with  their children, on both sides. So I think there   s still this carry-over of  suspicion and mistrust.  There   s still a lot of anger among native people because they   ve been  dispossessed. In a lot of ways, they   ve been dispossessed of their  property. A lot of it was done illegally in a devious and crooked manner  and because the Indian people weren   t educated, they didn   t understand  a lot of time that the form, if they signed their X on the piece of paper,  that meant you were selling this piece of land. Yet even with the wealth  that has come from this state, the Indians are very poor and they struggle  21  to live every day. But in the schools, at least the text book that I had on  Oklahoma History is no longer there and it   s probably not as negative as  it once was. They  the schools  really need to begin to be more balanced  in the history that they present. And while they may be proud that they  had the great land runs of Oklahoma, they got it in a way that wasn   t  good for us and hasn   t been. They need to know, the history books need  to tell the truth, what really happened and to get rid of some of the  stereotypes that people in this state have against native people.  The native people need to get over letting themselves be victims and  letting it defeat them. They need to just make up their mind that, you  know, they   re survivors. The expectation was that the Indian cultures  would have been wiped out and they wouldn   t have their culture or their  languages anymore but Indians are still here. They still have their  culture, they still have their beliefs. But they need to balance that out.  They need to be able to balance their values with the outside world, the  dominant society, so that they can function in both worlds and they need  to not accept these definitions, these negative definitions, of who they  are, that they are a Native American and be proud of that, and to go on  and move beyond that and not just accept that,    Oh, I   m just an Indian.  And I   m supposed to be poor, and I   m supposed to be a drunk or I   m  supposed to be uneducated. And I can   t do this and I can   t do that.    But  make up their mind that hey,    You   re strong people.     They tried to kill the Indians just by outright killing them, then they tried  to destroy them by taking their land and culture and used to whip them  for speaking their own language. All this stuff   but we   re still here. And  we are getting stronger. They need to be proud of how strong we are.  We   ve survived all of that. And to not be a victim, and to take that and  be out there and be who they are and know that they are equal with  anybody else.  I guess that   s what I want to see because a lot of people in Oklahoma are  part Indian. They need to learn more about the native culture and the  values because a lot of them are from the Bible. A lot of the teachings,  what they tell you is respect, you know, reciprocity, generosity, sharing,  being good to your neighbor, helping. But those values, they are not as  dominant as they once were so they need to be stronger and people need  to interact more because they   ll recognize that each culture or race has  something to offer the other. You can really be a better person for  learning about your fellow man, understanding and appreciating one  another and what they bring to the world. So I hope that we can begin to  see that in the future. And it   s more education on both sides, and more  giving and more understanding and appreciation of diversity. But we   re  not there yet.  22  Nykolaiszyn  Warrior  Nykolaiszyn  You, Della Warrior, are just a remarkable woman. And we do  appreciate your time today.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
