 Simpson, and I   m here with Cecil Wildman. We are  at the OSU Alumni Center, and it is October 20, 2006, and this project is  O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library. Well,  Cecil, tell me what years you were here at OSU?  I was here from 1955 to    59.  Okay. So your entire college experience was here at OSU?  Yes.  And what brought you to OSU?  Well, my degree is in civil engineering. At that time, ninety percent of  all the civil engineers in Oklahoma were OSU grads, and there was lots  of little things happened about that time. I just got out of the Army, and  in the    50s, half the classes were military and we were all Korean War  veterans  Wildman served in Germany , and the World War II veterans  had kind of set the stage for us, to draw the GI Bill and go to school. I  was actually giving a blood transfusion in the Shattuck Hospital and the  head of the housing at Oklahoma State   it was his brother, so he asked  me to come over and he would buy my lunch the following week. I came  over and they took me over to the school of civil engineering,  interviewed me, gave me a   what do you call it, advisor?   and went  from there. It was a very easy transformation for me to come over here  and he gave me a nice room in Cordell Hall.  So you went in for a blood transfusion and you got a path to college?  In effect.  5  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  In effect. (Laughter)  We were sitting out in the hall waiting to give his brother a blood  transfusion, and he asked me what I was getting ready to do. I told him I  was thinking about enrolling in college and I   d just gotten out of the  Army, and he said,    Why don   t you come over and let me show you  around?    He was a nice guy. His name was Mr. Thomas, and he was  here all the time I was. But he also was head of Cordell Hall   gave me a  really nice room in Cordell.  Now you grew up in the Woodward vicinity area?  Yes.  And so moving to Stillwater wasn   t a big change for you?  It wasn   t a big change, except I didn   t know anybody in town,  (Laughter) which was not too unusual.  How old were you when you started?  Let   s see, I was in my 20   s. Got out of the Army in   I was 24.  You were 24?  Yeah.  Was that about the age of many of the students there or were you a little  bit older?  I was older. The high school students, of course, were 18 in those  classes, but most of the GIs were a little younger than I was.  Okay.  Most of them were 20 to 21.  And was the Vet Village still being used at that time?  Vet Village was very interesting. It was a bunch of cracker boxes. I  called them houses, but it was really kind of an old barracks. They  weren   t insulated. The heat ran all the time, and they weren   t air  conditioned. It wasn   t the greatest place, but they had their own  governing body up there. They had their own basketball team, and they  represented the college. When they came to the college for something,  they came as a council. There was a pretty strong entity. Well, they were  6  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  all veterans, and it was cheap. You could stay up there cheap     Right.     and, as far as I know, they were all married. It was an interesting  place.  Did you live in a dorm?  I lived in Cordell Hall one year and then I moved into an apartment.  What was it like living in Cordell Hall at that time?  You know, it was a perfect thing to start to college, especially a GI,  because if you needed to know anything you could find somebody over  there and it was handy to get to all the classes. An interesting thing about  it, they had a class for returning GIs   math class   and the math class  started out with one plus one and ended up (Laughter) with heavy  algebra, and it didn   t count toward engineering but it really gave you a  chance to get your feet on the ground. And down at Oklahoma  University I checked, and they didn   t have that class. So I went from  that directly and I made    A   s    in trig and algebra from that class. That  was a GI returning class.  Now what got you interested in civil engineering?  I had worked for the federal government in Woodward in the production  marketing administration, and then I was in an aerial photo engineering  outfit in the Army.  So how long had you been out of the army when you were enrolled?  About a year and a half.  About a year and a half? So you had a little bit of time to re-adjust  before you     But I got discharged the last of January, and I couldn   t get into school  until the following year. Had a pretty darn good job, so I just delayed it  till I got a car paid for and had a little bit of money.  Tell me what campus looked like at that time   what the buildings looked  like, what the people looked like. Was it much different than what we see  today?  I don   t think so. They were beautiful, and the Student Union had just  7  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  been built. The girls wore dresses or skirts and blouses. Pantsuits were  not allowed. They also had a discussion at the college of whether the  boys could wear jeans, and they finally decided it was okay with a nice  shirt, because we had so many guys worked at the beef barn and what  have you, so that was allowed. (Laughter) But they still were fairly well,  you know, well-dressed. They wore sport shirts with them.  Orange and black   were those the colors then?  Yes, absolutely.  And did you see the people wearing orange like they are today? Was  there a lot of school spirit?  Yeah, there was, but I don   t know. At the football games, I would say  no. I think that got a little bit stronger as the years go by   more  students   because Oklahoma State was about half the size as it is today.  Well, speaking of football games, it   s Homecoming this week and how  many Homecoming games do you think you   ve been to in your life,  Cecil? (Laughs)  Well, I   ve had season tickets since 1955.  Wow.  So how many years would that be? Fifty?  Fifty-one?  Yeah. I was telling someone (Laughter) the other day and that kind of  surprised them. I   ve had season tickets since 1955 to four sports.  Wow.  Basketball,    rasslin,    football and baseball.     Rasslin?    (Laughs)  Wrestling, yeah. My college roommate was a wrestler from Perry.  Wow.  So he insisted that I go to all of the wrestling matches.  And what was the sport that was really big when you were here?  8  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  When I was here, probably basketball. However, in 1959, Oklahoma  State won the national baseball championship, and I knew all the players  but did I mention earlier about the odd and even tickets?  Tell me about that. It was hard to get into the games?  When you enrolled in school, you had to make a decision. You could  only see half the basketball games because Gallagher Hall was sold out  so Mr. Iba decided half the students could go. So you made a big deal  whether you got the odd or the even ticket, and then when you got that  ticket, you looked up someone somewhere in town that didn   t go to the  basketball games and talked them out of their ticket so you could see all  of them.  So you could see all of them. (Laughter)  Since we   re on basketball, I   d like to tell a little story.  Okay.  When they played Kansas here and Wilt Chamberlain was at Kansas     you hear Eddie Sutton talk about this quite often at the ball games today.  It was sold completely out, the game was, and they sold about 10,000  tickets at the school auditorium for people to see it on a large screen.  And they claim if everybody in the world says they went to that game  went, there   d have been 50,000 people. But I was actually there.  (Laughter) And there was a reason behind all the stories. I was in the  school of civil engineering, and the professor would   the hardest course  you could take   and they were only gonna pass about a third of the  students   was statistics. So the professor said,    I don   t want anyone  going to that basketball game.    (Laughter)    You can but you   re gonna  have a hard test tomorrow that will determine whether you pass or not.     Here   s the hardest course on the campus, and he   s gonna give a test the  next morning. Well, I made the decision that in the rest of my life I   d see  Wilt Chamberlain play, but I probably wouldn   t remember that test.  (Laughter) So my roommate did not go to the game and gave me his  ticket. You just couldn   t get in. So four of us went. We were all in the  School of Engineering, and so when the game was over, I tore home to  study for this test the next morning. Dr. Willham, the President of the  college, called a holiday and none of the professors could give a test the  next day. (Laughter) So the professor was very upset about that. He had  to give us another week to study for that test.  How   d you do on the test?  I don   t remember (Laughter) and I knew I wouldn   t. (Laughter) But we  9  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  were talking about that at the coffee shop this morning. Several people  remember that he decided, I think about midnight, to call a holiday the  next day and here were all these guys that stayed home to study for that  test.  Oh, they missed out.  We had a holiday the next day. But that was rather interesting. Mel  Wright made the winning goal for that game against Kansas, and if you  talk to people in the coffee shops today, they will tell you they were  there and everyone in the world made that shot. Mel Wright did, and I  went to a football game with him about a month ago and was talking to  him. His grandson   s playing on the Stillwater High team but he made the  shot and I was there.  Okay.  But Eddie Sutton   s right. If you listen to people talk, they weren   t at the  game. (Laughter) But they beat Kansas, and Wilt Chamberlain played  here at that time.  Well, now we have it officially.  Have officially they won it and a lot of people talk about the fact, but a  lot of people didn   t realize that these professors had scheduled these  tough tests the next day.  So, what were Homecoming festivities like then? Did we have the floats  in the parades?  I think the difference was that there were lots of floats, and there were  lots of house decorations. Now, tomorrow we   ll see about three floats  maybe. It used to just be solid floats, and they   d come all the way out to  the football stadium and they   d go around the stadium during the half. It  was quite a deal, but of course it was smaller. But they were heavy on  floats and heavy on the Walk Around, more so than today.  Did the Greek houses decorate?  Yes. Yes.  They did? And you weren   t ever in a fraternity were you?  No. Most of the GIs were not.  Right.  10  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  That just wasn   t done.  Did you also have a job while you were in college?  No. I worked for the federal government, the Soil Conservation Service,  at that time as a student in the summer. So the day school started, I went  off the payroll, and the day it was out, I went on the payroll, so I never  really had to. I was on the GI Bill.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I didn   t want to have a job.  Yeah. Well, civil engineering is such a hard subject area that I imagine  you studied quite a bit     I didn   t have a big social life.  No? What about on weekends? What did you do then?  Well, not really. Even on weekends, we studied a lot. But we used to  make the statement   this is a boring story, but we would study on  Friday nights and get our homework done, then we   d all go out   the  group I ran around with. There was a Sonic Drive-In here, then we   d eat  a hamburger on Sunday afternoon and there was a guy out here in the  north end of Stillwater had a nine-inch black and white TV and we   d go  watch Maverick every Sunday evening, about ten of us. That was the  only time all week long we saw TV, but that   s okay. That   s okay. We  enjoyed doing that. (Laughter)  So that was your big excitement, watching Maverick?  For a week, yeah.  For a weekend.  I   d like to remind you all   if you don   t realize this. They didn   t have  fall and spring breaks.  Oh.  And they had some real tough math teachers, and the math teachers were  so tough. I   ll tell a story about one of them so that everybody knows my  age. They didn   t list the math instructors in the catalog because no one  would schedule the tough ones, and so they decided, in addition to that,  all the engineers had to take math on Saturday to keep them in school.  11  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  And I   ll tell a story that everybody knows about that was here in the     50s. They had a professor here when I showed up, his name was     Square Root Smith,    and the reason   if you   ve never heard of him, all  of the people here in the    50s did, he had a math class before I got here  of 64 students and he passed eight. So he passed the square root of his  class. So if you drew him, you couldn   t really drop him. You probably  weren   t going to pass, but still if you dropped him and you were on the  GI Bill, they put you a semester behind. So it was really kind of a tough  deal. Well, I drew him for analytical geometry and calculus. There were  sixty students, I think, the first day. Thirty of them dropped it roughly.  There were fifteen showed up for the finals. He gave one    B.    He passed  about eleven of us, and one of the astronauts was in that class and he got  the only    B.    But I actually made a    C    in that course, and I actually  passed. They had a big article in the Daily Oklahoman when he retired,  about that, and they couldn   t understand why the college kept him  around.  And all the students knew him as    Square Root Smith?     Because he passed the square root of his class.  Oh.  He passed about eleven of us.  Yeah.  And he gave one    B    and about five or six    C   s    and two or three    D   s,     and the rest were    F   s.    Fifteen, I think, showed up for the final.  It sounds like classes were tougher then than they are today.  Well, they didn   t give very good grades. They told all the engineering  students   and you have to realize, if anyone was here in the    50s and  was an engineering student, they were going to be offered lots of jobs.  NASA was hiring, I think, 17,000. All the aircraft companies, Hughes  and all of those. Most of the engineers were mechanical, with an  aeronautical option, and they were literally guaranteed a job. So, for  some reason, it seems as though the instructors   that they would tell  you when going to a class,    We   re only gonna pass one out of three.     They would tell you that in class after class after class. And they claimed  the reason for that is, why take all those courses, those math courses,  then get to be a junior and flunk? Then you   ve lost all of it. So some of  the instructors would, before a final exam, you   d go sit down to take it  and they   d say,    Okay, I   m gonna pass one out of three. Take it or leave  it.    So they didn   t give very good grades even.  12  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Wow.  I personally made the highest grade in an advanced chemistry class in  the Chemistry Department, and I got a    C.    They told us when we  graduated, they said,    Well, now, if you   ve put up with all this stuff we  gave you, anyone that hires you is pretty much convinced you   ll stay  four years.    I got off subject though   that   s not a lot about Oklahoma  State, but     No, but that   s interesting that, you know. I think that because you came  in after the Army and you were a little older, you were maybe a little  better prepared for that situation.  Well, you learned and the engineers that I ran around with, and they  were all engineers   we had a pretty much a set thing. When we came  out of class, we immediately started doing homework in the evening.  Then we   d take about an hour break and then, personally, I studied till  about midnight and then I quit. I never did study past midnight. A lot of  them stayed up pretty late, but that   s okay. They were top-notch  students, and they all became very, very successful.  I want to ask you something while we   re on the subject. You work with a  lot, or have been working in your career with a lot, of younger  engineers.  Yes.  Do you think they   re coming out of school as prepared or as disciplined  as they did at your time?  I think they   re a lot smarter than we are, (Laughter) and I think that they,  as far as the computers and the bookwork stuff, they   re better. I   m with a  consulting engineering firm in Oklahoma City, and our young engineers  are not any good going out to the public much. And they broke in, while  I was here   Dr. Willham said we had to have a major in English courses  and so we had to have 20 hours of humanities and English. They quit  that, and now the young engineers in our office have trouble writing, and  we don   t even take them out with us to meet with the community  because they   re not very good. But they   re twice as smart as we are. I  don   t think they   re disciplined. I think they think,    Well, if I lose a job,  I   ll go get another one.    Which it really isn   t true. (Laughs)  Were you recruited when you were graduating?  I interviewed with, I think, approximately ten different people and was  offered ten jobs.  13  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Oh my gosh.  Yeah, but all the other engineers were, too. There wasn   t anything  special about me.  And what was the job you took?  I went to work as a planning engineer for the Soil Conservation Service.  Okay.  I really liked it and went to Oklahoma City. Didn   t stay too long with  them but     When did you move back to Stillwater?  1964.     64. So you   ve been here ever since?  Working as the state engineer for the Farmer   s Home Administration.  Well, since you   ve pretty much lived in Stillwater for fifty years, I  wonder what you think about how the town, how the university, has  grown. Is this college town different than the college town it was when  you were here?  I think so. Stillwater was kind of classified as a rural farm community  when I went to school here, and the old time   oh, ranchers and farmers     they kind of controlled the downtown. I think that they became more  sophisticated over the years and Stillwater kind of became a little bit  more of the larger   has a little bit of metropolitan stuff to it. The college  has doubled, and Stillwater has tripled in size. I don   t think you have the  animosity downtown as you had back in the    50s.  Right.  A lot of the people were born and reared here and had old businesses. A  lot of them didn   t particularly like the college. They kind of thought,     Well, we   d be better off just having the old town of Stillwater be the  size of Perkins.     Right. Well, what do you think about the controversy in the past year or  two over the Athletic Village expansion? Is that gonna be good for the  city and the campus?  14  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Personally, I think so, and I think that most of the engineers and the  people I talk to in Oklahoma City think it   s a great thing. You hear a few  people gripe and groan about it, but I think most of them think it   s a  great thing. The engineers in our office are engineers for Wal-Mart, and  we   re engineers on the new Wal-Mart store here, and they think that all  that   ll do is just enhance everything, the Athletic Village   I do, too. I  think it   s wonderful.  Do you think it was handled appropriately?  Well, they might have, from what I can tell   I hear people complain that  they might have gone out and talked to everybody a little bit nicer from  the beginning and kind of approached it a little bit better, but I think in  the long run, if I talk to a one hundred people about it all over the state,  there might be ten gripe and groan a little bit about it. The other ninety  will like it.  I just don   t see   I think it   s wonderful. I made a comment that I have  the club seats now, my football seats, and I said,    Well, the reason I did  that, if Boone Pickens can afford to put that much money in, I can surely  afford to buy those club seats.    (Laughter) And I think he spurs other  people doing that.  Sure. Sure. So tell me about the people. Did you mostly hang out with  the other GIs?  Yes. My last college roommate though was from Perry and he hadn   t  been in the Army, and the draft was still on then. Just because we got out  of the Army, the draft was still on. They were gonna draft those guys as  soon as they got out of school. He was drafted. He was from Perry. He  was a wrestler, and he and I were both civil engineers so we roomed  together the last year, and he got drafted and went to Alaska of all  places. And then another one that was real sharp from Ponca City, he  became an engineer in Saudi Arabia.  Wow.  But the one I mentioned, my roommate, he became the base engineer for  Altus Air Force Base.  And you have stayed in touch with these people?  Yeah. Yeah. We stay in touch. There for awhile, the engineers and   you  might find this interesting   from the classes of    55,    56,    57,    58 and     59, met once a year in Oklahoma City and had a big steak dinner.  15  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Oh.  Neal McCaleb is one of the ones that was in   we were all   we   re all  buddies. Yeah, if you go to school, like at Oklahoma State there   s not  many big classes. In my graduating class of civil engineers, by the time  we got down to it, probably about twenty.  Wow.  But we   re all buddies. We   ve been buddies ever since we got out of  school. We   ve drank coffee together, and I   ve been pall bearer at some  of their funerals and been at some of their weddings, and we   re all still  very close friends. We used to always meet at Homecoming. They have  a civil engineering luncheon you all   I guess you all know, tomorrow,  and I   ve never missed one of those. I may tomorrow because of the  parking situation. The club seats are on the north side, and I have to  come clear over to the engineering school to go back over there and eat.  But they still have a get together.  Yes.  I would think that would be common, and especially the engineers, now  let me tell you a little bit of a story about that. There are ten OU grads in  our office in Oklahoma City, civil engineering grads. They don   t go to  the football games together and don   t even speak about their  Homecoming. They don   t like each other I think. (Laughter) I mean, it   s  kind of an interesting thing that they do not socialize     Right, like you guys do.     and if I was in the office today, we would be discussing if we were  gonna meet up at the luncheon tomorrow, all the OSU engineers, and  we   d probably all show up. But if they   re   and they   re having a  Homecoming at OU, I think, tomorrow, and they won   t even get  together and discuss it     I wonder how much of that is generational, because I don   t think people  my age have those lifelong friendships as much.  Well, we were all in the same boat. We were all on the GI Bill and  didn   t have any money (Laughter) and going to school and studying, and  it just   but when you get out in the cold, cruel world, these guys have  all been in the consulting business or went somewhere. We all end up  working together.  Yes.  16  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  I was state engineer one time for twenty years for the FHA  Farmer   s  Home Administration  here in Stillwater. I had an engineers    seminar,  and I invited ninety-one consulting engineers to the seminar. Eighty-nine  of them were Oklahoma State grads.  Wow.  There was one from MIT and one from OU, so you   I don   t think that  they had the   well, it was just different   a lot of those guys lived in  Oklahoma City and they   d commute. And here you   re stuck in  Stillwater. When I was in school, you had to live here.  Right.  You couldn   t live anywhere else and go to school here. I think that   s the  reason Oklahoma State people are friendlier. We were all stuck here.  (Laughter) I mean, you can   t commute to Oklahoma State from Tulsa or  Edmond   it   s too far, and we all lived here and were stuck here, where  the Oklahoma City people lived all over Oklahoma City, Norman,  Moore     Right, commuted.     and they weren   t on the campus. Here, you   re pretty much stuck on  the campus if you live   which I think is great.  Yeah. Did you have a car?  Yes.  You did? What kind?  Of course I was old enough to have a car, but everyone had the same  type car. I had a    52 Ford, and the day I graduated I had 147,000 miles  on it.  Wow.  But isn   t that common for a college student?  You got out of Stillwater occasionally then? (Laughs)  I went home. Yeah, I went back out home pretty often and then I worked  in the summer, you know   job in the summertime.  Do you remember the tone of what it was like on campus when the name  17  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  was changed from A M to OSU?  You know, it didn   t seem to me like that was a big deal. I went two  years, I believe, at Oklahoma A M, and I was in English class when  they got to talking   everyone was real pleased that that was changed. I  thought it was a great idea and everybody else that I knew thought it was  a great idea.  Why?  Well, it just seemed like it was a university, and since   in the old days,  you had a lot of agriculture students here. When I was in school, the  largest class was mechanical engineers, with an aeronautical option, and  they pretty much controlled the school. And why would you have an  agriculture mechanical title when you could go to a university when  most of the students were not agriculture majors   even though that   s  great and the agriculture schools here are great, but it just seemed to me  like   at the time I   everyone I knew was pleased. I think I was a  sophomore when they changed it. I   m not sure about that but I think that  was     So your diploma says OSU?  My diploma says Oklahoma State, yes.  Okay.  The English professors used to require us to spell Oklahoma  Agricultural and Mechanical College (Laughter) every morning before  class started, and they said,    We don   t want you graduating from here  and can   t spell the name of the college (Laughter) that you graduated  from.    And it was kind of tough at first, everybody spelling that sucker  out.  That   s a long thing to spell. (Laughs) Well, just tell me some more of  your recollections. What are some other things that you remember?  Well, as I mentioned before, the GIs were about half the classes   that  some of the professors   I like to talk, but everyone talks about    ole  Square Root Smith. The Kansas basketball game was very interesting  because of the fact people still talk about it.  Yes.  And I think I remember that the total cost for room and board at Cordell  Hall was  60 dollars.  18  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  For a year?  For a semester.  Oh wow.  No, wait. That   s not true.  60 dollars a month.  A month?  Yeah,  60 dollars a month.  For Cordell?  I think after the first semester, it went to  66 dollars. But that   s pretty  cheap. That   s room and board per month. And they had three good  meals a day.  That was with your food?  That was with your food, yes.  And how much was coffee at the Y-Hut?  I   m gonna guess   we were talking about that this morning. I drank  coffee with two 1957 grads this morning. They said they thought it  might have been twenty cents. I don   t think it was over a quarter. I doubt  if it was a quarter, but it was pretty cheap. Might have been a dime. I   m  not for sure.  What do you pay today for coffee?  Well, I think over there   we drank coffee over at Red Rock  Bakery and  Restaurant , and I think it   s seventy-some cents, but we give a buck. We  just throw a dollar down and     Still a bargain.  Still a dollar a cup over there, and everybody gives a tip. I think that   s  about what it is. I   m not for sure. (Laughter) I was gonna say   the notes  that I took were about Pistol Pete     Tell me about Pistol Pete. You were there for the unveiling of the  mascot?  Yes. We were at a Homecoming football game, and I   m almost positive  19  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  it was 1958, and Oklahoma State had a real good football team and they  were playing the Air Force Academy. The Air Force Academy, I think,  was undefeated   two of the top teams in the nation. Oklahoma State  went to a bowl game that year, went to the Bluegrass Bowl. Well, I think  it was at the half, here comes this crazy Pistol Pete guy out on the  (Laughter) middle of the field and nobody knew what it was or who it  was or why. It was a secret and it took us awhile for that to soak in that it  was    ol Frank Eaton (Laughter) because he rode in all the parades prior  to that, and that   s the unveiling of Pistol Pete as we see him today.  Oh, okay. Great.  It was quite a surprise to everybody.  Did the students like it?  Yeah, they were kind of shocked. Really, you kind of looked out there  and think,    What is that fool (Laughter) coming out here with that big     but you could tell it looked like Frank Eaton   but it was a total surprise,  as far as I know, to everybody.  Yes.  That happened just about the time Oklahoma State went from Oklahoma  Agricultural and Mechanical to Oklahoma State University, about the  time when they   and that   s when they stopped calling teams    Aggies     and pretty much went to    Cowboys,    all about that same time.  Everybody was pleased with the cowboy nickname. And I think other  colleges have used   Wyoming, I think, uses the same   I   m not for sure  they don   t even use him. I kind of think they do. But I think that   s good  that you have a mascot like that.  Well, was school spirit in the    50s like it is today?  I think so, every bit as good. You literally, at those basketball games     there was no change. You couldn   t, if you went with someone, you  couldn   t talk to them. (Laughter) Just like today, you can   t talk to  whoever you go to the ballgame with. Too much noise. That   s the first  time in my life I ever went anywhere that was solid noise that you  couldn   t even talk to anybody. It was the same then. And the  basketball   but the football games were full. I mean that was, like I  said, they had a national championship baseball team that year in    59,  which was good. So it was good and the wrestling team was national  champions then just like they are now.  Yeah.  20  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  They were national champions in    59.  So the Y-Hut   was it a hut literally?  It was a little hut-looking thing that was very small, probably 40 feet  long and 20 feet wide. It had booths on both sides and, from what I can  remember and what people remind me, the guy that ran it was blind.  And they had snacks in there, but it was primarily a coffee drinking  place. It was right east of the Student Union between there and what  would be the business school, and people would come out of the  classroom building   instead of going over to the Student Union, they  would stop in the Y-Hut.  There   s another thing that we all talk about and after the years   when  you were freshmen, sophomores and juniors, you studied all the time.  By the time we were seniors, we all learned to take a break and didn   t  schedule anything, a one-hour break. We didn   t schedule class from  10:00 till 11:00 our senior year, and go over to the Student Union and  drink coffee. Never did do that the first three years. We got to be seniors,  we got a little bit wise about that thing.  Did the Y-Hut get torn down eventually?  I   m gonna guess and there   s some people that would know, but I was  thinking he probably got in real poor health and it probably lasted  another four or five years after that. And of course with expansion, they  probably let him get in poor health before they bought him out and  closed it.  Right.  It was probably an old, old coffee shop years before that.  Sure. Now, did the women and the men both go there for coffee?  Yeah, and professors.  And the professors?  It was real common for a professor to teach a class and go there and  drink a cup of coffee because it was handy.  Yeah.  Just walk out   and didn   t have to go to the Student Union and stand in  line or anything. There were probably six booths on each side.  21  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Were there any women in your major?  No. I was gonna mention that earlier. I never had an engineering class, a  physics class, a math class, that had a woman in it.  Wildman recollected  after this interview that one math class had a woman in it   Why do you think that is?  Well, I don   t know. There weren   t near as many women then in school. I  did take one class over  in the Classroom Building , I took geography,  and most of the athletes were in that class and about half were women.  But at the Engineers    Ball the year I graduated, there were three women  came in and sat at the table with us at the dance   at the Engineers    Ball  they still do, I   m sure, on Saint Patrick   s Day and they  the girls that  were there  were mechanical engineers. And I   d never had classes with  them at all. They were very attractive, and I   m sure they got great jobs.  (Laughter) I never in any of my statistics, physics, strength of material,  senior classes   have a woman in any of them.  Yeah.  I think there   s probably as many women in it now as there are men.  What about black students? Were there     I think there were about two in the whole school. There weren   t any  black basketball players, and I   m sure there weren   t any black football  players. That came on in the    60s.  Right. Right.  But I think there were a couple of students here if I remember.  Do you remember that being a big deal?  Well, just that   no one even paid any attention to it. You never even  thought about it one way or the other.  Well, what advice do you have for students today, whether they   re going  into engineering or anything else?  Well, one thing that you talk about in the coffee shops in Oklahoma  City, and even the Governor   s Water Conferences and what have you     there   s an awful lot of students that enroll in school up here today just to  get in school, and they graduate and they don   t take anything, and  they   ve got a degree on the wall and they can   t get a job. We kind of  22  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  think maybe talking   why don   t more of them take some of the  sciences? Because there   s still tremendous job openings for all of those.  That   s one thing I guess you just can   t help, but we kind of wonder  around the coffee shops   so many students get a degree. They don   t  know what they   re gonna do. And I think an awful lot of the students  today   their high school teachers are their role models, so they come  over here and in other colleges and they   re gonna be teachers. Then  generally the teachers aren   t the highest paid people (Laughter) in the  world, and we kind of feel like maybe, you know, that   s not their fault.  Right.  But     So more math and science should be stressed to the high school     I think there   s still a tremendous opening for anyone that goes into the  sciences.  Sure.  I don   t think many people, if you come over here   I know a lot of  students come over here and take engineering after the first year and  quit. Now if you   re gonna study every night, you don   t have any  business in there if you don   t. You   re not gonna do it. I always told my  daughter, Wendy, the day she started,    It   s gonna take more guts than it  is brains (Laughter) to get through that college.    And I think that   s true.  Yeah.  Just bow your neck and study and you   ll be okay.  Yeah. Yeah.  I think the students are smarter than we were, by far.  What other family members have gone to OSU?  Well, Joy has and Wendy.  And I went for one year.  And I think that   I told Chelsea, my granddaughter, that she would  probably fall right into that because see Wendy was in a sorority. She   ll  be asked in the same sorority, won   t she? I assume and has a chance if  she wants to be.  23  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Yeah. Has she talked about coming here?  Yeah. She insists on it.  How old is Chelsea now?  Let   s see. She   ll be 17.  Okay. She   s a junior?  Junior in high school. I   ve talked to her about it quite a lot.  So you would be proud to have your third generation of your family     Yes. Why not? Well, I think it   s easy for a high school student at  Stillwater to come right over here to college because you   re gonna have  about ten or fifteen that was in your class, and it   s comfortable. There   s  nothing gonna get you real excited about going. Come from a small  town and you   re scared to death. I   ve talked to students that said,    No  one talks to me. They don   t take roll in classes, and I   m just shocked.     Well, Wendy and Joy weren   t shocked at all. They just had   still  running around with the same ones they did in high school.  A little easier   not so much of a culture shock, I guess.  There   s about, from five to ten OSU grads drink coffee over at  Mickael   s   and the girls that work in there are all college students. Two  or three of them graduate and don   t have a clue what they   re gonna do.  They   ve got a degree in their hand, but they didn   t take anything, and  they   re just kind of out looking for a job. Now there   s a couple went in  the medical field and immediately went to work.  Do you advise young engineering students?  Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I think if you got a degree in engineering  tomorrow, you could even go to work for our company in Oklahoma  City. I think it   s that critical.  Really?  And they keep about twenty   they   re one of the top engineering firms in  the state. They   re designing approximately twenty Wal-Mart stores  today in five states, and they really have trouble   we have trouble  finding a young student that will go out to a night meeting and stay in  some town like Stillwater and meet with a city council building a new  Wal-Mart store. They say,    I   m not gonna do that. My wife doesn   t want  24  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  me to travel,    and on and on and on. (Laughter) So you have that.  Different work ethic, isn   t it?  Yes, and it   s really a problem.  Yes.  We   re the engineers for a hundred towns, and we have trouble getting  any of the young engineers to even go with us because they didn   t have  to beat their brains out like we did, seems like. You know, their folks  paid their way through school and they   ll do something else and what  have you. We just kind of feel like that they   re smarter. There   s no  question that they   re taking even nuclear physics and all that stuff that  we didn   t even take. But that   s just the way of the world and they   ll  probably all do great. (Laughter)  Well, I think we   re about to wrap up. Is there anything else you want to  talk about?  Well, another thing that is discussed with all college grads, and  especially OSU grads, is the fact that if you graduate from high school  and you go into the workplace and then you take this guy and he goes  through college, his income is gonna be 10 times what this guy that  didn   t go to college   not just a few times   it   s gonna be 10 times.  It   s a million dollars over your lifetime.  Yes, what he would make by not going, and we tell everybody that. I  think you can increase that a little bit more if you take some tough  courses and go into the sciences. The highest priced engineers that came  out of here were electrical engineers, when we were in school. Probably  still are, and that   s tough. And the chemical engineers. But we tell  everybody at the office that comes in there   I met with the Wal-Mart  president   s kids in Oklahoma City about a month ago. The president of  SMC is Tom McCaleb from Norman. He   s a Texas grad. He wanted me  to meet with them and tell them what to expect, and I told them when  you go to college, don   t take physics, chemistry, math, calculus   take  history and English. Go into school slow where you   ll pass and you kind  of get a little bit of background behind you and don   t let some advisor  just load you up. I   ve seen them load them up and they flunk their first  year. Take it easy. Get your feet on the ground, and then take   very  slowly go into your math and your sciences.  Right.  25  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  And I told them for God   s sakes go to a college that they like. Don   t go  where your folks say you   ve got to do this and you   ve got to do that.  Select your   I   m talking to the parents, but the kids are in the  conference room; none of them lived in Oklahoma. These are all Wal-  Mart people out of Arkansas mostly, and I told them if the kids want to  go to Arkansas University, fine. If they want to go to Missouri, fine. If  they want to go to Harvard, fine. If that   s where they want to go, they   ll  be better off initially. They might not like it and want to come back  home, but for God   s sakes don   t let them take a whole bunch of tough  math courses that first year. And I would tell anybody that.  Yes.  And I said   and I know a guy that lived in Stillwater that went clear  through to his senior year in college. A bank here in Stillwater offered  him a loan officer   s position if he got that degree. They didn   t care     they had to have a piece of paper on the wall. He got crossways with his  girlfriend. He didn   t show up and take his finals. He   s working for a  floor contractor in Texas. He got an    F    in all his classes   and he was a  senior   and he had a bank job offered him. So I tell them for God   s sake  get that degree and get it behind. But the people that I drink coffee with  are all OSU grads and all successful. And there   s one of them an  electrical engineer. One   s a geologist, and one   s a     Wow.     I mean, just different fields. And I imagine you feel the same way  when you walked across that stage, it was a good feeling, wasn   t it     Central State.  Yes.  That   s a good feeling to have that    ol degree (Laughter) in your hip  pocket.  So you spent a lot of time in the Library?  I spent some time in the Library. One of the interesting courses I took  was Oklahoma history and political science, and Dr. LeRoy Fischer was  the instructor here at Oklahoma State, and after each class   we took it  Monday, Wednesday and Friday, it was a three-hour course   he  required us to go to the Library and read at least thirty pages. Then when  we walked into the class the next time we sat down with the Blue Book  and we wrote what those thirty pages told us. (Laughter) So as a result of  that, we spent a lot of time in the Library, and it was real interesting  stuff.  26  Simpson  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  I   ll give you an example. One of the assignments he gave us was to write  about when Churchill and Roosevelt met in the middle of the Atlantic  Ocean and decided whether the United States would declare war on  Germany with England. He assigned us that, and that went on for about  four weeks, and we would have to write whether we felt like that  England got us into the war or didn   t get us into the war. So as a result  of that, you had to spend a lot of time at the Library.  Another interesting story about it   and I was taking a graduate course in  civil engineering in    59   and they had us design a dam over the Snake  River in Washington State, and the water ran over the top of the dam.   According to Wildman, this was assigned right before Christmas  vacation and the class was not happy about it . And so we were in the  process of designing this dam, and we all got to thinking,    Wonder if  there   s ever been one designed before?    So we go to the Library and,  sure enough, in New York State they had built one like it and we were  all leaving out part of the central part of that dam, and that was the trick  to it.  According to Wildman, the design was wrong, but they had  changed it, and could see it in the picture at the Library.  The trick to it  was that if you filled the thing full of water, you designed it for that     but what happened, it was empty. If it was empty, the dam would fall  forward into the river because it didn   t have any water in it. Over at the  Library, it had the plans and specs on that particular dam that we looked  up in New York, and we would have never got the problem worked  without that. It was amazing that we had worked this problem and it was  wrong, because we never dreamed of designing the dam if there wasn   t  any water in the river. But now Dr. Fischer was very strong on going to  the Library after every class and   imagine reading all that stuff, how  much you   d get out of it because it was always different subjects.  The Library was fairly new at that time?  Well, it must have been.  Yes.  It was there and it had to be new. The Classroom Building was new. I  think it was only about three years old. I don   t know when it was built. I  was in the Army then, but wasn   t it about    51 or    52?     53 for the Library.  Yeah. See this was just two years later. It was a great place to go. We  enjoyed it. I always liked going over there.  What did it look like? Do you remember?  27  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Simpson  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Well, it was beautiful. I mean, it was just like it is today, and we went in  on the first floor and had people sitting there helping you to find what  you was looking for. Of course, we had to learn the system to find our  own reference material and all that.  Yes.  But we didn   t study over there because   well, we were doing mostly  problems and it wasn   t that type   I never studied over there at all. We   d  have to get all of that stuff out of there and read it and report on it. I  remember it was beautiful and we enjoyed going over there. Of course, I  lived in Cordell Hall and walked right by the thing ever day and it was     like I say, to me it was wonderful. Probably still is. That would be my  guess.  Well, we   d love for you to come back and visit anytime. (Laughs)  Yes.  Well, thank you very much.  All right. I enjoyed showing up today.  ------- End of October 20, 2006 interview -------  Today is August 27, 2007 and we   re here in the Angie Debo Room of the  OSU Library, Mr. Cecil Wildman who graduated in        59  From Oklahoma State University     Civil engineering.  Mr. Wildman has agreed to come back for a second interview with us.  We learned in the course of our conversations after the first interview  that he   s had some interesting career experiences that were somewhat  significant for the town of Stillwater and for Oklahoma State University.  Could you tell us a little bit about your career in the early 1960s?  In 1962, I was given the position of the area engineer for the Soil  Conservation Services in the Perry office. I was in charge of eighteen  flood control watersheds in nine counties. And one of my counties was  Payne County and one of the watersheds was Stillwater Creek. So every  Monday morning, I would drive to Stillwater. I would pick up officials  of the water association and the upstream flood control. We would take  28  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  maps of the projects and we   d go to the land owners to get the  easements. That was the second stage. Those water shed programs were  very, very popular at that time and they started in Oklahoma. The first  ones were built on Washita River out by Cheyenne.  And were they federally funded?  They were federally funded. All of them in the state, except if a city  wanted additional water for a municipal water supply. About the first  two in the state, I served as the engineer on them. One of the reasons I  was promoted to that job was because of the Stillwell and Sallisaw  projects. And then Stillwater Creek Watershed Authority wanted to put  extra water in Lake McMurtry for the city of Stillwater. So the way that  worked, the federal government paid for all the flood control dams in the  county and all these watersheds, except in the case of Stillwater. The  city had to pay extra for the amount of water that they wanted to put in  McMurtry for additional water supplies for the city of Stillwater.  Otherwise it was all federal money.  Where does the water in Stillwater Creek originate?  Well it isn   t a big watershed. Lake Carl Blackwell is on Stillwater  Creek. But if you go north to Meadow Park, just straight north of town,  you   re not even in Stillwater watershed anymore. It   s fairly short north,  it goes west past Lake Carl Blackwell and then it drains into the river  near Perkins. It   s a rather small watershed, but it   s a tough one. It always  flooded.  Oh.  One of the worst flooded watersheds in Oklahoma.  And what time of the year would be common for it to experience  flooding?  April. Stillwater flooded big in 1957 in April. School was still going on.  And it flooded again in    59.  Were you a student during that time period?  I was in    57 when it flooded, yes. The first watershed dam built on  Stillwater Creek protected the area south of the Pizza Hut that goes  down through where I was showing the boy who picked me up, down  around McDonald   s. Those houses were underwater. The first one built  was Professor Hazen on 160 acres of land. So if you can visualize about  two and a half blocks north and about two and a half blocks west of  29  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Lakeview on Monroe. Can you visualize that one?  Yes.  First one is the big one there, west of those houses. That was the first  one built on Stillwater Creek.  And that was shortly after the big flood?  Well, I was only two and a half years in Perry and I came down here  every Monday in    63 and    64.  And who were the people that you met with when you came down? You  said you met with several officials?  Sam Meyers was the official here in Stillwater. He had married one of  the Berry girls and had an office downtown. And he was kind of a big  wig   he ran for Mayor a couple of times, wasn   t elected. Lawrence  Hamm was a farmer. Let me back up, Lester Hamm was his brother.  Lester Hamm was a farmer west of town, everybody liked him. I would  take those two guys and we would meet at the county SCS office in  downtown Stillwater with Bill McMurtry. Bill McMurtry was an elderly  man in charge of the office. Lake McMurtry is named after him. So the  four of us would go out to a landowner   s home and I   d get the maps out  and we   d explain how big the dam was   the area of it, how much flood  water it could hold and all that. And we   d ask them for an easement.  Chilton Swank   by the way, all these people are dead now. Chilton  Swank was the attorney. He was a really nice hotshot attorney. We   d  take the easements to him and he   d record them. Then that would allow  the planning engineers to come in and plan that lake. The construction  office which was also in Perry had a construction engineer that worked  for me and he came in and was in charge of building the dams.  So, if you could clarify for me your role then, was to develop the plans  and get all of the paperwork and maps and things together?  Nope, I was the, probably pretty much the public relations engineer. I  was, prior to this job, a planning engineer on several watersheds. I  worked out of Oklahoma City. They had an engineer, a geologist and an  economist and we would go to a watershed that people would ask for us  to study and we would locate the dams. The geologist would tell us  whether we could build them out of the dirt that was there. The  economist would say was it worth building with the government  spending the money. Those maps were in a book and were sent to  Congress and Congress approved the money. Then they sent those to an  area office to complete.  30  Neurohr  Wildman  Then I was promoted and I had three engineers who worked under me.  But I had the authority to go to these towns and I was kind of on my  own. Now, I picked these guys up, we   d eat lunch together and we   d talk  about it. We   d try to get the easements and try to satisfy the people.  When that was done, then the construction engineer   which there was a  large office in Perry, they would take over those plans and award the  contracts and supervise the construction. I was hands off at that time. I  was actually administrative, pretty much, by that time.  Okay, and then you had a story about a particular dam that we were  interested in hearing about today on Hall of Fame and Western.  Yes, several people have asked me over the years about that and no one  seems to know much about it. But you can understand they wouldn   t  know much about it because I   m the only one living that was involved.  Dr. Willham was a real popular president here and as far as I know,  everybody really liked him. So one day, Bill McMurtry called me and  said,    We got to meet with Dr. Willham.    I said,    Well, that   s kind of  strange, meeting with the president of the college.    And he said,    Yeah,  we   ve got to meet him out at the food services on the corner of Hall of  Fame and Western.    Western was an old dirt road. If you remember it, it  was open but it wasn   t paved and people didn   t use it much. Dr.  Willham met me out there. And he said,    I want a dry dam here, I want a  dam that will hold with no water.    I told him,    That   s pretty unusual.     And he said,    Well, that   s what I want.     I thought about it later. He wanted to protect those people below there.  And it really does a great job. But I told him I was going to talk him out  of it. So he said,    Okay, we   re not going to walk up to McElroy and  leave everybody else here.    Well it was a dirty, old windy day, dust was  blowing and he had a dark suit and a tie and all that. I was trying to  explain to him that it would be a nice lake. The college would own it and  we   d have to build a road around Western but it would be pretty. And he  said,    Well, you haven   t talked me out of anything.    By the time we got  back to the corner he said,    No, it   s going to be a dry dam.    And he said,     Any problems with that?    I said,    No, if you want a dry dam it   s going  to be a dry dam.     I might explain that to people that don   t understand   if I can do this  simple. Assume you   ve got a bathtub full of water and it   s flowing over  the top. And you keep running the faucet in there it   s going to flow over  the top. Eventually, if you turn the faucet off, it will settle down to the  overflow, and it   ll settle down and then it   ll stay in that tub and go out  this overflow. And you got about that much distance between that and  the top. That   s the way most flood-control dams are today, they hold  this, what we call the permanent pool of water. If you reach down and  31  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  pull the plug out of the bottom of the tub, it   s going to drain the whole  thing. Well that dam hasn   t got a plug in the bottom. So it can fill up  during a heavy flood, but it immediately is trying to drain out.  It takes two or three weeks, they tell me, sometimes for it to drain out,  instead of all that water rushing in the creek. So it   s a good thing. I think  he probably did a wise thing. It   s very interesting because today you  would never have a president of a college do a meaningless job like that,  would you? I mean, he   d have five staff people out there talking and  probably a couple of attorneys. But he was out there himself and a nice  person. I always remember that, when I go over that dam, to this day I  still remember that trip we took. But that was his idea and nobody else   s.  Did he have an engineering background?  No, I don   t think so. He was a farm guy from Randlett, Oklahoma if I  remember. He was sharp, and he worked all the time. But, I   m sure he  had asked some people before we got out there some of the details. All I  had to do, at that particular time, was just say,    Okay, it   s going to be  dry.    I had the authority to say it would be dry and then I submitted it to  the design section here in Stillwater, and then the planning and the  construction engineers built it.  Were dry dams unusual for this area at that time?  Yes, there would probably be one out of fifty maybe and it would be an  unusual situation because most people wanted the water. And this area,  dams around here are pretty. If you   ve been around them, they   re nice  lakes. Most people wanted them. It was a little unusual, there was only  one on Stillwater Creek that even had a request for it.  Well, how many dams are there on Stillwater Creek, approximately?  There   s a plan available in the SCS state office that shows all of those.  And I   d just have to guess. One of the first watersheds I worked on out  in western Oklahoma was Barnitz Creek, and it had 62 dams. I would  guess Stillwater is down in the category of about 25. It was a smaller  watershed than those big ones, but very critical to this area because  Stillwater Creek flooded. There was an article in the Daily Oklahoman  about a month ago that was very interesting that told how well those  things had worked all over the state of Oklahoma. Did y   all read that  article?  I didn   t.  They ran a special on it. Said there wasn   t any of their dams that had  32  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  failed. They all worked. They   re talking about all the way from the  Texas line to the Arkansas line. That historically, in these floods, the  dams have worked real well.  Why was Oklahoma at the fore front of this do you think? Did we have  some legislators or politicians that were very involved in this?  Yes. There was a guy by the name of Red Mayo who was a banker in  Cheyenne and he was one of the first people that got the Congressmen  and the people interested in the Washita River. It was the first big  watershed project in the United States. Well then, they just kind of  caught a hold and there was lots of money available. If they were  building them today, Congress doesn   t allocate any money. They didn   t  get them all built, but they   ve dried up those funds. I think that if you  went out to work on one today, the Soil Conservation Service, SCS,  would hire private consultants to do whatever they needed to do. But  that program, I understand, has no funding, as of today, for construction.  Okay. Your recommendation had been to make a lake there. And you  saw the benefits to this being, just the beauty or the recreation  possibilities?  Yes, yes, and because most all of the rest of them wanted a lake. I even  described to Dr. Willham how I thought that it would cover up Western  permanently. But the SCS would build a road around the west side and it  would just be a pretty thing. But he was primarily interested in flood  control and I think he did the right thing. I don   t know whether people  complain about that thing or not, but it works. It isn   t real pretty because  out there today you   d have to mow the grass and there   s no water in it,  but it sure works.  Were you surprised when he said that he wanted to take a walk with you  and discuss this a little more?  Yes, I was. Yes, and here   s the president of the college and I thought  well, I   ve got all these wheels here in Stillwater standing around there  and they were a little bit concerned. I think they didn   t want to tackle  him with a bunch of stuff and it kind of caught me by surprise. But that   s  okay, we had a good argument. I always kind of cherished the fact that I  told him,    Fine, let   s build the dry dam.    You want to ask me a little bit  about   or I might volunteer a little about Karsten Creek.  Okay, one other thing I do want to ask you, though   did you have any  other contact with Dr. Willham through the years? And did you and he  ever discuss the dry dam?  33  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  I think a couple of times at receptions and places that I was invited to. I  just shook hands with him and it was a short deal. I don   t think he was  here too much longer. You   ve got to realize, I quit that job. I mean right  in the middle of all that. I wasn   t responsible for any of the construction.  I was only in Perry two and a half years and then was offered the state  engineer   s job at the Farmer   s Home Administration here in Stillwater in  May of    64. We were just getting started on the construction of the  Stillwater Creek and I turned it all over to other people that replaced me.  I had a great job with Farmer   s Home for twenty years where I was  located in the USDA building. So I got away from all of that except I  drank coffee with the SCS engineers out at the USDA building. I had  literally no follow-up on those flood control projects.  Okay, I would like to hear about Karsten.  Well a lot of people don   t know a lot about Karsten. It   s not a real  interesting story, but it kind of is too. Lawrence Hamm owned the land  where the land is located. He was a farmer that owned that 80 acres on  that corner as you drive out 51. And he told me he had purchased it from  two elderly women that came to Stillwater and who wanted to get rid of  that 80 acres. He told me he had to come to town to borrow the money  and he had trouble doing that, but he got it bought. Well something got  in his head that the lake wasn   t going to be very big. So I   m sitting in the  office in Perry and he comes in there very upset. I don   t know him at  that time   he   s very upset. He says,    I   m really concerned this lake is  going to be a mud puddle.    And I said,    Well, Lawrence, you know  we   re putting extra water in there.    You build them bigger when you   re  protecting a highway, those lakes are built bigger. You also build them  bigger if you can irrigate out of them. Well, he could irrigate out of that  one and also Highway 51 you had to protect it. So he said,    I believe  they call those Class-A structures.    And I said,    It   s bigger than the  normal one and you know what the others look like.    I said,    It   s going  to be a bigger dam and a bigger lake because we   ve got to protect  Highway 51.     He left and in the meantime, I   m leaving the agency for a new job. He  comes back again about two weeks later and he   s real upset again. And  he said,    You know, I just don   t think I   m going to like this lake.    I said,     Well Lawrence, I   ve been thinking about it    and I said,    I   ll tell you  what I   m going to do. I   ve got the top inspectors in Oklahoma working  for me. One of them is a local Stillwater High School graduate you   ve  known all your life. I   m going to assign him as the inspector on this  lake. It   s your baby and his baby to see it   s built    cause I   m not going to  be around.    And he said,    That suits me fine.    So about two years later,  I was downtown drinking coffee on a Saturday morning after the dam  was built and he came up to me and said,    That   s a beautiful lake. I want  34  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  you to come out Sunday and we   ll drive around and show it to you.    So  for ten years he told me the same thing and I never did go out there on a  Sunday. I was busy and he said,    It   s just great. I want you to drive out  and I want to show you that sucker.    And I never did go out. I haven   t  seen it to this day.  Oh you haven   t?  Nope. But he was very upset about that originally. He told me later that  he and that inspector stayed out there and they watched that contractor.  He said he built a beautiful lake. Very few people have any idea that  that   s the way that even got started. He sold it and I think it was a catfish  farm. Then the golf people took it over and part of that ended up being  Karsten Creek. But they called it Hamm   s Lake when it was built. And  you know that Boomer was part of the Stillwater Creek flood control  project also.  Boomer Lake was?  Boomer, yes, yes. So there were some pretty interesting lakes built just  to protect Stillwater. I think they   ve done a pretty good job.  Was there any community reaction, one way or the other, to any of the  projects?  You know, I   m thinking at that time that the people in Stillwater and the  officials thought it was a great thing. There have been some of the  communities around Oklahoma that have fought that program because  the landowners would not give the easements and cover up their wheat  fields and whatever. Some of them have failed to go toward completion  because of that. This was a popular project. Stillwater had flooded.  Stillwater sits on a creek. It   s down in a hole. It   s probably one of the  most volatile towns in Oklahoma for flooding. But it really wasn   t bad  this summer and I   m sure these flood control dams helped a lot.  Mm-hmm, we had a lot of rain this year.  This big one north of town, by that little golf course that they   re building  on the west side, it   s one of the last ones built. Just a couple miles north  on the west side, there   s a great big dam.  Lakeview?  They have batting cages and stuff below it.  I wonder, Whittenburg Park     35  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Yes. See, that   s one of the newest ones and then McMurtry and Karsten  and Boomer   they catch lots of water and let it out easy.  But where is the water supply for the city of Stillwater?  The big one now is Kaw Reservoir near Ponca City. Lake Carl  Blackwell can serve water to Stillwater and so can McMurtry. They  were both designed to serve water to Stillwater. And Blackwell did for  years and years and years. They never did really develop McMurtry, so  Perry comes in and gets about half the water rights in McMurtry. A lot  of people are very critical of that happening. But right now they have a  thirty inch, big water main to Kaw. I   m going to guess that   s about 20  years, no it   s probably about 30 years old now. In our conversations  before, Bill Thomas was the mayor of Stillwater. His brother owns  Thomas Ford. His dad owned Thomas Ford. Bill was going 100 miles an  hour and was a great mayor. But he didn   t let anyone get in his way. He  was a pushy guy and wanted to build that bad, that 30 inch water line to  Kaw, that was his baby. And build the water treatment plant near  Stillwater so that Stillwater would own the plant and operate it.  He appointed myself and Carl Reid and the Head of the Civil  Engineering Department, Vernon Parcher, as advisers to the City  Council for a year. I met with the City Council for a year and I liked  Bill, he liked me. But he ran the City Council meetings like a dictator,  which was okay. A lot of people were opposed to the cost of the project  because it raised their rates and taxes and all that stuff. But the new  pipeline eliminated Blackwell and McMurtry as needs for Stillwater.  Do you remember what year that was, approximately?  I   m going to say that was approximately 30 years ago. So what would  that be? It   s    70   I was still state engineer for Farmer   s Home and I  retired from that job in    84. So, I was still there. So maybe around    80,  1980,    79 maybe. That was our new water supply for Stillwater.  And can you tell that it   s made a difference in the growth of Stillwater?  Yes, I think   and the politicians ought to be telling this story instead of  me. But all of those developers and all of those big plants on Perkins,  they were just starting. And they gave Stillwater an ultimatum. You   ve  got to get a guaranteed water supply or we   re not going to build here.  And I can   t remember who they all are   National Standard, Mercury  Marine   all of those were coming in. They really pushed big time for  that. I think it allowed Stillwater just to bloom. Every realtor in town  was for it, voted for that vote that came out. It didn   t pass by a lot, but  people wanted it bad. It   s been an assurance.  36  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  And you can see the significance of that at that time?  Yes, yes I think that they gave Stillwater an ultimatum that you do  something because they just didn   t want to rely on Lake Carl Blackwell  and Lake McMurtry for a water supply. I argued with Bill almost every  day. He   d come over here and drink coffee with me at the USDA  building and I argued with him all the time about the fact, that if we built  the plant at Ponca City, we could have sold water to Ponca City, Perry,  Morrison and the water districts and everybody between here and Ponca.  And he said,    I want the water treatment plant in Stillwater. I want the  Stillwater people to run it. And that   s the way it   s going to be.    (Laughs)  We argued all the time about it   friendly arguments. We used to drink a  cup of coffee   I argued with him for a year about it, but it was a  friendly argument.  When you mentioned the dry dam and talking about the significance of it  for the homes, what neighborhoods or streets are you talking about that  you feel like that helped     If you can visualize off of Farm Road by the Vet school. That creek goes  through all those homes, going to the south end of Stillwater on  Stillwater Creek. I didn   t ever live out there, but I understand that there  was always a problem. This dam, I understand, it solved that problem. I  never heard anyone complain. They claim it takes it two weeks, three  weeks, four weeks to drain out of there after a flood. And those people  just have a creek, before it would have rushed down through there.  And many of them probably don   t know the story     They don   t even know the dam   s there, don   t even know why it   s there,  they just know it doesn   t flood. Those houses, probably half of them,  have sold. And the last thing you   d even think about is,    Well there   s a  flood control dam up there protecting us.     I see a group of students that practice archery over there on the south  side of that dam when I go home a lot. And they probably have no idea.  Are there any other noteworthy projects in OSU or the Stillwater area  that you want to mention, that we haven   t talked about?  Well, I might want to mention something and we won   t have to go into  detail at all. Well you know Stillwater is surrounded by water districts.  And none of them were built prior to    64. I was the state engineer for the  whole state. I had all 77 counties and we experimented with different  types of plastic pipe. The first 10 inch plastic pipe we ever decided to  approve was installed west of Stillwater. We tied west of Stillwater to  rural water district number three that the city now owns. We ran 10 inch  37  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  plastic pipe out there and that was the first time we   d ever tried 10 inch  plastic pipe on a project, it works great.  Does it?  Yes.  Do you have photographs or anything from your work or what you were  involved in?  On the watershed projects and that involved Stillwater? I left all that in  Perry, of course, when I left the agency. I may have a few old ones but I  have lots of photographs statewide of the rural water districts and stuff  that was built, but there was no reason for me to keep any of that stuff.  Is there still an office in Perry, then, that would have     I   m pretty sure that construction office is still there.     any historical information and plans and things?  In the state office here, I would think in Stillwater, still has all those  plans. And the plan book is about this   most of them have this cover,  about this big, they   re not very big. And in the back of them they have  all the plans of all the dams. It may be 20 pages of plans. It   s all just  small scale. They would have the big ones, too, I   m sure, filed and those  books are available.  And how did your college education at OSU tie in with your career?  Anything noteworthy you would want to say about that?  Well, I think I mentioned in my previous interview that when I was state  engineer for the Farmer   s Home, we dealt with private consultants every  day. I called a meeting, a seminar at the Student Union case study room  one time, and it was by invitation only, just to consultant engineers that  worked on water and sewer projects in Oklahoma. And I think I   m right  that there were 81 private consultants that came to the meeting. 78 were  OSU consulting engineers. There were three that weren   t, two from OU  and one from MIT, I remember that. We just invited all of them. I didn   t  realize till they showed up and signed their names. They were all glad to  come back in Stillwater.  OSU Civil Engineering wasn   t a big school then. But there were always  jobs available, they still are today. This has nothing to do with what  we   re talking about but there   s a girl that   s a friend of my daughters.  She   s a graduate civil engineer and she got registered last week and  38  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  works in Tulsa. She wanted to possibly transfer or find a job in  Oklahoma City, her mother lives in Oklahoma City. I wouldn   t know her  if she came in the door but I talked to her last week and set up an  appointment at our office in Oklahoma City.  She interviewed last Friday and the president of the firm offered her a  job on the spot. Well, she couldn   t take it. She called me last night.  She   s still working in Tulsa and has a really good job and she was a little  surprised that he offered her a job on the spot, says,    You can move  tomorrow and you   re going to work.    Well the reason I mention that,  you don   t find a lot of civil engineers running up and down the street. I  mean, that   s a small class and regardless of what anyone says, that   s a  tough course to take. You have to have a major in math and a minor in  chemistry and minor in physics and all that to get a degree in civil  engineering. So there   s not a lot of students in that, there never was. But  historically, all of those guys became   what   s the word? They all  became     Successful?  Successful, yes. And still are. Just like in this case, can you imagine her  coming from Tulsa and just interviewing. I don   t even know her and I  ask the president of the company to interview her, see about going to  work and he offered her a job. And he was a little upset she didn   t take  it. And this was Friday.  What led you into civil engineering?  Primarily the money. (Laughs) I mean, there was lots of money  available. But I had worked for the federal government, I had gone to  business college and I was offered a real good job with the federal  government in Woodward, that   s my home county. I   d worked there  with aerophotos and when I got drafted in the Army, and in the Army,  that   s what I did. When I came out, I thought well if I go to school and  take civil engineering, the Soil Conservation Service will pay me over  the summer as an employee of theirs. So in the summertime, the day  school is out, I can go to work on Monday and work till school starts  with the Soil Conservation Service on their survey crews. And it was  really a good deal for me. I was on the GI Bill and so they did exactly  that. When I was offered these jobs when I graduated, I told them I   d  kind of like to go to Oklahoma City. The reason was I didn   t want to get  stuck in some little town in the middle of nowhere. And they gave me  the planning engineer   s job in Oklahoma City, that   s where their  headquarters were at that time. So it was just kind of a natural fit for me.  Was it common for people to work in the summer and to have that  39  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  hands-on experience like you had?  I think it was very uncommon. At the Soil Conservation, we had six of  us scattered around. All six of us were veterans. They all came out of  and finally finished college at different times but we were one of those  crews that had about two or three students that were veterans. They had  about six or seven crews around over the state. I just happened to be on  one that worked out of Clinton. And the reason is because I had an  apartment at Shattuck and they did everything for me, just really nice.  They were even nice enough when I was offered a job as state engineer  job at Farmer   s Home, the two directors of the two agencies both said  they would pay my expenses to move from Perry to Stillwater. They   d  welcome me to quit one agency to go to work for another one. It was all  congenial, no bridges were burned.  That   s nice.  Yes, and it was a nice move for me.  Have there been significant things that have changed in civil  engineering since you started your career in the way things are done or  handled today? You mentioned, of course, the funding is different for a  lot of the projects, the SCS, the watershed projects and things. Could  you mention a couple of other things that you   ve seen across your years  of working that are different now?  I was talking to this girl that interviewed Friday. The Farmer   s Home  and the Soil Conservation Service, Congress has pretty much dried up  those programs. But the Water Resources Board in Oklahoma City has  picked up and they give lots of grants and loans now for water and sewer  projects. So you go to a different funding agency and the Department of  Commerce funds lots of projects, even in rural areas. They funded like   12 million two weeks ago. There   s about ten projects that are mine to  design. I only work a couple of days a week. But the big thing is I think  the school of engineering, all students must take aeronautical  engineering, nuclear physics and all that stuff, I think that   s all required  now and they didn   t even mention these classes to us. It   s probably  harder now, and they are better educated. I would imagine a lot of  students go to work for the major corporations, especially the  mechanical engineers. The old civil engineers are still   the guy that   s  got on a pair of boots and he   s out here staking a water line or a sewer  line and it   s kind of a different animal.  They told us at the time, in college, and I imagine it   s the same today,  they have a big boost nation-wide for mechanical engineers, then it   ll die  down. Have a big boost for electrical engineers, it   ll die down; then a big  40  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  boost for chemical engineers. They said since day one, civil engineers  still don   t have a boost but they are steady. Everyday there   s someone in  Oklahoma   believe it or not, everyday in Oklahoma there   s a town  replacing all the water lines in the town because they were built in the     20s. So they   re almost 100 years old. All the water towers, those old  overhead water towers were built in the    20s and they   re being replaced.  And the old engineers that did those back in the    30s, the company I   m  with was established by an engineer in the    30s, did a bunch of those  water projects for the WPA. Then he was replaced by a guy and that   s  all he did. And then he   s replaced by another guy and, same company.  But I think the younger ones, like I said before, smarter and they know a  lot. They do everything on the computer. We weren   t even allowed to  take a hand computer to class. We had to take slide rules. We couldn   t  have walked into class with a hand computer at all.  Do students still know how to use the slider?  I don   t think so. John Gage here in town, I don   t know whether you  know John Gage or not. His dad had an old western store. He came by  the coffee shop about three or four weeks ago and his dad had a hock  shop back in the    50s and    60s. A couple students had hocked their  sliders. But he had these two slide rules and he gave them to me over at  the coffee shop. So I   m sitting here with these two slide rules   this was  30 days ago. I thought,    Well, what am I gonna do with them?    I took  them down to the office and we put them inside the office where people  sit, on a table like this. We just put them out on the top of the office table  as a show thing. But none of the engineers down there know how to use  them. You couldn   t go to class without one when I was in school.  Did you have to buy your own?  Had to buy your own, and they were like  25 bucks and that was tough.  That was tough. I decided I   d go to class without one, and I hadn   t  bought one yet, I was a freshman. I walked in, sit down, and you had to  have your trig functions before you could work the problem. I didn   t  have a slide rule. I had to look up the trig functions. It was a  trigonometry class, I suppose. I decided to leave and go buy me a slide  rule.  Do you still have the one that you used when you were in school?  Yes, yes, I take good care of it. I still keep it in my briefcase. And it   s  really a nice one. I took good care of it. They all had leather cases. These  have leather cases that John gave me but the girls took them out. I  noticed yesterday, well it was Thursday when I was down there   they  were still lying out there on the table. I think people pick them up and  41  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  look at them.  When was the last time you used yours?  Well, I can say a long time but there   s another little story I could tell. It  really doesn   t have anything to do with this stuff. But, when the  computers first came out, a couple engineers and I later on, they had four  engineers on staff at Farmer   s Home   they called us to Kansas City to  design a pipeline north of Auburn University and had about 20 engineers  in the nation there. They wanted us all to go set it up on a computer to  calculate the pipe size needed. Well, Gene Womack was with me, he   s  an OSU grad and he was working for Farmer   s Home at the time. We  pulled our slide rules out and it took us about 10 minutes to tell them  what size pipe they needed. The other engineers worked on that problem  all day. They didn   t get it set up for four hours and the computer to kick  it out to see what size pipe they needed. And they were a little upset at  us. They gave us the problem at about 11 o   clock and at noon we were  sitting in the bar and they didn   t call us back until four.  Those slide rules will actually tell you what size pipe you need with a  certain flow and pressure and all that. So I still carry this kind of, as a  joke. But if I   m out in the middle of nowhere tomorrow and three  farmers come up to me at church where they usually meet and say,    We  want to lay a pipeline over here at so and so, what size do you think it  would take?    I pull out that slide rule and tell them in about two  seconds. On a computer   one of our engineers for Oklahoma State, it  will take him two days to set that up and actually have an accurate figure  to tell him.  Well that   s a pretty impressive story.  There   s the difference. And the reason for that is, they don   t ask you in  the office, they ask you out in the middle of nowhere at church, if there   s  a bunch of them. So I use it occasionally for that but that   s okay.  They   re outdated. Calculators are a lot better. Every engineer carries  calculators in their pocket now.  Any other tools that they can   t live without?  Well, let   s see, I would think on a day-to-day basis, the one thing that  you would need to know in the civil engineering business is hydraulics. I  was the engineer for one hundred towns and water districts when I  retired, if you walk into a city council meeting in any town, just name  any town in Oklahoma, the first thing the council is going to ask you is,     Well, we need this, how much is it going to cost and where are we  going to get the money?    The young engineers do not know where the  42  Neurohr  Wildman  money is. I always tell them it will take about two years of traveling  with all the heads of the funding agency such as the water resource  board. Farmer   s Home still funds big projects. We just closed a loan last  week for a new sewer system in Langston. It   s like a  7 million dollar  project. Farmer   s Home funded that   they still fund some big stuff. And  you   ve got to know, there   s about five different piles of money available  in Oklahoma to finance a water or sewer project. Very common to get a  one hundred percent grant, but you got to know where the money is. The  young engineers in our office don   t have a clue. They don   t, they  wouldn   t even think about going out and meeting with the community  unless I went with them or one of the older guys. They wouldn   t even  think about it because they wouldn   t know what to tell them.  The most important thing we probably do is we know where the money  is. We know where they can find it, where the grants are, what it takes to  get the grants. My partner and I, he   s about my age, and we   re both  consultants and we an office in Oklahoma City. We worked about six  projects six months ago and we were notified last week that all six of  them are going to receive one hundred percent grants. One of them is up  in, north of here in Noble county, it   s a  380,000 dollar grant. We   re  going to run a pipeline from Meadow Park to Glencoe and then they  want to replace all the water lines in Blackburn and all the water lines in  Skedee. We applied to the Department of Commerce today. Those two  grants, they were both approved. They are meeting right now in Pawnee  to decide whether they want to accept the grant or not. The young  engineers wouldn   t have a clue. You   ve got to know where the money  is. That   s probably the most important thing we do today. And it makes  sense, doesn   t it? If you were the mayor of a town, say they elected you  mayor of Perkins or Ripley, you moved in. They   ve got to have a new  water tower, how would you go about it? You   ve got to call somebody,  you   ve got to say,    How do I go about getting a water tower free?     Because there   s grants today available. I tell people, that   s life in the  slow lane today.  (Laughs) Well the knowledge base is so important and obviously with  your career and number of years that you   ve been involved with this at  the state level, I   m sure that that is a very valuable skill to have.  Like I say, talking about me, if I would do it, I could give a presentation.  Say 10 little towns get together somewhere and ask me to come speak at  their luncheon about where the money is   I could do one a week. I was  invited to do so many of them I quit doing them because I couldn   t get  anything done. But that   s the thing they like to know. And the mayor  may use another engineer to do it, but a lot of the younger engineers  would not know it. They just don   t get hired because of they don   t know  how, don   t know where. That   s the only way you can do it, you   ve just  43  Neurohr  Wildman  got to be around it for a long time to know all the people and know  where the money is.  You mentioned the water towers and the pipes and things that were built  in the    20s and    30s and how there   s some deterioration, if I   m using the  right word. Is there anything that concerns you or that you   re aware of  that you would have some concerns about in particular or you think that  cities need to be more aware of or communities need to be more aware  of that they need it or not?  Well, you   re all familiar with asbestos, I bet. Well prior to about 1962 or     63, all of the major pipelines, including Stillwater, the water lines were  asbestos cement. They are there today   they   re setting in the ground  today. The state health department really would like to condemn all of  those pipelines   they   d like to have all it replaced. So we have replaced  a lot of those lines. Some those old towns were built on the flat out in  western Oklahoma. They have a water tower downtown that was built  prior, mostly prior to the depression. So it was built in the    20s when  times were good. The sewer systems, all those were built during the  depression by the WPA. But going back to these towns, over the years  most of those little towns have grown twenty percent, a lot of them, and  they build on a little hill. This guy comes in to build this little old 20 or  30 or 40 acre track, build on a hill and they got beautiful homes on this  hill. They   re getting higher and higher and the water tower is not any  taller. So the pressure is low and they all want to say,    Hey, we got to do  something here. We need a new water tower.    Well invariably, I tell  them, what you   ve got to do though, in that case, you   ve got to tear this  one down and build you a new one out here on this hill or you won   t  have any water pressure. The towns don   t want to tear the old one down.  So if you give them a choice almost invariably, they will build the new  one at the same elevation. That way they don   t have to have any  different pumps or anything and it will flow but it won   t increase the  pressure at all. But invariably they won   t tear that old tank down and a  lot of them actually operate and day-by-day a little lower pressure than  they really should.  They just need to replace that stuff. There wasn   t any plastic. Plastics  came on in the    60s. The asbestos cement pipe has breaks everyday. The  interesting thing that the mayor will do, once you walk in and sit down,  the mayor will say,    Now the only thing I want you to know, I ran for  office and my platform is I will not raise water rates. And what we need  here is a new water tower, a new water treatment plant and all new water  lines. But I don   t want it to cost us anything.    That   s the way they think.  They   re not saying the previous 25 mayors also ran on that same  platform, they wouldn   t raise the water rates. But that   s the kind of life  in the slow lane. Well, we   ve rattled on quite a bit about everything in  44  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  the world but what we started to talk about, right?  I think we covered quite a bit here.  Well, for my benefit to close it up, personally, I tell people you couldn   t  have a much better life than I   ve had as far as jobs. That area engineer   s  job at Perry was a great job. I had a lot of freedom. I just came and went  from town to town, getting those easements and stuff. There had never  been a water district built when I moved to Stillwater. That was a  Kennedy program that Johnson took over and I got in on the ground  floor of that, I was there 20 years. Then I   ve been a consulting engineer  with the firm in Oklahoma City since    84. That   s been 27 years. And  now, their big thing is Wal-Mart stores. They design Wal-Mart stores  and big developments and they have all that stuff. It   s all changed,  probably to the better.  I think I   ve heard Senator Kerr was instrumental in     He was instrumental in the large lakes, like the Corps of Engineers. He  was a big Corps of Engineers    man. And he knew about the small  watershed program and he backed it. They give him credit for  Tenkiller     The Arkansas River     Yes and all that. That was his baby but he certainly was for the small  watershed dam program also.  Do you think that the Dust Bowl in the far western part of the state and  the depression played into the progressiveness of Oklahoma with these  types of projects?  I would think so because they started out there. Like I say, the first one  was at Cheyenne and you can   t get any further west and get more  involved in the Dust Bowl. I was born and reared out there. I remember  people asked me about this new book out, I don   t know whether you   ve  read of it or not, but I bought it at Hastings, on the Dust Bowl. I  remember in second grade, I couldn   t see across the street of my  hometown. I remember standing there and I couldn   t see the businesses  across the street. The people that stayed pretty much became pillars of  the community and got some money. The ones that left, and there were  more of them that left than stayed. But I remember people going to  California.  I would like to hear a little bit about that, if you have time.  45  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  You ought to read that book, have you read   it   s a new book.  Is it Timothy Egan   s book, The Worst Hard Time?  Yes, yes. Well the couple   my hometown is Vici and the woman that  they   re talking about and the child that dies and the child that was born  in Boise City and all that. They live in Vici to this day. He   s an  undertaker and I went out there a couple months ago, I got my picture in  the paper again in Woodward for discussing living in a small town in the  1940   s. My granddad was one of the first settlers, literally, in 1892 and  he dug a cave. I was born and reared in Vici.  The people in that book, I know them personally and they   re still alive.  The woman that was the school teacher died about three years ago, but  her son that had the sister that died with dust pneumonia lives in Vici  and he   s the undertaker there. He and I were both on the panel talking  about what it was like living there at that time. I was pretty young, but I  remember. My grandparents and my dad and uncle all stayed during the  dust bowl. Then my granddad just started buying land. I mean, after they  all left, it was cheap. I just remember Mother putting sheets over the  windows that were wet. I was telling someone at the coffee shop one  day, you   d go to some kid   s house and no one had any money really, and  they would give you bread, butter and sugar sandwiches for the kids to  eat after school. I think it was a great place to be born and reared. I  wouldn   t trade it.  It wasn   t unusual to go to a swimming hole and start swimming and  eating watermelons in those days. The farmers would give the  watermelons to you and they   d tell you to stop and get some roasting  ears out of the corn patch also. When I go back to high school alumni,  there aren   t any big shots. You   d look real stupid being a big shot when  you were born and reared out there during the Dust Bowl. But the people  that stayed became fairly well to do. I mean, land was cheap and they  bought it up. It just didn   t seem like a big deal to me because I was too  young, I suppose. It was hot all the time, I remember, we   d never see it  rain.  Were you aware that people were becoming ill from the dust?  No, I do remember people coughing and wheezing and all that, I  remember that. But I really wasn   t paying all that much attention to it. I  tell you one little story about that. I was probably 10 years old and my  dad had a business in town. He had produce and all that stuff. There was  a guy drove up in front of my dad   s produce   it was about eight o   clock  at night. Typical Grapes of Wrath. He had on blue overalls and gray  shirt, a big tall guy. And he had about three or four kids out in his  46  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Neurohr  Wildman  Model-A. He came in, my dad   s name is Charlie, and he said,    Charlie, I  can   t make it.    He said,    I haven   t had a crop in two or three years.    He  said,    That place has got a good well on it. I dug it by hand and why  don   t you go pay the taxes on it and it   ll be yours to have? I   m heading  to California.    I could draw a picture of that guy. He said,    That   s a  pretty nice quarter section of land.    So I remember I asked my dad when  the guy drove off. I said,    Well, how much would the taxes be?    And I  believe he said about  40 dollars, maybe about  42. And we talked for a  little bit about it. He said,    It   s not worth it. I   m not going to pay  40  dollars for it.    I tell people to this day, there are gas wells all over that  160 acres sitting out there. But I remember that guy and he was really  down and he drove west in that old Model-A with a bunch of kids in it. I  have no idea what happened to him.  Do you remember the name, the family name?  No, I just remember later, when I got a little older, where the 160 acres  was and it was out by the little town of Harmon and I do remember that.  Whoever bought it, got gas wells all over it. But that   s pretty common,  stories like that.  Did you have any friends that left? Did you know people that left?  Yes. We have reunions and I go back and look at some of the first,  second and third grade pictures   those kids just up and left. I remember  when they left. I assume they   d had to leave. I never did know what  happened to them. I just look at those little old pictures.  I didn   t know your Dust Bowl stories.  About 25 years ago. I bought two farms in Woodward County and I just  felt like from my childhood days, the people that owned the land, stayed  and they had money. The renters left. Believe it or not, this one place  that I bought, well I bought two, they   ve already called me in the last  month to lease it for oil. I got half the royalty on both places. I didn   t  give very much for them because I bought them when they were cheap.  Great interview. (Laughs) Thank you so much.  I told the boy who brought me over here, I said,    You   ve got to learn  one thing in life. Don   t ever ask an ex-GI to tell you about his life story.  He   ll talk for three days and never quit.     ------- End of August 27, 2007 interview -------
