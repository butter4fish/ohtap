And Uncle Harry was blonde as he is and talked like this: (laughter) Kat, (laughter); lived out in the country (laughter), come on, Kat, and help us to pick this cotton.  See, see, in the summertime, we'd go (unclear) grandmama, that's why my mother and daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] would have to go to summer school to get their degrees to keep teaching.  See, they didn't care about teachers, whether they had a degree.  They just gon' have black kids anyway.  So, daddy just went on teaching, and mama went on teaching.  And they'd go to summer school, and we'd stay with grandmama, eat watermelons and steal the, steal the watermelons out of our uncle's patch.  And our Aunt Kate, she's dead now.  She had (unclear)--Aunt Kate, Uncle Harry, and Uncle Aubrey, and I think it's one other--Uncle James, he died when he was young, my mother's--now, I don't know a lot about my daddy's.  My daddy's mother died when he was a little boy.  And some white family took him to Virginia with them.  They call him Scratch.  They say, Scratch, you are too smart to stay down here and don't get your education.  And see, daddy went to Hampton Institute [now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in--
Speaker 1: Virginia, right?
Speaker 2: Virginia.
Story_ID: 73682
Speaker 1: But daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] was a genius.  Oh, he taught me algebra.  And I don't act like I knew him because some of those kids, what we call ghetto kids, who they could get up there and do that algebra in a minute.  And I'd be sitting, trying to look cute and acting like I didn't hear it (laughter)--and --but, but at home, three boys and three girls.  We had, we had to go in one room and study at night.  You wouldn't be in--there was no television then when I was little.  And we had, we had rooms with fireplaces or wall (unclear).  We didn't have central air.  The air, the air came from outdoors.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: And (laughter), and bring in, bring in the coal to put in the--we had to bring it in all night.  Our parents made us work.  But she [Beatrice Ross] didn't let me work for anybody in their homes or anything, said you just work here at this house.  Now, my baby brother, Spence, who I love to death, he, he, he's my youngest brother.  He died with cancer.  He was the best looking, cutest boy you've ever seen in your life, curly hair, wonderful skin, and the girls loved him to death.  And there was a guy who was a, a jewelry--jeweler--in Winnsboro [South Carolina], and he said, Mancil (ph.), can you take care of my daughters--these cute little blonde girls--say, say, could you take care of them for us while we working and when we have to go somewhere?  Oh, he would tell them the most stories and all, and they were crazy about Spence.  Now, Spence is the only one who worked in somebody's house.  My mother didn't let us work in anybody's house--say work in this house.  Go in there, Kathleen, scrub the kitchen; Kathleen, change the linen on the (unclear).  My mother could give me more chores than anything (laughter).  And when they'd go to Township Auditorium in Columbia, oh, we get to go to Columbia.  We thought it was just great to go to Columbia.  We didn't have a car, now.  Listen, we weren't that rich.  Daddy could not drive, and mother could not drive.  And my oldest brother go--went, went to the [U.S.] Army, to the Second World War [WWII], and he bought him a brand new '36 [1936] Chevrolet, or whatever war it was.  What was it in, in, in--
Speaker 2: Thirty--well, it started in ni--for us it started in 1941.
Speaker 1: Forty-one [1941].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he, but W.A.--let me see.  Maybe, maybe because he bought, maybe it was then, but maybe it was a '36 [1936] Chevrolet.  And when he came out from the war, he left the car in the yard with us, and told me to learn how to, how to drive.  And daddy never could drive.  And a young man in Charlotte [North Carolina]--in Winnsboro--who was the husband of one of my teachers, and he was a farm agent, and he taught me how to drive.  And I was in ninth grade.  And I never will forget one time my daddy got in the car and said, Kat, let me drive some.  See, daddy had just been looking.  And he started (laughter) driving, and he, and he was driving around the block.  And everybody called him Professor Ross--Professor Ross!  And they were just waving at him, and he was just bowing.  And, and he came all the way around the corner, and when he got ready to drive into the drive, drive way, he landed that car in my mother's bed--flowerbed.  And instead of mother coming out seeing whether he was hurt, she was worried about if her flowers were hurt.  Daddy, you are tearing up my flowers.  He got out--all right, mother (laughter)--he just wanna know how he did.  And at night we had to sit around in one room and study, no talking, homework and go to bed.  And we had tin tubs.  We, we finally got bathrooms, indoor--we didn't used to have a toilet.  You had to walk out--you bet not go from midnight, how those light bugs will be coming.  And, and then daddy got rich and put us a bathroom on--so we got--
Speaker 2: So you took a--you used to take a bath in one of those--
Speaker 1: Tin tubs.
Speaker 2: Tin tubs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: See, I'm real proud of my heritage.  (Unclear)--same up here, 'cause most people did not have indoor toilets way back then, way back then.
Story_ID: 73683
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back to the origin of the family.  And, and I guess what I'm asking, do you have any stories about what your family was doing in the 19th century, or, or did you ever talk to your grandparents, or did they talk about what their parents were doing, or where the family came from?  Was there any stories of, of Africa or anything, or anything--
Speaker 2: Mine--none of my mine--my daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] never talked about--my daddy pure brown skinned, but he never talked about Africa, in fact, my daddy nor my mother [Beatrice Ross].  They say they were born in the United States, and that's what they are, they're not African.  They're just--they talking about African Americans.  They just, my parents were not, they were not-- you know, like way back when people didn't talk--think about race and all that.  They didn't even talk about it.  But see, I looked at my mama and I knew that she was kin to somebody white.  And I never knew who they, who they were.  'Cause that's one thing, they were very quiet about who they were, 'cause she didn't wanna say that this is my brother who is real dark, and this is Uncle Harry who is so blonde.  They never talked about it, and we didn't care, and even me grown up, I didn't even care.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they never, there were never any--
Speaker 2: Talk--
Speaker 1: --stories about what the family was doing way back in slavery or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, they, mm-mm, they never talked about--they really was not slaves though; neither one of them was slaves.  As I told you, that white family took my, my daddy to Hampton, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Well, your daddy was too young to be a--been a slave, but what was your family doing--I mean, meaning your ancestors, going back into the--(simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: They talked about the [Ku Klux] Klan coming.  The Klan told me they were coming to this house right here.  I don't have to go way back then.
Speaker 1: What did your parents say about the Klan?
Speaker 2: My mother acted like she wasn't afraid of anything.  She was very strong.  She didn't talk ugly to anybody.  She just looked like this.  She'd give you that look, honey.  Kathleen Earle--she called my whole name when (laughter) she getting my attention.  And she, my mother and daddy, they didn't talk about negative things.  I don't know, I guess people think it's wonderful stories about--I don't think--
Speaker 1: Well, it's not that it's wonderful.  It's just, it's just it's information about that period.
Speaker 2: See, see, I was not the historian.  I was next to the baby.  I was supposed to be the baby.  You saw me sitting on my mama's lap?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: That other little child hadn't come yet, Cecile, my sisters, my, my sister.  We, we, we call her Cecile, but we named her after a teacher, Ms. Cecil Jordan.  They, they know Cecil used to be a boy name, but her name was Ms. Cecil Jordan.  And she was named after that teacher.  And see, I was next to the baby, and I can see--W.A [Ross], my brother W.A., now, if you could get him, he could tell you some old tales.  My--oh, he knows everything.
Story_ID: 73684
Speaker 1: But--

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And see, like I'm not the historian.  Now, my sister, Evelyn [Ross Hartzog], she's, she is four years older than I am, and she is--she cannot think now.  She's kind of Alzheimer['s disease].
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am, but we--
Speaker 1: And, and she, and her husband, they didn't have any children.  He, he left her with a million dollars down there in Orangeburg [South Carolina].  And my nieces are always down there to see her so they can take a few quarters (laughter), and she wouldn't even miss it.  I have a niece who is a--
Speaker 2: But, ma'am, we, we, we have you now (laughter).  We don't have her, so I have to ask you what you remember about some of these things.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: What about any--how long did your father, did he teach school his whole life, or, or was he a principal some--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, my, my daddy taught at Friendship College [Rock Hill, South Carolina], and that's where he met my mother [Beatrice Ross].  Then he came to Winnsboro [South Carolina] and bought her a house.  Oh, child, honey, she was rich then (unclear)--house (unclear), and had French doors.  You know, you couldn't tell mother she wasn't rich then (laughter).  But mother taught too.  She taught first grade.  And, and I remember a little boy who was a dwarf, and they put him in mother's class because children laughed at him.  And when, when my mother died, he was a, he was a pallbearer at my mother's funeral.  He was about this tall, about big as the casket.  He was a grown man.  My mother--but my mother was very caring about people.  It was an old lady named Ms. Nancy Strauthers (ph.).  She lived in Winnsboro, and she worked for Captain Lass (ph.).  He was a captain in the world's--in the First World War [WWI], not the, not the Second World War [WWII].  And she lived in, in his backyard.  She--he even had her a little house back there.  And she would cook his food, and then go, and, and then she became blind.  And my mother would make us go walk two or three blocks to pick her up.  We didn't have a car, a call--a car.  On Sunday she wanted to come to church, and our church is two doors from our house.  Mother would make us go and pick up Ms. Nancy.  We didn't wanna pick her up 'cause she was real black, and she had bushy hair, and she was blind.  And I learned something from her.  We were coming home, and we had to walk down the steps when you got downtown and then walk back up the steps, and she was blind.  I said Ms., Ms. Nancy, step down, and she just smiled.  I never will forget she said, isn't this a pretty day?  She couldn't see a thing.  She said, isn't this a pretty day?  I learned that from her.  It was pretty all right.  And then when she finished being at church, she had to come to our house and sit at that table right there with le--other leaves in there.  And Ms. Nancy always loved my mother's cooking.  And we'd have--somebody has to take her home on Sunday afternoon, one of us.  My, my parents were very, especially mother, was a very, kind to people who have less than she, she does, 'cause she thinks about how she grew up--told us we better.  They didn't ask me (laughter).  I told you they say I was the worst child in the family.  I just rolled my eye.  You're not gonna be anything.  I said yes, I am (laughter).

I said don't be putting my name engraved on that tombstone.  But it's down there.  But it's not a lot about Winnsboro.  It's just a nice little old country town, and people are--they, they believe in sending their children to school.  And we have a lot of carpenters and brick masons.  My brother, Spence, who is a year and a half older than I am, now, he's the only one that didn't finish four years of college.

Nothing useless is, or low; each thing in its place is best; and what seems but idle show strengthens and supports the rest.  Now think about the foundation, (unclear)--see, I--see, my brothers and all used to like to do it, and I didn't want them to outdo me.  I bet you I know more poetry than anybody.

See, children don't--see, people don't know any--my kids don't know any poetry, 'cause they used to spend all their time sitting on the floor looking at the television.  And a friend of mine gave my husband [Joseph C. Crosby, Sr.] that big television, 'cause that one down there I gave it to him way back, and it stopped.  And he said, Uncle Joe, you're too nice a person not to--the way you love games.  Put it over there on him.  I said and left it for Mama Kat.

Speaker 2: Y'all doing well to get to my present (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but you gotta get us there, and--
Speaker 2: I'm telling you.
Story_ID: 73885
Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Like, who were your teachers and who were the mentors in the community?  Did you have some role models in the community, other than your parents, that you looked up to that, that you--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --in the church, or--
Speaker 2: Now listen, there was a woman in my church named Ms. Cutsy Smith [ph.].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  We just called her Ms. Cutsy.  I--
Speaker 1: Cutsy?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Cutsy.  I think it's C-U-T-S-Y.  I don't know where she got--I never heard of that name, Ms. Cutsy Smith.  Now you know I was telling you about the blind lady that we used to take care of.  But Ms. Cutsy was a strong black woman, who, if she could have gone to college, she probably would've been the president of the world.  And she had a daughter named Edna.  And she, she, she was kind of country, and you know, laid back.  And Ms., Ms. Cutsy was a member of our church, First Baptist Church.  We, we were two doors from the church.  And Ms. Cutsy would sit on the front seat, the pew, the, the--see, it's, it's two rows--I mean two aisles like that, and then pews over there, and pews over there.  She would sit on the front seat on the left, and her husband would sit on the right of the front pew.  And they, they sit up--she sat up, and, and, and the minister we had, he was not one of those--when they say seeing that colored preacher clearing his throat and bowing his head, you know that's in Paul Laurence Dunbar too, but this man's very intelligent, Reverend Beatty [ph.].  He was my minister, and his wife was a seamstress, and she just stayed at home and had, she had three smart kids.  And they did music. They could sing, and they could play and all.  And now my sister could sing pretty well and, and play too.  All of us had to learn how to play the piano, play something.  But anyway, Reverend Beatty was not like those priests who usually said (imitates), you know.  Unh-uh, he was very intelligent.  And he says, "And the Lord said, 'Let there be light.'"  She said, "Hm, sure, God is light, hm.  When God say for it to be light, it's gone be light."  And I would be back there cracking up.  Mother's [Beatrice Ross] punching, "Kathleen," (laughter) she said.  And one Sunday he said, "Now you all need to stay together.  If you're married, you don't need to divorce; just stay together."  He say, "Hm, what you say, hun?"  She say, "Hm, think I'm gone turn back now?  Hell, no, hm," (laughter).  She'd do all that in church.  Ms. Cutsy, I just loved her to death.  And then she, she--I never will forget one day she came from church, and I, I was back home.  My mother was not well then.  See, I was much older then, and my children were already born.  And I had taken my children down to see about my mother over the--on the weekend sometimes from Charlotte [North Carolina] to, down there.  And the children were playing.  And both of my kids are fair complected.  Both of 'em got that colors from, from them--my mother and Joe's mother.  Both of 'em got fair complexion.  She said, "Now whose chaps is these right here?"  I said, "They're mine."  "They mighty yellow," (laughter).  She, Ms. Cutsy was a killer (laughter).
Story_ID: 73886
Speaker 1: Anyway, but there were a lot of people.  See, my mother [Beatrice Ross], she didn't, she didn't let us be in the street a whole lot.  And, and we didn't, we didn't, we were allowed to go to certain places home.  If they didn't have parents to see what they were doing, mm-mm.  I know my mother and dad [W.A. Ross, Sr.], they were strict.  They gave us chores to do.  They made us study our lesson.  They made us go over and take food to people who don't have enough food, 'cause they always--I say, mama, why you sending--you know you got all of us to feed.  Kathleen Earle, just do what I say (laughter).  I wanted to ask the questions.  But anyway, it's--I told you the teachers told me I wasn't gonna be anything.  I said yes, I am.  And my, my sister-in-law was working in, in Columbia, and saw Ms. Anderson (ph.), this teacher who pulled a chair out from me one time.
Speaker 2: She pulled a chair out?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was teaching me home economics.  And she was teaching us something about Welsh rabbit.  And she, she's a kind of mean teacher.  She, she, she walked with these toes like this, and she was cross-eyed, and she was mean.  And she said something to me, and I did like this [crossed eyes, looking up]: Is that true?  And when I got ready to sit down, she pulled the chair out from under me.  And I fell on the floor, and I hurt myself.  And when school was out, I went over to my mama's room.  I said mama, Ms. Anderson pulled the chair out from under me.  My mother, her Indian started coming up, honey.  She went marching over there.  She said Ms. Anderson, Kat is a character, said but don't you ever pull another chair out from under her again.  Then she goes to my daddy.  Professor Ross, your wife came over there and told me so and so and so.   And so when we got, got home in the afternoon, and they made us sit at the table, W.A., Paul, Mancil, Evelyn, Kat, Cecile, mama at the foot, daddy at the head, and they always sat down.  We didn't get food and run around, un-un, you had to sit down, and daddy'd come home.  And if we'd be washing clothes out there, daddy would put his books down and--'cause he used to teach algebra too--and honey, he'd be helping us too--who, they made us work.  They--we were no rich kids.  They just though it was 'cause my daddy was a principal that they were big shots.  That's what they thought.  But we were just ordinary people, and they never talked above anybody.  But anyway, daddy sat, sat at the table and say, did you have a good day, so and so and so?  Yes, sir.  You?  Un-huh.  Mother?  Mother say, no, I didn't have a good day because I don't think Ms. Anderson should have pulled the chair out from under Kathleen.  He said well, you're not the principal.  She started crying.  She said but she's my child (laughter).  I thought I was up in the world then, honey.  But anyway, I, I was the worst one.
Speaker 2: You felt important then, I guess--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, child.  I, I wouldn't give anything for the training I got.
Story_ID: 73887
Speaker 1: And my daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] could play the piano, honey.  He'd go in there and start playing a song called "Under His Wings I'm Safely Abiding."  And almost every morning I get up and go in there and play it because he loved that song.  And I didn't know what it meant until I got grown.  And after my husband last year, I played the piano a whole lot to keep from crying.  I don't cry a lot, 'cause I took real good care of him.  We were married 50--51 years.
Speaker 2: How, how does the song go?
Speaker 1: [Singing] Under his wings I'm safely abiding though the night deepens, the temp is, is (unclear).  Sure, I will know, I know he will keep me.  He is my savior and I am his child.  Under his wings, under his wings--it's a pretty song.  And I've been trying to get my, my te--my music te--the choral teacher at our church, he wanted to play all those wild things.  I don't like that.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: We never did have all that gospel thing in our church, even in that little town.  We sang hymns.  And Reverend Beatty was very educated.  We got a lot of education in that church, as well as spiritual things.  But it wasn't a whole lot of hol--except Ms. Cutsy, who'd say, hmm, my Lordy, Lord, hm, think I'm gon' stop?  Hell no.  (Laughter) Now, Ms. Cutsy's the only one would tear up the church (laughter).
Story_ID: 73888

He finished Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] the seminary, and then went to Drew University and got his master's.  Then he, he's a Presbyterian minister.

And my brother died four years ago.  W.A. is the oldest one and only one who didn't get married, and that's how come he's still alive.  He didn't have to worry about no wife and children (laughter) and all of that.  He's coming home to stay with me for Christmas.  And I don't want him to 'cause he'll want me to--he say, Kat, I want some greens with okra on top of it, and make me some cornbread, Kat, like mother [Beatrice Ross] used to do (laughter).  He bosses me around.  But I will say, he'll give me a few quarters, though, when I got ready to buy that car.  He said you should buy a Mercedes like you had.  I said I ain't paying no $95,000 for no car.  He said well, I'm gon' send you $2,500 since you're not gon' buy the Mercedes.  I said a car won't make anything out of me.  No more Mercedes.  I--who, I look like a nut paying $95,000 for a 500SEL.  That's what I had, but I bought mine--mine was a '85 [1985], but I bought mine in '87 [1987].

Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--high school.  When you were in high school, did you have any idea what you wanted to do as an adult when you got out of school?
Speaker 1: Wasn't even thinking about it, just going to school.  See, our parents told us that we all were going to college.  They didn't ask us would you like to go.  See, my parents, they were not mean, but they meant business.  They, they were, they were feeding us and clothing us, and so many children, you know, just stay out at night.  They didn't allow us to stay out at night.  No, we had to--

Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we sat around--we had a Ronda (ph.) heater in our bedroom.  And honey, you'd sit around with them books and, and do your lesson.  Now, now my parents were strict.  They were not mean, but they were strict.  They didn't do a lot of talking.  When my mother [Beatrice Ross] said something, she meant it.  And daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] was calm.  And if daddy got on you, you'd cry so long.  He was so sweet till you hated to let him down.  My dad, he's a calm man, but he was strong.  You knew he was strong, he could run that school.  And they used to declare that, says, if 'fessor Ross have to call you in his office, honey, say if he give you three licks, you know you've been hit (laughter).  And daddy used to have a leather strap in, in, in their bedroom.  See, we had a fireplace, a fireplace was in all of ours, and then finally they got wall moldings and all that kind of stuff.

They must go to sleep and argue.  They never argued in front of us.  And daddy would sit down at the table with us.  We all had to sit down, nobody sitting up--just like my kids come and eat awhile and walk out.  Un-uh, you sit down until you finish, and wash dishes when you get through.  Yeah, they, they were very, they were very strict but not mean.  But I, I just thank God every day for my mother and my daddy, I really do.  But both of my children are doing well to.  They, they good kids.  I just came back from Houston, Texas, and she [Kathy C. Wells] sent me the ticket.  She bought my ticket.  I almost had a stroke when she sent it to me.

Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they would say--I never will forget we used to have milk--we'd buy our milk from our family doctor.  And we lived two blocks from, from--I lived--we lived on a corner where the house--my daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] bought that house for $1300.  It was a pretty house, a hall down--hall, down the hall and two bedrooms, and one bedroom over here, and the living room, and then the dining room and the kitchen, and a nice lot.  And the Manigaults were kind of rich black people.  They looked kind of like they were, they came from something other than black.  And, and he--they had a, they had a store downtown, and they a, and then they had a funeral home right next to our house, 'cause he, he sold my daddy that house for $1300.  And then they build the, the Manigault Funeral Home right next door to us.  They said well, we ain't get the body.  We ain't passing him through the window and (laughter).
Speaker 1: How you spell Manigault?
Speaker 2: M-A-N-I-G-A-U-L-T.  See, they call him Manigault.  It's a, it's a, it's different name.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard of the name before.  There's a famous basketball player in New York named Manigault.
Speaker 2: Some are Manigo, but his is G-A-U-L-T.  We used to call him Mr. Manigault, but it's goat--it's, it's, it's French or something like that name.  But anyway, but we used to go downtown on Saturday and just look in the windows, and it's not but two blocks.  Once you get out, out of the two blocks, you're out of Winnsboro [South Carolina].  That's how little it is, and it stayed little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was nothing to do.  On Sunday, we'd go and sit on the steps of the post office, just to see people walking by, nothing to do.  It's, it was nothing happening in Winnsboro, if you didn't have a good family to have a good time.  We played checkers at home, and, and we did a lot of poetry, and we all, we all learned how to play the piano, and we'd just carry on.
Speaker 1: But you said you had a sense of what race relations were like in--(simultaneous)--

You don't know about lard--Jewel, red and, and white bucket, and that's what the lard came in.  And I would go up to the back door.  They say come to the back door, Kathleen.  That's what Ms., that's what Ms. Lindsay (ph.) said, go to the back door.  I didn't care.  I went on to the back door and got, and got my mi--milk.  And I, one day I was coming from the doctor's office, and it was on Vanderhall (ph.) Street.  And a little white boy came.  I had on a white dress.  Oh, it was nothing prettier than a white dress.  He through a clod of dirt and, and made that dirt on my, on my skirt.  Honey, I threw that bucket all him, bam!  And, and the (laughter), and the milk came out and got all over him.  And, and his mother came out crocheting.  She saw her son.  You know what she said to me?  The [Ku Klux] Klan is gon' get you tonight.  That's what she told me.  I say they better not come, 'cause if they come, I'm gon' pass gas on 'em (laughter)--(unclear)--I was just that bad.  My mother [Beatrice Ross] said that next time anybody ignorant say, say--don't say anything.  Honey, I had to always tell 'em.  And sometimes the Klan would, would go on Saturday night up and down our streets.
Speaker 2: Oh, they would--they'd march in the black community?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, but blacks wasn't scared of them.  They wouldn't go to look, look at 'em.  We didn't give 'em--that's (unclear)--I know we didn't.  Mother and daddy say, we don't care what they do; said we not gon' even give us (unclear) to even look at 'em, said I, I dare you to go out there to see 'em.  They told us just don't--act like you don't know it.  So, but it was not a lot of--they just, them guys just wanted to have fun.  Their daddies told 'em to do that--scared up them niggers--that's what they called 'em.  They said nigger, so and so and so and so.  I said I ain't no nigger, honey.  I said I'm a Negro.  I, but I always let 'em know who I was.  I said I might be kin to you (laughter).  I was a bad child.  But, but I think Winnsboro was all right compared to some other places.  But they, though, the Klan would run about, about twice a year, to be sure they know we still there.  Shoot, I'd never go out to see 'em.  I wasn't scared of 'em.  I hated them.  'Cause I--see, mother and daddy wouldn't talk about it.  They didn't, they didn't teach us a whole lot of meanness.  I guess that's why I can get alone with white, black, rich, poor.  When I went to Billingsville [Elementary] School [Charlotte, North Carolina] to be the principal, honey, I had all kinds of--I had rich people, poor people, white, black.  I didn't care who they were.  Child, I had the best time at Billingsville School, heck; in fact, I had a book that I wanted to show you.  I stole it from my sister.  The lady's name is Mary Krat (ph.).  She's a white woman.  She wrote a book about women in Charlotte [North Carolina].

Speaker 1: Now, when you were a senior in high school [Fairfield County Training School, Winnsboro, South Carolina], had you planned for college at that point, or did you--
Speaker 2: It was understood you were gonna go in our family.  Everybody had to go to college in my family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened?
Speaker 2: I went to Voorhees Junior College [now Voorhees College, Denmark, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And stayed two years.  And then I came to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Can you spell Voorhees for me?
Speaker 2: V-O-O-R-H-E-E-S, Voorhees Junior College.  It was, it was an Episcopal school.  It was built for black people down in Denmark, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now is that--does that--did that school have anything to do with Bishop Delaney, the, the Episcopal Bishop Delaney and the Delaney Sisters, his daughters and all--I mean is that the school that he founded when, when he was the bishop of--
Speaker 2: I thought the Delaney Sisters--
Speaker 1: --of (unclear)--of Carolina, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I thought the Delaney Sisters were, they were at Bennett, weren't they?
Speaker 1: Maybe, I don't--I'm, I--
Speaker 2: For girls college.
Speaker 1: --just asking, I was asking--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, Voorhees was done by--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by white, rich Episcopalian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Dr. Blanton, Mr. Blanton was my president.  And I went two years, and then I went to Johnson C. Smith as a junior and a senior.
Speaker 1: And Johnson C. Smith is here in--
Speaker 2: In Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: --Charlotte.
Speaker 2: Yeah, doctor, doctor--Ms.--doc--the president is the rascal who gave that lady my name.  Dr. Dee Yancy [Dr. Dorothy Cowser Yancy], she's smart as she can be.  Now some people don't like her 'cause she's a little bit caustic.  But she can run a school, honey, and raise money.  And see, I was the first trust, trustee, woman trustee, on Johnson C.'s board.  I'm--now (unclear) gon' pass to you, old as I am.
Story_ID: 72811
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: All right--
Speaker 1: --I enjoyed in ca--being in college.  I learned how to play cards and court (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --had different boyfriends every year.  But Joe Crosby [Joseph C. Crosby, Sr.], the one I married, I met him when I was in ninth grade.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Right at Winnsboro, when, when his daddy came down--that picture up there--his daddy came down to my daddy's [W.A. Ross, Sr.] house, and I was in ninth grade.  And Presiding Elder Crosby said, Mr. Ross, I'd like to borrow your school auditorium for our fall conference 'cause our--the little church up there is too little.  And he said okay, we'll work that out.  And Joe, Joe was with his daddy.  And Joe was sitting in the swing, and I was in the bedroom listening to 'em.  And then I came out, and he said, hello, I know you.  He said you Evelyn's sister?  I said yes, I am.  And, and he said--I don't know what he said.  I was just ninth grade; I didn't know what to say.  And so then he said well, when father--they called their daddy father--said when father comes down there in October, come up to the, to the conference, okay?  I told my two best friends, Johnny and--y'all saw those pictures, he did or you, saw those pictures, those two women I told you that that was my best friend.  I said, child, I met this good-looking boy.  They said I'm going up there and see how he look.  I said y'all can't get him.  And they, all three of us went up there in October, and he was there.  Oh, I thought I was in heaven, honey.  And his daddy had a '36 [1936] Chevrolet, black.  And see, they had dusty roads, and so he, he, he--we were walking around.  Honey, I thought I was a big shot in ninth grade, honey, just walking around.  So, when they went back to Chester [South Carolina], 26 miles from Winnsboro [South Carolina], he, he wrote my name on the trunk of the car, dust, "Kat and Joe."  So he wrote me a, a, a special delivery.  They believed in special deliveries, not us.  We think that's too much money, un-uh, a three cent stamp, mm-mm.  He sent that special delivery, came Wednesday.  My mother opened it and said, who is this sending you a, a, a--mm-mm.  And it wasn't nothing.  It said: Dear Kat, when I got home, father's car still had our name on it, and so and so and so, and so wasn't nothing in it.  It was just little child play stuff.  That's how I met him, in ninth grade.  And so he started coming down to, down to Winnsboro on Sunday and eat dinner with us, and ride back to Chester 26 miles.  And his daddy said now you gon' run out.  You, you don't need to be going down there every Sunday.  He said, daddy, you just tend your business.  See, he was in eleventh grade, and I was in ninth.  He thought he was big time.  And so when he went to, he went to the C.C. Camp, and then when he went to--
Speaker 2: The Community Conservation Corps--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, so then he went to Germany, and that's when I went to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and started courting this other guy.
Speaker 2: He went to Germany during the war, is that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, World War I--
Speaker 1: Well, II.
Speaker 2: I mean II, II, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And so, and so when, when Joe called me, he--Joe called me--let me see.  He wrote me a letter and told me he was gonna come back home.  See, I graduated in '46 [1946], and he came home January in '46 [1946].  And he called me when he got to Chester and said you can come down to Chester this weekend and spend the night with us?  I said I have to call my mother [Beatrice Ross].  I said, mother, Joe is home from Germany.  Is it all right if I go down to Chester--say yes, you know how to behave.  Yes, ma'am.  Honey, that, that Friday at--Saturday I got on a bus and rode to Chester.  And I looked out that window and saw that handsome man sitting out there, I was about grinning myself to death.  And when I got off the bus, he took me on back to his mama's house--'cause his mother, she's a wonderful lady, pretty as she could be--and I spent the night.  And I came back to Charlotte on the Greyhound bus, and paid 10 cents to drive--to ride--from the Greyhound bus down there on Trade Street to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina].  And when I got back to Johnson C. Smith, my old boyfriend, the one that I had been courting, he, he, he, he said what did you tell him?  I said I told him I still loved him.  And so he, he got nervous then.  That was in February of 1946.  He thought I was gonna marry Joe right away.  I wasn't gon' marry nobody unless I had a job.  I got to have some money in my pocket.  I ain't marrying nobody poor.  I wasn't ready.  So, so he started on with this big fat woman.  I don't know why he picked her.  She, she lived in Charlotte [North Carolina].  And so when, when, when we graduated that Sunday in May, Joe was sitting up important, with me marching up front.  And he had married this lady.  So he, he marched too.
Story_ID: 72812
Speaker 1: Come to find out, when Joe [Joseph C. Crosby, Sr.] came to Charlotte [North Carolina], see, Joe and I got married in, in '48 [1948].  And when we married, we came back up here and we were living in a garage apartment.  And we bought this house in '51 [1951].  And so Joe and Warren, this same guy, got to be good friends, 'cause he was working--Warren was working with North Carolina Mutual selling insurance.  He didn't teach.  And Joe came home and, and went to South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and took up shoe repairing.  He just wanted to be doing something to get some G.I. money.  So he came back up here and started doing shoe repair.  And, and he, and he and this guy got together that I used to date.  And he said why don't you get a job with North Carolina Mutual?  And Joe got a job with North Carolina Mutual.  North Carolina Mutual gave us the money to buy this house.  And then he and, he and his wife were supposed to go on vacation.  And one Sunday we were in this house, and somebody called us and said come over on Beattysville (ph.) Road.  He--his wife went to buy some cigarettes so they could go on vacation.  And while she was gone, when he came back, he had blown his head off.  But my mother [Beatrice Ross]--when he used to come to see me down in Winnsboro [South Carolina], he came to our house for, for Christmas.  And oh, he could sing, honey.  My daddy [W.A. Ross, Sr.] and mother loved him 'cause he loved--could sing "Silent Night" and all them.  My daddy used to could play the piano too.  And child, they thought he was a fine person.  But my mother say he has red eyes, say when people got red eyes (laughter)--my mama, I don't where she got that from.  But anyway--
Speaker 2: Red eyes was--what part of his eyes were red?
Speaker 1: No, it's just red thing.  My mama and daddy think that red eyes ain't right.  (Laughter) I don't know what they--
Speaker 2: The white of his eyes was red or--
Speaker 1: Un-huh, the white of eyes was red.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And so, anyway, but he could sing.  See, my daddy loved music, but mother said it's something about him is not right.  I don't know what it is.  My mother just got a mind, and I'm very much like that too, 'cause I can kind of see--
Speaker 2: So you didn't have any idea why he--
Speaker 1: No.  And see, Joe and that boy were friends.  They became friends.  But I think he was, I think he just--see, he started on the, on the, on the police force first, but he didn't like it because he, he had to shoot somebody or, or to be shot--not be shot--and I think that got, got on him.  And I think he couldn't get over it.  And I think when he looked at that fat woman every night--I mean she was this wide--and I think he just said I don't know what to do.  And they were getting ready to go on vacation.  And, and, and when she went to get those cigarettes, and I--he probably didn't want her smoking over him.  Honey, he just put that gun in his--his, his body fell, his body fell back behind the sofa.  I said my mama tell--whatever your mama tells you to do, you'd better do it.
Speaker 2: Well, that's a sad story.
Story_ID: 72813
Speaker 1: So, how did you--I mean, what school did you start teaching in when you--
Speaker 2: Pineville Colored High School [Pineville, North Carolina]; that was the name of it.  When Charles Collingwood (ph.) came to me to interview me down in Billingsville [North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I gave him, I gave him the--he didn't believe it--I gave him the, the, the thing that has Pineville Colored High School.  See, way back--
Speaker 1: Pineville, how's it spelled?
Speaker 2: See--okay, P-I-N-E-V-I-L-L-E, Pineville, it's a little city called Pine-Pineville right down, down, down the street about 10 miles from here.  And they had a white school, Pineville High School.  But ours was called Pineville Colored High School, and only black kids went to, to, to the one that I taught.  Nineteen forty-six [1946] I started teaching, and, and I didn't have a car.  It was a guy named Mr. Anderson (ph.), and he charged us $10 a month.  He'd pick us up in his car, and drive him down to Pineville, and drive us back, $10 a month (laughter).  I wasn't making but--how much I made--$129 a month, big time.  And so I stayed there from 1946 to 19--1957.  Lincoln Heights is right over here, about two blocks from here.  They built a brand new school, Lincoln Heights [Elementary School].  See, see, they, they, they give us ghetto names, you know, down in the slum, Lincoln Heights, Abraham Lincoln, lifted us up.  Lincoln Heights, that's the name of that school, and I was the first teacher that was hired at Lincoln Heights.  And I went from '57 [1957] to '67 [1967].  And by that time, I had my master's from Bank Street College [New York, New York], and I became the trainer of early childhood education.  We didn't have kindergartens, and so we, we started training teachers to be able to do preschool children.  See, it used to start first grade on to tenth, to the tenth--twelfth grade.  So I, I trained teachers from 1967 to 1970, '71 [1971].  That's when I was named to go to Billingsville [Elementary] School because the--when they integrated the school--
Story_ID: 72814
Speaker 1: Now let's, let's backtrack a little bit--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to the Swann [v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education] case.  Let's talk about--that's, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, that's the Swann, that's the Swann thing.
Speaker 1: --integrated, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, see--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --see the, see the--okay, when, when--
Speaker 1: Vera [Swann], Vera--
Speaker 2: --when, when they said--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Un-huh, un-huh, and Vera, his wife, Vera, she went to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] too, and [Darius] Swann did too.  They were there when I was there.  And--
Speaker 1: So they sued in 1959.
Speaker 2: They sued, but we didn't integrate until--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't integrate until 19--close to 1970, '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And see, see--
Speaker 1: What was the suit about?  Can you explain it?  Because it's better for you to explain it than have me try, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, see, see, doctor--let me see.  Oh, I'm looking at the girl right now, doctor--oh, his, his--Counts, Dorothy Counts, a tall--I got a picture of her standing with the crowd around her.  Dorothy Counts' father was a professor at Johnson C. Smith.  His--her mother was a housewife.  And they, they, they, they told her that she was going to Harding High School, which was a white school, which, which is a different place than where Harding is now.  And honey, when she went down there, her--see, Hawkins, there's a guy here named Reginald Hawkins.  He's a real foul--people don't pay him any attention now, but he used to fight for civil rights all the time.  He and, and Dr. Counts, who was a professor at Johnson C. Smith, they marched their daughter down there and oh, honey, you, you ought to see the pictures that I got.  I got pictures in there somewhere.  Honey, they were saying go home, nigger, and just all this kind--and she just walked like a queen, just walked right through the crowd.  She was the first one to go into a white school.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Counts?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Counts.
Speaker 1: C-O-U-N-T-S.
Speaker 2: T-S, mm-hm.  Yeah, and so anyway, that was 70--'71 [1971], and--
Speaker 1: That was--no, that was '57 [1957] when she--
Speaker 2: Oh, '57 [1957], that's right, way back then.  But they, but they integrated the schools in '69 [1969], '70 [1970], and that's when I, that is when I, that's where I told you I was training people from '67 [1967] to '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay, the, the lawsuit, just Dorothy Counts tried to integrate [Harding High School] and some other people, Gus Roberts and other people tried to integrate in '57 [1957], but it--
Speaker 2: But it didn't work.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It didn't work.
Speaker 1: Well, '59' [1959] there were some discuss--they consolidated two school districts, Mecklenburg--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, now that's--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that was different, that's consolidation.
Speaker 1: Then--
Speaker 2: But they still--see, I, I still was at Lincoln Heights, a black school, and Myers Park [High School].  See, see, some people went to Myers Park too.  That's where the real rich white folks and--but not many.  But, see, when Julius Chambers [HM] came here and started, made things go.  See, Judge [James B.] McMillan was the one that was doing the sta--
Speaker 1: Now let's, let's, let's slow down a bit.  Julius Chambers was the attorney, the NAACP attorney, who filed a lawsuit--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --for the Swanns.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right, and he followed that case all the way through.
Speaker 2: All the way through.
Speaker 1: Julius Chambers, right, and was part of a big law firm here--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, child.
Speaker 1: --a man named James Ferguson and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I (unclear) all of them booga boos, honey.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Shucks, in fact, I was down at that house the other day, Christian named grandbaby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, see, her--his, his wife and I talk together at Lincoln Heights.  We've been buddies forever.  In fact, I put his name down on my list.  I didn't know whether they had him.  And so I called and I said, Julius, I know your name was on this list.  Said I'm supposed to be interviewed.  But Julius is a cool guy, smart as he can be.
Speaker 1: And then James McMillan, the judge, the--
Speaker 2: That's the judge.
Speaker 1: --district court judge, James McMillan, ordered--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the desegregation of the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Charlotte public schools in 1969, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, '70 [1970], '69 [1969], '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 72815
Speaker 1: Now, now, they, they integrated the schools, and you were saying how did I come in right there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right, Billingsville [Elementary] School was built by a black man whose name is Sam Billings; he owned the property, and they built that school.  It was in the county.  It wasn't in the city then, and it was for black kids in Grier Town.  And the Grier, Mr. Grier is like a white man.  He's, he's, he's got a funeral home.  Mr. Grier, he got a big white house out in Grier Town.  It's called Grier Town.  But Billingsville School was (unclear), because Mr. Billings gave the property.  So--back when they didn't care what blacks thought about name, naming the schools af--they don't name streets after blacks anymore now.  But Grier Town is where Billingsville School is, and Billingsville School was built in 1927, and it had three rooms.  But when I got there, they had built a new school for Billingsville, brick school.  And it's a guy named Banks, a black guy, he was the principal.  And when they integrated with it, when they got to '69 [1969], '70 [1970], these rich people down Providence Road, in, in Parit--on Providence Road and Randolph Road, and right across from Billingsville is Eastover [North Carolina], where ve--very wealthy people, and the Mint Museum right across, across, across 7th Street, 4th Street and 7th Street.  But anyway, when they, when they integrated the schools they had to get some whites to go to some black schools, so they brought people from Providence Road and Randolph Road and sent them to Billingsville.  And Billingsville was right across the street from, from, from Eastover, and that, that's what they wanted to go, but, but those superintendents, they didn't play around.  They say you going to this school.  All right, when they, when the whites went to Billingsville School, he start--the principal started crying the blues and told the PTA people, say, you white people trying to run my school.  That's what he told them in that PTA - y'all trying to run my school.  Because they should be glad them little junior leaguers wanted to come and do something, 'cause most of those black folks had to go to work.  And they were coming in wanting to do, helping with reading.  They, they had these kind of reading classes after school and all that.  And he said y'all trying to run my school.
Story_ID: 72816
Speaker 1: So Jay Robinson, y'all, I wish y'all knew him.  He's a mountain--a white mountaineer and smart as he can be.  He come calling me, Kat, come up here.  I wanna talk to you.  I said okay, yes, sir.  He said now I'm gonna send you out to Billingsville [Elementary] School.  I said, for what?  To be the principal.  I said, now wait a minute.  I don't have a principal certificate.  I don't give a darn what you don't have.  You know how to deal with kids, and you know how to deal with grown folks.  You got your master's from Bank Street College [New York, New York].  How many people went to Bank Street College?  Just get on out there and do the job.  I went (laughter), I went out there, and the first day I went, oh, he--he gave him a--said I'm gon' give him a black school so he'll be happy.  And there was no such thing as a black school, but I don't where he--I've forgotten--like he probably made him a, you know--I've forgotten what he was doing.  'Cause I don't think he gave him another school, gave him a job, but he wasn't a principal.  But anyway, when I went out there the first day I went to every class.  I said I'm your new principal.  My name is Mrs. Crosby.  Mrs. Crosby, do you whip?  These little kids is cute.  I said whip who?  Do you whip?  I said I didn't come out here to whip.  I said you see this dress I got on?  I said this dress cost too much.  I's be sweatin' too much, un-uh.  They went (unclear)--little blonde kids (unclear)--Mrs. Crosby said she doesn't whip 'cause she doesn't wanna get her pretty clothes messed up.  They thought that was the funniest thing they ever heard of.  And those parents started coming over there.  They say, Kat, is there anything we can do?  I said I understand that you all want a reading clinic.  If you all want to have a reading clinic, and for children who need a little bit more, you all are welcome to come over.  And then they started talking about having breakfast for kids who don't have--I let 'em do anything good for kids they wanted to do.  It's--yeah--and black and whites, they were working together.  And it just--I mean I love Billingsville.  And heck, those little old kids were a mess.  And I had good teachers too.  And I got real good, good support from the PTA.  Heck, when, when, when Christmas came, they were giving me presents like I was some queen or something.  I said you all shouldn't do this.  They say, we are, we're bringing it to your house.  We're not bringing it to school.  I said yes, ma'am.
Story_ID: 72817
Speaker 1: But anyway, we, we--let me see, I was there from 1970, '71 [1971] to 1976, and that's when they made 10 area superintendents.  They say assistant superintendents, but we were called area superintendents 'cause we just had a part of it, just, just 10 schools.  I had Myers Park [High School], and that was the rich people.  And they almost died that I got to be the, the superintendent over those rich people.  'Cause they had, they had two white area su--two--I think--I don't think any wom--white women, but white men.  They said, I could take my--Myers Park.  I said I'm taking what Jay [Robinson] tell me to take.  So I took Myers Park, (unclear) Junior High School, Selwyn School; I had two junior high schools, and one high school, and seven elementary schools.  The next year, Jay said, Kat, now you can handle two areas.  I'm gon' give you twenty-five schools (laughter).  He gave me Harding High School, which is just the opposite of Myers Park.  I took Myers Park--I mean Har--Harding and the other schools.  I had twenty-five schools and--but my principals were very cooperative.  I just had to tell two somewhere to go, 'cause they didn't, they weren't too nice to kids.  I didn't fire them.  I just told 'em to move over somewhere else where you can be happy, 'cause if you don't like kids and don't--and you're not kind to kids of all kinds, colors, and creeds, you can't work for me.  'Cause one of 'em sent fourteen girls home by themselves, and told, told--didn't even tell the parents why she sent 'em.  And the kids had been home for two weeks, and they didn't even know it.  The parents didn't know it.  See, the principal is supposed to call the parents in if the kids are having problems.  She just didn't want 'em in her school.  She thought those kids were too rich to be with those poor kids.  See, it's easy to take black kids from in the ghetto to be bused over, so that those kids didn't have to go anywhere.  But, honey, I just straightened that up real good.  And they had a big hearing [clearing throat] at the school board.  And oh, all those parents came up supporting her, and I didn't say a word.  I went in there and sat down by myself.  And the custodian came--Ms. Crosby, I didn't know they was trying to get after you.  I, I don't know, I didn't know what they came up here for.  You want me to sit with you?  I said if you want to, but I don't need anybody to sit with me.
Speaker 2: Now is this the meeting where you were threatened not to attend or?
Speaker 1: That was, that was--no--
Speaker 2: That wasn't it?
Speaker 1: The one, the one that you're talking about is the one that I had to speak on a Sunday--
Speaker 2: Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --when the [Ku Klux] Klan--
Speaker 2: --or afterwards?
Speaker 1: No, this was way after--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: When the Klan, when the--
Speaker 2: All right, well, keep, keep, keep, keep going with this--
Speaker 1: No, this is a story that has to do with school.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And, and this lady sent those fourteen black kids who lived out in, in the ghetto, and she didn't care whether they ever came back to school.  She didn't even tell the parents.  She was supposed to call the parents here and say this child is doing so and so, and if she doesn't straighten up, she's gonna be out of school for so and so.  But the parents didn't even know it.  The kid, kids just stayed home and didn't tell the--and they could've gotten pregnant or anything with nobody at home.
Speaker 2: So they just didn't go to school at all, and their--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --parents didn't know they weren't going?
Speaker 1: The parents didn't know it 'cause those parents had to go to work early in the morning, catch the bus.  They didn't have any--see, they were in a what they call a ghetto.
Story_ID: 72818
Speaker 1: But anyway, when, when they had the hearing, all these rich parents came, 'cause it was about thirty of 'em came in and sat down.  They just stormed the place and sat down.  I was sitting up there by myself.  And when the custo- see, she'd told the custodians to come up there because they were gonna be trying to get my job.  And see, he didn't know what was going on, "Yes ma'am, yes ma'am."  He walks up there, "Mrs., Mrs. Crosby, I didn't know they was trying to get after you.  I'm a sit with you."  I said, "You don't need to sit with me, baby.  If you want to, you can."  I just sat on up there just as happy.  And so when the board took, took the--they listened to what was going on, two white women who were on the board voted for her to keep her job.  Those white men, who knew I was doing my job--I had the sweetest man who, who got on the school board named Walter McKeithen [ph.].  He's a, he's a lawyer.  He was in my PTA [Parent Teacher Association] when I was the principal of Billingsville.  And Ashley Mc- Hogwood [Ashley Hogwood] was on the board too.  Shucks, they was up--I knew they were in my corner 'cause they knew how I good I was to their kids and the, black and white kids.  Honey, all those guys, every--and Dicky Spangler [Clemmie Spangler, Jr.], you know Dicky Spangler?  Oh, he's a--child, millionaire.  He built so many houses, and he's a millionaire.  He was on the board too.  Honey, those people got out, he said, "Mrs. Crosby is doing her job."  And so, it came out that--I, I didn't want them to fire her, but she wasn't gone work for me, not in that school.  So they demoted her and put her in an elementary school in a poor neighborhood.  So she didn't have to pick out the rich and the poor.  All of them were poor.  And so, but she didn't (unclear) with me 'cause she knew she was wrong.  And so, oh, it was all in the paper, child.  Oh, they loved to put everything in the paper.  I just sat up there.  When I went out, those women, they stormed me when I started out the door.  She said (gesture), "You bring Ms. Davis back to us."  I said, "Just get back."  I was just like this, Red Sea.  I said, "Step back, miss."  (Laughter), "That's all I'm gonna say, step back."  And they started standing back, and I just walked through that sea of meanness.  And when I got out to the elevator, two little blonde girls sitting there, "Mrs. Crosby, you are doing your job.  And I told my mother she didn't have any business up here" 'cause she didn't have any business doing that to those children.  Kids know everything.  I got on my elevator, and got in my car, and came on home.  That was the end of that.  And when I see her now, she speaks and everything, but she's not in this, in this system.  She's not, she's not anywhere now.  But anyway, it was hard, but I enjoyed it.  And Jay Robinson was my superintendent, and he always treated me right.  And doctor--another superintendent came in.  He was nice too.  I didn't have any trouble getting along with folk, but I didn't take no stuff.  Just give 'em that eye (laughter).  You saw my boy, my boy in there talking about putting my picture up in your kitchen, David (laughter).  Dave is a mess.  But I--all of 'em, I, I didn't fall out with any of 'em.  I just had to do my job.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you about Charles Collingwood at CBS.  Now, when did they come to interview you?
Speaker 2: Okay, in 1976, the word got out that Charles Collingwood wanted to come down to Charlotte [North Carolina] to see how well integration was going on and how well it's doing.  And he came, he wanted to see personally, so he wrote me a letter asking me could he come to my school [Billingsville Elementary School].  I say yes, whenever.  And he came, and the word got out that Charles was coming.  And it was in the paper that Sunday.  Oh, child, people were calling me all day and night.  Your picture's in the paper.  You gon' be in the television--on the television.  And the children went wild, those children at Billingsville.  Honey, them little rich kids, they went home and told their parents--oh, Mrs. Crosby's gon' be on television.  And they had a picture--you know, how the Sunday paper comes out, and it has the magazine?  You know, inside it says--no, I think it was on the front page of the of the magazine.  It showed Charles Collingwood and a picture of me, and it says Kat Crosby said--it, it's somewhere in there--said, said we gonna get ready for the stuff--well, talking about crazy thing.  And the children went wild.  And Monday they came to school with this big banner.  I know their parents made it.  Mrs. Crosby is gon' be on the television today, and had this big, big banner out there.  And when he came, it was hard for me to get my interview because two little blondes knocked on the door, "can we come in?"  (Laughter) And, and he said one or two and let 'em back out.  But anyway, it was good interview.  But I didn't have any idea it was gonna be like it was.  But it was, it was very good.  And it--when it came out on the, you know, that Sunday night special?
Speaker 1: "60 Minutes."
Speaker 2: "60 Minutes."  Honey, we were doing this thing, CBS News with Charles Collingwood.
Speaker 1: Yeah, "60 Minutes" was, at one--at that time, I think the most popular show on television and the highest ratings.
Speaker 2: It was out.  And then they went over to a lady named--what is her name?  She's a pretty white woman.  She's on the school board, and she didn't believe in integration.  And they inter--they interviewed her too.  But she, she sent her children to private school.
Speaker 1: Rather than have them integrate.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, but they were glad to--she was glad that she--here's a lady on the board and not letting her children go to school.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Huh, but Jay Robinson--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--contradiction on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Honey, Jay Robinson and Dr.--who was the one came after that?  Dr. Jones (unclear)--they didn't care who, they said they were gonna integrate that, the school system, and said we're not gonna take, take it back, and they never have taken it back; they're still integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: It's, it's a lot of integration in Charlotte, but people in Charlotte, Dr.--Mr. [Stanford R.] Brookshire was the mayor way back during the '70s [1970s] when, when the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] kids going wild.  He's a wonderful, he was a wonderful mayor.  I cannot say that about every one of 'em.  I'm not gon' say anything now.
Speaker 1: Brookshire, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-R-O-O-K-S-H-I-R-E.  You see Brookshire Boulevard driving through Charlotte.  It's on the wa--Brookshire Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: It's, it's on, on there, on some of my papers somewhere--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the mayor.
Story_ID: 72820
Speaker 1: Now can you tell me about some of the opposition?  I know you had a, a couple of incidents where your family was threatened, and the [Ku Klux] Klan threatened you.  What happened then?  You've had about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: --threats?
Speaker 2: That was when they bombed Julius Chambers' [HM] house, bombed Reginald Hawkins, who is a Presbyterian minister and a dentist, they, they, they bombed his house.  Kelly and Fred Alexander--Kelly [Miller] Alexander was the president of NAACP, and he's strong.  And Fred Alexander was, was the mayor at one time.  And let me tell you, those men were strong.  And Kelly has two boys, and the Klan threw a bomb in their bedroom where they were sleeping.  And so, Mayor [Stanford R.] Brookshire called the Community Relations Committee.  I was a minimum--member--of the Community Relations Committee, had white and black thinking about and doing, doing good things for each other.  That's how we, that's how Charlotte [North Carolina] got together.  Brookshire pulled us together, and no, no, no man has been able to, to make us the racist place we used to have.
Story_ID: 72821
Speaker 1: And so, anyway, Mrs. Cannon--you've heard about Cannon towels?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, Ms. Cannon is this rich lady who lived in a--she, she, she kin to the Duke Mansion, the, the Dukes in (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The Dukes at--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)--Dukes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, honey, she, she had just married a Cannon.  But anyway, Mrs., and Mrs. Cannon called me and said now, Kat, you need to be on this program, and you'll know what to say.  I said all right.  So, on, on Saturday evening's paper we used have an evening paper, not just the "Observer," but the Saturday--the evening newspaper had the names of all the people who were gonna speak, Kelly Alexander, whose child was bombed, and their house was bombed, and, and now he not scared a bit.  And I spoke.  And I'm trying to think about all the people--I got a, a copy of that somewhere.  But anyway, people in the community had to speak, and, and Mayor Brookshire spoke too.  And put--they put our pic--names in the paper.  The Klan, so, so-called Klan--wasn't no Klan--they, they wrote me a letter and said hello, nigger, if you get up on that television tomorrow, I'm gon' blow your whatever color my back part is, and signed KKK.  All right, they put the letter in a special delivery and went over to Mount Holly [North Carolina], which is about 12 miles from here, and my--and mailed it in Mount Holly so they couldn't, couldn't track you down.  And Sunday morning I was in the bed, and my, my husband [Joseph C. Crosby, Sr.] sleeps really, he, he sleeps.  And I was lying up just with my eyes closed, and I heard the, the station wagon come up in our yard and park right on a steep of, of the hill.  And I saw that man go up there and put a letter, and I said Joe, that guy put--he said go back to sleep, ain't nothing, and he went on back to sleep.  And after they left, I went out and got the letter.  It was a special delivery.  And when I looked at it, he said what you gon' do?  I said I want you to get the children up and take them to Sunday school, and I will be fine.  He said but you gonna do?  I said please do what I asked you to do.  I said 'cause if I tell you, you'll get mad, and it'll be a big blowout.  'Cause, honey, W.A. [Ross, Sr.] would probably have got a gun and shot 'em down (laughter).  So Joe took the kids to Sunday school.  I called the FBI and I told them, and they came right in that back door.  They sat down, and they said now, are you going today?  I said mm-hmm--said I'm glad you're going, said we'll be there, said you scared?  I said mm-mm, no.  I said if the wanna get you, they gon' get you anyway.  And so we were out there are 3:00, and Kathy [C. Wells]--I was sitting up on the stage trying to look cute.  And Kathy and Joey [Joseph C. Crosby, Jr.] were little children, and Joe was sitting there proud of me.  He always was proud.  So, when I, when I stood up to speak--no, Ms. Cannon spoke, this rich lady.  She spoke and told them how dumb they were.  And one of the Alexanders spoke, the, the either the undertakers--they, they, they had two, two families bombed--their houses were bombed.  They didn't bomb mine.  They just got me to talk, to talk to people, black and white.  And so when I stood up I said well, I'm--the first thing I said was I said I'm glad my daddy taught me not to hate, but he also taught me not to be afraid.  I said so now I'm about to say something now, and you all may not be ready for it.  And I just started talking about when a coward would throw a bomb in a house where a child is sleeping.  I said they just need to regroup, and I just talked like I'm talking to y'all now.  And I just said what I had to say and sat down.  And the next day it was the big in the paper, what all we said and all that.  And, and, and (laughter) I had a kind a hard time, but I, I always acted like I wasn't afraid if I was.  I'd just get on out and go, too bad, just have to--you get killed, you just have to be dead.  I've never been dead yet, so I wouldn't know what's like (laughter).
Speaker 2: But nothing really happened, I mean--
Speaker 1: No, they, they didn't bother me anymore, 'cause people were too nice to me, white and black, rich and poor.  I just kept on doing what I was doing.
Story_ID: 72822
Speaker 1: Now tell me about being district superintendent.
Speaker 2: Well, anyway, they called it area, but it's the same thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, area, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, see, we had one superintendent, and he had those supervisors, you know, them ladies who walk around and see what teachers are doing and go on about their business.  And Charlotte-Mecklenburg [Schools], since it's, it's a hundred schools, they, they couldn't have one superintendent to take care of all those schools.  So they picked ten people to be area superintendents, and I was the first woman to be on it and, an area superintendent.  And then they got a, a, a white woman the next year.  And she wanted Myers Park [High School].  She wanted what I had.  And Jay [Robinson] said, Kat's gon' take what I told her to take, and she gon' do that.  She'll do it right.  She'll handle those rich people, and she handle those poor kids, say I'm in charge now.  Jay, he was a mess (laughter), had one bad--one bad, bad eye would go that way, and the other went--Jay was a mess, but he was real, he was real fair.  He was fair to white and black, and just say what he got to say.  But anyway, it was kind of hard.  See, at first I had just had one--just ten schools.  And then after a year is when he gave me the other ten, or whatever it was.  I had twenty-five.  I don't know how I got twenty-five.  The area had however many schools they had, you had--and they named it like Harding [High School], Myers Park, that was mine.  And then Independence was a big area.  Somebody's over there--the high school was the name of the area that you were over.  And I did that from 1976 to 1986, and I retired in 1986.
Story_ID: 72823
Speaker 1: All right, now, tell me, I mean, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: My hope, my concern is that parents don't spend enough time with their children.  Everybody wants a big--everybody say, Kat, you still living in this house?  I said un-huh--say, I thought you would go to Hyde Park.  I said, honey, I was born in a house.  I said my mama had French doors.  I don't need no French doors.  I said we had French doors when we were little.  I said we wasn't rich, but we didn't--I, I, I said I'm just as happy over here, didn't do a thing for me.  And now what did you say?
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: To, to, to--for, for all of us to get our males, more than anything else, straightened out and stop being so quick to get a gun and get the drugs, or do, do the drugs for somebody else and all that kind of thing.  And parents don't pay any attention to 'em, and half are too afraid to tell them what they should do.  And, and it's really--every time I look in the paper, here comes two black guys shot somebody down the other day, talking about for a little bit of, give me a cigarette, anything.  I just get mad.  But white kids do it too.  But, you know, our kids look so bad when they get--when they put their pictures on the paper, and they got the, you know, the jail look.  And see, a lot of these people can protect their children, but you don't have the money.  We just need to do more--in our churches, we do well in our churches.  We got a real good young minister, and he does a lot of nice things with kids and, and talks a lot in, in our services.  And, but we just need to give people jobs, and, and give them a lot of support.  That's what we need to do, instead of saying I'm gon', negative, and you can't do anything doing negative.  You got to do positive.  Shoot, I see them bad boys.  I said what y'all doing?  Mrs. Crosby, we ain't doing nothing.  I say you better not, come here.  No, Mrs. Crosby.  Now you now I--you--that ain't'--no, no, ma'am.  I say you bet not.  And they call me Mama Kat.  I say okay, you better do good.  We just got to give, give some time for children and young people, and tell them how important it is to stay out of trouble and, and do something positive.  But so many kids are really good; there's so many good ones.  But--
Speaker 1: You don't think that, that there's enough time spent, you know, with--
Speaker 2: They don't--
Speaker 1: --with youth, you know, with--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, that's the problem.  See, the mamas wanna go out in the street and have good time, and leave the children home with somebody to take care of them.  Honey, I didn't let mine go out.  I got somebody to come in my house when my children were little, and they loved those people.  They came to the house and stayed until I came.  No, I didn't let mine get passed out, no.  I said I don't have to have a whole lot of stuff.  I got four grandchildren.  They're just as sweet as they can be.  But it's, it's, it's--but I still say your upbringing has a whole lot to do with what you're gonna do.  See, I had good home training, but they said I was the worst child.  That's what teachers said.  They said you're not gonna be there.  I said yes, I am.  I was just mean enough to say it.  I said yes, I am.  Don't take, don't take my, my, my happiness.  But I was a pretty good old lady to be seventy-seven, trying to look cute (laughter).
Story_ID: 72824
Speaker 1: What would you see when you look back on all this?  And you, you've received so many awards and--
Speaker 2: I don't even think about it hardly.  In fact, when I got that letter from--what's her name?  I didn't get to meet her yet.  I just talked to her on the phone.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never got to see her yet.  But anyway, now what did you say?  I talk so much--
Speaker 1: I said, no, I said when you have received so many awards, and you've done so, so much, I mean, what, what would you consider as your, as your legacy?  What, what are the highlights of the things that you've done?
Speaker 2: I think, people, children, and people.  I love people.  And my legacy is to help kids, even, even grown people.  When I was an area superintendent, I helped, I helped teachers to become principals and to be leaders.  I got a friend I wish you could have gotten her.  Her name is Mildred Wright.  Her mama used to teach with me, and she died with cancer.  Her mother died with cancer.  Her name is Mildred Wright, and she is so smart.  She was one of my principals over there at Thomasboro [Elementary School].  And she, she retired, and Dr. Smith made her come back.  And she's trying to retire, Dr. Pusen (ph.) won't let her go.  She's excellent.  She's very articulate.  And it's just that people just need to mentor a lot of younger people so that they can move on up.  'Cause I don't know how I got to where I was 'cause I was the bad child in the family.  But I, I did it out of saying y'all (unclear) when those, when those teachers told me I wasn't gonna be anything, that was my challenge.  But I was mean enough (laughter) to say, oh, you're not gonna keep me from being--you're gonna be--yes, I am (laughter).  I wasn't even thinking about, about to let them know it, but it was because I wanted them to know I could.  And both of my children--
Speaker 1: Now you believed you could, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, you have to believe in yourself.  Honey, I, I'll put a good old prayer too.  I can pray pretty good for all y'all, honey, in a minute, and me, and my children--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and other folk too.
Speaker 1: You believe in positive reinforcement, you were saying that at some point, that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --that people act out what you tell them they--
Speaker 2: You got to say "I'd rather see a sermon than to hear one with they--I'd rather you to walk with me than merely show the way.  The eye is a better pupil and more willing than the ear.  Fine counsel is confusing, but example's always clear." ["I'd Rather See A Sermon", Edgar A. Guest]  Make the example.  If they say I was a good principal, I want them to be good principals.  If they the good teachers, I want them to be it.  You want to be an architect? Get with some of these Harvey Gantts, want to be a lawyer, get with Julius Chambers [HM], get with Mel Watt.  We got plenty of fine men in Charlotte [North Carolina], that's true.  I mean they are fine.  And now and then they come up with one or two showing and done shot somebody (laughter).  I say heck.  But I think that--I don't think drugs are as bad as they were in the '60s [1960s], do you?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Because they slick with it.  They just, they're passing it around quietly, and then they know, they know how not to get all piped out.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They're still doing it.
Speaker 1: --violence was associated with drugs I think now--
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: There's more violence associated with it now I think--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and guns, and shooting people, and stealing.  I don't know.  And some people don't have jobs, and they think they got to steal, steal cars.  Now y'all, I'm gonna tell y'all right now, y'all better be sure y'all's cars backed up in there 'cause, honey, they steal cars.
Story_ID: 72825
Speaker 1: What do you think is the toughest problem in the school system today, I mean?
Speaker 2: I think, I think teachers do not get the training that they used to get.  See, they used to, they used to give us discipline, something about disciplining children and disciplining son or all that kind of thing.  I don't think they teach what a child needs now, the kind of teachers that we, we grew up being.  See, they just wanna get through the class to be a teacher.  And see, they need to take child development.  That's another thing that teachers don't take enough of.  They just take a psychology course.  That's nothing.  Child development, you gon' teach young children, you need to know what they do, and how they are, and how, and how you do not treat a, a five-year-old the same you do a ten-year-old.  Teachers don't get the training.  I don't think they having the training that they ought to have, and then get paid more.  And parents--don't you think parents stay at home a little bit more than they did in about ten years ago?  'Cause people were wild about big house and have a big job.  But it seems like to me a lot of people are--I think people have bigger jobs.  And, and I don't know.  Children got to have a home, not a house.  They got to come in and sit down and sit at the table and talk, and, and do your homework and all that.  And see, some of these parents just wanna be in the street all the time, got to go there to that bridge stuff.  When I used to go to my bridge, honey, I'd have a babysitter until Joe [Joseph C. Crosby, Sr.] gets there.  We always worked together on that.  And my kids just average and wonderful kids, that's all.  But it's a lot of good, good ones around too.  But I think men need to put, put, put more time at home with their children.  Don't just leave it for a mother to do, and let them know that with--I might call mama, call mama or daddy.  You can't pick this one because that one won't do.  They have to get--the parents got to get together and say we, we decided you can't do this and just that's it.  There's not a whole lot of discussion about it.

Speaker 1: Do, do you think your father [W.A. Ross, Sr.] would have been proud of what you've done?
Speaker 2: Oh, my daddy would be so proud of me, honey, I'm telling you right now.  I loved my daddy to death.  He was a calm, kind, strong man, and he didn't take any stuff.  He wasn't mean, but if he ever say Kathleen, come here a minute.  Uh-oh, I knew I--honey, if daddy gave me two licks, I'd just die, 'cause I thought he loved me better than all of 'em together.  Oh, but daddy didn't do a lot of whipping or anything.  Mama [Beatrice Ross] would get that switch and get, get that peach--come here, Kathleen Earle (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now your mother lived until 1970 I guess.  And she, she, she had a chance to see you become--
Speaker 2: Oh, honey, my mother and daddy were so proud.  I was--I, I, I did an operetta, "The Land of Dreams Come True."  Honey, my mother and daddy came to sit in the audience, an operetta that I put on.  And played the--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --played the music for it.  Huh?
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was--let me see--I was--let me see, I was twenty--I was 21--22 years old.  Oh, child, that (unclear)--and daddy said look at Mattie Bole (ph.).  Ms., Ms. Bole was my third grade teacher, and she was strong, honey.  She could play the piano, and she'd make us sing all these songs and all these things.  And he said look at Matt Bole, that's daddy said, look at Matt Bole, giving her, that teacher--see, she's like Mat Bole.  He--they never would say you look like me or acting like me, but honey, I knew who I got my--from my mama and daddy.  See, daddy was strong and kind.  I never heard him make a curse word in his life, never.  And he wouldn't argue with you a whole lot.  He just, come in here and sit down, let your daddy talk to you a minute.  My daddy was a cool man.  Now, my mother would get my shirttail in a minute.  'Cause she'd get a peach tree and say Kathleen Earle, da, da, da, da and talk a lot.  But daddy just say now, Kathleen Earle.  Honey, my daddy, he was a prince of a man.  That's what I called him.  He's calm, and he was good looking.  I thought he was just good looking.  We used to think that you had to have light skin to be good looking.  Daddy was just as handsome as he could be and so intelligent.  You could tell that he had been around rich people, 'cause he knew what was proper.  He had to teach mother a lot of things about what you do when you, you know, bring people in.  'Cause, see, mother was from a poor family, just pretty, with that hair down to here (laughter).

I never say I can't stand her or I can't stand him.  I never use that.  If I, if I don't like something, I usually work it out with somebody.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I, I didn't have too many big problems in my life to get along with people.  I don't even care what they say about me when I'm dead, 'cause they tell me so many things while I'm living.  Mama Kat, I'm coming over to your house.  I got to talk to you about my children and my classroom.  Now I want you to talk about my own children.  I said, honey, I'm trying to keep mine straight (laughter).  I had the best time at my daughter's [Kathy C. Wells] house for Thanksgiving.  She called me this morning.  I said don't be calling me, got your handsome husband up there with all you got, and up here crying at the airport.  She went to, she always, she cannot stand for me to come down there and go back.  She, she walk--she asked the man, can I go to the, not to the gate, but right before you turn to go on the plane?  He said yeah, you can go.  And I, I was going down.  I knew I had to look back.  I looked back, she's talking about [waving].  That's the way she does, and she dropped them tears.  See, I know her.  She called me this morning: Mama, I'm sorry I had to drop that tear, but I was so glad you came.  And see, she can't get over my daddy--when I--her daddy [Joseph C. Crosby, Sr.] being dead; she can't get over daddy.  And she said, mama, you all right?  I said yeah.  I said I took care of your daddy.  I didn't send him to a nursing home.  I was his nurse, and he was at our home, so he was in his nursing home right here in that room over--he, he, he was, he was really so sick.  And one night he fell, fell in the tub, didn't have any business in the bathroom, going in there trying to slip and get in the tub by himself and fell in the bathroom.  I had to call--but the fire department's not but two blocks from here.  I called.  They came, they said you'd better do what Mrs. Crosby tell you to do (laughter).  And another time he did something.  Oh, he tried to get out of his bed.  You know, he had this railing, and he wanted to urinate--sports, sport.  I, I said you already done it.  And he, he comes stepping over and fell again.  And, and see, they oxygen was over there.  I had to call them.  They said now, Mrs. Crosby not gon' call us anymore.  He gon' put you in a nursing home (laughter).  He didn't never do anything else, but I had to threaten him.  'Cause see, he's a soldier, and he liked to have his way now.  But he, he wasn't that bad.  Heck, when that man had prostate cancer--'cause see, he was sick.  And see, his daddy died with cancer, and he had another brother that died with cancer.  It was in that gene.  So I told my son, I said now you go and see about yourself every year.  I said don't come up here sick, child, got to keep well.  I said you get to be seventy-seven, you're doing all right.  The Lord didn't promise me but three score and ten, and I got my seven more years, thank Him every night for having seven more years than I was expecting.
