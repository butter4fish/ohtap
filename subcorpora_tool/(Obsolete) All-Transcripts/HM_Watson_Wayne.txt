Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five 'People' magazine-ish type questions, kind of lightweight questions that just require a brief answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  Well, it's recently become salmon over a bed of lettuce and spinach, with avocado and tomatoes.  But that's a hot salmon, an ear of corn--oh, we've got a phone ringing, don't we?
Speaker 1: Yes, we do.  Okay, oh, second question is, what is your favorite color?

Speaker 1: And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Probably two.  If you control a man's mind, you do not have to tell him to go to the back door.  His very nature will take him there.  And if there's no back door, he will make one.  [Historian] Carter G. Woodson.  All right, very basic.  Something that has plagued black people for centuries, people controlling our minds through education.
Story_ID: 14921
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your family history.  How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, my mother [Fayette LaCroix Watson] probably--you know, some time in, the 1800s, yeah, and some time in the 1800s.  I don't know, that much about my mother's side.  I know more about my father's side in terms of family history.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can go back to your, is it your great grandparents or beyond?
Speaker 2: You know, 1800s.  I don't know anything about them, just, I just have names.  The earliest story that I have is concerning my father's [Wade H. Watson's] father in terms of when he left out North--out of South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know what part of South Carolina he was in?
Speaker 2: Anderson.
Speaker 1: Anderson?
Speaker 2: Anderson, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you know what he was doing in Anderson?
Speaker 2: Grandpa was a sharecropper.  He was a sharecropper down there, had a couple of mules and some kids and was sharecropping some land.
Speaker 1: That's a story, and a lot of people probably have a similar story.
Speaker 2: Oh, everybody, you know--
Speaker 1: If it's not Carolina, it's some place else.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you know.  And just, he, was in a--at nighttime, he used to sweep up.  And he was sweeping up in this, restaurant--or actually, this tavern.  And these two white guys walked up to him, and I guess they had dropped a silver dollar in his spittoon.  And they asked him, they said, "Nigger, get that silver dollar out of the spittoon for us."  He looked at them, you know, and they said, "Nigger, you heard me.  Get that silver dollar out of the spittoon."  So he was bending down to get it, but something--and he told me this story.  Between him bending down and putting his hand on it, on that spittoon, made him say, "Not this time."  So when he came up, he came up with this spittoon in his hand and hit them in the head with it.  And the spit and the everything went all over, and this is a tavern of white people.  So when he hit them, he was running for the door.  And they chased him.  He got out of town.  And he made it back to his, acres that he was sharecropping.  And he told my grandma, "I'm taking one of the mules.  I'll write you," well not write you, "I'll let you know where I am," cause grandpa couldn't write.  "I'll let you know where I am, and, you know, you can bring the boys."  And so he took one mule, left one mule there for grand- for my father and his brother to work the farm.  And he got on the buckboard.  And he left town.  When he was coming down the road to leave, this car was coming up the road, and it was a car full of the white men from the town, because they knew where he lived.  But grandpa wore a real big hat, something like the hats that I wear now.  And he was sitting on the buck, this buckboard with his mule.  And they didn't realize it was him.  Grandpa was light, you know.  They knew he was, he was black, but they didn't know it was him.  And they said, "Nigger, move that off the road."  And he sat there, and they said, "Nigger, move that buckboard off the road."  So he didn't anything, still didn't raise his head, and, you know, the hat was covering his face.  They got out the car, and they opened both doors.  As soon as they opened both doors, he lifted his head.  And when he lifted his head, they saw him.  And they went for their guns, and he had his gun.  He said, "You take another step, they going to find you making that step tomorrow."  And that's one--that's my second favorite saying.  I told you there were two.  That's the second favorite saying.  He shot the tires out.  He went on.  And he escaped.  I asked him, I said, "Well, okay, if that was in South Carolina, how'd you end up in Chicago [Illinois]?"  Most people, when they migrate, they migrate straight north.
Speaker 1: Yeah, New York City [New York] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, his, you know, his statement was--or Washington, D.C.  He said, "Well, I knew they were going to have the block--the roads blocked going north.  So I knew that if I went straight west they would--you know."  He said, "What I did was I headed out over the mountains."  So, and then he said that the reason why he came to Chicago is because they used to sit down at nighttime and go through what they called the 'Wish Book', which was the Sears [mail order company and retailer], the Sears book.  They used to go through that book and look at it.  And so he said, you know, "I'm going to Chicago, any place that has a book like that, has got to be a place that got everything I want."  So he went to Chicago.  Later he had some people contact my grandma, let her know where he was.  And, you know, years later, she brought the boys and the baby up, daughter up there.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  That's a good one.  Now, what was that second favorite saying again, just one more time?
Speaker 2: If you take a step--if you take another step, they're going to find you making that step tomorrow.  Yeah, it's, classic to, me, you know.  He, basically, takes a position, makes a decision of, you know, "Guess what?  I'm not going any further.  You want to fight; we can fight."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that's how your family got to Chicago?
Speaker 2: That's how my family got to Chicago on my father's side.  And it's basically been, you know, something that my--you know, that saying, something that my family have basically adhered to.  Certain things we will stand for; certain things we, just won't play about.
Story_ID: 14922
Speaker 1: Okay, so why don't you tell us about your father?  Can you give us his full name and date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Wade Watson, Wade H. Watson.  H is for Hamilton.
Speaker 1: W-A-D-E?
Speaker 2: W-A-D-E, born May 28, 1917.
Speaker 1: And what was he like and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, papa's still alive.  He's eighty-seven years of age.  He was an athlete in high school.  He wrestled and he played football.
Speaker 1: Where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: He went to Lindbloom High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And he was an excellent athlete.  He's--until today, he's an excellent athlete.  People--there's not a day that goes by when I'm walking down the street, someone doesn't stop and ask me about my father.  You know, he plays four hours of tennis every day today.  And he's eighty-seven.  So he's well known throughout the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And so he was an athlete.  He tried to go to college.  When he was in high school, he was the captain of the team.  The team was invited to Wheaton College [Wheaton, Illinois].  He beat all the college kids in his weight class on the, wrestling team.  The coach was very impressed with the total team.  He gave everybody a scholarship but my father.  My father's black and all the other kids on the team were white.  And--well, not everybody, there were about five kids he gave a scholarship to.  And without a doubt, my father was the best wrestler.  So the other kids said, "What about Wat- they called him 'Red.'  And, you know, the kids figured out, the white kids figured out, "Hey, he's not getting it because he's black."  So they turned down their scholarship to go to Wheaton [College].  And they all went to different schools.  My father then ended up going to [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [Chicago, Illinois, later Kennedy-King College] and graduated from Wilson.  And then he ended up having children and ended up working.  You know, he met my mother, and worked for Commonwealth Edison [electric company]  and retired from there.  He's one of the first black managers.  He was not hired as a manager.  He was hired as a,--almost an office boy, sweeping the floors.  But by the time he left, he had, you know, in the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s], he worked his way up where they let him up a little bit higher.  And then eventually he became a manager and retired.  And now he's living out his retirement, enjoying his grandchildren and playing tennis.
Speaker 1: Four hours a day.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he's in fantastic shape, fantastic shape.
Story_ID: 14923
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about your mother?  Now, you said you knew something about her family origin, but not a lot.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, Fayette, F-A-Y-E-T-T-E, LaCroix, capital L-A-, capital C-R-O-I-X, pronounced "la qua."  Her father was a Pullman Porter and her mother was a housewife.  I think, I'm not sure, I think her mother may have been white.  I'm not sure.  I never met her.  I remember--
Speaker 1: She never really talked about it?
Speaker 2: No, I mean they were married.  She loved her mother.  It's just that, you know, I was--she died before I was born.
Speaker 1: And when you say, she may have been, she never discussed what they (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: I just don't remember, you know.  I just, you know, I know on my father's [Wade H. Watson's] side, his father, the one who was run out of the South, he was half black and half white.  His mother was raped in the, in the cotton fields.  A man came along and raped her--a white man.  So I know he's half black and half white.  My--that's on my father's side.  My mother's side, I think she's, she was German, you know.  I--that's, that would be my grandmother.  My grandfather on my maternal side was a dark-skinned, very handsome, tall, black man, Pullman Porter.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you don't know a lot about her family history much beyond that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What was your mother like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother, she was a housewife.  She pretty much lived her life for her family, for her children, you know.  She--
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: One brother.  One sister.  She and my father fell in love, and they got married, typical story, and stayed together their entire life until she left, meaning deceased.  And she was very, very devoted to the family.
Story_ID: 14924
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story that they [parents, Wade H. Watson and Fayette LaCroix] tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  It's one of--daddy says that when he saw mama, for the first time, and she was a little girl--so daddy's a little bit older than mama, maybe about eight, ten years older.  And he was walking past her one day, and he told one of his buddies, you see that little girl, I'm going to marry her.  And then I guess ten, fifteen years later he ended up marrying her.  But he said, he went to a party one time, and it was like at the parkway, something like that.  And he saw her there.  And he had not seen her for a while.  And, you know, pop was an athlete.  He was extremely popular.  Everybody knew him back then.  He was an Omega [fraternity member].  You know, he was, you know, big man on campus.  And so he walked her and asked her for a dance.  And he said, before he had his hand out, she had started dancing while she was sitting in the chair.  And she was dancing and getting up out the chair dancing with him. And he said, you know, they, they then hooked up.
Story_ID: 14925
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Fayette LaCroix Watson] basically never worked outside of the home?
Speaker 2: No, well, you know, little jobs to make things--to make ends meet.  You know, mama, yes, she did work.  Mama used to scrub the floors over there on, California [Avenue] at the, [Cook County] courthouse [Chicago, Illinois].  And I remember her taking me.  And I used to sit and watch her scrub the floors.  I used to watch the judges walk by and walk on her wet floor.  And I never could understand, why would these men be walking by, walking on my mama's wet floor.
Speaker 1: Because you could get in trouble at home for doing that, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and I'd look at them and say, but I understand why.
Speaker 1: And what do you think the reason is now?
Speaker 2: It's obvious.  You know, [author, W.E.B.] Dubois stated it in the early 1900s, "The challenge of the 20th century will be one of race."  And we have yet to meet that challenge.  These men had no respect, no acknowledgment of my mother's existence in terms of on her hands and knees scrubbing that floor.  And you see it today in 2003.
Story_ID: 14926
Speaker 1: Can you reflect back on growing up?  Now, did you grow up on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, south, yeah.
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in?
Speaker 2: Englewood.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you kind of take us back and give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I grew up, sure in a loving family, but I grew up pretty much in the streets, yeah.  I guess there were not as many kidnappings and not as many abductions of children.  I would hang out in the streets with my little buddies and we'd be playing in the dirt, playing in the alley, playing, you know, just totally, totally enjoying ourselves.  Kids do not play the way we played back then.  They just don't.  You don't see kids playing the way we played.  We'd run.  We'd be jumping on things.  We'd be climbing roofs, you know.  We'd play baseball, play cowboy, play--you name it, and we'd play it.  And dirt was our best friend because it was all--we were dirty (laughter).  And, yeah, so I remember that, you know, grew up right there on 63rd Street, all my life.
Speaker 1: So you all lived at 63rd [Street] and--
Speaker 2: Well, first at 62nd [Street] and May [Street], then 62nd and Racine [Avenue], then to where my father lives today, 64th [Street] and Sangamon [Street].
Speaker 1: He's right over there by the church, by the United Methodist Church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, that's right.  That's right, same block.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what else--what was your favorite activity when you were a youth?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to say wallowing in the dirt.  That's what my mama would have said.  You know, and just--it depends which, stage, you know.  I'd be playing with little soldiers.  I'd be playing cowboys and Indians, dressed up like a cowboy.  I'd be playing like I was Superman, trying to jump out of the second story window.  I would be--I was creating more images for me to be, more things for me to be.  I was extremely creative.
Speaker 1: Now, was your life impacted by--now, you're a generation that knew radio and movies, but then all of a sudden television emerges while you were a child.  Did that have a big impact on you?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, yeah, you know, you'd watch [actor] John Wayne and you'd watch, you know, [actor] Hopalong Cassidy, so, of course, you were influenced.  But that may have been an hour a day.  You were mostly outside.  It was, yeah, very much so.
Story_ID: 14927
Speaker 1: Well tell me about school.  What grade schools did you go to?
Speaker 2: Went St. Raphael Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois], and I guess about third or fourth grade, we were put out of there because we were black.  The Catholic school Archdiocese decided too many blacks were at St. Raphael so they drew a line and said, well, you know, "If you're black," well, they didn't say if you're black, but, "If you're living on--east of, I think Loomis [Boulevard], you have to go to a school called St. Brendan [Chicago, Illinois]."  And St. Brendan already had a bunch of blacks in it.  And, you know, the black parents protested.  Well, at that time, they were trying to keep blacks from going west of Loomis.  And, but the Archdiocese did what it does best.  And so I left St. Rafael and went to St. Brendan, graduated from St. Brendan Elementary School, went to Mount Carmel High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, were your parents Catholic?
Speaker 2: No.  No, it was just my parents did not have that much confidence in the public school system.  And they wanted to try and make sure that their children got a--received a quality education.
Speaker 1: So even then, the public school system was looked upon with a little suspicion by people in the black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: It's nothing new, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's--we're talking about the '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: Talking about the '50s [1950s], you know.  I mean education has always been something that, that my parents valued.  So -- and I, I do not know what it was, but something made them make that decision of they would not send their children to public schools.
Story_ID: 14928
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, did you like school?  I mean did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I did like it.  I stuttered.  I was a very severe stutterer.  I think it's, who was it?  [Actor] James Earl Jones, he used to stutter.  I, I was a very severe stutterer.  I flunked, I think second or third grade.  And my stuttering was very inhibiting.  I remember studying a lesson and going to school the next day.  And the instructor, the teacher, the sister, the nun, calling on me. And I stood up to read it, you know, "The ball--" you know, what it said was, "The ball rolled down the hill".  I looked at it.  And I knew what the words were, but because I stuttered, I said, "Te, te, te, te, the ba, ba, ba, ball."  And it made it--the teacher looked upon that as, "Oh, he doesn't know what the words are.  He didn't study."  She didn't acknowledge or accept the fact that I was stuttering.  And that, you know what it is, it's just that you stutter.  She looked at me, and said, "Wayne, sit down.  You get an F for the day."  So I remember sitting down and then she called on a little boy in back of me, Billy.  And she called on Billy, and Billy, "The, ball, rolled--"  And I'm sitting there thinking, "The ball rolled down the hill, stupid.  Why don't you just say it?"  You know, but that happened enough times where, and I remember consciously saying, "Why study?"  You know, "If I'm going to get an F anyway, why study?"  So I pretty much made a conscious decision to back away, out of formal education.  You know, my parents, they sent me to the best school, but because of my stuttering, and no one was working with me at the school, you know, I backed away from it.  Now my mother [Fayette LaCroix Watson], she realized that my stuttering was becoming a problem, and she sent me to some private tutoring, some private stuttering tutoring at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois]. And it played a very key role.  It did help me quite a bit.  So my memories of elementary school were really ones of being embarrassed because I stuttered when I was in school.  Out of school, stuttering was not looked upon in a negative way, you know.
Speaker 1: So kids didn't make fun of you or anything?
Speaker 2: Not outside of school.  Only in school.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you overcome it?  I mean what were the techniques?
Speaker 2: Well, it was combination of two things.  One is the actual--the classes or the tutoring that I received at Northwestern University. Two was, I was dating a young lady who was very patient with me.  And she would allow me to complete my sentences.  She would not rush me.  She would, you know, she'd be there for me in terms of, you know, not putting me off, and allow me to finish.  So I didn't feel rushed.  And I felt relaxed around her, very key.  You had to feel relaxed around somebody.  Then the third thing is I became very secure in my sport.  I, wrestled in school.  So I became very secure in my sport, and that helped give me some inner security.  So between Northwestern University tutoring, the young lady I was dating, whose name was Cynthia Waters, and three, my wrestling sport, I pretty much overcame it.  And, you know, I stutter today, I still stutter, but you learn to manage it and you speak in a rhythm.  So if, even as I'm talking now, I, talk with a cadence.  I speak in, you know, I talk with a rhythm, a certain rhythm.  People who stutter, if they sing, they will not stutter, you know.  So you pick up little hints like that, you get a rhythm going in your mind.  And you try and talk to that rhythm.
Story_ID: 14929
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea of what the cause of stuttering is or why or what you--?
Speaker 2: You know, just very simplistically, I just think that it's people feeling uncomfortable in a situation or around people.  A lot of people will not stutter.  A lot of people only stutter when they are put in different situations, all right, if they're around someone who they don't feel comfortable with.  Some people have it much, much more serious.  And they can't get their mind--no they can't their, words, their auditory--no, not their auditory, their oral expression to catch up with their mind.  And, they're trying to get in sync with it, you know.  So one's here, and the other one is down here [holds one hand up and one at a lower position].  And what they have to do is get it to flow and get a rhythm, a harmony of both mind and oral expression.  And if you can't get that harmony, one's up and one's down, then you've got the stuttering taking place.  And what I do is, I try and say, "Okay, slow down, slow down, and let's get some, you know, let's get some harmony here," you know.  And if I'm around some, if I am around someone who makes me nervous, I just pause for a second.  Or sometimes I connect with them by touching them on their sleeve or on their arm, you know, giving me a connect to that person.  And sometimes people will look at that and say, "I wonder what's wrong with him, touching, me."  Well, I don't give a damn about the person.  What I'm doing is just really trying to make a connect so I can stop myself from stuttering.  So you just touch somebody on their elbow, touch them on their, their wrist.
Story_ID: 14930
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors in grade school; teachers that tried to help you or people in the community that, you know, tried to help you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my father [Wade A. Watson] and my mother [Fayette LaCroix Watson], of course were great mentors.  My father was a great role model, just unbelievable role model to me and my brother.  My mother provided the nourishment to us, but my father was a role model, you know.  He showed us what a man can be, always proud of him.  So after, my father, then it would come to people like, you know, people who would help you in school, you know.  Father O'Hara at St. Brendan [grammar school, Chicago, Illinois], you know, the priest who helped us out.  A guy named John Woods in Mount Car- at Mount Carmel High School, [Chicago, Illinois] coached the wrestling team.  Ken Kraft, coach of the wrestling team at, Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  Individuals like that would work with you, help you, give you some guidance.  I spent quite a bit of my time-- once I got into high school, my life was pretty much focused on wrestling.  So any adult who came in my life pretty much was associated with the sport, and more specifically, wrestling.
Story_ID: 14931
Speaker 1: So you kind of struggled in grade school, I guess, from what you described?
Speaker 2: Struggled.
Speaker 1: So you attended Mount Carmel [High School, Chicago, Illinois], that's, off Stoney Island [Avenue], right?
Speaker 2: Right off of Stoney on 64th [Street] and Blackstone [Avenue], and struggled at, Mount Carmel academically.  I did not finally start achieving academically until I got, until I attended Joliet Junior College [Joliet, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I don't want to jump there yet so let's talk about high school, about Mount Carmel.  Now, this is an all-boy's Catholic school, and known for football basically.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Well, that's the popular culture notion of it, football, but you see them practicing out in the park, out in Jackson Park, you know. What was Mount Carmel like?  Were you--did you like the idea of going to Catholic school at this point or--?
Speaker 2: I went to Mount Carmel simply because a guy named Greg, Gregory Morris, he was on our basketball team in grammar school, I heard him one day say he was going to Mount Carmel High School.  I didn't know where I was going.  So I said, well, "Greg is smart.  He's a good basketball player.  If he's going to Mount Carmel, why don't I go?"  That simple.  Peer influence.  One of the better decisions I made or I brought it home to my parents.  My parents said, "Okay, you want to go?  We'll send you."  Because --but anyway, so I went to Mount Carmel because of something I overheard someone say.  Very fortunate for me because I got involved in a sport [wrestling] that I could excel in.  If I had not excelled in that sport, I don't know where I'd be because that sport is what opened different doors for me, not just doors of opportunity, but doors of security, doors of self-confidence, doors of independence, doors of confidence, you know, because if I had gone to another school, I may not have been able to excel in a sport.  Wrestling is a sport that a small per- a person of small stature can excel in.  I'm sure, you know, there'd be very limited opportunity for me to excel in basketball or football.  I could, but the opportunities are less.  In wrestling, you're wrestling somebody who's at your weight class.  So now it's just whether or not you can deal with that.  So I went to Mount Carmel and, it worked out for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, I guess Literature and it, you know, it's--I had an English teacher called Mr. Fritz.  He would bring it to life, you know.  I was still suffering from some self-confidence at Mount Carmel High School because of what I expereineced in grammar school.  So I was not a strong student at Mount Carmel.  I was a C student, and I was struggling, you know.
Story_ID: 14932
Speaker 1: Now, did your family have a--did you go to church and stuff or were you--did you have a--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: When you go to Catholic school [Mount Carmel High School, Chicago, Illinois], you go to Catholic Church--
Speaker 1: But your family didn't go--
Speaker 2: Nah, the family didn't go.  I would go to church.  My brother [Wade Watson] would go to church.  No, my mother [Fayette LaCroix Watson] and father [Wade H. Watson] and my--no, they were home.  My mother would be home cooking breakfast.  My father would be doing something around the house or probably working.  My father worked two jobs all his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never did he not work two jobs.  And that's not a full time and part time.  That was a full time and full time.
Speaker 1: And so two full-time jobs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, boy, yeah, that's a lot of work.

Speaker 1: So, you said, you liked Literature better than any of the other courses you were in, and you were kind of struggling in high school [Mount Carmel High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Now, how was your social life in high school?  Did you get involved and go to many social events and--?
Speaker 2: Wrestling pretty much consumed my life, you know, the one young lady that I was dating, you know, she helped me get over my stuttering.  That was my social life.  It was primarily Cynthia Waters and for a period of time, I was dating a young lady named Barbara Allen, you know, very nice young lady.  So it was those two young ladies throughout my four years of, high school.
Speaker 1: Did they live in the neighborhood or were they--?
Speaker 2: No--yes, Cynthia lived in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: I know Mount Carmel was like an all-boy's school, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Cynthia lived in the neighborhood.  She lived one block over.  And I met her through--well, everybody knew of Cynthia.  She was the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood.  And no one was allowed to talk to her because her father was just, you know, he'd rip your head off.  And I was out walking my dog, I had a German Shepherd.  And his dog ran off the porch at my dog. It was a, like a Boxer.  And it came at my dog, and the two of them went at each other.  Well, at that time, if you remember--well, anyway.  I pulled my dog back cause I didn't want them to fight.  But they went at each other.  So finally--I was a wrestler, and, you know, didn't have--I was like seventeen, eighteen years of age, so I didn't have--I wasn't thinking too well.  I jumped down and got into a fight with the dogs (laughter).  And I'm trying to pull them apart.  And I was pretty strong at that age.  I grabbed my dog by his collar, and that dog by his collar, and actually separated them apart.  And when I did that, the Boxer, the other dog turned his head--and, of course, being I got him by his collar, that dog just reached down and just bites me.  And he bit me, and I've got the scar today.  And, and he grabbed my wrist, and when he grabbed my wrist, I let my dog go.  And then my dog tore into his dog.  And so, you know, her father came down and helped separate the dogs.  So I went home.  The next day her brother came around to my house, and said, "My daddy wants to see you."  "Okay."  And it's the weirdest thing.  Her daddy came around--I went around to around to her, her Daddy.  He met me at the front door.  He said, "Anybody that's crazy enough to fight my dog is good enough to meet my daughter."  It was that kind of a statement.  And I like, you know, what is it that I do not understand here, you know (laughter).  I'm seventeen, eighteen but I said, if that's the entrée to get into this house to meet Cynthia, you know--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd never think that the way to a female's heart is through fighting her daddy's dog (laughter)
Speaker 2: Hey, it worked.  Her father and I became the best of friends.  She and I became the absolute best of friends.  She's still someone very special in my life today.  And there's a little love story.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.  That's an unusual story.
Speaker 2: Very unusual, very unusual.
Story_ID: 14934
Speaker 1: So, well, I take it that you didn't like run for high school offices and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I was trouble.  Either I was in wrestling or I was in trouble [laughs].
Speaker 1: Well, how'd you do on the wrestling team?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I excelled.  I was captain of the team.  I went to the final Olympic trials in New York.  I went to college and wrestled in college.
Speaker 1: This is '64 [1964] Olympic trials?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The one that ended up in Tokyo [Japan], I think, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I didn't make it to Tokyo.  I made it to the final trials in New York.  I placed probably about eighth or something in the final trials, as a senior in high school.  And it was in New York where the coach--where different coaches approached me and said, "Hey, you want to go to college?"  And I really was not that interested.  My father [Wade H. Watson], he came over and talked with them.  And what they decided to do was send me to Joliet Junior College [Joliet, Illinois].  That's outside of Chicago [Illinois], but they were like a wrestling powerhouse throughout the nation.  So I went to Joliet Junior College and wrestled there for two years, took first in the nation, you know, my first year, broke my rib my second year.  I ended up taking, I think it was third or fourth in the nation, I don't remember.  Second, third or fourth, I didn't take first.  I broke my rib.  And then I went on to Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], wrestled there and took second in the Big Ten [collegiate conference]; started focusing on, academics than sports and kind of lost my focus on, the sport.
Story_ID: 14935
Speaker 1: What academic discipline drew you, you know, to it?
Speaker 2: Drew me to?
Speaker 1: Yeah, to, I mean what academic course of study were you drawn to?
Speaker 2: I'd wanted to be a doctor, you know, once I realized that I did have the ability, but a number of things just sidetracked me.  You know, just--I broke a number of bones and, you know, you were always healing.  You were always in a situation of, not being able to focus the way you needed to focus.  I was at a weight class where it required one to not eat.  So I was putting a lot of energy there, more than I should have, maybe sometimes in relationship to my studies.  But then once I really started clicking with my studies, I started putting more in my studies than on my sports.  I never really got a good harmony of both where I could excel in both.  But--
Speaker 1: So when you became a better student, you became less of an athlete, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, became an average, a less focused athlete.
Speaker 1: And wrestling is like track or boxing.  You have to maintain a certain level of personal discipline--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in order to excel.
Speaker 2: It's unbelievable, unbelievable.
Speaker 1: You have to watch your weight and all that sort of thing.  Yeah, and practice all the time.
Speaker 2: You're always practicing.  You're always losing weight.  You always have a broken bone or a stretched muscle or, you know--I remember dating Cynthia Waters at the time.  I had gone off to a tournament.  And so I hadn't seen her in like three days, and she ran down the stairs to see me.  I'd been off wrestling for three days.  And when she opened up the door, she just cried.  I had black eyes, busted lips, you know.  She looked at me.  She said, "What did they do to you?"  And what happens in wrestling, if you're tournament, whoever wrestles three days, the person at the end of the tournament who takes first, they're going to be beat up pretty bad because each you wrestle is going to either get one lick in on you.  So, but, so the, accumulation of injuries looks pretty bad after three days.  And that's what she saw.  I won the tournament.  But how--
Speaker 1: You looked like you lost.
Speaker 2: --my face looks like, looks like a piece of raw meat.  I remember, you know, I knew the taste of blood better than I knew the taste of meat or the taste of a sandwich because my mouth was always cut up.  My mouth was always, you know, I always had blood in, you know, of some kind in my mouth.  So the taste of blood literally was a, taste that I was very familiar with.
Story_ID: 14936
Speaker 1: So, now, what did you think of Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  Now, you were at Joliet Junior College [Joliet, Illinois].  Was Northwestern--I mean that's a, big time, Big Ten [collegiate conference] school, high academic--?
Speaker 2: High academics.  I had an excellent [wrestling] coach, a guy named Ken Kraft.  He helped me as--you know, I owe so much to him.  And a guy named William Inafeld (ph.) helped me get in.  He was the Admissions Director.  He was, eventually became the Vice President of Northwestern University.  So those two individuals helped me quite a bit.  And I applied myself, you know.  And it's Big Ten, but I'm the classic success story, you might say, a kid who comes out of the ghetto, a kid who was not strong academically.  I went to Northwestern and my first semester, I think I had a B average.  And I was taking Anatomy and Physiology.  I was taking the tough courses.  But I just applied myself.  And I am not--my aptitude is not one that is going to go off the scale when it comes to ACT [American College Test] and SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] scores.  But I'm the type that I have skills, I have an ability, but I apply myself.  I'm extremely creative.  And that's what got me through Northwestern.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you major in at Northwestern?
Speaker 2: I think I first started out in Pre-Med, you know, but then I changed and went into, I think, Health, Physical Education and Health in undergraduate school.  And then graduate school, I ended up going into, I think it was Masters of Arts in Social Science, called an MAT [Master of Arts in Teaching] program, and then the Doctorate was a PhD in Education Administration.
Story_ID: 14937
Speaker 1: Now, tell me how did you--I mean here's someone that at one time, in high school [Mount Carmel High School, Chicago, Illinois], you didn't know if you wanted to go to college or would go to college.  And now, you're in school and you decide to stay in for a Master's or stay in for Ph.D., and you went straight through in a way, right?
Speaker 2: Well, not, yeah, I did go straight through, but once again, being in the right place at the right time, having some people looking out for you.  My senior year, I had missed the Olympic Games because I was involved in my senior year studies and I was not able to really get myself together to, try out for them.  So I think it was in nineteen six--the next year were the World Games, '69 [1969] I think it was.  And I was out in San Bernardino, California working (unclear) wrestling.  And we were pretty much getting ready for the World Games--see who would represent the United States in the World Games.  And I got a phone call while I was out there in San Bernardino from Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  You know, I was just graduating.  And they basically asked me, they said, "Wayne, we understand that you're considering going to the World Games and that we'll, you know, take you out of Northwestern for a year or so.  Have you considered going to graduate school?"  And I had considered, but I didn't have any money.  And so I got a call while I was right in the middle of the World Games tryouts and they said, "We'd like for you to go to Northwestern Graduate School.  And we have a scholarship for you to work on your Masters and Doctorate."  So once again, being in the right place at the right time, having the right people helping you, which a guy named Ken Kraft and another guy named B. J. Chandler.  He was Dean of the School of Education.  And they made it possible for me to go to graduate school.  I, of course, made the decision not to continue the tryouts for the World Games and ended up going to Northwestern Graduate School.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you just--yeah, and that is pretty--that's fortuitous to be able to go straight through like that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A lot of people have to stop and go do something else.
Speaker 2: Oh, I would have never gone back (chuckle) if I had stopped.
Story_ID: 14938
Speaker 1: Well, are there any highlights of your graduate study there [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] to speak of?
Speaker 2: Well, I did quite a bit of oral history, you know, which, which I--my Doctorial dissertation was called 'A Social Science Curriculum Model.'  And it took the anthropological research of oral history and merged it with the, business management of PERT, Program Evaluation Review Technique.  And what it does is, it, then took the third area called Education, and showed how you can take oral history, integrate it into an educational setting in a very systematic way, all right?  And I implemented the model at Evanston High School [Evanston, Illinois], extremely successful model.  A number of people, even today have contacted me and said, "Hey, your book is, your, dissertation is, it's like the foundation.  It's the primer, if you want to do oral history and especially if you want to do oral history and put it into an educational setting."  [Author] Alex Haley somehow found out about it, contacted me.  And then the next four years, hired me to work with him on--not with his book 'Roots,' but in duplicating the effort that the put forth in doing 'Roots' to show that it could be done for African Americans.  So I worked with Alex for about four years.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get involved in oral history in the beginning?  Was it being used--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I think in the black community, we really didn't--it wasn't discussed that much until Alex Haley's book came out and we started about family histories and so forth.
Speaker 2: I started my research in 1969, I think it was, or maybe 1970.  And how did I get involved in that?  You know, I really don't know.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't recall where you first heard about it?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sure if I think about it and after we get off-camera, I probably will, will remember, but for maybe three years of my life, I was totally inundated with oral history.  And what I did was, I did the oral history of Evanston, Illinois, blacks in Evanston.  And if you got to the Evanston Historical Society, you will see the tapes that I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so basically, how did you do it?  What did you interview people for?  Was there a specific time length?
Speaker 2: No, if you were from Evanston, and you were born in the 1800s or early 1900s, I was interviewing you--and if you were black.  And I got people who were born in 1870, 1880, you know, and just got some unbelievable stories, just unbelievable stories.  Got it on tape, transcribed it, integrated it into a dissertation, showed how you can systematically do this utilizing high school kids, you know, because when you utilize high school kids, it becomes so, such a wealth of education and value to them.
Speaker 1: Right, they actually learn as they (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Oh, they learn history.  They learn to read.  They learn to write, you know, they learn to listen well.  They learn to raise questions. Oral history teaches you all of that.
Story_ID: 14939
Speaker 1: Okay, now, [author] Alex Haley, tell us about Alex Haley, though.  What kind of person was Alex Haley?
Speaker 2: The best--the best storyteller to ever live probably.  Alex could mesmerize you, just mesmerize you with a story, you know.  He would tell a story about Althea Gibson, you know, the track runner, who would run, he would, you know.  He would tell a story about just different, common-day things, but he knew how to draw it and describe it for you.  And when he finished, you were like sitting on the edge of your chair, you know.  So, I was would spend many, many a nights with Alex in New York, you know, you know.  We would be doing research or helping him develop the model, paralleling what he was doing with the book 'Roots.'  But he, Alex was a good guy, very sincere, a very sincere person.
Story_ID: 14940
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any--is there a story or stories that you remember concerning people who had, I guess, whose lives were changed by, you know, oral history research, I mean who--when Alex Haley's book 'Roots' came out, it shook up the black community.  A lot of people had tried to bury their past because they saw it as, rooted in slavery and in embarrassing situations and demeaning conditions, and they didn't want to go over that.  So a lot of parents who came out of slavery didn't pass down the stories to their children about what happened.  So consequently, a lot of people didn't know.  A lot of broken families involved in the black experience from reconstruction on, too, which makes it even harder to trace where you come from and what you do.  So, are there some stories of, you know, transformation that people experienced after--?
Speaker 2: Well, the students who worked with me when I did my research, all their lives were, were definitely touched and transformed because one thing that oral history does, it teaches you to value your elder.  You have a great appreciation for older people because you realize the repository of knowledge, wisdom that they have, and experiences, you know.  So all of the students that worked with, me, when I see them today, they're, you know, they're now in their 40s and 50s, you know.  They will say, "Hey, you know, I remember that project we worked on.  Wow, you know, that was really--" you know.  So, that's an example.  It transformed me.  It helped make me the person I am today.
Story_ID: 14941
Speaker 1: What do you think is the most, I guess, significant lesson out of the history of our people that, changes us in a positive, you know, in a--I don't know if understand--do you understand the question?  I'm trying to say what is the most, I guess instructional, what's the core of instruction to come down of our experience as a people when you really look back.
Speaker 2: Struggle, struggle, lack of appreciation.  This country has never appreciated black people, never, even today.  Black people have had to struggle.  It is my firm belief that, regrettably, (stressed) regrettably, black people are the most humane and loving people that there is, but this country has never accepted black people.  And I'm talking in general, you know.  Sure, it accepts the [U.S. Secretary of State] Colin Powells.  It accepts the Wayne Watson, you know.  It accepts the [Mayor] Harold Washington [of Chicago, Illinois], you know.  It accepts, you know, individuals, but as a whole, if you're black, you're going to struggle.  Be ready for a fight, be ready for a struggle.
Story_ID: 14942
Speaker 1: So, well, after you received your PhD, well, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I went down South to teach at Shaw University, taught down there for about three years.  And it was a good, you know, it was a good experience teaching at a black college.
Speaker 1: Shaw University is in--?
Speaker 2: Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Raleigh, North Carolina, and I think, if I'm not wrong, I think that Dr. Ben (unclear) was down as a visiting professor--.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Dr. Ben, Yosef Ben-Jochannan.  He was at Shaw.
Speaker 2: He had been before me.
Speaker 1: Maybe before, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He was probably--and I, I know who you are speaking of, but he was before me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, how'd you like life as a professor?
Speaker 2: Oh, I enjoyed it.  You know, I enjoyed teaching, something I look forward to getting back to doing.  It's a, good life, it's a good life.
Speaker 1: And North Carolina, I guess, at the time was in kind of a state of transition, you know, having just desegregated some things and I suppose.  Did you--I mean how did you find life in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was the 1970s.  I was pretty much in a bell jar you might say.  I was pretty much confined to the university.  So, you had a black college in an historic--you had a historic black college, so all your life is there.  So I really did not get involved that much in the state of North Carolina or the city of Raleigh.  My time was spent dealing with my students and really became, you know--all my energies were inside the university.
Story_ID: 14943
Speaker 1: Did you notice a difference between the South and, you know, coming from Chicago [Illinois], and, you know, did you notice striking differences?
Speaker 2: Other than the geography and the beauty of it, you know.  Once again, I was really insulated, you know.  I would get up in the morning.  I'd go to the college [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], spend twelve hours a day, come back.  I was very, very much insulated.  It was not until I, decided to learn how to fly.  And I was going out to the airport.  Then I started getting more into the environment of North Carolina, you know.  And I learned that, you know--because I became a pilot when I was down in, Raleigh, North Carolina.  And then I started saying, "Okay, I'm in the South," you know.  Black people are not supposed to be flying these planes, you know.  And I started seeing that, contrast.
Story_ID: 14944
Speaker 1: Okay, did you--well, were people shocked that you were flying down there or they were--?
Speaker 2: Well, we started a black airline company, you know.  I was with a guy named Warren Wheeler.  He started a company called Wheeler Flying Service and hired me to be the General Manager.  So I left the university [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and went to manage this airline company.  And at that time it was the only black airline company in the United States.  And we were hiring black pilots and white pilots.  And it was going pretty well, up until [U.S. President Ronald] Reagan decided to deregulate the airline industry.  And he killed all of the small airlines.
Speaker 1: Now, what services did you all offer?  Did you offer passenger service?
Speaker 2: Passenger service, mail service, courier service, charter service.  We had about four different divisions, and I ran all four.
Speaker 1: And how many planes did you have?
Speaker 2: I think we probably got up to maybe sixteen planes at one time, you know, carrying about three thousand to four thousand passengers a month, flying checks between different Federal Reserves at nighttime.  Doing charter flights.  We did a lot of flights for Burroughs Wellcome [foundation], IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  I remember we flew Mrs. Watson, the gentleman who founded IBM [Thomas Watson], we flew his wife a couple of times.  And I remember myself taking a couple of flights up to--I don't want to call it, maybe it was Poughkeepsie, New York.  You know, I would only fly when we ran out of pilots and there was a problem.  And I'd jump a plane and fly something.  Normally, I would just be the General Manager.  And, you know, then I started seeing, in reference to your earlier question, the difference between the South and North, when I started running the company.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what did you see?
Speaker 2: It was just obvious, you know.  You'd have passengers walk off the plane when they walked up and saw a black pilot, you know.  Then we started realizing we need to mask the fact that this is a black company, you know, and let them think that the company is owned by white individuals and put some white pilots up there in the seat.  Let a white pilot sit in the left seat and the black pilot in the right seat.  Do all kinds of things because, you know, we were in the South.  But then again, you know, to the credit of a number of individuals, you know, some individuals didn't care.  They just wanted to get from point A to Point B.  They didn't care who was flying the plane.  But the South was, you know, back in 1970, the South was the South and is the, South.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a remarkable enterprise, you know, with--what your largest plane?
Speaker 2: Oh, Beech 99.
Speaker 1: And that would be, to a layman who doesn't know?
Speaker 2: Maybe seventeen, nineteen seater, flew Otters.  It was a big plane.  Flew like a, bowling ball, real slow (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did that until 1977?
Speaker 2: I'd say about 1978, '77 [1977], something like that.
Story_ID: 14945
Speaker 1: Okay, then you went to a place called Boggs Academy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Boggs Academy.
Speaker 1: Now, where is that?
Speaker 2: That's a school located in Georgia, right outside of--it's Keysville, Georgia.  And I was Head Master of, that school for a while, and it didn't last long.  I decided that--
Speaker 1: Is this like a grade school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: High school, private high school for black kids.  [U.S. President Ronald] Reagan was deregulating.  I wanted to get out of the airline industry, get back into education which was my real love anyway.  And I loved flying, but, you know, there were a number of challenges getting ready to come down the pipe.  And so I went to Boggs.  And I lasted there maybe six months to eight months at, at most (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I decided to do an audit.  And the Chairman of the Board told me not to do an audit.  And so I brought some friends in and said, you know, "I need to find out what money we've got."  So we did an audit; called the Chairman of the Board up, a guy named--what was his name?  Reynolds.  He was over a bank in Norfolk, Virginia, Bill Reyno- no, not Bill.  Frank Reynolds something like that.  But he had told me not to do an audit.  So we ended up doing an audit anyway.  I didn't charge the academy.  I had some friends who were accountants, and found that there was a considerable amount of money that could not be accounted for.  So I called him, really somewhat innocent, saying, "Hey, just completed this audit, and guess what?  There's some money missing."  And he said, "What are you talking about?  I thought I told you not to do an audit."  I said, "Well, you know, I did this audit."  And he said, "Well, have you told anybody?"  I said, "No.  I'm calling you."  And he said, "Well, don't tell anybody.  I'll get back to you tomorrow."  Well, you know, I was married at that time.  We went to bed that night at about nine thirty, living in the deep South.  About eleven o'clock, the grounds person came and woke me up.  He said, "Dr. Watson, wake up, please come quick."  I said, "What's wrong?"  He said, "The business office is on fire."  This was a cinderblock business office.  It burned to the ground.  It was on fire.  The--it turns out that either the Police Chief or the Fire Chief, somebody from the town was on the board.  And the Chairman of the Board was from Norfolk [Virginia], and there were about seven to nine people somehow, some way, they had been dealing with the money.  Somehow, some way, it took that fire department a whole, real long time to get there to put out that fire.  So I said, "You know, I guess it's time for me to retire from this job."  So I left and came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's quite the story (laughter).  I think we knew the rest of the story before you even explain it.  The office is on fire.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 14946
Speaker 1: But, so, had you made contact with people in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I just came to Chic- I just came home, moved home and ran into a guy named Harold Pates [President, City Colleges Of Chicago].  You know, Harold?
Speaker 1: Harold Pates, right.
Speaker 2: I said, Harold, you know, I'm looking for a job.  He recommended I apply to the City Colleges of Chicago.  I applied.  And called up, asked to talk to Oscar Shabbat, the then Chancellor.  His secretary said, "Well, you--no one talks to the Chancellor.  You want to talk to the Personnel office."  I said, "Well, yeah, I'd like to."  She said, "No, no, no."  I said, "Well, I'm going to send my resume."  She said, "He won't see it.  We're going to send it to the Personnel office."  I said, "I'll send it anyway."  So I sent it.  Two days later, I got a call saying, "Hold on, Chancellor Shabbat wants to talk to you."  Oscar had brought me in, and Oscar said, "Hey, I want to talk to you."  And I said, "Well, what day next week?"  He said, "I want see you tomorrow morning."  He brought me in the very next day, interviewed me for two hours, hired me on the spot.  I came in at about the lowest paying job in this District.  And the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, your career with City Colleges begins at Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Malcolm X College.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1978, right?  So what did you first at Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: I think I was Coordinator, Assistant--no, Assistant Director of AIDP or some, kind of little federal grant, making sixteen thousand [dollars] a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so then you moved up.  By 1980, you were Vice President of Instructional Services, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know, was I-- is it?
Speaker 1: That's what it says here (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, in 1980, Vice President of Instruction.  And, yes, at Malcolm X.
Story_ID: 14947
Speaker 1: How did you like Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois]?  Now, Malcolm X had an interesting history.  A lot of people in the country, at one time didn't believe there was a school named Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Malcolm X had a very rich history.  It was prior to my coming.  When I was there, Malcolm X was in the throws of just trying to establish itself as being a strong academic institution that had strong health programs.  And that's what I focused on.  But it had a very, very strong, rich history.
Speaker 1: I think the founding President was Hurst, Charles Hurst.
Speaker 2: Hurst, yes, Charles Hurst.
Speaker 1: Right, he became a national spokesman.  I guess he kind of shook up the establishment on one hand, but then was, was in support of [U.S. President] Richard Nixon on the other hand, which was kind of strange.  A lot of the black organizations, professional organizations, seemed to be founded at Malcolm X.  I believe the African American Police League, (unclear) you know, founded the League there. Like [civil activist, Edward] Buzz Palmer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And [civil rights activist] Renault Robinson.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean so it's a long history of Malcolm X, and as I said, people in those days didn't believe a school was named after Malcolm X (laughs) for a while until they came to Chicago and saw it.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Story_ID: 14948
Speaker 1: Well, City Colleges of Chicago [Illinois]--so you're working with Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] and I know that you have been involved with community activities for a long time in various ways.  And I know in '83 [1983], you helped with the [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington campaign.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was with Harold quite a bit, helped him and, you know, learned a lot.  It was fun being part of a movement.  It speaks for itself.  You know, Harold became Mayor, and Chicago started its transition.
Speaker 1: So any other community activity you want to talk about?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.  Probably when I finish this interview, I'll say, "Oops, I was involved--."  You know, I was involved in quite a number of things in the community.  My--that's my foundation.
Speaker 1: Right, you're well known in the community.  You're involved in things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that's, that's from whence I come.  Very few brothers or sisters in my age group or even the generation before me, on the South Side, that I do not know.  You know, most of them I know from some type of involvement.  I guess it's selective amnesia right now that I'm suffering from.  I just don't remember, you know.  Put three or four of us together and we'll start talking and say, "Oh, yeah, remember this, remember this."  But quite a, you know, quite a bit of involvement.
Story_ID: 14949
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of City Colleges, City College have gone through, City Colleges of Chicago [Illinois] have gone through quite a number of changes and controversies, you know, during the time that you've been there.  And I know, activists have focused on City Colleges a number of times for different reasons.  You want to--do you remember any of the crises?
Speaker 2: Help me remember some of them, and I can--
Speaker 1: Well, some of them, I saw, I mean the details to me right now are obscure, but I remember the late James Cage used to, monitor City Colleges (laughs).  He used come to a lot of meetings.  He was a, you know, he didn't work for City Colleges, but he used to come.
Speaker 2: I wonder what the--I don't remember that it was about.
Speaker 1: Various things I can't--
Speaker 2: Because the City Colleges of Chicago is that educational institution that is a primary portal for black people to enter the higher education, City Colleges of Chicago will be at, the core--we'll be in the middle of a lot of controversy because people want access to it.  People want to be able to get in, you know.  One of my roles, one of my primary roles is to make sure that access is available, that if you are black, if you are brown, if--you know, if you're Asian, that you have that access, you know.  As well as the larger society, meaning white society, you know, that they have access.  But I think that that's where quite a bit of the controversy was around in terms of, you know, who was going to run Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois]?  Who was going to run Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois]?  Will we have access to it?  And so I can imagine there was quite a bit of controversy.
Speaker 1: Well, City Colleges in Chicago play a key role, I know, both key academic role in the community (unclear).  The colleges seem to be utilized quite a bit as community resources people, you know, go to the colleges for recreation, public programs quite a bit.  The space is rented out or utilized--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, the City Colleges of Chicago, one, we are the largest urban community college in American, 160,000 students.  Two, the--to imagine this city without a community college.  We started in 1911.  If this City College did not exist in this city, the racism, the bigotry, the sexism would be multiplied tenfold, okay, tenfold.  This community college has made it possible for people to leave the ghetto, people to leave a desperate situation and achieve a quality life.  You just--this would not be the great city it is if this community college did not exist here.  If we're doing 160,000 a year, imagine how many people that this community college has touched.  All right.  Its impact is major.  Just Malcolm X College alone with its health programs, you cannot go into a hospital in Chicago right now and I would say one out of five people who touch you, who is med-lab technician, respiratory therapist, renal nephrology, physician assistant, nutritionist, radiologist, nurse, one out of five, if not higher, are going to be from the City Colleges of Chicago.  And that's an, that's an impact.
Story_ID: 14950
Speaker 1: What's the biggest challenge facing you running the City Colleges of Chicago [Illinois]?  Now, you were President at Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois] and at--?
Speaker 2: Harold Washington [College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Harold Washington College.
Speaker 2: What's been the biggest challenge for you in dealing with administration (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Money, you know.  The, United States is facing what I believe--some people say it's a recession, you know.  I believe we're in a depression, you know.  But then again, it's hard to tell from the black community's side because black people pretty much always are in a depression economically in terms of the unemployment rate, if you just look at the unemployment rate only.  But I believe that is country is facing a major, major fiscal challenge.  This--City Colleges, my institution, is facing an absolute financial crisis.  The money, the dollars, the revenue is not there.  And it's at a point--it comes to us at a time when our enrollment is going up, and the dollars are going down.  And I'm fighting right now, and doing everything I can to ensure that our direct service to students is continued, it's maintained, that we--even though we're losing money, that we do not take teachers out of the classroom, that we are able to continue to provide quality instructors.  So it's a challenge right now.
Story_ID: 14951
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, one area I guess I know some detail about is Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois], which has been, I guess, the subject of speculation in terms of its future, the building it's in right now has been, I guess, is in bad shape, I guess.  And it's, the infrastructure is messed up.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: A new Kennedy-King College is in the--has been on the drawing boards and in the planning stages but it hasn't materialized yet.  Is it a money--?
Speaker 2: No, there is money for that.  [Chicago] Mayor [Richard] Daley, to his great credit, he has--he's put forth the vision for that college, to put it on 63rd [Street] and Halsted [Street].  He ensured that there are dollars.  What we're doing, going through right now is just the logistics of building a school.  You're going to see something very soon, within the--probably the next two or three months, that's going to show what the new school's going to look like.  This has been a very painstaking task.  But that school will be built.  And it will be on 63rd and Halsted.  And the community will benefit greatly from it.
Speaker 1: Now, the new Kennedy-King has been put out there by people who, and various kinds of people, as an anchor for--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --development in Englewood [neighborhood, Chicago's South Side], which is one of the most depressed communities in the city.
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And is it fair that a City College be considered an anchor for development?
Speaker 2: I can't think of a better anchor.  It's just as fair as to use the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or--on the Southeast side or DePaul University [Chicago, Illinois] on the North side as an anchor.  Those are anchors for communities.  City Colleges of Chicago, it is a community college.  It can be an excellent anchor.  It's more of an anchor than these universities because the universities, 70 percent of their students or more, don't even live in the community.  They go home every summer.  City College students, they live in the community, 99 percent of them.  That is an anchor.  So not only is the institution an anchor, but the students are, are an anchor, because they live there.  I think it is very fair, very appropriate.  And that was the Mayor's [Richard Daley's] concept, you know, that was his vision, that City Colleges of Chicago-- no, that Kennedy-King College will be an anchor on 63rd Street.  You know, history is going to come and go and people will give credit to a lot of different people, all right.  By the time this thing is shown, people, you know, I will probably be out of this chair, you know, ten, fifteen years from now.  But the record needs to be told.  That guy, Richard Daley, the current Mayor, had the vision.  Now, I was very blessed and fortunate to work with him on it, you know.  And he allowed me to put my vision into it also.  But I got to get credit where credit is.  He's the one who thought of putting it on 63rd Street.  And he wanted it to be an anchor.
Speaker 1: Now, there are some community fears about gentrification of the area, you know, and people that currently live there, living -- who are currently living there now are afraid and it's been publicized in the news and so forth and community leaders, they vocalize this, that they're afraid that the city, you know, the city buys up their property, build a new Kennedy-King and the new residents will not be the same pool of people.
Speaker 2: Not--Kennedy-King College bought up businesses.  We didn't buy up personal property.  I think twelve people may have lost their house at most, all right.  No, we bought businesses on 63rd and 64th [St.] and Halsted [St.].  So no--very, very few people were displaced, very few.  So that's not true.  That's the rumor.
Speaker 1: It's true for some.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: But a small number you think.
Speaker 2: Oh, and, you know, and I'm probably exaggerating when I say twelve because as I'm saying it, I'm thinking, well, no.  I think it was only six or seven homes.  We're right there on 63rd and Halsted.  You don't know of any--are there any homes there on 63rd and Halsted?  No.  That's what we bought up.
Story_ID: 14952
Speaker 1: But, you know, we were just saying, off-camera, this is a really difficult situation, development is in Englewood [neighborhood on Chicago, Illinois' South Side.]  And so many hopes are being laid on this new community college [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] [unclear].
Speaker 2: The community college that will be the anchor and it will also be the catalyst for change.  I mean this is--education is the answer, period, period.  You, know, you cannot--there are not enough jails to put people into to try and change Englewood.  That's not the way to do it.  You do it through education.
Speaker 1: They're trying to build enough now (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they may be trying to, but that's not going to work.  But they need to just continue to try.  If one does not improve the educational system, then, in terms of the elementary, high school and place a strong community college, it's not going to turn.  It's not going to turn around.  The answer is simple.  It's not complicated.
Story_ID: 14953
Speaker 1: Now, is there--it seems to me that enrollment has picked up in City Colleges [of Chicago, Illinois]--.
Speaker 2: And we've had about an 8 to 10 percent enrollment increase in the college credit courses.  We could experience the same kind of enrollment increase in our Adult Education GED [General Equivalency Diploma], ESL [English as a Second Language].  It's just that we don't have the kind of State funding that we need.
Speaker 1: Okay, it seems that people in the communities who are served by City Colleges often misunderstand the opportunity for some reason.  They--it's, the City College, in some instances, ends up exploited like the welfare system (unclear) something like that, you know, for a brief fix, you know, you get a stipend of money and then you drop out of school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Well, we stopped that, you know.  Right now, a lot of people used to come to the City Colleges to get a loan, you know, go to school, get a loan, and then drop out.  Well, you don't--we no longer make loans available to students.  Our tuition is of such where you can go to school with a [Federal] Pell Grant and not need to take out a loan, you know.  So there's no need for a loan.  Our tuition is not $150 an hour.  We're only $52 an hour.  So you can make it off of your Pell Grant.  So the rip-off's that were taking place in the '70s [1970s], and, etc. no longer exists; '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s] and maybe even the '90s [1990s], they no longer exist.  Discontinued it.
Speaker 1: Okay, that may account for the renewed vigor at some of the schools.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Very true.
Speaker 1: That and the fear of (unclear)--
Speaker 2: We've raised our, standards, our academic standards here.  You can get a quality education here equal to any university for the first two years now.
Story_ID: 14954
Speaker 1: What's your vision for City Colleges [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] beyond where it is today?  What's your vision?
Speaker 2: Just, you know, to go back to 1911 when William Rainey Harper conceived of the concept of a junior college, a college that would provide the first two years of education, you know, for a university, to go back to that and do an absolute quality job so that if you come to the City Colleges, you can go to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or Michigan University [Ann Arbor, Michigan], which happened to be the first three universities that in 1911, that were articulated with Joliet Junior College [Joliet, Illinois].  That you can go to those universities and enter as junior, all of your college credit be accepted, all right.  That's one dream.  The other part of the dream is, to extend and open that door to the every-day citizen of Chicago so that they can get their GED [General Equivalency Diploma]; so they can get their, their workforce training, you know, if they want to become a welder, if they want to become a physician assistant.  And you can come and just get--and ascertain skills so that you can get a job, not going to college, but just to get a job at the end of a certificate, advanced or Associate of Applied Science, okay.  That's really, you know--so that ultimately, regardless of if you go straight into the work world or if you go into college, we will make that qualitative difference in one's life, that makes a difference, different for someone.  And to--and ultimately to improve the quality of life.  To make America what it's supposed to be: and that is, you know, a country where, regardless of where you were born, regardless of your sex, regardless of your race, you can actually attain to the highest level that your abilities will allow you to, all right.  And it's, it will be your abilities that keep you from doing it and not your environment because right now, this country still has not attained that.  We still are not there.  And that's 2003, 102 years after [author W.E.B.] Dubois wrote, what was it, Dusk of ?
Speaker 1: 'Dusk of Dawn' is one, but--
Speaker 2: --Dawn, yeah, yeah, the 'Dusk of Dawn--'
Speaker 1: It's one-hundredth anniversary of [book] 'Souls of Black Folk.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what it was, 'Souls of Black Folk,' when, when Dubois wrote 'Souls of Black Folk' and he said, "The challenge for the twentieth century will be the question of color."  Well, we're now in the twenty-first century.  We failed miserably in the twentieth century.  Color is still--we finished the century with it as a challenge and we start off the twenty-first century with color being a challenge.  You know.
Speaker 1: Well, he was right about the twentieth century--.
Speaker 2: No, he's right about the twenty-first century.  We still haven't solved it, have we?
Speaker 1: No, no, sir, we haven't. What's the most rewarding part of being a Chancellor of the City Colleges?
Speaker 2: Helping people, just helping people, you know, making a difference in people's lives, taking an institution that is beset with the kind of problems and challenges that it has and turning it around, making a difference.
Story_ID: 14955
Speaker 1: Okay, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community in general?
Speaker 2: That we no longer have to struggle.  You know, it is just so, it's so disheartening to--I still live in--I live on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I live in what is considered the ghetto.  And to--when I go home, I see the young brothers and sisters, and I see the struggle, every day, every day.  People who have jobs that are making significant dollars who have never had to worry about their mortgage payment, have never had to worry about health, have never had to worry about their next meal, you know, 98 percent of them, 98 percent of them have forgotten--or not even forgotten, but they don't empathize, sympathize or feel what it means to not be able to pay your mortgage, be able to get health care or to even worry about where your next meal is going to come from.  They, they don't remember or they don't care.  And that's a very strong statement, but I see more of it than what I want to even accept as a human being.  We are--and that's what's happening to black people in reference to your question.  It's a true challenge.  There are--there's been progress, but the progress is once again, for individuals, you know, the Wayne Watsons of the world, the Jim Reynolds, the Hermine Hartmans, the Earl Neals, the Lester McKeevers, the Terry Hilliards, you know, Terry Petersons, you know, there's progress for individuals.  But the masses, the neighborhood that I live in, we still have 30 percent to 40 percent unemployment rate for young black men between eighteen and twenty-eight years of age. We still have generations that have never had a job longer than a year, family generations.  We still, you know, I can knock on a door within--on my block, and when the door opens, I can smell poverty.  Poverty has a different smell, it has a different scent.  And it has one that, never leaves your nostril.  You know, you walk out of the house, and you just (sniff, sniff) try to clear your nostril, and--your nostrils.  And it just, it's there.  The hope is to wipe out the vision, the scent, the sound and the sight of poverty and struggle.
Story_ID: 14956
Speaker 1: Now, at this juncture in your life, and you're still rather young, what would you consider--
Speaker 2: I don't know what you're looking at?  (Laughter)  But go ahead.  So whoever's watching this thing in the year 2200, yeah, I'm young, right, go ahead (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, at this juncture, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: You know, a buddy of mine went to Vietnam and about 1969, he came home from Vietnam.  He came into my dorm room--my nickname, at that time and is still, Baldy.  "Baldy, Baldy, we won the war!  We won!"  I said, "Rick, what the hell are you talking about, we won the war."  He said, "We won the war."  I said, "Look at the newspaper.  They're over there in Vietnam fighting right now.  What do you mean we won the war?"  He said, "Nah, nah, nah.  You don't understand.  I'm home.  I'm alive. We won the war.  If I'd gotten killed in Vietnam, we would have lost the war; being that I'm home, we won the war."  Well, that always stayed with me.  You know, my biggest legacy is one, that I survived.  I survived.  After that, my children are surviving, and I'm doing everything to make sure that they survive.  Now the question comes after you get past survival at the most basic level, making sure that they have heat, that they have clothes and they have food, the basics, then it's a question of quality of survival.  And once I take care of myself and my three, children, my loved ones, then it's a question of survival of the next concentric circle of my family; my cousins, my brothers, you know.  Then it's the next concentric circle, my friends, you know, making sure they survive.  Then after that, then it's the larger society, you know, and my larger society is my 160,000 students, making sure that they survive in a quality way, you know, and I improve the quality of their life.  So my legacy first starts in a very selfish way. [Author]  Albert Memmi said, you know, "I and Me," you know, "Me and I," you know.  You know, it comes down to the most basic, I survived.  If I don't survive, then nothing else--you know, and then it works its way out.  So, survival and improving the quality of life of each concentric circle around me.  First making sure they get their basics, then making sure I improve the quality of their life.  And quality of life to me is making sure they get the opportunity to walk through that door.  And that's education that provides that opportunity.
Story_ID: 14957
Speaker 1: Okay, this last question is slightly different than the legacy one, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who loved their children, very simple.  I love my children.  I'm very blessed to have had some people in my life, you know, Wade Watson, my son, Keisha Watson, my daughter, Wendy Watson, my daughter, and I'm very blessed to have had a Juanita Moezeek (ph.) who gave me Wendy Watson, a Joy Wat- a Joy Franklin, who gave me Keisha and Wade, you know.  I'm very blessed to have had a Cynthia Waters who helped me when I was coming up, a young lady.  I'm very blessed to have a Willa Morgan as a very close friend in my life.  I'm very blessed to have had my father [Wade H. Watson].  Those are, you know--I'd like to be remembered as, someone who--I'm just blessed, you know, in that, way.  And once again, it starts with my children.  This opportunity with the City College of Chicago [Illinois], you know, I've worked hard for it without a doubt.  I know for a fact that I'm one of the best educators in the United States at the community college level.  But I must also acknowledge that a number of people gave me opportunities to get here.  And a number of individuals, everybody from my [wrestling] Coach John Woods to--in high school [Mount Carmel High School, Chicago, Illinois], [wrestling] Coach Ken Kraft in college [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], to Harold Washington, the [Chicago] Mayor, to a [Chicago Mayor] Richard Daley, who gave me the opportunity to become Chancellor [City Colleges of Chicago].  Those are things one also, you know--you acknowledge those individuals who actually helped you.  Like my daddy once said, "Never go home from the party with someone that didn't bring you."  Understand who brought you to the party.  And so many people forget that.  These people helped me professionally and this group of people, group of individuals helped me personally.  But I'm going to always come back to the basics, my children.  That's my foundation because without them, if I didn't have to continually think of them and be reminded of their love and what they think of me and what I think of them, regardless of the PhD, god knows what I would have become cause there are a lot of people with PhD's who are not successful, who do not have integrity, who do not believe in their own profession.  My children have kept me focused in terms of what I believe in and what I do, which is educate.

Speaker 1: This picture is when I was President of Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois].  And it's, at the--right outside of the childcare center at Kennedy-King College.  As--most of the community colleges [City Colleges of Chicago] have a childcare center available for parents to drop off their children while they go to school.  My favorite place was the childcare center.  I would go probably once a week or twice a week, I'd go over to the childcare center and have lunch with, the kids and really built up a real good relationship with them.
Speaker 2: That's 1995.

I think this was right before we went to the nationals --actually, with the amount of weight I have on me, I think it was after the nationals cause I usually don't carry that much weight (laughter).  So this was either early in the season or late in the season after we'd actually gone to the nationals.  You know something, I know for a fact it was early in the season because I don't have any black eyes or any busted lips.  So this is early in the season.  I had not dropped weight yet, and we were getting some photos out the way.

When I went down South to teach at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], I left Shaw University to help the guy on the far right, Warren Wheeler, start an airline company called Wheeler Airlines.  And I was the General Manager and part-time pilot, you might say, flying whenever there was a pinch.  But it was a good two to three years, a lot of enjoyment.  It was the only black airline company in the United States at that time.  We were carrying about three thousand passengers a month airline.  We did--flew courier checks for the Federal Reserve in the South and then we had a mail--we flew mail, third.  And then the fourth thing we did was charter flights.

She was a person who showed a great deal of patience with me. This is the young lady who I referred to early, her father allowed me to date her because I had an encounter with his, dog.
