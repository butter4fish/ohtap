Speaker 1: Let me ask you a little bit about your mother.  What was her name, or what is her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Dolores Irene Posey Harris.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Silsbee, Texas.
Speaker 1: And she grew up in Silsbee also?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Waco, Texas.  My grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] and grandfather moved from there to Waco, Texas.  My grandmother was a--started out being a domestic person, but she got a college degree at Bishop College, which at that time was in Marshall, Texas, and became a classroom teacher.  She also went on to be the first African American president of the Waco Classroom Teachers Association [Waco, Texas].  And she also was one of the first black and first female principals of an elementary school in Waco, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Bishop College started out in Marshall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Marshall, Texas.
Speaker 1: --but now it is, well it moved to Dallas, Texas and now it's Paul Quinn College, I believe it is.
Speaker 2: And Paul Quinn College was originally in Waco, Texas.  It was in East Waco, Texas, and my mother was a librarian at Paul Quinn College.  When Bishop moved to Dallas and then became defunct, and then Paul Quinn moved from Waco to Dallas on that Bishop College campus.  My grandfather, Roosevelt Posey, was also a student at Bishop College and that's how he and my grandmother met, they were students.  And he was a football player, a celebrated football player at Bishop, and in the yearbook they called him Ironhead Posey [ph.].
Story_ID: 305457
Speaker 1: Well you've told us a little bit about your mother's [Dolores Posey Harris] background and her--her growing up.  Did--does she have any favorite stories that she might have had when she was growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Well one of the favorite stories that she did share with me is the story that I have made into a short story called 'More Than Equal' [ph.].  And it's about a football game in 1965 in Waco, Texas where the Moore High Lions of Waco, Texas, which was the high school [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas] I graduated from in Waco, go to the big city of Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that high school for us that you graduated from?
Speaker 2: Moore, M-O-O-R-E, High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Moore goes to the big city of Houston to play a football game for the state championship.  My grandfather [Roosevelt Posey] was the football coach at Moore High School in the '40s [1940s] and he was co-state champion in 1949 with his Moore High Lions team, and then again in the '50s [1950s].  And one of the stories that my mother tells is that she would go to the football practices and kick the football and kick field goals, and my grandfather would turn to his players and say, "See, my daughter can kick better than you all."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That didn't make the players too happy did it?  It should've given them some motivation.  Did she (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I think it motivated them to--to be better players.  And when he died in the '90s [1990s], several of his state championship football players came from as far as California and all over the country to his funeral.  And it just kind of let me know that teachers really are those that are remembered.  You could be a big celebrity, you could be a millionaire, but teachers have such an impact on the lives of young people.  And in addition to being a football coach, he was a math teacher.
Speaker 1: Are there any football players who might have started out with him that or--well, made some of the national teams or did they go on to be prominent in any field, even football or in mathematics?
Speaker 2: I know that he had some players that did go on to--to do well on some college teams and to become very successful businessmen.
Story_ID: 305458
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Dolores Posey Harris]?
Speaker 2: How I describe my mother is a very beautiful woman, very stylish, younger-looking than her age.  She recently celebrated her seventy-sixth birthday, but the doctors when, you know, she goes to get her physical they write on there that she looks like she, you know, is in her sixties or much younger.  Very stylish.  Always had beautiful shoes and beautiful clothes and just someone that you would--would look up to.
Speaker 1: And where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to Moore High School [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas].  And after she graduated from Moore High School, she--the--the librarian at Moore High School told her that she should go to Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia and thought that would be a good place for her to go to--to be a librarian.  So she got accepted to Spelman and went to Spelman.  And met my father who was Samuel L. Harris [Samuel Harris, Jr.] and he was a student at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], who was also a driver for Benjamin E. Mays, who was one of the first presidents of Morehouse College.  And they met and mar--my father's from Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And after she left Spelman, she went to--where did she and your father settle?
Speaker 2: During that time, when you didn't have a job, you came home.  So she (laughter), she and my father came to Waco, Texas because my mother--my grandfa--[maternal] grandfather [Roosevelt Posey] and [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] were there and working as teachers.  My grandfather did not stay in Waco.  He went to different places to coach in Texas.  He went to Orange, Texas and Port Arthur, Texas as a football coach, and then finally settled in Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause this was in the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: In the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305459
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit more about your father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: He name was Samuel Lawrence Harris, Jr., and he was the son of Samuel Lawrence Harris, Sr., who was a coal miner in Birmingham, Alabama and an electrician, and a very accomplished electrician.  And he helped to wire and built his own house.  At his funeral, the minister said that he had wired the church, which I didn't know, so he (laughter)--they said any time they had any kind of electrical problem they called on my grandfather.
Speaker 1: So he--do you remember the year he passed?
Speaker 2: He passed in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Oh he passed on, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was married to Eleanor Harris, who was my grandfa--grand--my father's mother.  And Eleanor is a college graduate also.  My grandfather [Roosevelt Posey] and grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] on my mother's side are college graduates, and my father's mother graduated from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in Alabama.  And because my grandfather was an electrician, she didn't--she never worked outside of the home.  She was an Avon [Avon Products, Inc.] representative.  And they lived very well.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this was your grandmother on your father's side, and would have been at Tuskegee in the--either the '30s [1930s] or the '40s [sic. 1920s], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I was thinking about the Tuskegee Airmen.  Did she have any stories that she might have shared about her experiences at--Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: She just--just let us know she was a college graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he had one sister, Barbara Harris.  And so my father had two children, two girls, and his sister had a son and a daughter, I'm sorry, his sister had two boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father was kind of a mentor for those two boys and one [Ronnie Glover (ph.)] who's living now in Dallas, Texas, and the other is living in Virginia.  And the one who is in Dallas, Texas is a musician.  He played drums for Johnnie Taylor.  And the one living in Virginia is Claude Glover [ph.] and he is a--retired from the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause Johnnie Taylor just died a few years ago, like 2003 [sic. 2000], somewhere around in there, okay.
Story_ID: 305460
Speaker 1: And you said your father [Samuel Harris, Jr.] was born in Birmingham [Alabama], and he grew up in Birmingham.  Did he have any favorite stories or--that he might have shared with you?
Speaker 2: He just talked about going to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] at a time when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was there and he talked about his experiences with Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays], that he was a strict taskmaster (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).  Did--Dr. Mays was very verbal I could say and very outspoken.  Did he remember any stories or experiences that he might have had when he was chauffeuring him around?
Speaker 2: Just that if he was ever late that Dr. Mays would get him told.  And I remember going to Paschal's Restaurant here in Atlanta [Georgia], which is a historic--an historic place, and seeing Dr. Mays there and Dr. Mays even in his eighties and nineties was sharp, you know, had a sharp memory.  So I would--I would talk to him.  I said well Dr. Harris--"Dr. Mays, I'm Sam Harris' daughter."  He said, "Well what is that boy doing now," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh that was interesting.  'Cause you have in one of the photos that we have here a photo of Dr. Mays and his wife [Sadie Mays].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well during the time that your father was chauffeuring for him?
Speaker 2: Chauffeuring them because they didn't have any children and Dr. Mays kind of looked at my father as a son.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  Did your father have any Morehouse stories that he might have shared with you?
Speaker 2: Just--the Morehouse stories were the getting into the--the class in color in Morehouse.  In Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] there was--you had the light skin and the dark skin at Morehouse and Spelman.  And my father was called black Sam and there was a light-skinned Sam also from the South.  And when they would talk about him, they would say, "Are you talking about black Sam or light Sam?"  But they, you know, now would probably be looked at as derogatory, but they looked at it as just the identifying mechanism.
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause during that time it was very class conscious--I mean it was color conscious at Spelman and Morehouse also.  So Morehouse had their color caste and Spelman had their--their color caste.  What was the racial--did he say anything about the racial of instructors, like the professors?  Were most of his professors white or--?
Speaker 2: Most of 'em were black at that time.
Speaker 1: At that time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they had--oh, okay.
Story_ID: 305461
Speaker 1: And he [Gripper's father, Samuel Harris, Jr.] was on Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --'cause you said that's where he--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he met your mother [Dolores Posey Harris].  Did he have any stories about he and your mother met or--
Speaker 2: None that he shared (laughter).
Speaker 1: --shared with you.  Okay and did your mother have any stories about how they--how they might have met?
Speaker 2: Just that I--I did find a picture which I--they did a--a retrospective of the maroon--Miss Maroon and White of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], which is the queen of Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they did a--an exhibit last year and one of--they went from the '30s [1930s] all the way up to the present.  And I had a couple of friends who were Spelman students who were queens.  So I had gone to see the exhibit to see my friends, but I saw my mother and father in a picture at a dance--at the homecoming dance.  So from what I do remember that they may have met at one of these parties, but it's a beautiful picture of the two of them and you could see my mother very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said that Miss Maroon, is that the coronation?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the queen of Morehouse is called Miss Maroon and White.  And they did a retrospective of the Miss Maroon and Whites and her courts from the '30s [1930s] all the way up to the present, and this exhibit was done during Morehouse's homecoming.
Speaker 1: Is there any significance behind the--the title?
Speaker 2: Maroon and white are the colors of Morehouse, maroon and white.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that gave that to--that title to the--the court--
Speaker 2: To the court--the court.
Speaker 1: --the queen and the court.
Speaker 2: And my mother's roommate was on the court of the--of Miss Maroon and White.  And my mother was at that coronation ball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's very interesting.  So that was--what was the date of birth, what's your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-nine [1929].
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-nine [1929]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, August--August 21, 1929.
Speaker 1: And your father's?
Speaker 2: He was 1927.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-seven [1927], okay.  So they were at Morehouse during the '49 [1949], fif--1950, early, early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: She graduated in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She graduated in '49 [1949].
Story_ID: 305462
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Samuel Harris, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: My father is a person who had some issues.  He was an alcoholic.  He was an accountant.  A brilliant person who went to--graduated from--from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and could do figures and do taxes for people, even with all his issues.  So just a very smart person who was troubled throughout his life.  And his mother, Eleanor Harris, his mother just loved him dearly.  And he and my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] divorced in the '60s [1960s], but I do have some fond memories that one of the things that he did do, which was good, was built a dollhouse for me in my grandmother's backyard and built it as if it was--I mean, probably somebody could've lived in it, it was that big (laughter).  And it had a floor and then we furnished it with all kind of appliances, you know, that you can get from-- for toy appliances and that sort of thing.  So, you know, even with all of his issues, he still was able to--to do some good things.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did he serve in any of the wars?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was in the [U.S.] military.  And I think that could've had something to do with his alcoholism.
Speaker 1: Did he go to the military after Morehouse?
Speaker 2: After Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Was he in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: He wasn't in the ROTC, but he did join the military and he--it was before the Korean War so he didn't--didn't do any active service, but he was in the military.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you remember how long he stayed?
Speaker 2: It was a brief time.
Speaker 1: Okay, like two years or--?
Speaker 2: It seems like about two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305463
Speaker 1: You've told us something--some things about your grandparents.  And your--do you have any stories on your mother's [Dolores Posey Harris] side.  I know you said that your mother's mother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] became a school principal and--in Waco [Texas] and that she had attended Bishop College (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Marshall [Texas].
Speaker 1: --in Marshall.  And--does she have any stories that she might have shared with you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She talked to me about, and I have the tape if I can find it, I interviewed her before she died and just did the oral history.  And she talked to me about her mother, Maddie Welch [ph.], and what a beautiful person she was.  And the fact that her sisters, Ollie and Anna, were people that she was named for and that they tried to keep those names in the family.  And for that reason, I named my youngest son Ellis Nickerson [Ellis Gripper] after her father.  She told me that there was a Welch who was in the Negro League and that he had traveled around and was a pretty good baseball player.  And she talked to me about just some of the hardships that her father had had in trying to take care of his family.  He--I did find a letter from him to her while she was in school where he told her--while she was in college and he told her, "I'm gonna make sure you have money to stay in school."  So education became a value that I really got from my grandmother that you should go to college and your kids should go to college and that's something that--that money should be spent for.  He worked as a waiter in a hotel in Dallas [Texas] and he was a light-skinned gentleman so he was able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay and this was Ellis Nickerson, her--her father.
Speaker 2: Ellis Nickerson, her father.  And that was how he was able to give her money to pay for school.  My [maternal] grandfather on the other hand, Roosevelt Posey--
Speaker 1: Now this was your?
Speaker 2: My--my grandmother's husband did not have parents who could help him.  In fact, my sister [Debra Harris] tells me that his name may not even be Posey.  That his father had gotten into a fight and had to leave town or he would've been lynched and that he came up with the name Posey.
Speaker 1: Now this was in Waco?
Speaker 2: This was in another part of--
Speaker 1: Texas.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305464
Speaker 1: He, my [maternal] grandfather [Roosevelt Posey], told me that the way that he was able to pay his way through Bishop [Bishop College] in Marshall [Texas] was working in the cafeteria as a cook.  And he is an excellent--he was an excellent cook, and that's how he paid his way through school.  They would give him money for tuition and room and board.  And years later when I worked for The Houston Post on a college internship, I stayed with my grandfather in Houston [Texas] and he was teaching me how to cook things that--that--that he could cook and my father [Samuel Harris, Jr.] was also a good cook.  So I have--I come from a family where the men were good cooks.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now Ellis Nickerson, which is your [maternal] great--
Speaker 1: Grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) great, okay your great-grandfather, your mother's mother's [Ollie Nickerson Posey] father, you said he worked at a hotel in Dallas [Texas].  Do--did you remember the name of the hotel?
Speaker 1: I don't remember the name of the hotel, but that was from that letter where he said that he was working in the hotel.  Because he lived in Dallas, but my grandmother and her sisters and her mother, Maddie [Maddie Welch (ph.)], lived in Waxahachie, Texas, which is about an hour or forty minutes from Dallas.  So there was no work in Waxahachie, and he lived in Dallas working at the hotels and he would send his money, you know, home to the family or visit 'em, you know.
Speaker 2: But he and your--he and his wife were still together?
Speaker 1: They were together, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, but he would just go to Dallas and work--
Speaker 1: To work, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, 'cause there were two hotels.  There was a Baker Hotel [Dallas, Texas] and there was the Adolphus Hotel [Dallas, Texas], which were older Dallas hotels.  The Baker Hotel was imploded in the '70s [1970s] or early '80s [1980s] I believe, so it's no longer in existence.  But the Adolphus Hotel is one of the older hotels that's still in Dallas.  So that was the reason I was wondering if it might have been--
Speaker 1: One of those two.
Speaker 2: --one of those historical.
Speaker 1: For some reason the Adolphus sounds familiar.
Speaker 2: Yeah and it's a very ornate hotel, has a lot of history attached to it that might've--that might've been it.  Now did Ellis Nickerson have--he didn't go to school, and that was the reason why he wanted his children to--to have an education?
Speaker 1: But my grandmother was the only one out of the daughters that finished college.  But, her whole thing was that she believed in education, so she put my--put her sister's son through Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and that was the gentleman who did the genealogy who was in the picture with my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] at her seventy-fifth birthday.  So my grandmother paid for him to go to Morehouse.  She also paid for another sister's child to go--to go to college also.  So if you wanted to go to school, my grandmother would pay for it.
Story_ID: 305465
Speaker 1: Did your [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] remember her father's [Ellis Nickerson] father or her father's mother?  Did she have any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She never talked to me about them.
Speaker 1: She never talked to 'em about it?
Speaker 2: She only talked to me about--
Speaker 1: Her father?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and he was--he was born around the 1800s--1880s, so that would be after the Civil War.  But she never mentioned slavery or--or anything like that.  Okay.  Now your great--your father's [Samuel Harris, Jr.] mother and father [Samuel Harris, Sr.] in Birmingham [Alabama], you were telling us about them.  And you said that your father's father was--did you say coal miner and an electrician?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were telling us some stories about him.  Did he--did your father's father remember or tell you about his grandparents or his parents, do you remember any stories?
Speaker 2: Well, I do remember my father's father's mother, who I guess I got my height from her.  She was--they called her little mamma and Little Lanie [ph.], Little Mamma, Little Lanie.  But she was the same height as I am and same complexion, had a slight hole in her ear.  I mean everybody just said we were like mirrors.  And I just remember him just being very obedient and just worshiping his mother.  And he was a very short man with the short mother.  But my grandmother, my father's mother was very tall.  I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: Eleanor.
Speaker 1: Eleanor. And Harris was--
Speaker 2: Eleanor Harris, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know how they met.
Story_ID: 303284
Speaker 1: Now we were talking about your grandmother, your great-grandmother Eleanor [sic.].  So you were telling us about your father's [Samuel Harris, Jr.] memories of his mother.
Speaker 2: Okay, my father's mother was Eleanor Harris.  And his father's mother was Little Mamma [ph.].  And I was--I got to meet her.  She was the same height as me, had a hole in her ear, same color, you know, almost like the same person.  And he was very obedient to Little Mamma.  And she was this--this matriarch of the family, of my father's father's family.  And I think now in Birmingham [Alabama] there's only one person left from Little Mamma's lineage, which is the wife of one of her sons is the only one left now.
Speaker 1: All right, and Eleanor was his--
Speaker 2: His mother.
Speaker 1: --mother, okay.  Now, all of your father's people were from Birmingham, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you had some stories of the Civil Rights Movement and their involvement with it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, their involvement in it.  During the Civil Rights Movement, the adults could not protest or march with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] because they would lose their jobs if they got arrested and didn't come to work they wouldn't have a job.  If they were teaching, and even teaching in a segregated school system, if you did anything protest-wise you would be fired.  Because even though it was a segregated school system, the controls were still in white society.  So, the children were the ones who did the protesting.  And Eleanor's grandson, who is my first cousin, who's the one that played with Johnnie Taylor later in life, was arrested many times as a result of being with Martin Luther King, was beaten.  And in Waco [Texas] I used to watch the 'CBS Evening News' with Walter Cronkite and look at everything that was going on with the Civil Rights Movement, trying to see if I could see my cousin, Ronnie Glover [ph.], and his name was Ronnie Glover.  And he, when I would get a phone call from my grandmother, Eleanor, we would think she was telling us that Ronnie had been killed in the Civil Rights Movement.  So, we felt a--a connection with Martin Luther King because of my cousin Ronnie and what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Did you have a chance to visit Birmingham as a young child?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a child I did visit Birmingham and my grandparents, Eleanor and Samuel Harris [Samuel Harris, Sr.], and my father lived in Ensley [Birmingham, Alabama] on Avenue G in Ensley.
Speaker 1: Now is Ensley a part of this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ensley is a part of Birmingham, and it's an area of Birmingham.  One of the Temp--Temptations lived in Ensley.  So it's a section of Birmingham, the black community.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: E-N-S-L-E-Y, Ensley.
Story_ID: 303285
Speaker 1: What is one of your earliest memories of growing up?  Or just what are some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories are, it sounds strange, but my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] verified it.  That when I was three years old, my mother, who also was a seamstress, she could sew very well.  She made a--a Easter outfit for me, it was a blue coat with a blue hat and a blue dress, and she made this for me.  And I remember standing on the bed and my mother putting this outfit on me.  And I asked her, I said, "Well mother did I dream this?"  And she said--she said, "No, you didn't dream it."  She said, "I did make that blue coat and that blue hat for you when you were three years old," which is amazing to me that I could remember something like that.  And she said, "And you didn't like that hat, you kept taking the hat off," (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you didn't like the hat that your mom had made for you, she said?
Speaker 2: I didn't like the hat.  She said, "You did not like that hat."  But it--it was--that was my fondest memory, well my first memory of growing up in Waco [Texas].  The other memories are of being with my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey], who was a person that went to church [New Hope Baptist Church, Waco, Texas] all the time and she would take me to church with her.  She would take me to funerals.  She would take me to visit people who were ill.  I remember taking food to a lady who was dying of cancer.  She would take me to nursing homes and she would play the piano and sing and have us sing.  And she was also the--the director for our children's choir and she would play for that and have us sing.  So, I also remember being annoyed that she would bring people from the orphanage to our home for dinner, 'cause I was so selfish.  You know, I said, "You got me why do you need to go get people out of the orphanage," you know (laughter).  But years later, that's in me.  You know, to--to be more helpful and to be more loving because that's the way she raised me.
Speaker 1: Now you were the only child for about how many years?
Speaker 2: I was the only child for five years.  And my mother had my sister, Debra [Debra Harris], who is in TV also.  It didn't--very interesting because we didn't start out to be in TV and she ended up being a TV anchor in Port Arthur [Texas] and Orange, Texas and some of those places where my father--my grandfather [Roosevelt Posey] had been a football coach.  So with him being--I think he was still in Port Arthur at the time that she was down there working as a TV anchor and he got a chance to enjoy seeing his granddaughter on TV.
Speaker 1: Now this was your mother's father?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how--but what year did he pass, do you remember that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He passed, I don't remember the exact year, but it was in the '90s [1990s] that he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 303286
Speaker 1: You stated that your father [Samuel Harris, Jr.] built the dollhouse for you.  Do you remember about what age you were?
Speaker 2: I had to be probably around seven or eight when he built the dollhouse in the backyard.  And he and his friends, he also owned a gas station, and he owned a gas station in south Waco [Texas].  So he was somewhat of an entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: And this was in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s], yes.  He owned a Gulf gas station, Gulf service station.  And it was in south Waco and the population was predominately white, just a few African Americans and a growing population of Mexicans.  But one of my father's buddies was Manuel Salazar [ph.], who worked at the gas station with him.  And the two of them imbibed a lot at that gas station (laughter).  And I remember being able to go into the machines and get candy and crackers and soda--soda water, as we called it in Texas, and do all that as I spent time with my father at the Gulf service station.
Speaker 1: All right. Did--did he also sell, was it kerosene?  A lot of the gas stations and the little corner stores, we called 'em corner grocery stores now, but they were the little stores where people would get their little incidentals from, the forerunners of supermarkets.  Did he sell, what else did he sell at the station?
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of other things that he sold, but I'm sure he--he and Manuel had some other things going there, too.
Speaker 1: Well this was quite an achievement for your father to own a franchise with a major chain of service stations in the '50s [1950s] because of what was going on throughout the rest of the country.  And you said that Waco was predominately white (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) White.
Speaker 1: And this is a southern town, southern Texas town and then to be in Texas of all places.  Did he share any--I know you were there at the service station, but did he have any stories that he might have shared?
Speaker 2: He didn't share how he got that service station, but it was--it was interesting to me that my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] and my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey], who were very prim and proper, would allow me to spend a lot of time at that service station with my father.  And he did get a lot of the business out of--out of the black community.
Speaker 1: That's interesting and Waco ended up being the scene for the Ruby Ridge [sic.] shootout with Koresh [David Koresh].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And where we lived was across the street.  Waco used to only be known for Baylor University [Waco, Texas], which was the home of the Baylor Bears and that--that football team.  And that was the only thing people knew about in Baylor.  And our home was right across the street from Baylor University.  So years later, the David Koresh incident that occurred in kind of like the suburbs of Waco and Waco came to be known for that.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  And Baylor is a predominately white university.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: All-white.
Speaker 2: It's all-white and it's a Baptist university where you could not dance on campus when I was living in Waco.
Speaker 1: And the medical school [Baylor College of Medicine] is in Houston [Texas], isn't it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were living across the street--
Speaker 2: From Baylor.
Speaker 1: --from Baylor during that particular time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Our home is still there.  My mother doesn't live there now, she--but we still have that property right across from Baylor.
Speaker 1: Okay is the house--the physical house still there?
Speaker 2: No the house has been torn down (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The house has been torn down?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 303287
Speaker 1: Can you describe what family life was like when you were small?  You told us about your [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] taking you around, but what were like holidays like and some special events and daily life like for you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well the--my grandmother was a member of the Tenth Street Community Club [South Tenth Street Community Club, Waco, Texas].  And it was a group of black women who were teachers, which was considered to be a high society kind of thing at that time and they would meet on Saturdays and have the most elaborate dinners and lunches.  And I just remember beautiful tablecloths and china, silver, crystal.  All of these things being brought out for this club meeting.  And my grandmother lived in south Waco [Texas] and some of the othe--other ladies lived in east Waco, and the black community was kind of segregated.  They wanted us to all live in east Waco.  But when my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] and grandmother had moved to Waco they were in south Waco and I remember stories about them trying to get them to move to east Waco and they didn't.  But these were just beautiful times to me as a child seeing these beautifully dressed women come in with their fine--fine suits on and dresses, and eating out of all this fine china and this elaborately done foods.  And then after they ate, they would play cards.
Speaker 1: Now, where would--where was the meeting held, was it in someone's home or was it?
Speaker 2: In someone's home.  It would rotate to different homes.  So my mother--my grandmother would spend like weeks preparing when it was her time.  And then she would set up card tables and have beautiful linen tablecloths and just--it was just exciting to me to know that the club meeting was coming to the home.  So that was--it was an exciting time.  And I did get a chance to go with her to some of the other meetings at some of the other ladies homes, and it was just--it's just beautiful the way they--the way the decked it out.
Speaker 1: Now, did your grandmother live down the street from you or did they--did she live in the same house with?
Speaker 2: We lived with her, my mother and I lived with her.  And she also owned a duplex that was next to that house.  And so she had a renter generally in that duplex and then another house where she had a renter in.  And one of the ladies that rented her house was a hundred years old and she would walk over to my grandmother's house and pay her rent, which my grandmother was charging her thirty dollars a month in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So she was a hundred in the '60s [1960s], so she must've been born late 1800s.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  And my grandmother died of cancer in 1979.  And the--right up until the lady that was--right up until she passed, she was still paying thirty--whatever it was my grandmother charged her, my mother just allowed her to continue to pay that amount.  And she would come over with the rent, walk over to the house (laughter).
Speaker 1: They were made out of different material--
Speaker 2: Different.
Speaker 1: --then, yes.  What was the name of the street again that you lived on?
Speaker 2: 10th Street.
Speaker 1: 10th Street.  And that's ironic that that was the name of the--of the organization too, wasn't?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, the Tenth Street Community Club.
Speaker 1: So was your grandmother one of the founders or was did--was this her idea or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah.  I don't know if it was her idea, I just know she was one of the founding ladies.
Speaker 1: And this was south Waco, which was not the black neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Story_ID: 303288
Speaker 1: Tell us some more about the 10th Street [Waco, Texas] community area, you said it was across from Baylor [Baylor University, Waco, Texas] and something about the community.  Since you were away from the black community, what was the--just a little bit more about that community?
Speaker 2: What I do remember is seeing a lot of white people, and I remember in the cars, riding in the cars with my mother [Dolores Posey Harris].  And Texas is very hot, so a lot of times, you know, you'd have the window down and we would be stopped at a stop sign or whatever, and someone would--would say nigger, get out of here nigger, you know.  I remember seeing signs for colored only, for whites only, and knowing that there were certain areas you couldn't go into.  So even though my father [Samuel Harris, Jr.] had that [Gulf] service station and my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] lived where she did, it was still very apparent that segregation was alive and well.  We lived next door to a black gentleman, who was a funeral home owner, and his--the funeral home was next door to our house.  So it was the, and I cannot think of the name of the funeral home.  But that was next door to our house.  And my grandmother was a teacher and one of her students and her mother and family had gotten killed in a car accident and they brought the body to the funeral home next door.  And I remember my grandmother saying that she did not want to go and see the bodies 'cause she wanted to remember the little girls the way they were in her class.  And sometimes he would ask my grandmother to play for funerals, because she was a--could play the piano.  But I just remember it being a community where right down the street there were white people living in the neighborhood.  And there was a grocery store called Tusa's grocery store.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: T-U-S-A apostrophe S (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was like the general store and you could get molasses and you know, all your staples in there.  And so I would go in there and get whatever grandmother needed, generally syrup, she would send me there for syrup.  But on the way because this was an integrated neighborhood I would see white people sitting on the porch and I had been taught, you know, to speak to adults.  And I would say, "How are you?" And they would not speak.
Speaker 1: But you spoke anyway.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was the neighborhood mixed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Whites, were they of the same class as your parents were or were they a lower class or were they equal class?  Were they working class, 'cause this is across from Baylor Hospital--I mean, I'm sorry, Baylor University?
Speaker 2: They were older whites that I remember seeing.  So I would think that they were probably at least the same class because it looked like they owned the homes and, you know, were just there basically.  You know, they weren't doing anything, they were just there.  So I'm thinking they were the same class, if not lower.
Story_ID: 303289
Speaker 1: Well did you have any playmates your age that were of your color, or who did you play with until your sister [Debra Harris] came along?
Speaker 2: There was one playmate who lived in South Atlanta [sic.] who her--
Speaker 1: South Waco [Texas]?
Speaker 2: South Waco, I'm sorry, south Waco.  Her parents were entrepreneurs and owned a lot of real estate in Waco and they lived in south Waco and she was my playmate.  So she was around the corner and that was the person that I kind of grew up with playing.  And her name was Patsy Joyner [Patsyanne Mayes Wheeler].  But her grandparents were the Malones, who owned a lot of real estate, and Vivienne Malone [Vivienne Malone-Mayes] was the first [sic.] African American to get a Ph.D. from Baylor--no she got it from the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], and she got it in mathematics.  But in her house, she also had a beauty salon in her home.  And her parents were these entrepreneurs that owned all the real estate in Waco.
Speaker 1: Was Vivienne your playmate or was she--
Speaker 2: Her daughter.
Speaker 1: --oh her daughter, okay.
Speaker 2: Patsy.
Speaker 1: Patsy was your room--okay was your playmate.  What are some of the sights and sounds that remind you of your growing up days?
Speaker 2: The sights are, I just remember my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] creating a beautiful Christmas that she would spend days flocking the tree, you know, spraying it white and then you could not put different color balls on there, they had to be color coordinated balls.  You know, whatever color she decided, one year it was blue and then it was--another year it was red and then the lights had to be red or blue.  I mean you could not mix 'em.  But I think I believed in Santa Claus until I was sixteen (laughter) 'cause I wanted to.  It was such a magical experience and she, you know, when you got up on Christmas morning you felt like you were in a winter wonderland the way she had the toys there, the dolls and the appliances for the dolls, and dresses and shoes, and just--she--she went overboard for me and for my sister.  So I think Christmas was the most magical time.  And then being there with my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] to make dressing and cakes and macaroni and cheese, and I kind of learned how to cook watching my grandmother cook and helping her cook.  So just the food and the--and the looks of that time.  So we were poor, I'm sure, but we didn't know it.
Speaker 1: And you say dressing, most people call it stuffing now, but that is a southern term, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, dressing.
Speaker 1: --for the cornbread dressing which has become stuffing.  So growing up for you was a fun occasion?
Speaker 2: It was a fun time and the things that were not fun I don't remember as much as I do the things that were.  But I just remember always going to church [New Hope Baptist Church, Waco, Texas].  I'll always remember riding in the car with my grandmother and her seeing somebody and asking me, "Do you know them?"  And I'd say, "Yeah."  And if I said yes, she would pick 'em up and take 'em where ever they were going.  So I started saying, "No, I don't know 'em," (laughter).
Story_ID: 303290
Speaker 1: Okay now, do you remember the name of the church that you attended?
Speaker 2: New Hope Baptist Church [Waco, Texas].
Speaker 1: Now was that on the south side of Waco [Texas] or was it on the east (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was on the south side.
Speaker 1: Okay, well there was quite a bit of black activity on the south side, right?
Speaker 2: There was quite a bit, but it was near the south--it--it was a portion of the south that was like at the dividing line between the south and the east Waco.  And it was near the Brazos River in Waco.  So there was a--the Brazos River bridge connected you to east Waco.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Brazos?
Speaker 2: B-R-A-Z-O-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was like a dividing line between black and whites.  Mostly it's--a lot of times it's the railroad tracks.  But this was the Brazos River.  Now was the New Hope, was it on this--
Speaker 2: New Hope was on the south side.
Speaker 1: So it was not, you didn't have to cross the river?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did a lot of the people cross the river to come over to New Hope?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended J.H. Hines Elementary [J.H. Hines Elementary School] in Waco, Texas.  My grandmother was my third grade teacher at J.H. Hines.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was this also the school where she was the principal or she became the principal?
Speaker 2: No, she was at--she was principal at a different school which was in, I can't think of the name of that school.  But the principal when I was there was Fred Batts [Fred D. Batts].
Speaker 1: B-A-T, how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: B-A-T-T-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Were there any teachers that influenced you and if so what were their names?
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother, Ollie Nickerson Posey, was a big influence because she taught me how to write and she also taught me how to speak to have good elocution.  So she would have us recite poems like, "O Captain! My Captain! the [sic. our] fearful trip is done;  The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won" ['O Captain! My Captain!,' Walt Whitman].  And she would have us over-enunciate and so she was a big influence on me and on my sister, Debra Harris, who went on to be a news anchor.  And I think that also is why I became an English major and my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] being a librarian influenced me to--to read and just love books.  And I loved--spent a lot of time in the library with her.  Another teacher that--that really influenced me was Mrs. Pryor, Hazel Pryor, who was my journalism teacher.  And she helped me to write a newspaper article that won honorable mention at a journalism conference at Baylor University [Waco, Texas].  So this was coming from a black high school [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas] and getting honorable mention, you know, all over the State of Texas, that was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what kind of student were you in elementary?
Speaker 2: I was always a good student I think because I didn't feel like I couldn't be because of my grandmother, you know, I had to be a good student.  And I was a good student in high school, graduated in the top ten of the class.
Story_ID: 303291
Speaker 1: What type of child do you think you were, or what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Spoiled rotten by my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] and, you know, feeling privileged like I said, we were poor, but we didn't know it.  You know, we thought we were elite.  And so as a result of that I think just a happy, I had a wonderful happy childhood, but spoiled by my grandmother and my mother [Dolores Posey Harris].  Because my mother would buy me all kind of beautiful dresses and what she didn't buy, she would make 'cause she was a wonderful seamstress and just created these Christmases that were unbelievable.  And my grandmother, anything I wanted she would get it.
Speaker 1: And did you have any dreams or aspirations at the young age, you know, during elementary school [J.H. Hines Elementary School, Waco, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted to be a writer and I wanted to write for television.  That was my dream.  What I really wanted to do was write soap operas.  Because my grandmother and I would watch 'As the World Turns,' and I thought I could come up with better endings for them.  So that was my goal that I was gonna one day write soap operas and make so that they would have happy endings, not realizing that the drama is what keeps it on the air (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you share this with your grandmother, this dream (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What did she think?
Speaker 2: She would just laugh (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, and at church, how were some of your experiences at New Hope Baptist Church [Waco, Texas] that you might recall?
Speaker 2: Well, I just remember singing.  I was in the choir.  Vivienne Malone-Mayes was like every woman, you know, (laughter), she not only got the Ph.D., but she also was the person who was in charge of the youth choir.
Story_ID: 305466
Speaker 1: Now you were talking about--
Speaker 2: Vivienne [Vivienne Malone-Mayes].
Speaker 1: Vivienne Malone-Mayes in New Hope--
Speaker 2: Baptist Church, right.  New Hope Baptist Church [Waco, Texas] was the high society church in Waco [Texas] where you couldn't shout, you sang operatic songs or Negro spirituals, something that was very cultured.  Well Vivienne Malone-Mayes, this first [sic.] African American women to get her Ph.D., brought gospel music to New Hope Baptist Church with her youth choir.  And I was one of her featured soloists.  So I remember my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] crying when she heard me sing these gospel songs that Vivienne was playing and having us sing as a--as a youth choir.
Speaker 1: Okay and you said that Vivienne was married to--not the Mays at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], but--
Speaker 2: Vivienne was married to--
Speaker 1: --a different Mayes?
Speaker 2: --Dr. Mayes [James Mayes], who was a dentist and he had gotten his dental degree at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  Vivienne's father [Pizarro Malone] and mother [Vera Allen Malone] were wealthy and they had set him up in dental practice in east Waco.
Speaker 1: But they lived in south Waco?
Speaker 2: But they lived in south Waco.  And her daughter was my playmate, Patsy, Patsy Joyner [Patsyanne Mayes Wheeler].  And she was her adopted daughter because she was supposed to have been--Patsy was supposed to have been the niece of Dr. Mayes that they brought to live with them and adopted her.  But we all believe that it was really her daughter.
Story_ID: 305467
Speaker 1: Yes, there was a lot of that going on during that particular time, even in the black community.  Because in the white community, they would send the girls away when they became pregnant and then the girls would return, you know, not pregnant anymore.  But in the black community, they just gave the child to someone else but it was actually the child of the young child that had the--the baby.
Speaker 2: And at my [paternal] grandmother, Eleanor's [Eleanor Harris] funeral, a man came who looked just like my grandmother from California and he was in the limo with me and my father [Samuel Harris, Jr.] who everybody knew that was her son and his sister had died a few years earlier of cancer.  And I said, "Now how are you related to my grandmother?"  And he wrote on a piece of paper, I'm her son.
Speaker 1: Oh so your grandmother had two sets of children?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So this child was before your mother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--before my father.
Speaker 1: Before your father, okay, this is your father's--
Speaker 2: Brother, half-brother, according to this man.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was on the Harris side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was this the Birmingham [Alabama] family, this is not the [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] that you grew up with in the household with?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  This is the Birmingham family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her father was--Grandmother Eleanor's father was Reverend F.C. Jones [ph.], not the picture I have, but we don't have a picture of him, but he was a minister.  And what we believe is that because of him being a big-time minister in Birmingham when this happened, they--what they did at that time was send the--the baby to live in the country.  And then at some point the baby emerges and you reclaim 'em.  But my grandmother never, to us, acknowledged that this was her son, but some believe it was.  But he looked just like her to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you're saying that was the same father though, it was just a child that she had earlier in life, but--
Speaker 2: No it wasn't the same father, it was a different father (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, it was a different father, okay, all right.  And when you say the country, if it wasn't in the area where your grandmother was living in Birmingham, they sent the child to live--was it with her mother and father or an aunt or someone in another part of Alabama?
Speaker 2: Some relative in another part of Alabama--
Speaker 1: Alabama.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 305468
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Wylie Junior High School [Waco, Texas], which was in East Atlanta [sic.] because there was no black--no, east Waco [Texas] because there was no black junior high school in south Waco.  So they did have--and I went to elementary school [J.H. Hines Elementary School] in east Waco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who were your friends at Wylie Junior High?
Speaker 2: A lady, well a girl named Debra Clay [ph.] was a real good friend.  A boy named Ronald Scott [ph.] and a lady who's my friend to this day, Yvonne Lister Moss.  And she lives in Dallas [Texas] now.
Speaker 1: What influenced you as a young person at--in junior high school?
Speaker 2: In junior high school I was influenced by music, 'cause that was around the time when I was singing and I wanted to be a singer.  And I was influenced by the--the music of the '60s [1960s] and just seeing The Supremes and the lifestyle that The Temptations and all those had.  I said, oh I can do that (laughter).  So what I did in junior high school and in senior high school was a lot of talent shows.  And I was in the glee club, the Moore High School [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas] glee club and won a state competition in vocals as a contralto.  So I seriously considered a career in music.  And when I came to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I took--I was--started off being a music minor playing the violin and the viola and taking voice lessons and I was a member of the Spelman Glee Club.
Story_ID: 305469
Speaker 1: Now did you have any previous training with music, you know, like other--you said you played the violin, were these some of the classes that you took to learn how to play the instruments when you were younger?
Speaker 2: Yes, my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] wanted me to be a musician and my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] wanted me to be a musician.  So they had me taking piano lessons when I was in elementary school [J.H. Hines Elementary School, Waco, Texas].  And I took them from Mrs. Davis in east Waco [Texas].  And Mrs. Davis had the only piano school in Waco for blacks.  And her husband, B.T. Davis was the only photographer in Waco for blacks.  So he had his photography studio [Davis Studio, Waco, Texas] next to her--next to the house.  So she had the piano lessons in her house and then next to that was a freestanding photography studio where he took every photo that was taken of black people probably through the '70s [1970s].  And the--the funny thing about B.T. Davis, you know, he took our high school photos, our junior high school [Wylie Junior High School, Waco, Texas], everything.  (Laughter) And the--the funny thing that people always said, which was true he would, being the only black photographer in town, he'd get up there and take all these pictures and then at the end of it he'd say, "I don't have any film in the camera," (laughter).  So it was a running joke, you know, you want to make sure you have (laughter), make sure you have film in your camera.
Speaker 1: Do you know if any--what became of his photo collections?
Speaker 2: This I do not know.  But he's--he's got to have every black person, I mean it would be wonderful to--to see what--what happened with his collection.  I went from taking the piano lessons to taking violin lessons at school because my grandmother wanted me to take the violin.
Speaker 1: And what grade was this in when you took the violin lessons?
Speaker 2: This was in junior high school.  And then in junior high school I also played the saxophone with the junior high school band.  Because she just wanted me to play all these instruments.  I played the clarinet and the saxophone.  And the final thing that she wanted me to learn was the harp.  So she was researching trying to find, but I think by the time she figured it out I was in college [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], but she--she wanted me to play the harp also, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Now these were black teachers who taught you these musical instruments?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--and was Wylie Junior High, was that a predominately black school, all-black school or was it mixed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was all-black.  It was all-black.  See then everything was segregated.  So there were no junior high schools in the south side, there was one, which was Wylie where every--
Speaker 1: This was--
Speaker 2: This was the--
Speaker 1: --during the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like late '60s [1960s], '65 [1965], '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], yeah, 'cause I was in '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], '68 [1968], probably '64 [1964], 'cause I went to Moore High School [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas], I graduated from Moore High School in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So this was in the earlier--of the '60s [1960s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Early '60s [1960s], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305470
Speaker 1: All right so you went to Moore High School [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas], and who were some of your teachers at Moore?
Speaker 2: The teacher I remember is Mrs. White [ph.], who was the math teacher.  And math, even though my [maternal] grandfather, Roosevelt Posey was a math teacher, I didn't get any of those genes.  So that was like my toughest subject, and Mrs. White was my--one of my toughest teachers.  And her motto was time wasted is money wasted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who influenced you most in high school?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Pryor [Hazel Pryor (ph.)], who was the journalism teacher.  And she was also over the--the Moore Highlight, which was the school newspaper.  So I started writing for the Moore Highlight and got the awards at the journalism competition at Baylor University [Waco, Texas] for writing for the Moore Highlight.  And Mrs. Pryor encouraged me to get a career in journalism.  She took me to interview one of the--well the--the person I got the award for.  It was a guy who was a football fan of Moore High and my--my headline was "Fan Follows Football for Forty Years."  The teacher that influenced me the most was Mrs. Pryor who--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --who was the one who encouraged me to get into journalism.  And she took me on the interview with the article that won me the honorable mention in the Baylor University competition.  And the headline was "Fan Follows Football for Forty Years."  And the article was about a man who had followed the Moore High Lions, which is the team that my grandfather had coached to a co-state championship.  He had followed it for forty years and his name was Eucolia Erby.  So my fondest memories of high school are going to football games and that is football is--is in our blood.  I guess I got that naturally and I love football and love the fall, love being--being near the field.  One of the other things, in addition to playing in the band in junior high school [Wylie Junior High School, Waco, Texas], playing the clarinet and then later playing the saxophone, I wanted to be a majorette.  And I started learning how to twirl the baton so I could audition for the majorettes.  And what happened, I told the lady who was the captain of the majorettes that I wanted to--to be a majorette.  Her father also happened to be the minister at New Hope Baptist Church [Waco, Texas].  And she's probably somebody that HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] may want to interview her at some--I mean you've probably have interviewed her 'cause she has been in Ebony magazine, Gaynelle Griffin [Gaynelle Griffin Jones] and I don't know what Gaynelle's married name is, but she's a big attorney in Houston [Texas], Gaynelle Griffin.  She told me if I would learn how to twirl that she would work with me and if there was an opening, you know, they would consider me.  The coach of the Waco High School [Waco, Texas] football team's son got one of the majorettes pregnant which made an opening for me (laughter).  So I was able to--to be a majorette in my tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade year because of that.
Speaker 1: Now how did this sit with your grandpar--your [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey]?  She was--
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't me.  Oh with the majorette (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No with the majorettes.
Speaker 2: I'm sure she didn't want me to be a majorette, she wanted me playing that saxophone, but I wanted to be a majorette, so I loved it (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your mother [Dolores Posey Harris] didn't have any objections?
Speaker 2: No.  No, they just got my boots and my baton.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting because that was quite a switch.
Speaker 2: It was a switch, but it was what I wanted to do, which is--I didn't get to do too much of what I wanted to do, so that was one of the few things (laughter) I was able to get in.
Speaker 1: So that way you got a chance to still go to all the games.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you left the band and just became a majorette and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305471
Speaker 1: I can see what influenced you most then when you were in high school, and I know music was one of them and being--having a chance to serve your time as a majorette, but what are some of the other influences that were of interest to you in high school?
Speaker 2: I had one boyfriend that was on the state champion football team, so that was exciting to me 'cause I was, I think I was in the ninth grade or tenth grade and he was a senior.  And he was a big guy, so I don't know why he was interested in me 'cause I was a tiny little ninth grader.  And my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] and my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] wouldn't allow me to date or even receive company.  You know, so I couldn't figure it out, but at any rate, he gave me his senior ring and his championship ring and all that.  So I was influenced by guys that played football (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, well you still had a busy high school.  You were writing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and your activities, 'cause you still had to practice.
Speaker 2: And oh, and that's how we got together 'cause he was in the glee club, he had a beautiful voice.  And that's what it was.  You know, you have to think back a little bit, but I was still doing the--I was singing with the glee club and we did pretty good and that's how I got into that competition was as a result of the vocal teacher with the Moore High School [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas] chorus and glee club.  And he sang with the glee club.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were you thinking you-what were you thinking you wanted your career to be at this point?
Speaker 2: Marian Anderson, 'cause I had a contralto voice.  So that's what I was gonna do, be Marian Anderson.  And then when I got to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] I saw that, you know, was--you had to do a lot of work and you travel to Europe, I mean those--those were the people that made it and I didn't wanna do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did Marian Anderson become a focal point in your life?  Was there a performance that she had done or had you seen or read about her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I read about her in Ebony because my mother was the librarian at Paul Quinn College [Waco, Texas] and just working--waiting there with her.  I would look at every Ebony, every Jet and that's how I started to dream was looking at Ebony, and Jet magazines.  And I saw Marian Anderson and I saw her on television and heard her voice.  And then people would compare me to her, they'd say, "Oh you have a contralto voice like Marian Anderson."  And I said, "Oh okay, I can do that."  But then when you realize what it takes to, to do something like that you really, that really has to be your total love.  And I, I still enjoyed writing.
Story_ID: 305472
Speaker 1: So after high school [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas], you went on to--to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Was there--how did you go about applying and getting accepted into Spelman?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] would allow me to apply for only one college, which was Spelman.  She said, "That's the only place you're going."  And I had wanted to go to Huston-Tillotson [Huston-Tillotson College; Houston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] because one of my boyfriends at the time was going there, and she said, "Nope, you're going to Spelman."  So at that time, Spelman had kind of a legacy program that if your mother or grandmother had finished Spelman, if you had a 3.0 average in high school and you kept a 3.0 average you would get a half-tuition scholarship at Spelman.  So I had a good average, my mother was a legacy, it didn't take a lot to get in.  Now it would be difficult because Spelman is so big now.  But at that time it was not that difficult I don't think to get in.  And I did keep the half tuition scholarship my whole four years.
Speaker 1: Okay and about what year was this?  You said you graduated in 1968?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-two [1972] I graduated from Spelman.
Speaker 1: No from high school in '68 [1968] and then you went to Spelman.  And your major?
Speaker 2: My major was English but I had a kind of a minor, which they didn't declare it a minor, but--but I wanted to do journalism.  My goal was to be a newspaper reporter because that's all I knew.  I didn't see any black people on TV so I never thought I could be on TV.  You know, I saw Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid and people like that, so I didn't see anybody that looked like me.  I didn't even see any females, so that was not a goal.  But my goal was to be a newspaper reporter because I saw women having bylines in the black press.  So when I got to Spelman, Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], which was then just Clark College and had not merged with Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], had a program, a journalism program that some of the Spelman and Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] people were involved in and I got into that program.  And there was a professor there who profoundly influenced me, Alan Bussell and he was from Wisconsin.  And he had worked for a newspaper in Wisconsin.  And I think a lot of, well not a lot, but some white people at that time thought they would do their missionary work by coming and working at a black college campus and helping them to learn whatever it is they knew.  And thank God he felt that way, 'cause he really helped me.
Speaker 1: And Alan Bussell was white?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: A white man with red hair from Wisconsin.
Story_ID: 305473
Speaker 1: And what are some of your other experiences at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: The biggest experience I'd say outside of working in that journalism program [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], I worked with the Spelman Spotlight.  Alan Bussell helped me to get a Princeton Newspaper Fund scholarship [Newspaper Fund, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey], which I had a half-tuition scholarship and this Princeton paid the other half my junior and senior year.  And I got an internship at The Houston Post newspaper as a result of this Princeton Newspaper Fund scholarship, and they paid me hundred and fifteen dollars a week to write for The Houston Post.  I got to write and cover the concert of Ray Charles and The Raelettes.  I got to do investigative articles about customs corruption.
Speaker 1: And this is United States Customs [U.S. Customs Service; U.S. Customs and Border Protection] corruption?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  And I lived with my [maternal] grandfather [Roosevelt Posey] who was living in Houston [Texas] then.  So that probably is one of the--the--the things that shaped where I am today being able to do that.
Speaker 1: And this was your senior, I mean your freshman and sophomore year at Spelman?
Speaker 2: This was my sophomore year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --at Spelman that this happened.  And I interviewed a guy, David Lippert who was a filmmaker and talked about his films and him working in the movie industry and a big article on that.  And so all of these articles had my byline on 'em, so you talk about a resume, I had a resume that was most impressive because of this experience.
Speaker 1: Who was David Lippert?
Speaker 2: He was a filmmaker.
Speaker 1: Would you spell his last--
Speaker 2: L-I-P-P-E-R-T.  So I was able to interview him because he was doing a film premier in Houston.  And so that was one of my assignments.  So my grandfather, who I was living with, when I would come home and say, "Granddaddy look," and he would see my name in the paper in The Houston Post, which was the major white newspaper and it would say Sheryl Harris [HistoryMaker Sheryl Riley Gripper], you know, written by Sheryl Harris.  And was like, "Did you write this, or somebody else wrote that and just put your name on it," (laughter).  I said, "Granddad, I wrote this," you know (laughter).  But I was able to use those articles from The Houston Post to--to actually get the job (laughter) that I have now at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] because the guy that interviewed me for the job at Channel 11 knew David Lippert.  So he was impressed that I had interviewed David Lippert and that's all he wanted to talk about in the interview.
Speaker 1: Okay now, that was your sophomore year that you did the internship at the Houston Chronicle--
Speaker 2: Houston Post.
Speaker 1: Houston Post sorry, The Houston Post.  And so, did you have any other internships after that, like the junior year or?
Speaker 2: The junior and senior year I was writing for free for the Atlanta Daily World.  And just trying to get my byline out again.  So those were the, that--that internship was the thing that was the biggest deal.  But then after that, just realizing that it's a good thing to see your name in print.  I was writing for the Atlanta Daily World.
Speaker 1: And for those who might be listening, explain what the byline is for those who are in your field?
Speaker 2: The byline is when you write something and then you put your name down, written by or by, and so I was able to write things and have Sheryl Harris, you know, written by Sheryl Harris.  So when I would write something for free, I would say, "Well just since you're not paying me, put my name on it, make sure that my name was on it."
Story_ID: 305474
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any organizations at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and the fraternities--I mean I'm sorry, sororities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  When I started Spelman there were no sororities on campus because of the sisterhood.  They didn't want sororities.  They felt that it would interfere with the sisterhood.  My senior year at Spelman, I pledged with the first sorority chapter that came on Spelman's campus.  So I pledged Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], Eta Kappa Chapter, which was the inaugural chapter, the terrible twenty-six.  And my roommate pledged with the inaugural AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] Chapter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you talk about the sisterhood at Spelman, would you just explain that a little bit for us?
Speaker 2: The sisterhood at Spelman is that it's an all-girl college.  And Spelman wants to instill that there is no sisterhood like that between Spelman sisters.  So you don't wanna do anything that interferes with that.  My roommate at Spelman was Barbara Washington from Jackson, Mississippi.  And she's still one of my good friends today.  So the sisterhood is something that is--is--is a definite integral part of going to Spelman.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were some of the circumstances surrounding getting some of the Greek sororities on campus at Spelman?
Speaker 2: I think it was, you know, the--the turbulent '60s [1960s] that some of the things that hadn't been done before were--were being done.  My freshman year at Spelman, there were no--there were curfews, but my freshman year we all walked out of the dorms, everybody and they said you don't have to have a curfew, that was my freshman year at Spelman.  So things that, it was just things coming--walls being torn down bit by bit.
Speaker 1: Okay now, when you were at Spelman did all of the students live on campus or was there also off-campus housing?  Did everybody live in the dorm?
Speaker 2: Fresh--yeah people lived in the dorms, even the students that were--no everybody did not live in the dorm 'cause students that lived in the city who were from the City of Atlanta [Georgia] did not live in the dorm.
Speaker 1: Okay, but everyone from--
Speaker 2: Everybody else did.
Speaker 1: --out-of-state did and out of the city had to--to live in the dorms.  Were there any major events that took place to get the sororities, you know, incorporated on the campus and also were the fraternities incorporated at the same time into Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: The fraternities were already, they were already at Morehouse.  But the sororities were not at Spelman.  I don't really know why they allowed those sororities on campus, but that was my senior year and we sang in the quadrangle, we did step shows.  We went to Morehouse's campus and performed.  I don't know why they did it, unless it was just the times, you know, when the times were changing, I don't know.
Story_ID: 303301
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about some more of your Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] experience.  I know you--you did pledge the sorority, Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], were there any other student organizat--were there's student organizations on campus when you were at Spelman?
Speaker 2: There was of course a student government association, there's a--was a Black Student Alliance, this was the time when the Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] students locked up the board of trustees at Morehouse because they wanted blacks on the board and they didn't feel like there were enough black representation at Morehouse.  So Samuel L. Jackson, I guess--the actor, celebrity, just one of the ones that people remember--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --during that era.  And it was an interesting time because there was a lot a protests and if you didn't feel like things were going right, you would protest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any other black student organizations?
Speaker 2: I just remember working for an organization that was trying to help get Maynard Jackson elected to the [U.S.] Senate.  And we were going around canvassing and getting people to go out and vote.  And we met in West End [Atlanta, Georgia], and Hosea Williams who is a civil rights activist and was one of the persons who was one of the organizers.  And I just remember meeting with him, telling us what we needed to do to get Maynard elected to the United States Senate.
Speaker 1: Okay. And who was president when you were at Spelman?
Speaker 2: The president was Dr. Albert (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of the--
Speaker 2: Oh of the student government?
Speaker 1: No, no, no of the university?
Speaker 2: Dr. Albert Manley.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did you have any stories to tell about the president?
Speaker 2: Not that I wanna (laughter).  Not that I want recorded for history (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it is interesting.  His wife [HistoryMaker Audrey Manley] that he married, who later became a president of Spelman, I remember that she would walk around the campus offering Planned Parenthood.
Speaker 1: To the students?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he was the first black, you said, to become president of Spelman.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  And he was from Jamaica.  I think his--his--one of his relatives [Norman Washington Manley] was the prime minister of Jamaica.
Story_ID: 303302
Speaker 1: After pledging [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], and you said that you interviewed for a job with Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], where you are now, and you got the job, would you just tell us a little bit more about how your career started with Channel 11?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well after graduating from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I really wanted to be a newspaper reporter because I had the bylines and I had the experience working at The Houston Post, which was a major newspaper and the Pentagon Papers ['Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force'] was a big scandal that happened at the time that I was working at The Houston Post.  The Houston Chronicle, the person there was gonna print the Pentagon Papers and The Houston Post would not print them, which because the owner of The Houston Post was good friends with the president [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] of the United States.  So he wasn't gonna do anything to bring any disrepute to the administration.  So we would sit there at The Houston Post at that time upset that the Chronicle was printing the Pentagon Papers and we were these crusading journalists who weren't being allowed to crusade.
Speaker 1: Now who was president at this time, was that Nixon?
Speaker 2: Johnson [sic. President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 1: Oh it was Johnson's papers, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what was the scandal about, let's just go a little bit into that?
Speaker 2: The scandal was that someone was letting people know the inside of this administration and you weren't supposed to--to tell.  But this again was the era of the crusading journalists so you were trying to uncover everything.  And Daniel Ellsberg was the person who had uncovered this--these Pentagon Papers.  And some of the major daily newspapers were printing the papers and others would not print them.  But The Post would not print them.
Speaker 1: And this was during the time when Johnson is associated the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination and--
Speaker 2: A lot--
Speaker 1: --the cov--
Speaker 2: --a lot was covered up and I'm--I don't wanna say the wrong thing because I may not remember correctly.  But I--I just remembered that we were upset as journalists, and I considered myself a journalist at that time, because we could not print these papers.  But coming from that, graduating in 1972, I was naive enough to think that I could go from working for this major daily paper and get a job and in Atlanta, Georgia and that did not happen.  I went to interview at The Atlanta Constitution and Atlanta Journal [The Atlanta Journal; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution].  I was able to meet with the publisher, Reg Murphy [J. Reginald Murphy], publisher of The Atlanta Constitution.  I would call him and say I want a job and he'd say, "Well come over let's talk."  And then he would send me to Jim Mentor, whose name I remember to this day, to fill out the application and talk to him and he would tell me every week, "There are no positions."  So I soon realized what it was, was that they weren't hiring black women.  And I was gonna need to come up with a different career.  [HistoryMaker] Alexis Herman, who later became the labor secretary under Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], developed a program called the Black Women Employment Program [Black Women Employment Program of the Southern Regional Council], BWEP.  And I signed up for that program.
Story_ID: 303303
Speaker 1: Through her [HistoryMaker Alexis Herman], I got a job with public television as a secretary, which was one of the other skills that I learned while in high school [A.J. Moore High School, Waco, Texas] that I didn't talk about.  I learned how to be a secretary and a stenographer, because we figured that would be something I could use at some point.
Speaker 2: Now the stenographer during the time that you were trying to be a secretary was taking shorthand, right?
Speaker 1: Taking shorthand, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So you knew the--the language, the shorthand language, okay?
Speaker 1: Yes, so I knew how to do shorthand, which helped me in taking notes in college [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and graduate school [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia].  But--and also helped me, you know, to this day if I'm taking notes at a meeting or whatever.  But I got a job through the Black Women Employment Program [Black Women Employment Program of the Southern Regional Council]  that was started by [HistoryMaker] Alexis Herman to be a secretary to the general manager of the public television station here in Atlanta [Georgia], which was at that time called WETV [WPBA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], which it stands for W Educational TV.  And the guy's name was Dick Holcomb [Richard Holcomb].  And when I went in to interview with him I said, "I'm a graduate of Spelman College, I have these bylines at The Houston Post newspaper, and I will be a secretary but I expect at a certain time you will promote me to something else, and you know, more in line with what my experiences and my education are."  And he said, "Okay."  So I worked as his secretary, but working as his secretary I got a chance to learn about management and how to write letters and politics and all that.  And at a certain point, probably about a year afterwards I said, wait a minute, I'm still a secretary.  So I went in to him and I said, "You told me that at a certain point I would get a job in line with my--my education," and he said, "Okay."  So he made me a public information writer which was something he just created to shut me up.  And after that I started doing a program while I was in public television, which was--public television at that time was predominantly white.  You know, most of the images and the--the programming was white.  Music, operas, musicals, you know, 'Singin' in the Rain,' Danny Kaye and things like that.  Good programming, but predominantly white.  So he asked me to come up with something that was geared toward the African American community because WETV was owned by the Atlanta Board of Education [Atlanta, Georgia] which was predominantly black.  Dr. Benjamin E. Mays was the president of the Atlanta Board of Education (laughter).  So they thought they should do at least something as a token, something for the black community.
Story_ID: 303304
Speaker 1: With a group of people at the TV station I came up with an idea for a--an awards program called the Bronze Jubilee Awards, which was like a Oscars [Academy Awards] for black culture.  And we honored persons in music, dance, drama, theater, communicative arts and long-term contribution to the arts and arts educators.  And we did this show on public TV at the Morehouse Chapel [Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And that program started in 1978.  And as a result of doing that program, he [Richard Holcomb] made me promotion manager of the TV stations and the radio station there.  So I was promotion manager for WETV [WPBA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] and WABE Radio [Atlanta, Georgia].  The program was televised live on--on public broadcasting, WETV, and we were able to bring in hosts through the years like [HistoryMaker] Freda Payne, Peabo Bryson then performed on it.  We went and got artists from other areas where public television was that I could get 'em.  I got Richmond Barthe who was a sculptor in--living in--in--in California.  We brought him in to get an award.  We brought in people from New Orleans [Louisiana] who were artists and--and--to--to get awards.  So we--we didn't just focus on the Atlanta [Georgia] area.
Speaker 2: So you had a budget--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that you worked with, too?
Speaker 1: I had to raise the money.  Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] was one of my first sponsors and the Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Company.  And we had a budget with the TV station and with the sponsors that enabled us to--to do this.
Speaker 2: Okay, and do--do you have, I mean, the television station have clips of those that you actually did the--the shows of.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was--that program ran from 1978 to 1990.  And I left the TV station in 1981, 1981, yeah, 1981 to go to Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], which is the NBC affiliate.
Story_ID: 303305
Speaker 1: The reason that I went to the NBC affiliate [Channel 11; WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], I volunteered for the United Negro College Fund [UNCF] telethon ['Lou Rawls Parade of Stars'].  So I was working at a public television station [WETV; WPBA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], volunteering for the UNCF telethon, which was being done at Channel 11.  So when a position came open, they knew me because this--this program that I did, the Bronze Jubilee Awards, had been nominated for an Emmy [Emmy Award] up against some of their high school football games.  So they knew who I was, but they also knew me because I was volunteering for UNCF Telethon at their TV station.  And then working--I've been at Channel 11 since 1981 and was the first female and the first black named vice president.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, when you started with Channel 11 you were known because of the--the programming that you had, you know, promoted at the public television station and the radio station [WABE Radio, Atlanta, Georgia].  So what were your duties when you first started at Channel 11?
Speaker 1: When I first started I was executive producer of eight TV shows.  A show called 'Ebony Beat Journal,' which was about the black community.  A kids show, a call-in show that was on at eleven o'clock at night called 'Contact 11' where viewers called in.  And one of the shows we did was on a guy who was supposed to go to the electric chair.  So people were calling in about whether or not his--his execution should be stayed.  We did a show called 'Newsmakers' [ph.] that was about politics and we had the politicians on that one.  We did another show called 'Ask the Mayor' [ph.] with Maynard Jackson.  So those are just some of the ones that I remember, but that was my job, was being executive producer of all these shows.
Speaker 2: Okay, now the--the--the call-ins for the person who should--well might have been sent to the death chamber, did--is that a person that we might know of who was in the news (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  Well his name was--was--was Potts [Jack Potts] and I cannot think of his first name.
Speaker 2: P-O-T-T-S?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  He was a white man and he had murdered some people in Georgia and I just cannot remember what the situation was.  But we took a lot of call-ins because it was a time when you didn't ha--you just had the three TV stations.  So this was an outlet for people.
Speaker 2: Well had the death penalty been outlawed in Georgia or was it still--
Speaker 1: It was still there.
Speaker 2: It was still in effect?  So do you know what his fate was, did he get exonerated or he was?
Speaker 1: For some reason I think he died on death row.
Speaker 2: Okay but he was not sent to be electrocuted (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He wasn't--he wasn't executed.
Speaker 2: He wasn't executed. He just spent all of his years on death row and eventually died.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 303306
Speaker 1: You did that and what else did you do after the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And after when cable came in and there were more choices, the one thing that local television stations had that cable didn't have was the local news.  So my job then became to--to do the award show that we do, which we've done at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] for thirty-one years, the Community Service Awards [11 Who Care Community Service Awards].  So I'm the executive producer of that and to try to get our news people out into the community.  So my job changed to be more cause-related marketing.  So you're trying to find things that make good business sense that are good for the community.
Speaker 1: Now how did cable actually affect the television stations?  Tell me about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cable affected the TV stations in that people had other choices.  You know, if you can only watch CBS, ABC and NBC, you're gonna watch 'em.  But if you could also watch HBO and Showtime and all that on cable, you're gonna watch that, too.  So that divided up the advertising money and divided up the viewers.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, therefore, the TV stations had to--
Speaker 2: Had to be more targeted to what they were gonna do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so a lot of people that had my job disappeared.  They are now promotion people or marketing people.  But our TV station continued to see the value in what we do as being something that could make good business sense, as well as be good for the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the big things that I do now are just trying to target programs that are good and beneficial, but also we can bring advertising dollars to it.  For example, the Buddy-Check [Buddy Check 11] for breast health self-awareness, Go Red for Heart [Go Red for Women], so we get sponsors for these things and do messages and programming around that.  And I do the Can-A-Thon, which we raised 300,000 pounds of food for Georgia's hungry.  We partnered with Publix [Publix Super Markets, Inc.] for that.  And then for the Community Service Awards, which is like an Emmy Awards for volunteers, each year we give a big check to a nonprofit, and this year we're doing the Special Olympics Georgia.  And the dinner chairs are Stephanie Blank, who's married to Arthur Blank of The Blank Foundation [The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation] and the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and one of the Falcon players.  And my sponsors are Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company], UPS Foundation [The UPS Foundation] and Bank of America Foundation [Bank of America Charitable Foundation].

Speaker 1: So what is a typical day like for you as VP of community relations [at Channel 11; WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: The good thing is there is no typical day.  That when I get to work today--when I go in this afternoon, I don't know what is gonna be awaiting me, which means that you kind of have to be, at this point, a jack of all trades.  It could be that the news department needs something from me.  It could be that my boss needs me to do something.  But I plan to be working on Black History Month because I'm gonna get sponsors to do vignettes for that.  That's my plan.  But when I get there I may have to divert from that plan.  As a result of being in TV for so many years I realize that what I really enjoy doing is being creative.  So I went back to school after I got the--I got a--the degree at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in English in '72 [1972], and then I got a master's [degree] in education in '77 [1977] because my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] and [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] were in education, so you always have to have that to fall back on.  Well in 2000, I got a master's in film and video at Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that I would have the opportunity to be creative.  While there, I realized there were no black women in any of my classes.  And I started an organization, the Black Women Film Preservation Project [Black Women Film Preservation Project, Inc.; Black Women Film Network] to increase the numbers of women that are in film or related areas.  And also to honor, because my background was award shows, to salute women who have blazed a trail in film.  And my first honoree was the woman [HistoryMaker Jennifer Lawson], who is now the head of the communications department [sic. WHUT-TV] at Howard University [Washington D.C.], who is a filmmaker.
Speaker 1: And her name is?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna have to come up with that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's fine.
Speaker 2: And the second honoree was Sheryl Lee Ralph, the actress and filmmaker 'cause she has done a film called 'Secrets' and does a film festival [Jamerican Film Festival] in Jamaica.  And last year we honored Xernona Clayton Brady [HistoryMaker Xernona Clayton] who does the Trumpet Awards because she has focused on so many African American women.  And I do this just so women can get their props, but at the same time so that somebody else can see these women and feel like I can do the same thing.  And then we give out these scholarships to the girls and we've given--last year we gave 'em to girls at North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], at Spelman, Clark [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and one of the girls is one of the--
Speaker 1: Joyce--Jocelyn--
Speaker 2: Yeah Jocelyn Delk.
Speaker 1: --Jocelyn Delk one of The HistoryMaker employees was a recipient and she was at Clark Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Right, so she was one of our recipients.  And it's just exciting to me to see what the recipients are doing because Jocelyn would send me letters about working--doing movies with Jennifer Lopez and working with Judge Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis] in Chicago [Illinois].  So it's just--and last year for the first time we did a film festival in conjunction with the awards and scholarships, and this year will be our fifth luncheon where we present scholarships, and we will be doing our second annual film festival at the Regal Cinema at Atlantic Station [Regal Atlantic Station, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 303308
Speaker 1: Okay, so you said you started the organization in 1997 and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you were inspired when you were working on your master's [degree] in--in film [at Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't see any black women.  And the supporters I got in working on my films were white men.  They just loved what I did.  They loved it and they said, "You need to do this and you need to make movies and you need to do documentaries and feature films because the voice of the black woman has not been heard."  And they would tell me, "So we hear enough 'Animal House' and crazy white men doing crazy things, but we need to know about black women."  So that's the theme of the Black Women Film Preservation Project [Black Women Film Preservation Project, Inc.; Black Women Film Network] is preserving the voice of the black woman through digital media and film.  And when I started in 1997 it was just film, but now there's so many other media that get on the screen.  So, you know, people are doing things digital media.  And people, you know, Spike Lee is making movies in video and digital.  So you want to be all-encompassing.  And--but just preserving the voice of--of black women, which is the often unheard of voice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because when you look back into the history of black women in film was it the first one was--well we go Micheaux [Oscar Micheaux], (unclear) black men, and well he was born in 1800s, but it was in the 19--what is it 1920s when he first did his film production?
Speaker 2: When he first did his and one of the women who's supposed to be one of the--who could be possibly the first black woman to make a film is Eloyce Gist, who was a Howard University [Washington, D.C.] graduate.  So I'm working on a film about her, a short, just to let people know that she existed.  And that is one of my goals of trying to do that within the next year, to get that short done on Eloyce Gist.  But she was married to a man [James Gist] who was making films, but they said that she was the one that made 'em.  And her films were predominately with a religious theme.  And she's one of the ones that is considered to be the first black woman to make a film.
Speaker 1: Right, she was a (unclear), yes she was a (unclear).  And she was one of the--the first black woman.  And after, there--there's a lot that was done with film and by the African Americans, but they were all male up until that time.  There was the Johnsons brothers [Noble M. Johnson and George P. Johnson].  They opened up a movie house [Lincoln Motion Picture Company] in Los Angeles [California].  And women have always been--black women have been actresses in a lot of the productions, but they were just not producing themselves or--
Speaker 2: Not recognized.  They were doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the men were the ones that got recognized for doing it.  And the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] is supposed to be restoring Eloyce's film so that it will be available for people to study, and that's what I'm really looking forward to, in being able to promote that.
Story_ID: 303309
Speaker 1: That is interesting.  You know, it was either--and I'm thinking if it was Waco [Texas], where these black films, it was a city in Texas where these black films were found.  I think from the '30s [1930s], the '40s [1940s], the--the first black films and they were stuck away in, not an attic, but in some little storage area and they had corroded.  But the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], I believe--
Speaker 2: Was trying to restore?
Speaker 1: They were restoring them and making them available.  And I don't know how they have actually gotten out into the community, but they were restoring 'em on the film project for African American films.  Do you think there might have been any black women film producers in that lot?
Speaker 2: Well I know that Eloyce Gist is originally from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was the one--
Speaker 2: --Hitchcock, Texas.
Speaker 1: Oh she is?
Speaker 2: From Hitchcock, Texas.  So even though I'm from Texas, I don't know where Hitchcock, Texas--I mean it's a big state and I have tried research it.  But it's--it's quite possible, quite possible.  Because even Alfred Hitchcock, who is, you know, considered one of the best film directors, his wife [Alma Reville], from what I understand, saved him and did a lot of the work.  That when he did the--one of his most important films and the woman was laying down on the ground and when he ended the scene, she moved.  And the wife went back, looked through the film, looked through the cuts and said, "You gotta shoot this again."  So she was an integral part of everything he did, but he got the credit.
Speaker 1: Okay and the same as you're saying with--with Gist and--and her husband [James Gist].  It's--was behind every successful man there's a--there's a woman.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So women have--
Speaker 2: Oftentimes a successful black woman (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 305475
Speaker 1: Now with the Black Women--
Speaker 2: Film Preservation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Film Preservation Project [Black Women Film Preservation Project, Inc.; Black Women Film Network], you stated that the first award that you gave in 2001 went to the Howard University [Washington, D.C.] person?
Speaker 2: Yes, it went to [HistoryMaker] Jennifer Lawson, who was a former head of PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] programming.  She was the woman who brought 'The Civil War' project to PBS which was highly acclaimed.  And she also was able to raise $14 million to produce a film about Africa.  And I read about her in Oprah magazine and was talking about her at church.  And one of my church members said, "Oh she went to high school with me."  And I said, "What?" And she said, "Yeah, she's from Birmingham, Alabama."  So we were able to get her to come and accept our first award.
Story_ID: 305476
Speaker 1: We haven't talked about your family, your immediate family.  So tell us about your family?
Speaker 2: Well my family is composed of my husband, Jeff Gripper, Sr. [Jeffery Gripper, Sr.], and he is the son of Willie Gripper [Willie Gripper, Sr.], who was a veteran of World War II [WWII] and a man who was a jack of many trades, an entrepreneur.  He owned a gas station.  He did a lot of different things and lived in Upstate New York, in Columbus, Ohio, a lot of different places.  His wife was Myrel Gripper, Myrel Knight Gripper, who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you spell her name for us please?
Speaker 2: Myrel, M-Y-R-E-L, K-N-I-G-H-T, Gripper, G-R-I-P-P-E-R and she was from Jamaica.  So she was brought to the United States by her father from Jamaica.  And from what I understand, she was in Brooklyn [New York] when she met her husband, Willie Gripper, Sr.  And my husband is someone that I met while working at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia].  He is my second husband.  My first husband was Edward Riley, who I met when I was at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he is an entrepreneur, I think he's in the mortgage business and graduated from Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  So my first son, Edward Riley, Jr., is by the first husband.  And he now calls himself Salah, DJ Salah [Salah Ananse], S-A-L-A-H.  And my second husband I met working.  I was doing a film on a family that had six high school All-Americans, and of course, football was something I was interested in.  And it was Ross Browner who played for Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] and played for the Cincinnati Bengals.  So it was his family and I was doing a story on them while he was getting in preparation for the Super Bowl.  I had gone to interview one of his brothers and he said, "You can't do the story until my trainer returns from Europe."  And I said, "Well the story's not about him, it's about you."  But he said, "I really want him in it," and I said, "Oh, okay."  So I went to the gym, it was a boxing gym, and my--then--didn't know him, but soon-to-be husband came through the door, and he had just come back from fighting in Venezuela.  He was a kick boxer.  And the--Browner young man was learning kick boxing from him.  And so they got into the ring and did some sparring.  And then when it was over, he came over and kissed me on the cheek and I was like, oh, he's a little fresh, but that's okay, he's cute, so (laughter).
Story_ID: 305477
Speaker 1: Several months later, I had--this was during the time of the missing and murdered children crisis [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders] in Atlanta [Georgia] where young black boys were turning up missing and murdered.  And there was a panic.  And so I had a son [Edward Riley, Jr.] at that time who was scared to death to go outside and play 'cause he thought he would end up missing and murdered.  And we [Channel 11; WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] had done a PSA, public service announcement, with [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron about watching children.  And--
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: This was in 1982.  So I had asked a woman who worked with me at public broadcasting [WETV; WPBA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] to--even though I had gone on then to Channel 11, to be in this PSA 'cause I thought she had the right look for it.  And so we shot the PSA at my cousin's house over in West End [Atlanta, Georgia] with Hank Aaron and this--this woman.  Well we won a national award for the PSA.  And I was debating, I said, now do I just mail the award to her, do I go over to the public broadcasting place and present it to her and make a big deal about it.  So I guess with my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] speaking in my heart, I said, let me take it over there and make a big deal.  Well on the way over there I saw my husband [Jeffery Gripper, Sr.] and his brother in a car and I waved at him and then his brother told him to get my phone number and he called me.  And just a few months later we were married--engaged to be married.  So that's my husband who's a kick boxer.  And he was Atlanta's first world karate champion.  He was the welterweight champion in kickboxing in 1982.  From that union came Jeffery Gripper, Jr. and Ellis Nickerson Gripper, who's named for his great-great grandfather [Ellis Nickerson].  If it had been a girl, I was gonna name her Ollie for her--for my grandmother.  So hopefully at some point I will out of three boys get somebody who gets married and has a granddaughter that I can name Ollie Alethea Nickerson (laughter).
Story_ID: 305478
Speaker 1: --Okay and I think there's one other film that you did or documentary you did on the Negro League?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did a film called 'CYO: Where the Negro League Lives' [ph.].  And CYO stands for Cascade Youth Organization.  And it is a little league, a predominately black little league in southwest Atlanta [Georgia] that is based on the teams of the old Negro League.  My two sons, Jeffery [Jeffery Gripper, Jr.] and Ellis [Ellis Gripper], were in that league and they took the teams of the old Negro League and that was a fascinating thing for me to do because my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] had told me that one of the Welches [ph.] was a pretty good Negro League player.  So to have my sons playing in that league and then to be able to interview [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron as part of that film, which is kind of like a promotional video for the Cascade Youth Organization.  Red Moore [James Moore], who is a person who lives here in Atlanta who played with the Atlanta Black Crackers and the Newark Eagles from the old Negro League is--is in that film.  And it was just a blessing to be able to--to get the history of that league.
Speaker 1: Okay, because Hank Aaron was how many years at the Negro League had dissolved?
Speaker 2: He was at the end of the Negro League and in my film, he says I played for the Indianapolis Clowns for two months.
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).
Speaker 2: And at the age of seventeen, he went to the big leagues.  And my husband  and I were married at Hank Aaron's home in the--out by his lake.  Because that was another dream I had, I just told his wife I said, at that time--I tell a lot of women this, that I really believe in God and believe in faith, and believe in the power of the Holy Spirit.  So I believed at that time that at some point I was going to get married to someone because I wanted to have children, wanted to have a family after having gotten a divorce from the first husband [Edward Riley].  And the first husband, I believe it was because I wanted to get married in 1972 and the correct thing to do was to marry a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] man, and that's not the spiritual thing to do.  So for the second one I prayed to God to send me the person that God wanted me to be with for the rest of my life.  I made a list of the guests that were gonna be at the wedding, not even dating anybody at that time.  And I told Hank Aaron's wife, Billye [HistoryMaker Billye Aaron] that I wanted to get married at her house.  And I'm sure she probably thought this girl's never getting married, so okay, yeah we can do this.  And I think it was like a year and a half later that my husband Jeff [Jeffery Gripper, Sr.] and I became engaged and we got married at Hank Aaron's house by the lake and Willie Gripper, Sr. who was the minister was the officiant at the wedding, along with Ron Sailor who was the--Ron Sailor, Sr. who was one of my co-workers when I was in public television [WETV; WPBA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], and at that time he working at Channel 2 [WSB-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], so it was--and my father [Samuel Harris, Jr.] was there and people from all over.  The Count [ph.] sisters from South Carolina came up for the wedding, they're on my husband's father's side.  And one of the films that I would like to do is the Lizzie's--Lizzie's legacy because my father-in-law's mother was Lizzie Gripper [ph.] and her whole legacy was that she would make sure that all of her children had land in South Carolina.  So where she had her home, she left it to my husband's father because she felt like he would be the one person who wouldn't sell the land.  And it's like in the middle of all their property.  So all those Grippers live on Gripper row in Elgin, South Carolina.  And one of the Grippers has now built like a mansion, it looks like a hotel and swimming pool, and she had the groundbreaking and the housewarming in July.  And I wanna be able to tell that story for future generations of Grippers.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  There's so many stories that need to be told.
Speaker 2: I know, so how do you--how do you decide to--which one to go with?  But that's one of the ones that I hope I'll be able to--that I want to be able to tell.
Story_ID: 305479
Speaker 1: There are just a few questions that we like to ask, but I want to ask this, is there anything that you--that you would like to say that I might not have asked you?
Speaker 2: Well what I wanna say is that at this point in my life I am really trying to figure out what it--what God's purpose is for my life.  And to focus on the power of the Holy Spirit and being able to help people and not to be judgmental, but to witness for Christ because I've had so many trials and tribulations.  In 2001, my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] was diagnosed with colon cancer and my son, the middle son Jeffery [Jeffery Gripper, Jr.] got into some trouble, so it was like right at that time when probably it should have been the easiest time in my life and I had prayed for a closer relationship with God.  And I had some friends to tell me be careful what you pray for, 'cause when I did that it was like almost immediately that my mother called me and told me about the cancer and this happened with my son, and--and I had to pray and learn how to trust God and call on the power of the Holy Spirit.  My mother came to live with me for almost two years.  She was at that first Black Women Film [Black Women Film Preservation Project, Inc.; Black Women Film Network] luncheon when [HistoryMaker] Jennifer Lawson, so she was there, she's in the pictures there and she got to see what I was doing.  She was cured of the colon cancer.  My son is working and you know, we--we pray every day.  But it's--it's--it's a daily walk as opposed to something happening and it being over.  I mean it's just--it's just a way of life for me now to try to inspire people.  And I see that what I'm doing that of myself I couldn't do any of that, that, you know, for [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee to come to my second luncheon.  And be there and being able to take pictures with her.  That's, you know, because God is in it and because you--you are doing what he has for your purpose as opposed to me trying to do it myself.  So that is what I wanna share is that I'm on this--this walk now to try to--to do things that can glorify God because that's the only way that makes me happy.  I had--at different points in my career I've had all kind of accolades and--and money and fame and all that, I mean for what I can handle, but I was not happy.  I had an emptiness inside of me and I started praying for how to fill that emptiness and I--I understand now why some people may do drugs or alcohol or whatever just to try to fill that emptiness well.  Now I'm a rock star now, I'm a big NBA [National Basketball Association] player, but I'm not happy and they don't understand it.  But that is--what I realize is that you can fill that emptiness by--by glorifying God and achieving his purpose in your life.
Story_ID: 305480
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you have lived your life and what is important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I feel like I've made a lot of mistakes by not doing things the way I should have, but what's important to me right now is glorifying God and achieving his purpose and helping people, which is what my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] instilled in me.  Even though I was selfish and wanted to something different, it's still is with me.  So, the scripture, "Train up a child in the way he should go and when he's old he will not depart from it," [Proverbs 22:6] is real for me because that's the way I was trained and that's what I'm trying to do now is to--to be of help to others and be of service to mankind.
Story_ID: 305481
Speaker 1: What advice do you have, or suggestions that you might have for those who are going into your field, the film industry and even as a journalist?  What advice or what suggestions would you give to those people who are pursuing those careers?
Speaker 2: I would say to have a plan and then follow the plan so don't think, you know, that's it's just gonna happen.  So if you have a plan and you decide okay well I wanna go into journalism, so I need to--to write something.  You know, you can go and write articles and you can write newspaper articles or magazine articles, and then try to meet people who are in the industry who can be helpful to you and be a friend, and be a good friend.  And volunteer, because it was out of me volunteering for the United Negro College Fund [UNCF] that I got my job at Channel 11 [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia].  So I tell people all the time, to volunteer.  And I tell students all the time to do internships because those internships will help you to have some concrete work experience that it may be difficult for you to get without job experience.  So because of the internship with The Houston Post I had newspaper articles that I could take to a job interview, and that has made all the difference.
Story_ID: 305482
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I would hope that the African American community will not forget its legacy.  And an organization like The HistoryMakers is very important in helping to document who we are so we don't forget who we are.  And so that young people know who we are.  There're young people who know only about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and have no clue about some of the other contributions that African Americans have made to society.  And while my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey] always told me you're never--you're not better than anybody else, but you're not less than anybody else.  So for us to have that self-esteem and that knowledge to know that we are the sons and daughters of kings, of giants, and that we have our rightful place in society which is--and we've gotta claim it.  And organizations like The HistoryMakers are gonna help us claim our rightful place.
Story_ID: 305483
Speaker 1: --[When you] look back at your life, what stands out most?
Speaker 2: Well I'll--I'll say the relationship with my mother [Dolores Posey Harris] and my [maternal] grandmother [Ollie Nickerson Posey].  My mother beating the colon cancer, the birth of my children and marrying my husband [Jeffery Gripper, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay. How do you want to be remembered, what do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I would like for people to say she tried to help somebody.
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I would like for my legacy to be part of preserving the voice of black women.
Speaker 1: And this is in film or every--
Speaker 2: In every realm possible.
Story_ID: 303319
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my three sons that was done for me by my son Salah [Edward Riley, Jr.; Salah Ananse], who's in the middle, and he did this--he's a photographer, as well as a videographer.  And he did this as a Mother's Day present for me.  So from left to right you have Jeffery [Jeffery Gripper, Jr.], who is the middle son, and then Salah, who is Edward Salah Riley, Jr, and then to the right is Ellis Nickerson Gripper, who is the baby.  Jeffery is twenty-two, Salah is thirty-two, and Ellis is eighteen.  Ellis is at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], a student at Fisk University and made their basketball team.
Speaker 2: And which Mother's Day was this, what year?
Speaker 1: This was 2005, he did it for me for this year.  So to get the three of them in suits was almost impossible, but he did it (laughter).
Speaker 2: This photo we have your--
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother's father, Ellis Levi Nickerson, and he worked at a hotel in Dallas [Texas] to be able to send money to my grandmother and mother and family in Waxahachie, Texas.
Speaker 2: So he was born around 1882 or so, so--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, born in the 1880s and died in 1937.  And my youngest son is named for him, his name is Ellis Nickerson Gripper.
Speaker 2: So this photo is probably early 1900s?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now this is your grandmother, what year do you think this was taken?
Speaker 2: This was taken in 1972.  This is my grandmother, Ollie Alethea Nickerson Posey.  And this is at my first wedding in 1972.
Speaker 1: And you say that she was the principal of the high--
Speaker 2: She was the principal of the elementary school and she was also the first African American president of Waco Classroom Teachers Association [Waco, Texas].  My first wedding, November 1972.
Speaker 1: And that was in, where Waco [Texas]?
Speaker 2: In Waco, Texas at a--so it was really my mother and my grandmother's wedding, I just showed up for it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh they were hap--
Speaker 2: She was in her sixties.
Speaker 1: Now was this done by the photographer who did the wedding or was it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was not B.T. Davis (laughter).
Speaker 1: He wouldn't had any film, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, we wouldn't have had it.  We would have--we wouldn't have had no record of it.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of your mother, would you tell us about this picture?
Speaker 1: Yes, this is a picture of my mother when she was at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], which would have been probably the late '40s [1940s], '48 [1948], '49 [1949], 1948--'49 [1949].  Dolores Irene Posey Harris.  And when she was at Spelman because her name was Dolores Irene Posey, they called her Dip.  'Cause she had those initials on her trunks, so people saw that and thought that was her name, Dip (laughter).
Speaker 2: Do you know how she came up to Spelman from Waco or over?
Speaker 1: She rode the train.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now this is a picture of your father's father, is that correct or--?
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father's father's father.  And I don't know what his name is, but I know that he was supposed to be part Cherokee Indian [Native American].  And the picture was given to me by my first cousin, Claude Glover [ph.].
Speaker 1: And your father's father's [Samuel Harris, Sr.] name, this is the Harris line, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
