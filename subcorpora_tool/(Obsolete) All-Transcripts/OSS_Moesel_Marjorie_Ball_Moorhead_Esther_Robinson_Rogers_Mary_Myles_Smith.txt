 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Thursday, December 6, 2007, and I   m at the El Reno  Carnegie Public Library in El Reno, Oklahoma interviewing Marjorie  Ball Moesel, Esther Robinson Moorhead and Mary Myles Smith Rogers.  This interview is being conducted as part of    O-STATE Stories,    an oral  history project of the OSU Library. Thank you for joining us today.  We   re going to begin by going down the line and learning a little bit  about you. I   d like you to tell me where you   re from originally. We   ll  start with you, Marjorie.  I was born southwest of Yukon and grew up on a farm. I went to school  at Yukon High School and was very active in 4-H, so I was pretty  determined all along I was going to go to OSU   Oklahoma A M at the  time.  Okay. And Esther?  And I am from Geary, Oklahoma. I was born in Geary, Oklahoma and  attended school there twelve years. I decided in eighth-grade home  economics class that I would go to Oklahoma State University, formerly  A M.  And Mary?  Well, I was born in Oklahoma City and went to school there   Central  High School. I had a great friend who   I was kind of torn whether to go  5  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  to OU  University of Oklahoma  or OSU   but I had a great friend and  she wanted a roommate and I wanted to major in home ec. Anyway, we  headed to OSU. (Laughs) It was Oklahoma A M.  So, tell me a little bit about your parents, your siblings, if you have  siblings, what your parents did for a living and if they went to college.  Esther, let   s start with you.  Okay. I had a brother who was four years younger than myself, and he  attended Oklahoma State University. He was killed in October, starting  his sophomore year. My dad went to OSU two years and then he moved  back home and began farming   married my mom in 1926. They lived  there all their married lives on the same homestead until they moved to  town in 1976.  And Marjorie, did your parents attend college or     No, neither of them attended college. My dad did go to a prep school     Oklahoma A M prep school   and then went back to farm, but he was  born and lived all his life within a nine-mile radius. And my mother and  dad married when she was a senior in high school. She was orphaned  when she was quite young and lived with various people. She had a  sister and three brothers, and they were just scattered because it was  during a time when there wasn   t much money around. But she and Dad  met while she was in high school. He was about seven or eight years  older than Mother, and they farmed until Dad   s health got bad. Then  they retired to Yukon, but it was still within the same radius. They were  very smart people even though they didn   t go to college. (Laughs)  And what crops did they farm?  Oh, we had a dairy and we grew a lot of wheat and silage crops. We had  chickens and gardened a lot.  Okay. And Mary?  Well, my dad was born in Cedartown, Georgia. He went to Berry  College in Georgia and came to Oklahoma during the oil boom time and  met Mother. She was born in Oklahoma City. He sold insurance and did  do oil things. And at one point, I had a brother who went to OU and was  one of the NROTC  Navy Reserve Officers    Training Corps  students on  July 17, 1953 in that plane crash when there were, I believe, 20 students  killed   but he was a sophomore at OU. Mother and Daddy lived in  Oklahoma City most of the time. We lived on a farm at Choctaw during  the war years and also had a fish hatchery in Cassville, Missouri for a  little while till the children began falling in the ponds (Laughter) and  6  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Mother and Daddy decided we   d better move (Laughs) and come back  to the city.  I didn   t tell about my brothers and sisters, but I had an older brother,  older sister   a brother just a little older than me, and then a younger  sister.  Now why did you want to attend Oklahoma A M? Did your parents  encourage you? Were you looking for something in particular or   ? Tell  me about why you decided OAMC. Esther?  I think I already mentioned that I knew at the eighth-grade level in home  ec that I wanted to be a home economics teacher   I had two excellent  home economics teachers in high school   role models for sure. Bernice  Walker is still living in Stillwater and I frequently see her. My aunt and  uncle lived two blocks from the campus. He was a professor in  agriculture. So I had a room already reserved for me; my aunt and uncle  had four daughters, so there were others in college at the same time I  was, so I had the advantages of living in a family and yet living in a  dormitory-style situation, too   What was your uncle   s name?  My uncle   s name was Chris White, and he was an agriculture ed  professor, and my aunt sponsored the    Aggie Wives      these were wives  of boys who were majoring in agriculture education, to be ag teachers.  She organized the wives so that they would have some input on what to  expect when they got out in the world of agriculture in small  communities.  Wow, so you knew early on   eighth grade   that was the path for you.  Yes.  Mary, why did you decide to attend Oklahoma A M?  Well, my parents had a wonderful couple   best friends   and she was  the home economics teacher at Choctaw High School. She was just a  lovely role model. When we were trying to think of what would be good  for me to major in, it was easy to settle on home economics, and then  OSU was a great place to go.  THE place to go. (Laughter)  THE place.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  There we go. And Marjorie?  I don   t think I ever considered any other college because I was real  active in 4-H and went to 4-H Roundup several years and   I mean, once  I started going. OAMC just seemed like the right place to go. I, again,  had a role model that was very good   Margaret Edsel, later Margaret  Edsel Fitch, who was a home demonstration agent here in Canadian  County and she was   she still is   an excellent role model, she   s a  wonderful lady. And so I also majored in home ec ed, planned really to  be a home demonstration agent.  Wow. So I have quite an interesting question for you ladies   how did  you get from your hometowns to Stillwater? Marjorie?  Well, my brother, Dick, and I were in the same grade in school, and he  also went to Oklahoma A M the first two years I think I was there, so  we would go back and forth.  Did he have a car?  He drove. And then after he quit to go ahead and farm, I went with Tony  Kouba because we were friends. He was a year ahead. And then  sometimes I   d go home on the bus. Then after I was married, why of  course if I went home, I went with my husband (Laughs)   who was  another Dick.  And Mary, how did you get to Stillwater?  Well, I didn   t even think about driving in high school   no problem at  all   walked to high school. And then when I went to college, my mother  and daddy just drove me up there. When it was time to come back for  Thanksgiving, he came and got me, and when it was time to come back  for Christmas, it was really simple for me   all those four years.  Sometimes the bus, but mostly, they just drove up from the city. And it  wasn   t until I graduated from college and then landed this job and  needed to drive all over the state that we got a car right quick. (Laughs)  I learned to drive over the weekend. (Laughs)  Were the roads paved between Oklahoma City and Stillwater?  Oh, yes.  Okay. And Esther, how did you get to OAMC?  Well, since I had family there it was kind of   my parents would come  up and visit   the two sisters would be together, or I would take the bus  8  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  home. I went home a little more often than Mary did   not that often, but  I would go on the bus and the bus would stop   we lived on the highway,  the driver would stop many times and just let me off. We just lived two  miles from Geary.  How long of a bus ride was it from Stillwater to Geary?  Oh, two and a half hours probably.  Okay. So let   s talk about where you lived on campus, and if you lived  several places on campus, please share that with us, too. Esther, where  did you live on campus?  Well, see I lived with my aunt and uncle, and in the home and I was just  one of the girls. I had chores. I helped do the dishes, do some of the food  preparation. I was just a family member.  Was it far from campus?  About two blocks.  So you walked to and from?  Yes.  Nice. Okay. And Marjorie, where did you live?  My first year, I lived in Willard and my roommate was Audell Murray.  We were good friends from 4-H. She lived in another part of the state,  but we knew each other well. My second year, I lived in Murray and  then the third year in Stout. And my second year   Virginia   Easley was  her maiden name, but she married Gene Allen. She married just around  Thanksgiving and so then I was without a roommate for just a little  while. In the second semester, Sue Stetson from Illinois was my  roommate, and that year I was in a corner room and Sue was from  Illinois and liked cold and she would have the windows up at night and I  would about freeze. (Laughs) We   re still good friends though. And then  my third year at Stout, Martha was my roommate   Martha Norman  Sowell.  I was married in the summer between my junior and senior year. My  husband and I lived in a house that Dr. Ealy   who was a professor at  OSU in horticulture   well, he was finishing up his doctoral work at  LSU  Louisiana State University . They wanted us to stay in their house  and take care of their house and yard and everything. Her mother and  father lived just down the street. The Ealys wanted us to take care of  9  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  them, but actually the Smith   s took care of us better than we took care of  them. (Laughs) So I was lucky. We just lived about a block or so north  of Bennett. Now it   s part of the property that   s been taken over for the  athletic area.  Okay. And Mary?  Well, as a freshman I lived in Murray, and we, of course, in our room,  there was one lavatory and two beds and two closets, but the telephone  was halfway down the hallway   two telephones   halfway down the  hallway, and you did your laundry in the basement. Then when I  pledged Alpha Chi Omega, I moved to the Alpha Chi house and there  was just one dorm upstairs for 35 girls   all in one dorm. We had to walk  two or three blocks to the washeteria to wash your clothes, or just  package them up and send them home and then when they came back,  there was a package of cookies. (Laughter) So then I lived there three  years till I graduated.  We   ve heard some interesting stories about stuff coming back in laundry  boxes.  I had the advantage of visiting all these people in the dorms on my way  back to my home two blocks away, so I would stop in and if they  weren   t home, I   d leave notes on the door. Everybody had a message  board on their door      Been by. Sorry I missed you. Ha.     Tell me a little bit about social activities. I know in the sorority houses  and a lot of the fraternities had dances and a lot of the dorms had  dances. Let   s talk a little bit about that. Marjorie, what do you  remember about social activities?  I did go to some dances, but I didn   t go to dances as much as some of  the other activities. I really enjoyed our student activity at our church,  and it was called DSF, or Disciple Student Fellowship, and it was just  off campus but we had a lot of activities and then church on Sunday. We  went down to the First Christian Church, which was downtown. In fact,  the minister that was there, Dr. Messenger, was the one who married  Dick and I when we were married. Then we would have a lot of different  clubs we were involved in, and clubs would have activities and then we  had   I don   t remember what they called them, but you can use your  student card     Allied Arts.     Allied Arts. That was good, yeah. They always had some real nice  things.  10  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  That was included with the tuition. I mean, you picked A or B ticket;  classic or popular artists.  So they had plays?  And not only that, but the ballgames, too, you could go to.  Esther, tell me about some social activities that you remember.  Well, I   m kind of like Marjorie. I didn   t participate in a lot of the dances  and the social clubs, but I belonged to Wesley Foundation which was  right across the street from Theta Pond   and, again, went to church on  Sunday downtown at the Methodist Church. I became an officer. Before  I left, I was the secretary of the student group and still stay in touch with  a few of the Wesley Foundation members   even attended a reunion a  few years ago.  Mary?  Well, and I   m a Baptist    (Laughter)  We   re ecumenical  (Laughter)     and so I loved going over to the BSU  Baptist Student Union  and  Mrs. Henry Bennett was my Sunday school teacher at First Baptist. And  the sorority, they had what they called    dance hour    once a week. It was,  I think, a little longer than an hour and then each year, we had a couple  of formals. There were lots of   it was a really active exciting time.  Do you remember your house mother?  Yes, I certainly do, but I can   t tell you her name at the moment.  And was she an enforcer?  Oh, yes, and I can remember, talking about enforcer, do you all  remember we heard about this one dean   maybe I shouldn   t mention  her name.  That   s okay.  When we were in the dorm, that the girls couldn   t wear red (Laughter)  because it attracted the guys, and you could not wear black patent shoes  because they might reflect     Wow.  11  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  I didn   t know about that one  (Laughs)  I remember.  Was this the home economics dean? Or the dean of women?  The Dean of Women. That changed   so then when the new dean came  along, well the stories weren   t quite so unusual. (Laughter)  Wow.  Oh, and also   if the girl sat on a guy   s lap, you should use a lap board.  (Laughter)  Where would you get the lap board from?  Beats me. (Laughter) We didn   t ask that. (Laughter)  Marjorie, do you remember a curfew in the dorm?  Yeah, they had curfews. And once you were dating, if the fellas had a  car, it seemed like you had to wait till they   d flip the lights  on and off   before you   d go in (Laughs) even though you were ready to go in earlier.  And some girls were bad about missing curfew. I only did it once and  that was because we were waiting for the light signal and we both went  to sleep (Laughs) and woke up and there were not many cars around and  I thought,    Oh, I   m going to be in so much trouble,    because some of the  other girls I knew had been in a lot of trouble, but they were very nice.  They were very thoughtful. I had three house mothers at three different  dorms, and they were all very good.  What would happen?  Then we had   I forget what they called it, but it was a hall   it was, an  upperclassman would be the hall person.  Monitor.  Monitor   and that person would   but for some reason, they didn   t get  after me at all. So I was glad.  What would happen if you missed curfew? What were some of the  punishments?  Mostly just getting after you, I think. (Laughter) But like I said, I was  real surprised because I had heard some of them get a pretty good  12  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  talking-to.  And Esther, did your aunt and uncle make sure you were in at a certain  time or     No, I don   t recall, and I wasn   t dating that much and that wasn   t a  problem. I look back now and wonder if they wondered if maybe I  should have gotten in a little earlier, but I wasn   t really out all that late,  and I usually tried to let them know if there would be an evening activity  or whatever.  We grew up at a time when everybody was innocent and we wanted to  follow all the rules. It   s a different day out there now. But I think that  everybody just tried to   if you had to be home at a certain time. There is  one funny thing about the dorm life though. In the fall of    49, early  spring of    50   do you remember the panty raids? Do they still do those?  Well, now I   ve heard it described several different ways, mostly from a  male perspective, so you   re gonna have to give me the perspective.  Well, that would be very interesting to hear the male perspective  because I didn   t actually see it happen, but my college friend   this one I  talk to a lot   I just talked to her the other day, and we were up on the  second floor of Murray Hall and it   s on Monroe Street and the side of it  is on   I don   t remember the name of that street     Washington?     I   m not sure, but the guys came up on that side of the dorm yelling at  the girls, and the girls opened the window and communicating back and  forth, and then the girls threw their panties down. Can you believe that?  But she saw it happen and I lived in the middle of the dorm and I didn   t  see that happen. But that was weird, I thought. (Laughter)  That sounds about right. I   ve heard a few stories so far, but I   m glad you  didn   t participate. That   s good. (Laughter)  No, I can   t imagine.  Well, tell me about some of the places you liked to hang out on campus.  Where would you like to spend some time? Esther, where would you like  to hang out?  Well, I don   t know that I hung out that much there, but I did enjoy going  to the snack bar on the fourth floor of the Student Union. The Student  Union was built in the    50s, like    51. I think it was between our  13  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  sophomore and junior year, maybe the end of our sophomore year. And  it was just like a soda fountain   snack bar.  I remember having class at Williams Hall which was near the Fire  Station, and then a class at 1:00   that would have been 11:00 to 12:00  and then a class at 1:00 over in Home Ec West, and that was a far jaunt  to go home for lunch. I usually went back to Auntie and Uncle Chris     house for lunch, so I started going to the snack bar, and I would have a  grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. I can still taste it.  (Laughs) And that was a nice place. Then there were several nice sitting  rooms in the Student Union where you could meet someone and just  visit, or I used it that way.  Or study.  Or study, yes   quiet place to study if you didn   t want to go to the  Library.  Mary, where are some places on campus you found yourself spending  time?  Well, the Student Union, but also Theta Pond was just such a pretty  place to sit and just absorb the sunshine if you had a few minutes. I  remember it as just being a beautiful place. At the sorority house, we had  to study in the dining room. I had to meet certain hours of study and the  goal   they showed the freshman a trophy, and the one who got the best  grades could get their name engraved on the trophy, so that was quite an  incentive for us kids starting in to try to do good. So I studied and  studied and studied, and my name got on the trophy.  Good   Do you remember what the trophy was called? Did it have a name?  It   s still there. I don   t remember for sure but I believe    Outstanding  Freshman.    Next time I go, I   ll look.  And Marjorie, where did you spend time on campus?  Well, one of the questions you didn   t have on the list was about if you  worked and my freshman year I was an elevator operator at Willard. At  that time, they were hand operated. And I enjoyed that because I liked  people and you get to know everybody in the dorm pretty well. Then my  sophomore and junior years I worked in the cafeteria at Murray   even  after I was over in Stout, I went back to Murray and worked, and that  was also good.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  But, you know, just getting together with the girls in the dorm was  always fun, and I would go   a lot of people go over and buy a shake or  something, but I never felt like I had enough money to do that. (Laughs)  We would go to the Student Union for different things, and the Library,  and so all of those were good places.  Tell me about how the elevator worked.  Well, you had to try to hit the floor just right   to stop at the right spot.  You didn   t want to stop too low or too high.  And how would you stop it?  Well, that was the way you stopped it was     Was it all by hand?  Uh-huh.  And there was a mesh screen that they would pull across, like a gate for  keeping kids, separated   what would you call it, Marjorie?  Well, it was to keep you from falling out.  Right   yeah, that   s what it was for     Might get in after   so you wouldn   t get too many in at one time.  It was lattice      Yeah.     a lattice gate   metal.  And later they did have the more automatic ones. But I thought that was  a fun job.  Wow, what an interesting job.  Occasionally some of us would be asked, or we volunteered, to serve  banquets in the Student Union. Put on our little black uniforms     especially home ec majors   and serve the big banquets. The big  ballroom would be full of people. In my scrapbook, I have a program  from the 50th celebration of Home Ec; we all put on our little uniforms  and helped serve. You might see someone like Dr. Willham or Dr.  Bennett or other leaders on the campus.  15  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  And when we were working in the dorms, sometimes they would have  special dinners that we would   if you didn   t have a class right at the  time, we could serve on those and again, you wore a little fancier thing  when you did those.  Black uniform and little white apron, and it was fun.  Interesting. Did you spend much time in the Library? What do you  remember about the Library? It was fairly new?  It was new     Yeah.     while we were there.  Mary, do you have any memories of the Library?  Well, just study, study, study so much. I don   t know why, in my little  scrapbook I have a cheat sheet for my chemistry class. For one of the  finals, the teacher told us we could have just notes on one sheet, as long  as it was just one sheet but I   ve got it packed. But, the Library was a  great place to go. It was quiet, a good place to study when we didn   t  have to study in the dining room of the sorority house where we were  required to spend so much time.  I can   t hardly remember. I know we had a library, but also each  department or each college would have their own library and when it  was all moved to one big building you had to learn a lot about (Laughs)  where the material would be that you might be interested in using.  Did any of you take the library course? There was a course to help you  learn about using the Library.  I can   t remember whether I did or not.  Did you?  It was good, yeah. I thought that was interesting.  What did they teach you in that course?  Oh, about all the keys to where you could find different things and we  toured the Library     The Dewey Decimal System. (Laughs)  16  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Yeah, the Dewey Decimal System, and all of that   of course, anymore  there   s so much computer stuff, too, that it would be a lot different now,  but     I remember being at the dedication, standing out on the steps.  And they also had quite a few activities   special events that would be in  the area just to the south of the Library, there was a pretty big opening  there, and so sometimes they   d have special things go on there.  In the Library?  No     No, outside that.     just outside the Library.  Kind of a pavilion or whatever you want to call it   I guess a pavilion  has a cover, but anyway just that   where the fountain was. And  occasionally the fountain would get chemicals in it and we   d have a  purple fountain or a blue fountain. (Laughter) You remember that,  Marjorie? (Laughter)  Oh, you crazy students. (Laughter)  Talk about being crazy, about the first day of school of my freshman  year, I had a class in the HA building, the Household Arts. I got out the  little map and figured out it was clear across the campus. So I got up a  little early to get clear across, and when I got there it was the AH  building, (Laughter) Animal Husbandry. (Laughter) I soon learned not to  go in that direction anymore. (Laughter)  Well, what were some of the buildings that you took classes in? Did you  take all of your classes in the Home Ec building? Esther, what were  some of the buildings you took classes in? What were those classes?  Well, I took English in Williams Hall which was over by the Fire Station  and sometimes I remember having one or two classes in Old Central, the  oldest building, maybe history or something. I can   t remember for sure.  But when the new Home Economics West was built, we just thought we  were in heaven. So many lovely furnishings and elevators and library all  under one roof   it was just, it was very, very special. And it was built in  phases, so we graduated before the foods section was finished. Am I  right Marjorie, don   t you think? I think it was finished later.  17  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  She mentioned Old Central   I had a history class in Old Central, and I  remember so distinctly   I can still see him to this day   Alfalfa Bill  Murray coming for an interview     Oh, yeah?     and it was like   he was the governor    31 to    35, and so this would  have been more like    51 or    52   so numerous years later after he was  governor. But he was just not dressed like a governor. You   d think a  former governor would have on a suit and tie.  I don   t think he did when he was Governor. (Laughs)  He had ridden the bus up there because I actually took the bus back the  same day he went back. But it was so interesting because he didn   t really  look like a governor, but he had been our governor.  What was he wearing?  Well, you know, kind of just some   I hate to be recorded (Laughter)     but it wasn   t very     Well-pressed?  He was dressed down.  Dressed down   that   s the way   big time. (Laughter)  We   ll be very politically correct.  Big time dressed down, did not look politically correct. (Laughter)  Do you remember any other buildings that you had classes in?  Well, the same ones that Esther was talking about   I don   t recall any  other one at the moment.  Okay. And Marjorie?  Well, we had Quonsets   didn   t some of you have Quonset buildings,  too?  Yes, first year.  So, we had a number of different buildings we   d have classes. You   d  have to have a pretty good walk sometimes from one to another.  18  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  What was it like having a class in a Quonset hut? Do you remember     was it too hot, too cold, too loud?  I don   t remember it being any different than the other classes really. I  remember one time when we won some kind of game that a lot of the  students felt like we should have had a day off afterwards and there were  crowds that came by and wanted everybody to walk out of their class  and they called it a walk-out or something. I forget what they called it,  but anyway, I was in one of the Quonsets at that time.  Did the teacher let you out?  I don   t remember. (Laughter) I just remember them coming and yelling,     Come on  Come on      Well, let   s talk more about the Home Economics building. What kind of  appliances do you remember inside of it or some of the classes you  took   Mary?  Oh, we had a fantastic interior decorating teacher and class. I started to  bring   I still have this big notebook that she had us do of floor plans for  all the rooms where we arranged the furniture. We could move it around,  but it   s still glued where I finally decided it should be   and fabric  samples that we chose colors from for different parts, different  decorating in each room. But she had us drawing designs. I have some  still in my scrapbook of a chair, sort of an ornamental chair. I loved the  interior decorating and to this day some of her words still ring in my ears  that,    You start with a color that makes you happy,    and so turquoise is  my color and you can see this color     In your earrings.     in my earrings. (Laughs) And I   m moving to a place soon, and it   s  gonna be turquoise. The first home, when I married   I didn   t marry in  college, but in    56, three years later, we bought a home and guess what  color the living room wallpaper was? (Laughter) And then I was trying  to find an oil painting to go above the sofa and couldn   t find any  turquoise sky on any oil painting in Oklahoma City at any store   they  were all plain light blue  So I had an oil painting painted with a  turquoise sky, but it all goes back to my interior decorating teacher.  And what was her name, do you remember?  I have it written down     Pippen?  19  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Pippen, yes.  Okay. I   ll be looking in here to just review   but, yeah, it probably was  Ms. Pippen.  Ms. Pippen.  Okay. And Marjorie, any notable classes you remember?  I think I might have taken that class   and I also   we were talking about  that on our way up   the time that I had a roommate and then didn   t have  a roommate, you know because I thought,    Oh, it   s so good to have a  little more space to work,    (Laughs) and I could put some stuff out on  the bed. It was really a very good course. But all of the home ec teachers  I felt like were good. I really enjoyed them all.  What were some of the classes you took?  Well, you took the foods and nutrition and you took clothing and you  took   of course I was in home ec ed so we also took some education  courses. In your junior year, you went out and did observation and in  your senior year, you went and did student teaching. That was a lot of  fun, too.  We had a tailoring class, too. That was fun.  And I think we had one just called orientation. The very first year, you  took home ec orientation.  You got a taste of all the departments in which to major.  Childcare     Oh yeah, there was child development.  Esther, any memories?  Well, I remember after getting in the new building that each of the  professors had their own office   or they might have shared an office     but it was an open-door policy. You just felt free to go in and   maybe  have to schedule      Can I come back Friday afternoon?    if you wanted  to share something or get a little more help maybe or just to visit. I was  an officer, and I think Marjorie was, too, in some of the clubs and I felt  free to go by most any time and visit with the professor that I had in  home ec ed.  20  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  I   d like to talk a little bit about the practice houses. Do you remember  the practice houses?  Yes. (Laughs)  If you could, describe the location of the house, what was in it, what you  did in the house. Esther, I know we spoke a little bit earlier today about  it. Why don   t you start us off?  Well, there were two practice houses   one on South Monroe and one on  North Monroe. The North Monroe house was a newer home, and I think  it only had   I   m gonna say six people   but the South Monroe house  probably had ten or twelve   ten maybe, eight.  I don   t recall that. I just went to some classes there.  Anyway, it had several more students   and we lived there the whole  semester, for twelve weeks. I believe it was a rotation of twelve weeks  rather than a semester, and we did our own meals, and you were  responsible for either preparing or cleaning up or laundry and making  out the menus, doing the shopping   it was a practice. (Laughter)  Mary, any memories?  Well. (Laughter) I remember distinctly trying to prepare a recipe, and  the bread didn   t rise and I was so embarrassed that I went out and buried  it right outside the back door. Then I worried that the sunshine might  make it come up (Laughter) or that it might     It might rise then  (Laughter)     be too warm and might finally rise, but that   s probably one of my  biggest memories of the house. But it was a great experience.  How were you graded in the practice house? Or were the instructors     did they check in on you?  Well, they lived there, too.  Oh, wow.  In both cases, I think they were both single women and they lived there.  So they were there kind of watching out of the corner of their eye when  you were doing your lab work   I   d call it kind of a lab work.  Marjorie, were you in the practice house at all?  21  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  No, because I was married my senior year and that   s when I would have  been in the practice house. So they just had me make notes     A notebook.  Yes, do a notebook of all the things that you do. So I was practicing on  the job. (Laughter)  Let   s talk a little bit about student teaching. You guys did a little student  teaching your senior year. I   d like to know what that experience was  like. Esther, what was that like for you?  Fabulous.  And where did you do it at?  I did it in Guthrie with Martha Norman Sewell from Little Rock,  Arkansas. We buddied up and were selected to go to Guthrie. Mrs.  Camilla Starzer   Erickson now   was our instructor, an excellent home  economics teacher, and we were there for four weeks. But she was the  state president of the Vocational Home Economics and got to go to a  national convention, and left Martha and I in charge for a week. So we  were under our own supervision for a week but it was an excellent  experience   just really great. And the year before that, another girl and I  had gone to Elk City, and that was for just a week of observation and it  was an excellent experience. When you did your observing, you were  really just in the classroom watching the teacher and how she worked  with the students, and keeping notes   a notebook that would not end.  Mary, do you remember anything?  Heavens, yes. (Laughter) I had Della Conrad. Remember Della?  Oh, yes.  Della Conrad and I drove to Vian, Oklahoma and we stayed with the  principal and his wife, who was the home ec teacher   we stayed in their  home. So it was really a great experience. She was really helpful and  good, and let us   I still have the notebook of notes I did with little  cartoons along to illustrate the experiences we had. I didn   t bring it  though. (Laughs) But it was a really good   I remember us driving at  night clear across to Vian but we didn   t have any problems. Della did  the driving since I didn   t drive.  And Marjorie?  22  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  I did observation at Garber, Oklahoma. That was a real nice experience  except   I think it was about the second from the last day we were  there   three of the boys had skipped school and gone hunting, and they  had their guns behind the seat. They hit a bump and the guns went off  and I think two of them were killed. The bullets ricocheted and so that  was a very traumatic thing because it was a small school, compared to  some schools, and they were all very well liked young men, and it was  really hard.  That reminded me of something that had happened when I was in high  school. My next door neighbor on the farm was killed in an accident. He  and another boy were killed by a drunken driver when they   d just got  home from a football game and they were crossing the street to go to get  in their vehicle and were hit by this drunken driver. So I remembered  how that felt. It was terrible, and so that was a very traumatic  experience. And then, you all remember Ms. Merrifield?  Yes.  Well, when I did student teaching, we lived in her mother   s house and  that was real good. She was also   I think they kind of work it where  they   re gone a few days anyway while you   re doing your student  teaching and so that     Let   s you get the feel. (Laughter)  But I really enjoyed that. My husband didn   t enjoy it too much though  because he   d say,    I don   t want you being gone so much.    (Laughter)  We were still fairly newly married then.  Tell me about your favorite instructor or most influential instructor in  the Home Ec Department. Mary, do you have one?  Well, that would have to be the interior decorating with the turquoise.  (Laughter) I would say she probably made more points with me than any  of them.  Esther?  I guess it would be Laura Cole who was my home economics education  advisor and just got me started on the right track.  And Marjorie?  I really liked all of our home ec teachers. I liked the foods and nutrition  area real well, but one that probably made more of an impression on me  23  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  was Mrs. Ware. I had known her husband for a long time because he  was the poultry extension specialist. I   d known him all through my 4-H  work. But she was a good teacher and they were going   this was my  senior year, and one of the things was going to be a field trip to Tulsa to  visit some of the stores and my sister-in-law and brother-in-law had  come to visit. So I   d got permission for her to go with us. And they were  at a motel and they didn   t get there in time so I missed the trip. I felt so  bad because I   d really looked forward to that trip and I felt like I had a  loss there, but for some reason I didn   t ask her,    Well, how can I make  up for it?    and at the end of the semester, I got an    I    in the course.  (Laughs) I thought,    Oh, my. What happened?    and she said,    Oh, well,  you should have done some other things to make up for that,    but she   d  never said anything about it and I don   t know why I didn   t think to ask.  So I made it up and I got an    A    out of the course but I thought that was  smart to impress on you that you need to be responsible. (Laughs) But I  just felt like,    Oh, I   ve really missed out on a great opportunity.    I   d felt  like I was the loser already and then when I got an    I,    I was so  surprised   I imagine.  Do you have any other home ec related stories you would like to share  with us?  Home Ec Club and Omicron Nu. All those were fun, too.  Tell me about the Home Ec Club.  Well, how often did we meet? Do you all remember?  Monthly.  That   s what I was thinking, about monthly.  We had an overall Home Ec Club for all the departments, and then each  department had a club, and we met about monthly.  And what types of things did you do in the Home Ec Club?  Well, we   d have speakers.  Yeah, that   s what I was gonna say. I think we had speakers and then just  some time to get together and have fun.  Fun things. In September, usually we had a picnic catered by Clay Potts  Barbeque, and I remember my senior year I had to estimate how many  24  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  would show up at that picnic. We   d had sign-in sheets and so on, and  Ms. Cole and I finally came up with a number and   right on the nose.  Oh, that is great. (Laughs)  I mean, on the nose   110 or whatever it was, showed up for that picnic.  I hear he was quite     Oh, he was.      an impressive figure and lots of people would come out. How many  people were there approximately? Do you remember?  For that picnic?  Yes, for that picnic.  Oh, a 100 for that picnic and that was just the home ec people that had  been invited for that picnic. But he did barbeques all over the state and  all over the campus.  I can always remember him because I would help serve at some of the  things that he catered.  I thought you did.      and he   d always say,    Now, our fingers were made before spoons and  forks and the corn on the cob you pick up and eat like this   and the  chicken you don   t cut into it, you pick it up and eat it.    (Laughs) And he  was really fun.  Yeah, he was just a good     When you were asking about social things    one other big thing at OSU  when we were there was the basketball team and Henry Iba and the  stadium was so packed with kids     Noisy.     and we went clear up to the top of the stadium and yelled and  screamed until we were hoarse in class the next day, but it was so  exciting to be   here   s one  referring to her scrapbook       Aggies rated  number one team      and it was   and a sympathy card from my  boyfriend from OU. (Laughter)  25  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Did you attend wrestling, too, or just more basketball?  It was a big   basketball was so popular then.  Do you remember some of the players?  I wasn   t into players. Just the game.  Just Henry Iba.  Henry Iba was the coach.  Coach Iba. That was     This probably has some of the players    names in it, but     Well, I came and saw home football games, too, and some baseball. Of  course my family was pretty sports-minded. (Laughs)  Were there a lot of people at the football games?  Yeah, they had a pretty good turnout. They had a student section, you  know, and the students sat in one area together usually.  Had the flashcards.  Yeah, that was fun. (Laughter)  I didn   t participate in that, but I remember attending some of the games.  I have an article from the O   Collegian the day that Dr. Bennett was  buried, he and his wife.  Yeah, I want to talk about that, too, so go ahead.  No, go ahead.  Well, I was gonna say he was very well-known not just in Oklahoma but  all over the world. I was involved in the Hort Club, too, and the  people   I mean all the horticulture students were out of class for two or  three days making flower arrangements, plus all the florists all over the  state, and did you go to the funeral? I mean, that was the biggest funeral  certainly I   ve ever been to. I mean     Gallagher was full and overflowing.  Yes, and they had flowers from the floor up to where everybody sat, and  26  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  hanging all over. It was a beautiful service and then after him   I   m  gonna let her tell a little more about Dr. Bennett   s   but after him we had  Oliver Willham, and that man had a terrific memory. He could recognize  almost every student and call a lot by name. I mean, most of them   he  would be able to say your name when he saw you on campus. So that  was quite a feat I always thought.  Well, I think you felt like after we heard about their accident   he was an  older man, father figure   we didn   t know him personally, but we felt  like we did.  But see, Mary had met     He lived right on campus.  His wife was a teacher, and so     Yes, right. And so it was pretty traumatic. You wondered how could  they possibly find anyone to take his place?  Sure. He was so influential.  Yes. Yes.  Mary, what do you recall from Dr. Bennett?  Well, seeing him in church service and with his wife. I guess that   s the  most memorable part of it.  Did you go to the service, too?  Oh, yes.  I thought you probably would have.  What was the feeling   the mood on campus?  Oh, you knew something had happened. It was just solemn   something  big.   Interview pauses for a break   All right, let   s talk a little bit about Homecoming when you were  students. OSU is known for having one of the best Homecomings in  America. What was it like back then? Did you have parades? Did you  have house decorations? Just tell me a little bit about that. Let   s begin  with Mary.  27  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Well, we really did get involved in decorating the house and floats, and  spending hours and hours punching little pieces of tissue in that chicken  wire. And they were beautiful floats and beautiful parades. It was a big  thing. Once I was asked to ride on a float, and that was kind of fun in a  way. (Laughs) But they were enormous events.  Was the float you rode on a sorority float or     It was a fraternity. This thank you note I have in my scrapbook is from  the    TKEs,    so they were the ones that invited three of us to ride on it. I  still have the newspaper photo of us on it.  That   s great. Marjorie, what do you remember?  Well, I remember certainly the parades. Everybody enjoyed seeing that  and there were all the floats and everything, and then going by and  seeing everybody   s house decorations. And they   d start two weeks or so,  wouldn   t it be about   to take to get it all done because some of     particularly the fraternities and sororities   really did a magnificent job  of decorating. But the dorms did some, too, you know. They had  decorations. And, as I said, I was also in the Hort Club, the Horticulture  Club, and we did one all of flowers and leaves   it was all   like the  Rose Bowl parade, that float   and that was a lot of work, too, putting  things through. Again, you make your float whatever shape you want to  make it and then punching all of those through and working late at night  a lot of times because you still had your classes to go to, and so you did  that later, or in your spare time.  And Esther?  Well, since I wasn   t involved in either one of those, I just got to enjoy  the parade mainly, but I do know that it was lots and lots of work, and  we just prayed that it didn   t rain and melt that tissue paper. (Laughter)  I want to tell another story about a Homecoming. This was, I believe, the  year that I was a senior most likely and my husband had a Model-A car  which we rode in, and we went to see the decorations. All of a sudden  we stopped at one of the corners or something and it wouldn   t go  forward   it would only go in reverse. And then trying to decide do you  go in reverse on the wrong side of the road or on the right side of the  road to try to get out of the traffic because there   s always a lot of people  coming. That was kind of real hilarious   a little scary. (Laughter)  And families always tried to come at that time to visit.  Wow. That   s good. Have you attended many Homecomings after  28  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  graduation?  Some.  Have you tried to return for a few?  A few.  A few. Not as many as I   d like to have.  Yeah, same way, I think only two.  And do you remember when you were a student during Homecoming, the  football game? Was it a big deal like it is now?  Oh, I think probably more people attended.  Yeah, because a lot of families would come and stuff.  Right.  It was really big.  And just traffic was something   and you think traffic is bad now, well,  it was bad then, too (Laughter) on Homecoming weekend for sure.  Where would they all park?  Well, wherever they could   someone   s driveway and hope they weren   t  blocking them in.  Do you remember any campus traditions, things students did? You   re  shaking your head, Marjorie. Do you remember anything?  One thing   she was talking about Theta Pond, and I agree   Theta Pond  was really nice, but they also had a tradition of when somebody got  pinned or engaged, they would throw the fella in Theta Pond, and that  was one tradition.  Any others?  I really don   t remember any, other than just like Mary said, it was a  good place to visit, walk through. I was going to mention that if they  hadn   t made a sidewalk or a path across campus and enough students  made one, then they would gravel it  (Laughter) After the Library and  the Student Union were put together, that   s why we have so many  29  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  unusual sidewalks going in all directions out from the Theta Pond.  Do you remember any tug-of-wars happening in Theta Pond between the  different classes?  I don   t know about different classes, but I think maybe   like some  fraternities would against each other. I don   t know that I ever actually  witnessed one.  I was never involved in one, so I don   t recall really.  I can   t remember. Seems like I heard about that, but I don   t remember  ever witnessing it.  Well, tell me a little bit about the music of the day. Did you listen to any  music while you were in school back then? What types of artists do you  remember? Mary?  Well, I was afraid you were gonna ask me (Laughter) because I was  really not into music like kids are now. I dearly love classical and gospel  music but I really did not have a collection of   I practiced the piano  when I was a little girl   taking piano lessons, but I really was not into  bands and all. I didn   t spend time listening to them on the radio or  anything like a lot of kids do and did probably then   but maybe you all  can tell her.  Well, the big band sound was definitely in, and I still enjoy Tony  Bennett and Bob Hope. I think it was Bob Hope that came and we went  to the Gallagher Hall and listened to him. I   m pretty sure it was Bob  Hope   it could have been another artist, but it was a big deal.  Yeah, those Allied Arts situations were good and now what do they  have, the Orange Peel or something?  Sure.  But, I mean, that would be kind of the same thing but you had something  really special. And I remember one year I took choir or glee club, but I  enjoyed going when the choir sang their concerts.  Yes. I think we all had to take Glee Club.  Yeah, but I wasn   t that good a singer. I did enjoy singing with a lot of  people who were good singers. But I   m like you, it didn   t seem like we  had that much time really. I mean, you study and then I was working,  and I don   t remember listening to any special other than going to just the  30  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Rogers  Moorhead  special concerts and things was mostly what we did.  But I   m sure on weekends, there were those who     Yeah, I   m sure there were.     went to the Union. There were places in the Union that would have  small dance areas and jukebox or whatever   I don   t think too much of it  was live.  Did you spend any time outside of campus? Were there hang-outs that  you visited?  Eskimo Joe   s was not there. (Laughter) The Campus Corner was     Yeah.  Yeah, Campus Corner.  What was the name of that? I wrote it down I think   McCaffrey   s     some went to McCaffrey   s Drug Store, and then Campus Corner. Like  we said, each one of us had our youth groups from church. Our church  youth groups were off campus, but not too far off.  And they showed movies, too, didn   t they? In certain areas of the  Union? Maybe not every weekend, but frequently.  Well, and there was a movie theater pretty close there.  There was one theater.  The Leachman?  Yes.  We got to go to once in awhile.  And you walked to the movie theater or walked to downtown?  We didn   t go downtown too much. (Laughs)  No, never downtown.  I did because I would go occasionally, you know, with my aunt or I  knew where they shopped downtown. Katz Department Store was a  big     31  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  I will tell something   my husband was from New York originally, and  he came in his Model-A from New York and he had already been to  college after the war and had gone a year or so, but he wanted to go into  horticulture. So he wrote all the colleges west of the Mississippi because  he had decided he wanted to be where it was friendly and all     Oklahoma A M was the first one to write back. Then he sent his  transcript and was accepted. Being prompt (Laughs) made a difference  to him and he came here. When he came, it was on a weekend and so he  couldn   t get to the place where you enroll and all, and so he went to one  of the little cafes downtown, and everybody was    Hi,       Howdy,       How  are you doing?      stuff like that. He thought,    There must be somebody  that looks just like me.    (Laughter) He really thought that they were  mistaking him for somebody else because they were all so friendly.  (Laughter) And so I think that made a very good first impression on him.  His very first impression of Oklahoma was when he was coming back  on the troop train after he had been in China in the service. And they  stopped for refueling or something in El Reno. A farmer with a  truckload of watermelons came up and told the officer of the day that  they could all get off and have as much watermelon as they wanted. He  was very impressed by that. So that was one reason he sent  a letter  to  Oklahoma     That   s cute.  I   m not from Oklahoma   everybody is just really friendly here. I just  moved here about six months ago, so I   m impressed myself.  Well, welcome to Oklahoma.  We would have thought you were a native and knew 99 percent of what  we   re telling you. (Laughter)  Did you do a lot of dating with the boys? Did they ask you out on dates?  (Laughter)  I had a boyfriend that was going to OU from high school, and I really  kind of thought   we weren   t dating that closely or that much, but I kind  of thought when we both got our degrees that we might take the next  step. Well, that didn   t happen. So I don   t know that I held back any, but  I might have. So I wasn   t dating that much.  Well, basically I want to know what a typical date was like back then.  Well, it could be just to the Library to study. It could be up to the corner  32  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  to have a soda or in to a movie   now Mary, go ahead.  Or to a movie. There were just real simple   go out and didn   t go to  dinner.  No, I can   t think     Heavens no. Just go for a walk or go to the movie...  Study together.     and that was it. When I was in high school, I kind of went steady with  a boy that went to OU, but he ended up going to West Point and I really  was a little   kind of thought he was real interesting and nice so I  didn   t   I dated on campus, but didn   t really fall madly in love with  anybody on campus. But after college, then I met this young guy  (Laughter) and we married three years after I graduated.  So Marjorie, you just studied?  Well, I did date, of course, before I got married (Laughter) but I didn   t  date much my freshman, sophomore year   it was probably mostly my  junior year.  You would study together or     He was in the Horticulture Department and so we did activities together.  Not only did they do things like the float every year, but they also made  apple cider and sold as a money-making project. We   d go out to the  place where the cider press was and there   d be a bunch of us go out to  do that, but     It was more group dating.  Yeah, that   s true.  Wesley Foundation   go over and be with everybody     Yeah, it wasn   t        and walk   maybe someone would walk you home and maybe  someone wouldn   t.  Or maybe it   d be a whole group. I was probably the only girl in the Hort  Club and so a lot of times there   d maybe be eight or ten of them walk  me home. (Laughter) So, I mean, that was fine.  33  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Rogers  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  How did you get involved in the Horticulture Club?  I had been president of the National Junior Horticulture Association, and  so Fred Lacrone   who was later Vice Dean of Students, but he was a  horticulture professor, and I had known him as an extension  horticulturist when I was in 4-H   invited me to speak to the Hort Club  banquet. They had a Hort Show every year where people from all over  the state would bring things in and display, and they would do things  and it was a pretty big deal. So they invited me to speak at the banquet,  which I did, and Dick  Marjorie   s husband  was there. I didn   t really  know him that night, but later on they invited me to join the Hort Club  and that   s how we got acquainted.  Later on, after you   ve graduated   a couple of years after you  graduated   Oklahoma A M   s name changed to Oklahoma State  University. Did you feel that was a good change or bad change or you  wanted it to stay the same or     They did a good selling job. (Laughter)  I thought it was fine   Oklahoma State University. It wasn   t quite so  agricultural and mechanical only, so Oklahoma State University was a  good name.  I thought so, too. It was just the shock, we just weren   t quite ready for a  change, but it was the thing to do, yes.  I think they pretty much impressed that    university    is better than     college    because   and there are colleges within the university, but  that   a university is considered higher ranking kind of, and so I think  they did a pretty good selling job. I don   t think many of us really were  anti.  No.  Now the name of your school changed from Home Economics to Human  and Environmental Sciences. How did you feel about that change?  Well, again, that was keeping up with the times. Other universities  across the nation were progressing in that direction, and it was time for  Oklahoma to follow suit, I think. We   ve always had outstanding  leadership in the home economics field at OSU, from Dean Talbot when  we were there and she was the beginning.  She was very good.  34  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  She was the beginning dean and clear on through to our search for a new  one. As far as I know, we don   t have a full-time one right now, but     We have a new president.  Yes, but it was good choice. We   ve just always had good leadership.  But we may still call it the other. (Laughter)  Oh, yes, and we know what we   re talking about. (Laughter)  We still refer to it as Home Ec.  And then   see, it   s kind of like home demonstration clubs and then  home extension clubs and then they   ve changed several more times.  Well, it   s still the same group. (Laughs) I mean it is.  It is.  The organization   American Association of Family and  Consumer Sciences   is celebrating 100 years of shaping the future of  individuals, families, and communities.   And after we graduated there was home economist in business     HEIB   and then there was home economist in homemaking   HEIH     And then extension.     and then the extension. So, you can   t get those letters all straight, and  the name had to change.  Yes.  Now I don   t want you ladies to be modest, but when you were students at  Oklahoma A M, did you win any awards in any of the activities you  participated in? You   ll just have to tell me if you did. Anybody?  All of us did. (Laughter)  Let   s begin with Mary then. Tell me about it, Mary. I   ll put you on the  spot first.  Well, I did make    Who   s Who    and I wrote down a few things because I  had forgotten I was involved in a couple of these things. It said I was a  Delta Kappa Gamma scholarship winner four years. I was in Orange  Quill and Orange and Black Quill. I was one of ten Outstanding Home  Ec freshman. I was Home Ec Consumer Education class president.  Anyway, it goes on   Omicron Nu, and I was a Great Issues Council  35  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  secretary and a member of the Young Democrats and Future Teachers of  America. I was Aggievator Girl of the Month once.  Oh, wow. (Laughter)  My picture   s on something here. (Laughter) But I was very honored to  have done that   gotten in     I can   t even think of the name, but I was thinking   you also got the one  where they put the letter on your door or something at the end     seniors     Yeah. What   there are a few more things written down here that I didn   t  mention, but anyway I was very honored. I did try to study.  That   s good. Esther, tell me about your honors.  Well, I tried to study but I wasn   t as scholarly as either one of these gals.  I made good grades, but I wasn   t as scholarly. I wasn   t in Omicron Nu  and Orange and Black Quill, but I was active in the home economics  organizations and was an officer each year and ended up being the  president my senior year. I felt that was quite an honor. I think it took  me down the road to a successful professional career in home  economics   32 years   and a 55-year member of the national  organization, AAFCS.  She taught home ec 32 years.  Wow.  When we got out of college, they formed a Home Ec Alumni  organization, and I was asked to be the first president.  Yes, I was just getting ready to say that.  My husband was an attorney, and so I think that was a way to get the  bylaws all set up. (Laughter)  For free  (Laughter)  I didn   t really say that. (Laughter)  But it   s probably true  (Laughter)  And then Esther is     36  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  I   m a past president also.  She   s a past president and     I helped get this gang together plus some others for our 50th   worked  real diligently locating people.  Oh, I bet.  Of course, the college helped a lot but some people don   t always stay in  touch with the college and so we had to do some research. Now  Marjorie, you had quite a career, too, at school.  Well, part of the way I paid for my schooling was I won several  scholarships in 4-H. I remember one occasion I was taking   and I can   t  remember the lady   s name that taught this chemistry class, but it was  one of our requirements and she was     I   ll think of it in a minute.     she was a tall, large woman   she was a good teacher. And that year I  missed one week to go to National 4-H Club Congress and one week to  go to the National Junior Vegetable Growers Association   and we  missed a week each for those things. At the end of the semester, she told  me,    Well, I   m sorry. You just got a    B   , you lacked one-tenth of one  point of making an    A,       and I thought,    Well, I was happy with a    B     till I knew I was that close,    and     Dr. Gerber.  Yeah.  Or Ms. Gerber rather.  So I did win some awards. I don   t remember what all they were, and I  was in several organizations, too, but at the end of each year at that time,  I think it was the state Home Demonstration Clubs   gave a scholarship  or some kind of an award to the senior Home Ec graduate who had been  very active in home ec, and maybe we might have had to have been a  former 4-H member. I can   t remember that, but anyway I was honored  to get that and some of the other things. One other and this wasn   t  anything to do with home ec, but did any of you have anything to do  with Religious Emphasis Week on campus?  Probably. Can   t put my finger on anything, but we did     37  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Rogers  I was involved in the planning and all on that, and my senior year they  asked if I would be chairman and I really wanted to be in a lot of ways,  but then I thought,    I   m gonna be doing student teaching. I   m married  and going to take on the household,    so I just helped again that year, but  it was fun getting to meet a lot of the speakers. They   d have quite a few  speakers come and     Out of state speakers.  Yeah. Some of them out of the country speakers.  Yes, that   s true.  I got to introduce Kagawa and I always thought that was quite an honor,  you know, to do that. But it was real interesting to do that and to work  with that, too.  Oklahoma State is   from an outsider looking in   has a very unique  group of alumni and students. Everybody feels this great pride of being a  student or alumni. Tell me a little bit about what you think sparks such  loyalty in alumni and students? Esther, let   s begin with you.  Goodness. Well, I think it comes from the faculty. I think they have  always had an excellent faculty, and I think that carries over to the  students and they   re just dedicated. I think they   re helpful to students  and just initiate pride, and that just goes out   ripple effect all over the  country and comes back then when needed. That   s why we have an  outstanding Alumni Association   I mean, one reason.  Marjorie?  Well, that was one of the things I had thought of   good caring teachers.  They were good instructors and they cared. They really did care about  the students and would help you in lots of ways. I only had one professor  I really didn   t like, and he was a sociology teacher and he embarrassed  us all so much. That was the one class I attended where the boys would  sit on one side and the girls on the other. (Laughs) I mean, I thought he  was too far ahead of me for sure. That was not one I enjoyed, but most  all of my other classes I really did enjoy. And I think it was the teachers  and then you make a lot of good friends and there   s a lot of great  memories, so all of that kind of goes into it.  And it   s such a gorgeous campus and was a real wholesome experience.  I   m very grateful for having made that choice to go because I do  attribute a lot to the professors and especially the School of Home  Economics.  38  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moorhead  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Yeah.  I shouldn   t call it home economics.  That   s what it was when we were there. (Laughter)  I truly   and a lot of that, it   s helped our lives to this day, the things we  learned.  Being active in the Home Economics Club, we had an opportunity in our  upper class years to visit other colleges for a conference in the spring.  We   d get on a bus, those who could go. You would get to visit other  campuses and we always came back and say,    Ours was so pretty,     sticking with the Georgian architecture. So many of the other campuses  have this style and that style, but ours is more uniform   not always, but  more uniform. And I think that adds to a feeling of warmth to the  campus.  Has anyone mentioned Dr.   the doc that took the pictures     referring  to Doc Pruitt   Oh, yeah. But he had a great memory, too. What class did he teach? I  took a class under him.  Yes. Photography.  I didn   t take photography, but I know who you   re talking about.  Well, I just thought   I had it just a minute ago.  Your first class, he would take a picture of everybody.  Yes. Yes. And he made all of the dances   all of the sorority houses, all  the fraternity proms   and take pictures, and you would have them on  Monday morning. I mean, he worked all weekend getting those out, he  and his staff.  Was there a dark room in the photography class or     Oh, yes.  I don   t think I took photography, but I took some course that he taught  but he was well known for that, and by the time the next class met he  would be looking at their pictures and be able to say who they were.  (Laughter)  39  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  We   ve had one person mention him in other interviews. I   d have to go  back and     Well, I may think of it. I can   t     Did he have a top hat?  Yes, he wore a top hat always, and it starts with a    P.     Not in class, I don   t think.  No. No.  Perky sounds right, but I think that   s actually somebody in Ag.  I think back   I just had a little box camera, but I took pictures and  developed and then learned a little bit about the process, but     And to this day, she   s still doing it   I have a little better camera, but not too much. (Laughter)  Well, I   d like for each of you to tell me what graduation day was like, if  you can remember. I know this is a question that was not on the list.  Well, family all came usually and that was something pretty big.  And did you graduate in Gallagher?  Yes, in the Field House.  And I really took some summer classes at OCU and at UCO, and so I  graduated a semester early. I had that middle of the school year  graduation so it wasn   t quite   it was a different time, but it was nice. I  remember it, but it wasn   t probably the big deal like     The big May graduation.     at the end of the Spring.  And did they have it in the Field House?  Yes.  And did your parents come up?  40  Rogers  Moesel  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Yes, they sure did.  Yeah, most everybody   s parents tried to come. I mean, this was a big  deal.  It was.  Esther, do you remember anything about graduation day?  Not any more than what   s already been said. It was a   I don   t want to  say scary   challenging moment,    We made it,    (Laughs) and tears of  joy and then tears of anticipation right down the road. I was fortunate  enough to know where I was going. In three months, I would be standing  in front of a classroom of kids   girls, and I felt very fortunate in that. A  lot of the students were still looking for jobs.  Well, I   d like each of you to tell me a little bit about your families, what  you ended up doing after you left OAMC for your careers, and kind of  catch me up between then and now, okay? Let   s start with you, Marjorie.  Okay. Well, I was married one year before I got out of college. My  husband graduated before we married and he worked at Stillwater Floral.  And then after I graduated probably by the next fall after that, well we  went to Enid and our first son was born while we lived in Enid. Then he  went back for graduate studies at Ohio State and got his master   s and  taught some there. Then he taught at Rutgers University in New Jersey  and then, he was from New York, but he really liked Oklahoma, so he  was anxious to come back. So we ended up coming back to Oklahoma  and worked in Pauls Valley for Bond Florist and then went into business  for ourselves later. He died four years ago but this is our 50th year in  business. I still have the business.  Oh, wow.     Moesel   s Hort-Haven    is what it   s called and we have four living  children. Rodd is our oldest son, and he went to OSU. He did not  graduate. He went into business before he graduated. Rodd continues to  be very involved with OSU. He is on the Dean of Agriculture   s  Advisory Committee, has been a member of search committees for  Director of Extension Service and Dean of Agriculture, and is current  president of the Oklahoma 4-H Foundation.  And then next is Eva, and she married after high school. She does a lot  of writing for religious magazines and what not. Then we have, our next  son is Bruce, and he got his degree in business at OSU. And then  Douglas, our youngest son, got both his bachelor   s and master   s at OSU,  41  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  and that was in the area of horticulture, but then he got his doctorate at  Texas A M. He   s teaching at the University of Missouri. And then our  youngest baby was born   he died pretty soon after he was born, so we  have a good family. We have one other   one granddaughter who went  to OSU at Oklahoma City in nursing, and her name is Chrissy Lincoln.  Oh, wow. You have     That   s our daughter   s daughter.     lots of orange in your blood.  Yeah. (Laughter)  Not red blood, but orange blood.  We have a lot of people who are OSU fans. (Laughs)  All right, Esther. Tell me what happened. Catch me up.  Catch you up. Well, as I said, I had a job waiting for me and it was in  Clinton, Oklahoma. Dr. Harris had hired me   he was working on his  doctorate at OSU   interviewed me in the Student Union and he said,     Now don   t call me. I   ll call you.    But I kind of knew maybe, you know,  hopefully   so I got the call that we would be there, and it was a two-teacher  department and the other girl that was a beginning teacher also  from OCW Chickasha. Her professor had told her,    One of you will  have to be head of the department.    Well, two beginning teachers     who   s gonna be the head? We didn   t need a head. We just needed to  work together, and we did.  After the first month, we each had an apartment and we decided that was  silly. We were spending all of our time together comparing notes and  planning lessons so we moved in together that first year, and then she  married at the end of that year. I stayed another year and met my  husband, a teacher, and was married the next summer. We moved down  to Purcell and he started working on a doctorate which didn   t work out  for him, but I taught. Then we moved to several small towns and for my  last 25 years of teaching at Berryhill High School in Tulsa, and  thoroughly enjoyed it. We had no children   have twelve nieces and  nephews. After 40 years we made it full circle and returned home to  Geary, where I grew up, and that   s where I live now in the home my  parents built after they retired from the farm.  Nice. All right. And Mary?  42  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Well, I graduated in January and then International Harvester had one  home economist in each state, so I was the home economist in  Oklahoma. I drove around Oklahoma giving demonstrations showing  people how to properly freeze food of all things     Wow.     package it for the   freezers had just come on the market. My second  job was Associate Home Editor for the Farmer Stockman magazine. I  traveled in Oklahoma and Texas interviewing and photographing farm  women. Anyway at my job, this young man was applying for a job and I  knew we had met before. I decided I   d leave at the same time he was  leaving, and we walked down the stairs   there wasn   t an elevator   but  we walked down together, and then he asked me out at the bottom of the  stairs. (Laughs) He was in law school. We dated three years and we  practically every night had a date. The doctor finally told me I had  chronic fatigue (Laughs) and     Better get married   His name was Cleeta John Rogers. Anyway, he was a member of the  Oklahoma Legislature. He had been elected to the House of  Representatives at the age of 21. We were married in    56 and in    57 he  was chosen Oklahoma City   s    Outstanding Young Man    which was  really, I thought, a great honor. He was a wonderful Christian  gentleman, and we had three children   Rosemary, Rand and Rod.  Rosemary went to OU and she   I was an Alpha Chi vice-president, but  she was president of Alpha Chi at OU. Now she   s an attorney after  attending OU Law School. Rand, our middle son, went to OU but he  was killed in an accident about six years ago now. And Rod loved to do  experiments with little white mice when he was in junior high school  over at the OU Medical Center and I drove him back and forth to take  care of his little mice   but he went to Dartmouth and then to OU  Medical School. He   s a urologist in California now   this morning doing  robotic surgery. He called on my cell phone on the way over here today.  They   re great children.  We   ve lived in Oklahoma City the whole time and my husband died 11  years ago. I did work for the state as a social work supervisor for the  Department of Human Services for 20-plus years. I taught home ec, but  only a short time until our first child was   until Rosemary was on the  way   so it   s been a great life.  Is there anything else you ladies would like to add that we have not  spoken about today? Any stories you want to share? Any influential  people you want to mention from your time back at Oklahoma A M?  43  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moorhead  Anything that I have left out and totally forgot to ask, and something you  think is important for us to know?  Well, there was a big hail storm our freshman year     I was gonna mention that.     and I was in the dorm. I think it was a Sunday, anyway   it was a  Sunday.  It was April 1, 1950.  Yeah, I was on the third floor, and all of a sudden saw this black stuff  coming down   well, the roof   we were losing the roof.  It was slate.  I mean it was a huge hail storm and I wanted to go to DSF that night or  to church that night and so I took a cab because you didn   t want to walk  in all that hail. I remember that a lot and all the horticulture greenhouses  with glass roofs and it just not only broke the glass, but then the glass  broke all the plants inside. My husband lived in the hort shed   he  wasn   t my husband at the time but that was part of his job, watching  over the greenhouse. All of the horticulture students had to work  cleaning up for several days, and it was a terrible thing. There was a lot  of expense repairing all the buildings. That was big hail. It   s the biggest  hail I   ve ever been in.  You remember the date, Mary?  April 1, 1950.  Wow. That must have really stuck with you for you to remember the  date.  It was a big storm.  It was a big hail. (Laughs)  And the roof of Murray Hall   the dorm, the slate was     Coming off.     coming off.  I   m sure we had damage probably where I was staying, but I don   t  44  Nykolaiszyn  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moesel  Rogers  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Moorhead  Moesel  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  remember the hail storm precise     Wow.  It was a lot of hail.  That   s interesting. Well, anything else you   d like to share? Feel free to  jump in there.  The only other little thing I didn   t mention   Marjorie was trying to tell  me what   I got a little honor that was under the door   it was that Phi  Kappa Phi     Yeah, that   s what I was trying to remember. (Laughs) That was a very  high honor.  That was a great honor, but it was a great life. Great happy memories.  And I would encourage everyone to participate to their fullest when they  go to college. Don   t be all academic oriented because it takes all of it to  be a well-rounded successful individual.  Sure.  All of these activities that we were involved in have made us who we  are.  And I do think those students need to study, too. (Laughs)  Well, yes.  And some of them do all the other and none of the studying, so I think  that is important   all of it. I agree that being involved in several things  is fun. I just think we were lucky to have so many good teachers.  Be there at the right time.  And I know they still have a lot of good teachers.  Any other advice for students, Mary   current students?  Just try to live a well-rounded life and not get involved in a lot of this  stuff that young people seem to be trying out now. Just know that it   s not  the thing to do and live upstanding lives and find a church home that  they   it   s just like a home away from home.  45  Nykolaiszyn  Rogers  Moorhead  Rogers  Nykolaiszyn  Moorhead  Nykolaiszyn  Well, we do appreciate you taking some time out of your day to meet  with us, to share your stories with us. We do appreciate it very much.  Well, we appreciate the time you all are taking, too.  Yes.  To learn what it was like back in the old days   that you   re even  interested.  We   re very interested.  We really do appreciate it, Juliana.  All right. Well, thank you very much ladies.  -------  -------
