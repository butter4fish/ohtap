 Finchum Today is February 13, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we are  in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to speak with Marge Rohl. This is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project, so thank you for allowing us to come  today. Let   s start by having you tell us when and where you were born.  Rohl I was born in Buffalo, New York, and I was the second in my family. In  other words I had a sister, who died when she was very young. I always  thought my family were especially careful, you know, wouldn   t let me  get into trouble. (Laughs) Shucks. (Laughter)  Finchum And when were you born? When   s your birthday?  Murphy What   s your date?  Rohl December. December 8, 1914.  Finchum Okay, and what did your parents do for a living?  Rohl My father and his brothers were in business and I don   t know if I can  pin it down to one thing, but they dealt a lot with farmers. I   m not too  sure about it, other than they kind of changed with how things work.  You know, it started out with horses and wagons and they went to  automobiles.  Murphy Can I prompt?  Finchum Sure.  Murphy They started out with horses and then they went into seat covers and  things that were made with leather.  5  Finchum They went into seat covers and things that were made into leather?  Rohl I didn   t hear you really.  Murphy Grandpa and the brothers started out with horse collars, leather shoes,  and leather things, and then when they didn   t have horses, they moved  to making seat covers and things for automobiles.  Rohl Yeah, that   s right.  Murphy I know you know.  Rohl She knows more about it than I do. (Laughter) You know, you don   t  pay attention to those things unless you   re interested in it. That   s how it  is.  Finchum Were there other children besides you and your sister?  Rohl No.  Finchum Were you born in a hospital or at home?  Rohl I don   t know, probably at home.  Finchum And where did you go to elementary school?  Rohl In Buffalo, New York, School 39.  Finchum Was it a small school?  Rohl When you   re a kid everything is bigger. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, did you have a favorite subject?  Rohl No. I don   t remember any.  Finchum How would you get to school?  Rohl Walk.  Bishop Did it ever snow? (Laughs)  Rohl Our school didn   t have all of the facilities that a modern school had.  You know, like they didn   t have a home ec department, so we would  6  have to walk to another school to get that part. I remember having to do  that. Didn   t like it very much.  Finchum Especially in the winter?  Rohl (Laughs) Yes, especially then. You don   t know what weather is until  you experience Buffalo weather. (Laughter)  Finchum Well what would you take for your lunch, or would you walk home for  lunch?  Rohl I think we walked home for lunch until I got to high school then it was  too far to walk.  Finchum What year would you have graduated from high school, 1931,    32,  something like that? Were you eighteen?  Murphy I think she was younger.  Finchum Finished high school younger? You don   t know? Okay, we   ll move on  then.  Rohl It   s all a long time ago. (Laughs) I   m glad to have finished.  Murphy I just remember her saying that when she went to college she was  younger than most of the other students, and so I assumed she might   ve  graduated at sixteen, seventeen, from high school. Her birthday being in  December, that   s logical.  Finchum So once you finished high school, what did you do?  Rohl I went to a teachers college. The only thing was a teachers college  because I remember wanting to go to Cornell, but my folks were dead  set against   I couldn   t go that far away. They couldn   t keep track of  me. (Laughter)  Finchum So where did you go?  Rohl A teachers college in Buffalo   State.  Finchum Buffalo State? Was that a two-year to get a teaching certificate?  Rohl Probably it   s a four-year.  Murphy Yeah, it was a four-year school.  7  Finchum Four-year, okay.  Murphy It was started as a Normal School, but I   m pretty sure it was four years  when she went.  Finchum What was your major?  Murphy What did you major in?  Rohl Yeah, I know the question. I guess home economics is the answer.  You   re asking me a lot of question that I haven   t even thought about.  (Laughter)  Finchum It   s kind of fun to think about though, isn   t it?  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum What kind of courses would you have had? Learning how to sew, or  cook, or what?  Rohl I remember that the first year you took everything. You know,  everybody took the same thing. Then you could specialize after that. It   s  crazy to think about it, but one of my friends said,    Well, why don   t you  do this Marge, because you like cooking and sewing. So why don   t you  go into home ec?    That   s how I got there.  Murphy Career choice.  Bishop Peer influence? (Laughter)  Finchum Did it turn out to be a good choice?  Rohl Yeah, very good.  Murphy Did you make close friends when you were in college?  Rohl Yes.  Murphy Talk a little bit about your friends    group.  Rohl God, I made close friends. We usually stayed out of trouble, but  sometimes we didn   t. (Laughs) Help me out.  Murphy Well, they were all in home ec, too. All of your close friends were in  home ec, too. Mary, and Ethel, and Anne, and Dorothy, and I missed  one. Do you remember anything else about them?  8  Rohl Yeah, okay.  Finchum Do you remember anything else about them   your girlfriends? Would  you go to dances?  Rohl No, I don   t think so, not the first year. After a while I had a boyfriend  and he liked to dance, so we did a lot of that.  Murphy Where did you meet your boyfriend?  Finchum Where did you meet your boyfriend?  Rohl I lived in the city of Buffalo, but our family had a farm that had been in  the family and that was in a small village about twenty miles east of  Buffalo. So I had a lot of friends from that area because we spent the  time in the summer; we   d spend it in the country. You   re really  dragging me open. (Laughter)  Finchum How did you meet the boyfriend? Where did you meet him?  Rohl I think   well, it was at a dance. And you don   t have to go to the dance  as a couple, so a bunch of us went to the dance. We met there and it  went on from there. (Laughs)  Finchum What was his name?  Rohl Burton.  Finchum Burton.  Murphy And he became your husband.  Rohl What?  Finchum She said,    And he became your husband.     Rohl Yeah.  Finchum How did he pop the question?  Rohl Oh God, I don   t remember.  Finchum You just said yes.  Rohl Yeah.  9  Finchum And when did you get married? Do you remember what year?  Rohl Oh boy, I have to think about that.  Finchum How old were you when you got married, do you remember?  Rohl Well, I was in college.  Murphy No.  Finchum We   ll look it up later.  Murphy No, you were teaching.  Finchum She said you were already teaching when you got married.  Rohl Yes. I taught in a school in New York State in part of the southwest  corner. They raised grapes, and the kids used to brag about how many  grapes   they closed school and the children all worked in the fields  picking grapes. I didn   t think too much about it at the time, but it was  interesting.  Finchum Well, in your early married life it would   ve been Depression time in the  early    30s   the Depression?  Rohl What was the question?  Finchum Do you have any memories of the Depression, living through the  Depression?  Rohl I remember my father talking about it, and he and this brother were in  business so it was difficult to live. They needed the business, but still  the farmers couldn   t pay. So they gave a lot of credit I guess. Yeah.  Finchum Did your mother work?  Rohl No.  Finchum Did she do a lot of sewing?  Rohl Yeah, she was very good at it.  Finchum Make your clothes?  Rohl Yeah, until I got big enough I had to do it myself. (Laughter)  10  Finchum Would you create your own pattern, or use a store-bought one?  Rohl No, I didn   t get that creative. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you take music lessons?  Rohl I took piano. I wasn   t very good at it, and I didn   t really stick to it.  That   s it.  Finchum Talk a little bit about the house you grew up in   the house.  Rohl Yeah, what about it?  Finchum Tell me a little bit about it. Describe it for me.  Rohl Oh     Finchum How many bedrooms and that sort of thing.  Murphy Fifty-five Timon Street, you know it. You can even picture it.  Rohl I don   t think about it much and I don   t remember very much. I know we  lived there and my mother and I would sometimes like to move, but it  was convenient for my father and he was the boss. (Laughs)  Finchum Did it have two stories or one?  Rohl One.  Finchum Did it have indoor plumbing?  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum That   s pretty good.  Rohl We also had a garage to keep the car in. (Laughter)  Murphy Did you have sidewalks?  Finchum Did the city have sidewalks?  Rohl Yeah.  Murphy What did you do on the sidewalks?  11  Finchum What did you do on the sidewalks?  Rohl Roller-skate.  Murphy And what happened then? And what happened?  Rohl I fell and broke my arm. (Laughs) Shoot. (Laughter)  Finchum Well what was Christmas like?  Rohl Good question. (Laughter)  Finchum Would you have a tree?  Rohl Yeah. The only thing I really remember about that is that they kept very  quiet. My mother had a lot of sisters and my father had brothers, but  anyway, they didn   t let me do much of anything, okay? I was the  protected kid. (Laughs)  Finchum Does that mean you were spoiled a little bit, too?  Rohl Probably, I don   t know. (Laughs) I   d like to think that they didn   t spoil  me, but I had everything they could afford to give me.  Finchum I guess we should back up and ask, what was your maiden name?  Rohl Schamber. Schamber   S-C-H-A-M-B-E-R.  Finchum Okay. Well what were some of the favorite foods that your mother  cooked for you?  Rohl I guess the answer to that is she was good at baking and she did a lot of  it. In fact, if she   I   ll say, for example, she baked bread and she   d give  some for us and some for her family, you know, shared.  Finchum Was church an important part of your life?  Rohl I started out in Sunday school and that was the only time that   I don   t  know how to answer that. My family were not church-going people, but  I went to Sunday school and got to know other kids my age. I guess  that   s it.  Murphy Who took you to church?  Finchum Who took you to church?  12  Rohl My father.  Murphy Did he go in? Did he go to church?  Finchum Did he go in with you?  Rohl He just dropped me off and picked me up. (Laughs)  Finchum Was he a pretty big influence in your life, your father?  Rohl He was the boss. (Laughter) Period.  Finchum Was he the one that did the discipline?  Rohl I probably got away with a lot. (Laughter) I   m not so sure about the  discipline.  Murphy I don   t know. I don   t think grandpa was a disciplinarian. Who are these  people? (Shows a photograph) Talk about the sisters. Talk about the  Parker sisters.  Rohl That   s my mother and her sister. What   d she say?  Finchum To talk a little bit about them.  Murphy And here   s the rest of them. Okay, who   s this?  Rohl That   s my Aunt Ethel and Andrew.  Murphy Okay, and these are the sisters. So talk about the sisters. What did you  learn from the sisters?  Finchum What did you learn from the sisters, your aunts?  Rohl Oh boy, I don   t know. I think I learned that my family kept very close  track of what went on. I didn   t get away with very much unless I was  away from home. I don   t know how to answer that. Our family would  get together and have parties and things like that. I discovered  afterwards other people didn   t do that, so we were a little unusual that  we kept close to the family rather than scattered. Help me out here.  Murphy The Schamber family and the Parker family, between the two of them,  you had fifteen or twenty people. They all  came to  anything, any  gathering, Memorial Day, July Fourth, those were all family gatherings  and they were all parties.  13  Finchum She said the whole family would gather at Fourth of July and Memorial  Day and things like that.  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum Celebrations.  Rohl A lot of family picnics and we had a place in the country that had  some   no, no, who grew up there   but anyway, they stayed together as  a family. In other words, they were friends and you didn   t have a party  unless you had everybody.  Finchum Probably no secrets then either, huh?  Rohl No. (Laughter) Not that I found out.  Finchum Okay, so once you graduated from college     Rohl Yeah.  Finchum    you went to work?  Rohl Yeah I did, and I remember about that as some member of their     somebody on their faculty or some family, they said,    Oh I know this  kid. She just graduated and if we get her we won   t have to change every  year   , you know. There had been such a lot of change. People stayed  maybe a year, if they were lucky. This was a small town southwest and  west of the city in the middle of a grape growing area that kids got off  from school in order to pick grapes. I was in the city, and I thought that  was very unusual.  Finchum How long were you there?  Rohl I think two years. I think two. I am not positive.  Finchum And then where did you go?  Murphy Why did you leave?  Rohl I got married.  Finchum So if you got married, you had to quit?  Rohl Yes, definitely. Well, you know it was tough. Things were tough and  there weren   t very many openings, so if you got married then you had  to leave. A place that I taught was southwest of the city in the grape  14  growing area. They used to give the days off of school so the kids  would pick grapes. I was in the city, and I thought that was unusual. I  don   t know if it was, but anyway.  Finchum So once you got married you had to quit your job. How many children  did you have?  Rohl Didn   t have any until I got married. (Laughs)  Finchum I understand that.  Bishop Might find out something you never knew. (Laughter)  Finchum I   ll rephrase that. How many children did you end up having?  Rohl Four.  Finchum Boys? Girls?  Rohl One boy and three girls.  Finchum And did you go back to work at some point?  Rohl It was quite a lot later. I   ll have to think about that. I don   t remember.  Murphy Mom, Mr. Conrad offered you a job. Do you remember now?  Finchum She said,    Mr. Conrad offered you a job.     Rohl Oh, yeah.  Murphy Why did you need a job?  Rohl My husband had died. In fact, he had an injury to his foot and   well, he  never recovered from that. Anyway, I was available and somehow or  another the principal found out that I had been a teacher, and I got hired  in a new school, new situation, and lots of work.  Finchum What did you teach?  Rohl I taught home economics.  Finchum Were the students mostly girls or did you have some boys in your class?  15  Rohl We had a boys    club. They didn   t mix the boys in the girls    classes.  Boys thought it was fun if they could learn to cook. They loved to bake.  They loved to eat what they made. (Laughs)  Finchum Was it pretty hard raising four children on your own?  Rohl Well it probably was tough, but my parents lived in Buffalo and they  came out and really took the kids over the weekend. Is that right? Yeah,  so I got a break. So they were in school or   they were good kids.  Finchum How long did you teach that time around?  Rohl Oh boy     Murphy My sister thinks she retired in    72, so she started about    54. That   s about  twenty   probably whatever the lowest level of retirement would be.  You know, twenty years or something.  Finchum She was saying she thinks you retired in 1972. Does that sound about  right? Does it? Don   t know, okay. Did you enjoy teaching?  Rohl Yes, I was in a good spot. You know everybody was friendly and  helpful, and I remember the principal once said, well he wouldn   t have  to find a teacher every couple of years. Yeah, so I don   t know. I think  this is news to her, too. (Laughs)  Finchum What did you enjoy most about teaching?  Rohl I don   t know.  Finchum Not grading homework.  Rohl (Laughs) No, we didn   t give any homework.  Finchum No homework?  Rohl Well, not in home economics, no.  Finchum They didn   t have to sew something at home and then bring it back in?  Rohl You   re getting too deep here. (Laughter)  Finchum Well we   ll switch topics a little bit. Do you remember your first radio?  Rohl Good question.  16  Finchum Or television?  Rohl I have to go back to the first radio. I had an uncle who was a very  successful businessman, so he sometimes bought something for the  family. That   s how we got some things.  Finchum First television?  Rohl Don   t know.  Finchum You   re first car?  Rohl My first car? I don   t really remember, but the first car we had was a  family car. My father used it in his business. My mother would not  drive, so it was up to me, and so I learned to drive.  Murphy I don   t think she ever had a car until they were married. I mean a  controlling grandfather   her father would not give a daughter a car.  Finchum Well what would you do for fun?  Rohl Well, I liked roller-skating and ice-skating and we lived near...I   m  trying to think the name of it. It seems like it was Humboldt  Park .  Murphy Yes.  Rohl Anyway, they freeze the pond and then everybody could skate.  Murphy It was a city park.  Finchum The city park   at the city park?  Rohl Yeah. I ran out of thoughts. (Laughs)  Finchum You   re doing great, doing great. So did your husband have to serve in  World War II?  Rohl No, and the reason was that he was working in Curtiss  Wright . And  they were building airplanes and were excused from that because their  defense work in the plant.  Finchum They contributed to the war through what they did. I understand.  Rohl I guess so. (Laughs)  Finchum Well living in New York, would you ever go to New York City?  17  Rohl I think once, but we were closer to Toronto and we would go there  for   sometimes as a group we   d get on a bus and we   d go for dinner  and a show. My daughter says I got that right. (Laughter)  Bishop Did you ever go see Niagara Falls?  Rohl Yeah, we had a lot of company that wanted to go to the falls. (Laughter)  Bishop Bet that   s what they came for.  Rohl Good place to stay cheap. (Laughter) Okay, what else?  Finchum What brought you to Oklahoma?  Rohl Because I think my family got together and decided that I couldn   t be  alone, I   d have to be near somebody so they could keep track of me. So  Oklahoma opened up.  Murphy I had the best weather.  Finchum She said she had the best weather.  Bishop By default.  Finchum Oklahoma and then the other. (Laughter)  Rohl I think that did contribute to it.  Finchum Had you been here before?  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum Had visited before?  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum When did you move here?  Murphy Two thousand and six.  Rohl Whatever she said is probably right. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you ever think you would live to 100?  Rohl No. Have I made it? (Laughter)  18  Finchum You have to answer that for me. What did you do to celebrate?  Rohl I think we went out to dinner   no?  Murphy We had a party right here.  Finchum You had a party here?  Rohl Oh, okay. She remembers better than I do.  Bishop What is your secret to living so long?  Rohl Good luck.  Finchum Did anyone else in your family live to be 100?  Rohl No.  Finchum You   re the first.  Murphy Yes.  Finchum Did you eat an apple a day or something?  Rohl (Laughs) Nothing as easy as that, no. I think in the first place you are  alive and you have genes and you   ve had background in your family.  And after that, you just got lucky. (Laughs)  Murphy Eat right and exercise.  Finchum Have you eaten right and exercised throughout your life?  Rohl You have four kids, you exercise whether you want to or not. (Laughs)  Murphy And she used to swim.  Finchum She said you used to swim. You used to swim?  Rohl Yeah. I liked ice-skating too.  Bishop Did you enjoy reading?  Rohl What was it?  Finchum He was asking if you enjoyed reading.  19  Rohl Yeah.  Murphy She also cross-country skied, I forgot about that.  Finchum Go ahead.  Rohl After the kids were in bed, then I could enjoy it.  Finchum What did you usually read?  Rohl Anything I could get a hold of, nothing in particular, but everything.  Finchum Mysteries or romance or didn   t matter?  Rohl Mysteries I liked. And sometimes I   d read something because  somebody recommended it and I   d say,    Oh shoot,    and throw it away.  (Laughter)  Finchum Well did you travel very much?  Rohl All that I could. Are you going to ask me where I   ve been?  Finchum Sure.  Bishop Yeah, what   s one of your favorite places you   ve been to?  Finchum What   s one of your favorite places?  Rohl Oh boy, I don   t know if I had a favorite. I just liked to travel and I got  in with a group who were travelers. So somebody arranged it and we  went.  Finchum Mostly in the United States?  Murphy Yes.  Rohl No. I   ve been to China, and where else?  Finchum She   s going to get a list.  Murphy There you go.  Rohl Okay. Athens, Greece and Florida. I don   t tend to think of Florida as a  foreign country. (Laughs) There you go. (Passes the list)  20  Bishop Been to Hawaii too. One of the places is Hawaii.  Murphy Ask her where she got her travel bug.  Rohl What was the question?  Finchum She wants to know where you got your travel bug.  Rohl Geez, that is a very good question and I don   t know the answer to that.  It could be because my parents weren   t allowed to travel. And so of  course if it was not to be, then I   d want to do it. (Laughter)  Bishop Is there a place you   ve never been that you   ve always wanted to go to?  Rohl Don   t think so. After a while your travel bug gets tired. (Laughs)  Finchum What   s the biggest challenge for being 100? What   s your biggest  challenge you think?  Rohl The first place, I don   t think about it. And the second place, I know I   m  in a good spot here. So, I guess you   d say,    Well that   s how it is.    I   m  happy to be here and Kay takes good care of me, if it   s necessary, and I  try to keep in touch with my family. I can hardly keep up with them;  they are always moving. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, describe a typical day for us. A typical day, what time do you get  up?  Rohl Usually by eight or so.  Finchum And go to bed at what time?  Rohl Oh maybe ten.  Finchum That   s a pretty long day.  Rohl Well I don   t do anything. (Laughs)  Finchum That was my next question. What do you do during the day?  Rohl I read a lot, I guess.  Finchum Where do you get your reading materials?  Rohl Kay.  21  Murphy You do word puzzles.  Finchum And you do word puzzles?  Rohl Yes.  Finchum Are you very good at them?  Rohl Probably average.  Finchum I   d say you   re better than I am.  Rohl (Laughs)  Bishop Do you have a philosophy or a motto you live by?  Rohl No, not really. If I do I don   t really put it into words, other than    get up  and get going.    (Laughter)  Murphy That   s probably true. (Laughter)  Finchum I   m impressed that you read as much as you do. I guess the biggest  thing is your hearing? Biggest challenge is your hearing?  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum You see pretty well. Take much medicine?  Rohl No.  Finchum That   s amazing, too.  Murphy One, you have one prescription.  Rohl I have one pill.  Murphy One prescription. Otherwise she takes a vitamin.  Rohl But I check every once in a while, that   s because my daughter takes me.  Finchum And you never remarried.  Rohl You   re a mother of four kids; you got a lot to do. (Laughs) You don   t  need extra trouble. (Laughter)  Finchum They were pretty good kids though, weren   t they?  22  Rohl Yeah, they all take care of me. They make sure   I don   t know what  they   I think they have a private line. (Laughs) If one knows it, it gets  spread out. (Laughter) Is that right?  Murphy Yes.  Bishop Family cohesion has never stopped.  Rohl I got that right, give me a plus   Finchum Give you a plus. (Laughter)  Murphy Except that I   m the family screener, because they only get what I send  along.  Finchum When you retired was it mandatory retirement? Did you have to  because you were sixty-five?  Rohl No, I don   t think so.  Finchum Well in 1972 it was mandatory that if you were sixty-five you had to  retire. Well, did you quilt?  Rohl No. I tried it once, it was too slow.  Finchum You were too slow, or just the process too slow?  Rohl No, getting anything done would be   you could work and work and  you still didn   t get much done.  Murphy She did cross-stitching.  Finchum You cross-stitched.  Rohl Yeah.  Finchum You sewed enough at work, I guess.  Rohl The first thing I ever did was that picture, the small picture there of the  house.  Finchum That   s pretty good.  Rohl It was pretty tough.  23  Murphy I   ve taken most of it down to put up her 100 stuff. The apartment had a  whole bunch of stuff, but this is the kind of thing she like to do, the big  tough stuff.  Finchum Big tough     Rohl She knows more about me than I do about myself.  Bishop Now being a home economics teacher, did you ever have a favorite  recipe? Did you ever have a favorite recipe you liked to teach the kids?  Rohl No. I was popular because the guys all found out what day we bake and  then we had all kinds of customers.  Bishop What would you bake?  Finchum What would you bake?  Rohl Oh, I don   t know, just plain rolls.  Finchum Those you smell before you see them. Pies and pie crusts?  Rohl Yeah, Just about everything. One of the things is when you lived  in the  country you were  so far from everything, you know. I grew up in the  city so I was used to having things around me, so it was different when  I couldn   t just run to the store.  Finchum When history is written what do you want it to say about you? How do  you want to be remembered?  Rohl I guess I have to think about that. I want to be remembered as a fair  person and caring. I don   t know. I don   t know who   s going to  remember me.  Finchum I   d say quite a few people.  Rohl Well, maybe.  Finchum Anything else you want to add before we close?  Rohl I don   t think so.  Finchum Been a good life?  24  Rohl Yeah, been a good life, it   s been a long life. My children have grown up  to be good adults and I think if I   m proud of anything, I   m proud of my  family.  Finchum You did very well.  Rohl Thank you.  Finchum Thank you for sharing with us today. You were great, thank you.  Rohl Okay.  -------  -------
