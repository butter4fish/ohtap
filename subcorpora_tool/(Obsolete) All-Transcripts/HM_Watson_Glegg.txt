Speaker 1: Let's start talking about your father. And his name was Jack?
Speaker 2: Jack.
Speaker 1: And I'd like--and I--Jack Watson I assume.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. And I'd like you to talk about what you know about his family. I know you were saying you didn't know, know as much but I would like you to talk about what you know about his family.
Speaker 2: Well, of course, as I think I shared with you, he died when I was four years old. He was thirty-four years old. He died of a heart attack. He was a builder and contractor. He built shopping centers, malls, schools. He had his own business. As a matter of fact, I think he'd turn over in his grave that his only child works for a corporation; as long as I have.  He was very tall, he was six feet six [inches] and he was what we call in Jamaica, 'sugga boy'.  He was a pretty boy; very handsome man, and quite a catch I understand. I recall as a little boy that he--when he would come home he would always check with my grandmother, who lived with us, my mother's mother, whether or not I had washed my feet before I went to bed, because I played incessantly as a child, as an only child.  I played with anybody that showed up. And he would always check to see. And my grandmother was so fond of me I think 'cause I used to feed her porridge, as a little boy. And she would always say, "I washed my feet," whether I wash it or not.  But he would always go and check it in the bed.  That I remember very distinctly. And if I had--if he checked it and I had not, he would make me get up and go and wash my feet before going to bed. I don't know what he had about feet.  He didn't have large feet and neither do I. But somehow he was a feet person in terms of making sure my feet were washed before I went to bed.
Story_ID: 14886
Speaker 1: Do you know much about his family at all past him [father Jack Watson]? You know, did you have much contact with his, you know, your grandparents on his side?
Speaker 2: No.  Unfortunately I didn't because my mother subsequently remarried and we grew apart because my mother was very young. She was a very young bride and I think he was her love. And her, her--his family, his sisters, and them had me stay with them one summer.  And I overheard them saying that they should take me and raise me because she was so young. And I remember telling my mother and that was it. So I don't know how much that may have influenced but I never had a chance to spend much. But I, I member he had a brother named Ferdy, who worked at the Water Commission,  Uncle Ferdy. And he had sisters. And I remember spending times with them. And, and I remember them being aghast at how dark I was because he was what we call in Jamaica, part coolie [Jamaican slang for East Indians], he was Indian.  He had some Indian in him and he was light. And--and I remember overhearing a conversation of whether or not I played in the sun too much, why I had gotten so dark. And I remember telling my mother about that.  And that's all she needed to hear. And I think it must have influenced it but I don't recall. I had opportunities to get back in touch with my father's family.  But I'd decided I'd been in America--I came over as a teenager and I'd decided that time had lapse so much.  I wasn't sure who would be authentic family. But there is one village in this parish.  There are fourteen parishes in Jamaica, like fourteen states and three counties of parishes. And in this one particular parish all the Watsons are related and I have run into people over the years, who have said that they were related to me.  But I've been very skeptical because I really don't know. And the one, who would know is since passed.  That is my aunt, who lived here and she as a bigger sister approved of my father, for my--her little sister.  And she knew the family very well. And I've been reluctant to really--I just sort of let that go.
Story_ID: 14887
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.  Her name Carmen [Watson]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you tell us about, you know, her side, you know, what you know about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the side I know most about. She was one of my mother's side was one of thirteen children. Eight of them lived. And my mother was second to the last.  And her, her mother lived with us.  Lived with my dad [Jack Watson] and I, and I used to feed her porridge as a little boy--it's been said that I have her blessings, you know.  She is--she was a beautiful woman very trusting woman.  And I just remember as a little boy just responding to her needs.  She was ill, and, and wound up living with us.  And I didn't know her husband, my grandfather, on my mother's side, he had passed.  I just knew her. She had come from the country to live in Kingston [Jamaica] with us and that's how I got to know her.  I didn't know her when in the country.  Obviously I had been taken there as a little baby but I didn't know about it.  And all of the family that I'm closest to is just my mother's side.  All the living sisters' and brothers' children. And my mother was the only one to have had one child.  Her other sisters have two and three and what have you.  But she is the only one to have had one child. So I have a lot of cousins, who are like sisters to me. As a matter of fact my cousin here is--in New York here--is like a sister.  And I have a cousin in England who's like a sister.  That sort of thing. And I have cousins, who are like brothers and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 14888
Speaker 1: You know, often when I'm interviewing people, who were born in this country, not, you know, born--
Speaker 2: Overseas?
Speaker 1: Overseas, I often ask them if they, you know, do they know where their family, you know, originated from. And I'm wondering if you know, if, you know, your family originated outside of you know. And if either side originated outside of Jamaica or were they long term Jamaicans? That's what I'm wondering.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as Christopher Columbus would have us believe in 1494 [sic, 1492], as he was sailing, you know, this island popped out of the water.  And was discovered and called Jamaica. But the, the reality is that the British had been there actually.  Several colonizers had been to Jamaica. My father's side, I know were English.  The name Glegg, come the roots come from that.  My father [Jack Watson]'s father was, an Englishman.  My grandfather, I've been told.  And whether he had lived in the colonies and married someone there and had a child, I don't know.  But I do know that.  My mother [Carmen Watson]'s side are the Arawak Indians were the original inhabitants.  And so Christopher Columbus call them Carib Indians for just a geographic designation. But I, I suspect somewhere there a lot of, as you know, a lot of people in the Caribbean came from different parts of Africa. The difference was here in this country it was cotton and in the islands it was sugar.  That they were--so they came in different ships at different times. Now, in terms of the etymology of that, I'm not sure where--where that part came from.  Even though I have been told by several Ethiopians and Sudanese that because of the migration pattern.  And there is long before the Rastafarian movement, who look at Haile Selassie as its, head.  There's been tremendous synergy between Sudan, Kenya, particularly in the highlands, and--and, and Jamaicans even though I think historians will tell you more Ghanians.  But I think for the men, particularly the height comes from that historical root.  I mean that's, that's what I've been able to pick up.
Story_ID: 14889
Speaker 1: Let's talk about you and some of earliest memories growing up, you know, and I would just like you to share some of those memories.
Speaker 2: In Jamaica?
Speaker 1: Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Well, my earliest memories of growing up was missing my dad [Jack Watson].  But my--because a lot of people had their dad. And he--I knew he loved me and to die at thirty-four just was just shocking.  And my mom [Carmen Watson] became a dad and a mom, and so we became extremely close 'til she died.  And my earliest memories was going to--in Jamaica we use to have a thing called Christmas Market at Christmas.  And they would take you down to do the shopping and we have a--what we called a 'dolly house', to play dolly house. And so I remember my mom taking me as a child on Christmas Eve and during the Christmas season.  And I remember Christmas was a time--was a very festive occasion in Jamaica.  All the homes were opened up and you would go from home to home. You didn't have to worry about crime.  I guess everywhere used to be like that but particularly in Jamaica. And they would always have every kind of meat-kind--goats, chicken, fish, and, and you would stay up, watch the preparation in the kitchen. And I used to like to open the pots 'cause I was very tall, and I used to like to open the pots and smell them.  I still do to this day, by the way. And--and so that--those are some of my fond memories.  Playing with my cousins--because I was an only child my--my mom was very careful that I didn't play with the wrong element. So I had enough cousins to play and we would play cricket.  And one time my cousin would be Australia I'd be New Zealand.  We would be West Indies.  We'd be India, Pakistan playing for the ashes and we would play that. And so I enjoyed that as a kid.  You know, having friends and living in neighborhoods where--and going to political rallies with my parents. I enjoyed that with my family.  We would go and, and listen to the political rhetoric.  And, and it gave me an early understanding of the significant role that politics plays in your life.  Even though, at the time I was very young.  But I, I came to appreciate it as I grew older.
Speaker 1: Now what parish did you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I, I was born in St. Andrews [Jamaica].
Speaker 1: And any other memories of family life and things you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Just joyous occasions.  We would go--I, I remember when my mom remarried going to Sabina Park [Kingston, Jamaica], which was the big--and it's a national stadium, where the Reggae Boyz [Jamaican national soccer team] play now.  But it was Sabina Park at the time, to cricket matches.  And my mom would fix egg salad sandwiches and cola champagne, lemonade and orange picked oranges and stuff and different thing in Thermos.  And then of course, I would notice a lot of the people would be going to--getting up in the middle of the game.  And she'd say, "They're drinking beer.  They're going to the bathroom." She would tell me.  I didn't know what a beer was, you know. But I must tell you a story, that my mother--that will always stand out in my mind. I was a little boy, don't remember old I was.  But we were walking.  In Jamaica, a lot of people live in the islands, the various islands common law.  And sometimes when a child is born, they take the--on different names or combinations of the names. And some common law husband was apparently abusing his common law wife and she was crying. And I remember my mom holding my hand and explaining to me that when I got old and when I got up, that a woman was not a toy, not to be abused.  And she was to be loved. I didn't know what a woman was or a rat or a cat.  But my mother--you know, I think if I ever grew up and was inclined to be abusive to a woman--every time I would clench my fist it would resonate in my mind.  Thank God I'm, you know,  I've never been so inclined.  But except in self-defense she said, you know.  And I remember that as an early lesson.  My mother telling me before I even knew what a woman was--I just knew my mother.  My mother--I didn't know even my mother was a woman.  I just knew she was my mother. And, you know, we were walking and she held my hand.  And, and held me and let me--stood in front of this house while the screams came out.  And she had characterized what she thought it was. And that, that has always stuck with me as an early memory of growing up in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Now, your--your stepfather his name--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Noel Valentine Nicholas is his name.
Speaker 1: And he was--what--what age were you when they got married?
Speaker 2: I was about twelve years old.
Story_ID: 14890
Speaker 1: What age were you when you started to go to school?
Speaker 2: Where?  In Jamaica or here?
Speaker 1: In Jamaica.
Speaker 2: I don't even remember what age you go to school.  But whatever age we go to school in Jamaica that's when I went. I mean, I went to a little private school--Miss Martin's Private School it was called. And I went with my cousins.  And I was the baby.  So they just made me carry the lunches and, I didn't like that.  And I would always leave it on the bus.  'Cause I didn't--I liked my hands to be free--[chuckling] to run. And so, but those were the rights of passages. But anyway I don't remember exactly the age.  But whatever I--we went to a little private school.  Miss Martin's Private School was like kindergarten or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you--do you remember liking any, you know, particular classes in school, or things or subjects?  Or--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you like, you know--.
Speaker 2: I remember--not at that age, not at that age.  But I remember enjoying being--raising my hand and being recognized by the teacher.
Speaker 1: I'm even talking the period from like going to school to maybe twelve?
Speaker 2: Oh! I see.  Yeah.  I, I liked then English.  I liked English as a course, I remember--and arithmetic.
Story_ID: 14891
Speaker 1: And when--what would you--how would you describe the young Glegg Watson? Would you say that he was, you know, introvert? Did you see--you know, you were saying you had a lot of energy.  You know, you were--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I was a busy body.  I mean, I, I had--I think when you're an only child I enjoyed playing with kids either in the neighborhood or wherever. And my mom [Carmen Watson] recognized that very early.  And tried to manage that process to make sure I didn't play with the wrong elements, so to speak. So whenever I wanted to play cricket or anything--she said she would call her brother and send his son to spend the weekend with us.  If we lived in a different part of town, that sort of thing. That's how my man--my mother managed that process. She was a very protected mother, pre--presumably understandable. Even though you didn't have to deal with the elements we do today raising children. But she was very protective.
Speaker 1: Now when she married Noel [Nicholas]--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Noel.
Speaker 1: Noel that was--you know, you had, like you said, "You had missed your father when he had passed away. Then the two of you had really, you know.  You and your mother had become best friends.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: How was--what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was a little tough.  Because I think it always is.  Because I wanted to be the man, to protect my mom, you know.  And boys are like that way about their mother.  I mean, they're very protective of their mother. And I, just to this day love her to death.  And so, I wish I were older that I could've protected her, you know.  And I--and I would want to say.  And I think now that I've become a man, I think my mother married my stepfather so that I had a father.  I think her true love was my natural father [Jack Watson].  But I think she understood the importance of having a male in my life. And I think that's why.  I now understand that.  I don't think there was passion or love there. And I--that made me very guilty.  That because she was a beautiful woman and she had a lot of options.  And I kept thinking if I'd--if I weren't around she you know, would've had so many more choices.  And--but she did that because she wanted to close the loop right away and make sure that I had a steady progression in my life. And my father, it was difficult.  I mean I kind of--stepfather--I resent him.  But I--I came to love him.  But I--it was difficult 'cause he was not a very open person. It was a function of his generation.  He didn't know to say, "I love you." He wouldn't hug me or that sort of thing.  And all the things I wanted from a father, it was very difficult. And I mean--I think I was a very good son.  I never--I was never in gangs, never did anything wrong.  And no one ever hit on the door and said, "Your child is downtown at a precinct.  Let's go." But he didn't know how to impre--express himself.  There was something considered sissified about his generation to embrace another male. And--and so I grew up with this kind of attitude and toughness that tears was about weakness. And now I cry in movies and stuff.  And now I would hug a man that I think because I'm secure in who I am. But the way that he raised me, I wasn't supposed to do that.  Something wrong about that. And in spite of the new lifestyles that go on, I'm confident in myself that I could hug a person and not be concern about being tainted, about it outside the boundaries of manhood. But I mean I didn't grow up that way.  'Cause I--I held on to a lot of his thing.  Which is like, you know, hey men don't touch each other. Then you know, so--and, you know, I would say, "Pops, I love you." And, you know.  And he, he would come and watch me play soccer and play cricket.  And, and, and yet, you know, he, he just didn't know what to say.  "That was a good goal," or something like that.  He just didn't know to express himself. I've come to realize that was a generational issue, because I've spoken with other friends of mine, my age, who have fathers who had the same issue.
Story_ID: 14892
Speaker 1: You came, to, to the [United] States at fifteen.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering what, what prompted that move here?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents, my mom [Carmen Watson] and my stepfather [Noel Nicholas] had migrated to the states for a better life.  And they were working in the diplomatic corps in Washington, D.C.  And they--and I lived with--I--I was boarding with another aunt--her sister in the country.  And I was growing very fast.  And the, the thing in Jamaica is if you grow too fast in--like New York they'll send you to Alabama, to use that example, in the States. Well I was sent to Lucea, [Jamaica] which is like very slow--to be kind.  Very slow, to make sure that I didn't grow too fast.  And 'cause I was about six foot two [inches], at fifteen.  And I was chosen to play on an all-island cricket team and I would tour with these grown men. My parents had migrated to the States, my stepfather and my mom to Washington, D.C.  And I was boarding with another aunt in this parish called Hanover [Parish, Jamaica].  Lucea was the capital and I went to high school there, Russey's High School. And that was in the year 1956 through '59 [1959].  And then I would--what I--there's a concept known as barrel children.  And I'm doing a book on, on Caribbean called 'Strangers in a Foreign Land: The Experience of West Indians and the U. S., Canada, and England', and why they migrate and what have you. And in the process, we have a concept called, barrel children, where a lot of these families send barrels of clothes and everything back to the islands to take care of their kids. And of course quite often is raised by another aunt or sister or brother or, or grandparent. And I--in the process, I realized I was a barrel child, but I didn't think of it that way.  I--'cause, you know, it wasn't the term given when I migrated to the States. But in effect--and so that was--I lived in the country for three years. And then I convinced my mom that I missed her so much 'cause my letters were more than, 'I miss you and I love you and send money' but I had a lot of those. And that I--I was apart of a group that wanted to come to America because I had a lot of issues with colonialism as I grew older. And read more about the reign of the Tudors and the Stuarts, in terms of British history.  And I developed a keen concern about that.  So I wanted to come to America and to go to Howard University [Washington,  D.C.]. I didn't want to go to McGill [University, Montreal, Canada] which is where we tend to migrate, or go to school in Canada, or we go to school in England, [University of] Oxford [Oxford, England] and [University of] Cambridge [Cambridge, England].  I wanted to go to Howard [University, Washington D.C.]. I must say most of the physicians in Jamaica, and dentists came from Howard. And so, now it's about roughly almost 60 percent of them. So, I wanted to be apart of that group to come to this country so to speak.  'Cause I thought America was gonna be a little different.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, before I leave the schooling, you went--you started--you told me the school you first went, you know, went at--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Miss Martin's School.
Speaker 1: Miss Martin's School.  And then what school did you go to after that?
Speaker 2: Then after Miss Martin's School, I went to--I went to the--Miss Martin's School went pretty far up.  And then I went to Russey's High School. But something I neglected to mention, the reason why--the motivation for me, I was a Boy Scout.  And the Queen [Elizabeth II] had visited Jamaica. And a gentlemen--we had to sort of hold guard.  And the Queen had--a gentlemen saw a puddle of water and took off his jacket to put it as she could step, step--that she wouldn't step in the puddle. And the way he was treated offended me as a child.  And I didn't like the idea of bowing to anyone, particularly a white woman.  I didn't like that.  So America was appealing to me 'cause I knew if I went to America, I wouldn't have to bow to anyone, and certainly not anybody. That--so that, that my sensibilities was cultivated then by that incident. And I still can remember it.  Because, as the Boy Scout we held guard as the procession went by.  And we had like, things, and we had to hold it to let the, you know, the Queen go by and what have you.  Because that was part of the royalty. They would always visit the colonies and what have you. So I remember that.  And that was a motivation for me as I thought about what had happened to that man who was only trying to make sure.  But on a stand--from a security standpoint, they had to make sure the jacket didn't have a bomb or anything like that.  I understand they were doing their job. But his treatment offended me as a child.
Speaker 1: And so you write to your mother and you say, "I want to come."
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we'd write all the time.  You know, I was with my aunt.  I showed you the pictures of my aunt, my mom and her two sisters. My cousin's mother and my cousin in England's mother. And those are three women in effect, who raised me.  And I--I wanted--you know, I was very close to her and I just told her I was missing her.  And I wanted to--I knew I wanted to go to Howard. And so why not get on with the process at an early stage? And so that's--I, I mean we would write. My mother was missing me too, obviously. I mean it was three years, from '56 [1956] to '59 [1959].  And she was missing me also. And--and I mean, it was a natural progression.
Story_ID: 14893
Speaker 1: So you came here [to the United States from Jamaica] with much, much anticipation?
Speaker 2: I came to Washington, D.C. with much anticipation. And when I came, the system did not process a lot of people from the Caribbean or English system.  So I lost some time because they couldn't interpret my grades.  'Cause it was such--the British system was so different. So I went to a school for diplomats' children and a lot of foreigners.  It's called--it's now the Duke Ellington School for Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. But it was Western High School. And Dean Rusk--his daughter--was Secretary of State--went there, and what have you. And so it was a very interesting school. And I became the first black president of this all white student council. That's how much my political awareness had become. That I ran for office and became president. In my senior year because they had not interpreted my grades properly from Jamaica, I had no real classes.  In effect, I'd--I'd lost some time.  So I had a whole year to be president which was fun.  It was great.  And I mean I enjoyed it. And so you know, that's what happened.
Speaker 1: So what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: 1962.
Story_ID: 14894
Speaker 1: You get here [Washington, D.C.] and you attend?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Western High School [Washington, D.C.], which is now the Duke Ellington School for Performing Arts [Washington, D.C.].  And became president of this all white student council, which was the first for Washington, D.C. And that a black had ever been president of a all white student body. And so it was a very interesting--so there was a lot of expectation that when I went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--and I applied to a lot of schools.  But I knew I wanted to go to Howard.  But I just did that because that was expected of me to do that.  But I knew where.  And I also wanted to stay in Washington to be close to my mom [Carmen Watson].  I didn't want to go far from her. And so it was expected when I went to Howard, I would be you know, leading movement and what have you. And Howard was a very politically active time.  And we would spend a lot of time debating issues.  The various islands and nations. One hundred and sixteen nations were represented at Howard when I was a student there. So we used to debate whether or not the French were more humane versus the British versus the, you know Spaniards or whomever, or French. And we would always have these debates at Howard.  But Howard then--people like Stokely Carmichael--Kwame Ture--was one of the student leaders.  Michael Thelwell. There were a lot of West Indians who were leaders at Howard at the, at the head of the [Civil Rights] Movement. And Larry Gibson, who was not West Indian but he's in Baltimore [Maryland].  He's an attorney. So what happened was one of the things that was clear to me was that I had to focus on my education  'cause that's really what I had gone to Howard. And I decided that I would help the Movement by getting on the inside and writing for 'The Washington Post' and making sure that their coverage of the Movement was fair. So that was my way of doing it.  Whereas--because I was never a nonviolent person.  I never got into fights.  But I knew if somebody spat on me I would kill them.  I mean 'cause I didn't know how to fight. I just don't have that kind of control.  I knew that about myself. So I never marched.  I didn't believe in marching and I really--it just never had no appeal to me.  I never had. And when I went south I made sure I traveled with people from the South, that they would know what side of the track to go on.  'Cause I couldn't handle that.  I just wasn't equipped to do that.
Speaker 1: Now I want to know--you went to Howard starting in 1960 what? '2 [1962]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And you went there until 1966.  Did you graduate in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: '67 [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: Right. I worked at The Washington Post and played football for Howard at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were working part-time or?
Speaker 2: I worked sometime part-time, right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.  So was, was--what was your major?
Speaker 2: Political science and economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell us about that experience. And the thing that I am, you know, particularly interested in is, were you--'cause when we were talking yesterday to Ossie Davis as he had described in his book that he was really hanging out with West Indians students.  And they were separate. And I was wondering, you know, in your experience were the African American students separate from the West Indians students, separate from the African students?  And, and, you know, what were the dynamics that you sort of found there?
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting because the dynamics being a West Indian at the time and so labeled on the campus.  There were lines of demarcation, there's no question.  But there was an attempt to bridge.  There were pockets.  There were many tents on the compound.  There was a West Indian tent, African tent, Middle East tent and an African American tent.  A black tent. But the interesting thing about it, there were people that always moved from tent to tent.  But there were people holding on to their own tents. And I considered myself, since I'd been in America sometimes longer than others that I was moving from tent to tent. I was one of the people moving from tent to tent. Stokely Carmichael--would be one of that.  'Cause, you know, he's--he was born here of Trinidadian heritage. He's like a Colin Powell, so to speak. And so, so there were people like that who moved.  But there were clearly--we were just getting to know each other on mass.  There were so many.  So there were a lot of issues. As a matter of fact there were so--even I must admit that I even participated in some of the stereotypic things that were said about Africans. In other words, it was racist in hindsight.  When we would play teams on the team--the soccer team would be made up of West Indians and Africans primarily. And maybe an African-American whose parents had lived overseas and played soccer.  Maybe one would come up.  But they weren't stars or they didn't start or anything.  But they were there. And when we would play other teams that had Africans, we would put our Africans to mark them.  We'd check 'em.  In soccer, that's what we'd call it. Say--because we had a, a guy who played on the wing position. The left-winger's name was George Igbe Ebu (ph.), from Nigeria and on the outside right was a guy named Nikse Asemani (ph.) from Ghana. I played inside right and right back.  And when we would run up into teams that had Africans, we would put our guys against theirs. 'Cause they ran incessantly, like Kip Keino did in that Olympic story. And none of us were in shape like that.  But it wasn't racist in a way.  We just said that, "That's the only way we'll make sure, none got away to score a goal on us."; so we would put our Africans on theirs.  So looking back at that, that wasn't right.  But coaches do that in basketball.  If you have an all white team and you have one black and four starting.  And UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles. Los Angeles, California] did that when they went up against Memphis State [University, Memphis, Tennesse] in the final.  They--Bill Walton was the only white.  And he--and the, the coach put--the Wizard coach [John Wooden]--put four black--he benched the other whites and only keep Bill Walton to keep up with the speed that was on the court. So, you know, it's various ways you can look at it.  I mean, so that happened. Because Howard again, of the 117 historical black colleges and universities was to many people the black man's Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. It is the premier school that has turned out over 60 percent of the black professionals in this country.  They've gone to Howard at some point or the other.  And so, as a result of that it de-emphasized athletics. And soccer we love and we played it out of love; not because we had big scholarships or anything like that. We didn't get scholarships at the time.  You only had academic scholarships. And Howard was determined not to be without naming some of these black schools like that; which were considered like football factories.  They didn't subscribe to the Greek notion of the mind and the body.  They just wanted the mind; they didn't want to deal with no body.  'Cause the body was at other schools. If you want to go to play sports you go to elsewhere.  And I think Howard, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] were considered for many years, Harvard's black people's Harvard, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] so to speak.  And that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: But what I'm sort of curious about because--remember you said, "When I was younger, I wanted to go to Howard." and I'm wondering how the experience met your expectations and how it differed from your expectations?
Speaker 2: Well, I was excited about it. I was being--I was torn.  When I was real young and before I knew of a Howard and came in contact with people in Howard, I wanted to go to the University of [the] West Indies [Mona, Jamaica], which was the school to go to.  And that's where I would have gone had my parents not migrated. But the truth of the matter is once I became exposed to people, graduates from Howard and I realized what Howard meant, and as I explain earlier my own political development and resentment for having to bow to somebody when they came by.  I have problems. I've never done that and would never do that to any human being.  And as a result of that I--Howard became very attractive to me.  'Cause I understood what it stood for and what I heard about it. Now when I got there, there were so many things going on at Howard.  And what was exciting about Howard, which I didn't know when I had a fascination with it was, every aspect of the human endeavor you could find at Howard from good to bad.  You know, on a, on a continuum. You had people, who cared about you, wanted you to be successful and there were people, who didn't want you to be successful.  There were people, who took a personal interest in you.  And it was like an extended family.  So if you were trying to pull hooky they would say, "By the way, young man aren't you supposed to be in biological science in the lab now? Or at French lab?" Or what have you.  So there was this family sense of that.  But the richness was in the people from all these other countries and parts of the world.  Including some people from Europe.  'Cause when I went to Howard lots of whites were there, not just in the professional schools.  But in--and a lot of exchange students and stuff.  The faculty was also taught a lot Caucasians majority male and female.  As matter of fact, the only B that Stokely Carmichael ever got was from a woman named Dr. Taharry. A majority female who gave him a B.  He had gotten As. He was a brilliant student.  A lot of people don't know this about Stokely.  He was an outstanding student. And that was--that's the only way you could be a leader at Howard.  You had to be an outstanding student.  You couldn't be an average student.  You had to have about a 3.5 [grade point] average before. So I had to get my average together if I wanted to be a leader.  And I did all the things that were American like pledging a fraternity, which I did.  Which was very new.  No West Indian had ever done that. But I wanted to get the full American experience.  That was important to me, and I wanted to understand that. And I wanted to blend in.  That when I walked down the street, not because of my accent I be treated--because as the African countries gained their independence, whites treated black people in Washington [D.C.] a little differently. You could--the open door accommodations and access, you know, civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act, 1964] was being passed and, and a lot of activism. And so as you would go into places, you couldn't get your hair cut in barbershops and stuff.

Speaker 1: Bobby [Robert] Kennedy--it was a very exciting time--came on the campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and said, " You know, if you go and you can't--and have problems call us at this number." And we would look at each other in the auditorium, cramp in the auditorium and said, "Boy, they're serious, this thing is gonna work, you know!" And we really believed that. So, [President] John [F.] Kennedy, as a matter of fact, when he got shot we were--I was in a gym class and we were brought to the middle of the campus, in front of the School of Religion Chapel and praying for this white man that he lived.  Because he represented so much hope for us. Now I had not been in America when Franklin [D.] Roosevelt was President.  But I heard black people loved him that much. But we loved John Kennedy, my generation.  Because he was the first white man, who seemed to want to address the issue of inequality in this country. So I was a true believer and I remember in my gym outfit praying, kneeling down and praying for this man that he live.  You know, it was just a shot that hit him in his arm.  We didn't realize the extent at the time.  But the moment he got shot, they'd suspended class and brought us all to pray for this man. And I said, "Boy, this must be some really special white man." And we prayed and I remember that. And that had a very--and I remember Bobby Kennedy coming to the campus.  And I remember Malcolm X and a lot of people. You know, because the Vietnamese War had started. And I remember my mother [Carmen Watson] telling me that I was her only child and if somehow I got drafted to either go to Canada and finish my education and then go home.  But not to go for a country and die for this country, who had not treated black people right.
Story_ID: 14896
Speaker 1: Who were your mentors? Did you have mentors at the school?  At Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well my first mentor--I'm an anti-hero person because my first, person that I admired as a child was Norman Manley.  Michael Manley was the Prime Minister [of Jamaica], his father. And the reason why I admired him as a young man, again, this is a very inspirational story; he was a Queen's Counsel. Like he was a combination of F. Lee Bailey, Melvin Belli and Edward Bennett Williams, in terms of their reputation in this country. He was the consummate trial lawyer and he had gone to England and studied.  He was brilliant. And Australia had laws that prohibit black people to become citizens of Australia but you could be a permanent resident if you married an Australian girl. We had a great cricketer named Sir Garfield Sobers, who tried to migrate there and they wouldn't let him. And I remember--and he--Norman Manley married an Englishwoman, Edna and brought her back to Jamaica and of course he was elected to be Prime Minister. And what I remember about him is that what the story--what impressed me is that, even though he could not become a citizen of Australia, he could go and to represent the Crown at the most difficult case. He had been chosen to be the attorney to represent them in Australia, to try the most difficult case in Australia. And what that said to me, as a young man, whatever's in your mind, nobody can stop you.  I don't care what your color is. So he was my first person that, that brought home the importance of education to me and preparation.  In this country, there are a lot of people I've admired.  But I'm an antihero person. I admire people for their intellect, or somebody who can sing and perform.  I--that's the things that I--
Speaker 1: Were there any professors that you particularly, you know, found counsel or that you think helped guided you? Or was it more your, your peers that were guiding you?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I had professors that had profound effect on me.  Dr. Martin, Dr. Dorsey, he was a classmate of Adam Clayton Powell at Colgate [University, Hamilton, New York]. And he would not drive all the way from Colgate, New York to Cleveland [Ohio], just to date a black woman. So he dated the president's--who was white--daughter. I mean, that's how, you know, kind of guy he was. He looked just like Adam Clayton Powell, Dr. Dorsey brilliant man. And, so he was a role model for me, a person that I admire.  Subsequently, I've admired people like Cliff Alexander, Secretary of the Army his brilliance and--and the kind of person he is and his values.  I mean he stands for something.  And, you know, there are--I admire [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  I also admire Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey. I admired Marcus Garvey as a young man.  And the more I got to read about him, I, admired him. I wished he was mo--He--I wish he had been more prepared to deal with the things that he had to deal with; which, he didn't realize. But he was just not as prepared for war as he--as, as events proved. So these, these were people--Mary Bethune Cook [sic, Mary McLeod Bethune], you know Rosa Parks.  There are lots of people that--Dr. Height, Dorothy Height. There are lots of people that I admire because of the position they have taken, the cross they have borne for, the race. I'm a race man, I'm a race person and I admire people who stand up for their people.  And, and, and, I, I think America is better off when we stand up than when we sit down.  We, we all grow from that experience.  And so I have difficulty with people, who make it and don't reach back and help their race or think they've crossed over.  Because you never cross over.  And there's nothing wrong with that. So I have this strong sense of pride and feel very proud.  Whether it's a hip-hop person that I watched from a Puff Daddy [Sean 'Puffy' Combs], who gave a half million dollars to Howard for scholarship, even though he went there only two years.  Dr. Dre and how these young people are making it outside a traditional way to make money.  So I admire these them and I'm gonna write a little bit about them too.  To try to get to understand them better.

Speaker 1: While you're there, you saying you're, you know, you're going to school and working at the 'Washington Post'.  And what is that experience like at the 'Post'?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That experience is a mind-boggling experience. I worked as a copy boy, a news aide and then, I became an intern and I became a reporter.  So I went through the whole stages.  And, and it exposed me--working for the 'Washington Post' at a young age was like going--it's like writing a book everyday.  Some of the brilliant--most brilliant minds in the world.  Brilliant people. But you see the class differentiation too.  And I understood the absence of blacks in the newsroom.  And when the riots started they deputized and made a lot of blacks reporters. And when they--the riots were over there were no jobs for them.  Because they didn't want to send them to be bureau chief in Moscow [Russia] or Paris [France] or whatever.  So the 'Post' was in its very infant stage in terms of diversity. And Bob [Robert C.] Maynard, who has since passed and [William] Bill Raspberry who was a columnist, were the two who were out front.  And then there were generation people like Leon Dash, that I mentioned and others behind.  Myself included, were behind. And we were like troublemakers because we were trying to get the 'Post' to do things and be more sensitive to people, how they cover black people worldwide.  You know Christian Bernard did the first heart transplant.  And he put in monkey's heart inside.  And they described black women very disparagingly in a AP [Associated Press] story that 'Washington Post' had purchased.  But we had them take it out even though they had bought it.  Because it--it spoke disparagingly of the blacks in South Africa. So we got with the editor, Benjamin Bradlee and said this was offensive and we had to, and we were gonna protest.  And so--and he changed--he moved it. So it was a growing period for a whole lot of people.  And so--but it opened my eyes.  Because it--I was a young man; here I am in this Mecca of black education, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And then I'm in a branch of the, the organ that postulate the greatness of white people, the 'Washington Post'.  'Cause that's all its coverage was about. So that was a very difficult piece for me.  But I think it helped me to grow and it helped me to understand the bigger picture.  And I've made lasting friends from that. 'Cause I had Jewish friends, who suffered and I became--Bob Levy, I became very close with.  And I understood other peoples' struggle.  'Cause they shared their difficulties and stuff. So, it was a very incredibly eye opening experience.  And I had a lot of interesting assignments. I covered [Senator Edmund] Muskie's [presidential] campaign, I covered the riots, I covered the--the launching of the astronauts [at the Johnson National Space Center] in Nassau Bay [Texas] outside Houston [Texas].  Lived down there. I mean so I got a lot of things that I, I got exposed to.  And I got exposed to how America works.  And, and, and how the ruling family made decisions.  That brings us to why we have a President like George W. [Bush]. I mean I understood that at an early age, how those things happened. Who went to Philson [sic, Phillips Andover Academy, Andover, Massachusetts] and then went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Harvard [University Business School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and how if you were gonna be a foreign correspondent, Benjamin Bradlee, editor came by, and rolled up a piece of paper and shot baskets with you.  And you knew for a quarter. And you knew that you were gonna be a foreign correspondent. And when people, always say, "How could you leave the 'Washington Post'?" You never shot it with me, or my kind. Now I could be a foreign correspondent by going to--volunteering to go to Vietnam.  But I didn't--that was not the way for me to do it.  I didn't want to do that.
Story_ID: 14898
Speaker 1: Now when you graduate from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you graduate with your degree in economics?
Speaker 2: Political Science.
Speaker 1: Political science.
Speaker 2: Political science and economics.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Political Science and economics.  But along the way you decided that you wanted journalism?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't really decide I wanted journalism. I started law school at Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and was there a semester.  My mom [Carmen Waston] died. And in between my graduation in '67 [1967].  And I was so shocked by the experience; I dropped out of law school 'cause I couldn't concentrate. She was forty-four years old.  I couldn't believe she had died.  So I dropped out of law school and decided to go into journalism.  Because I wanted to stay busy. And I had been at the 'Washington Post' already and I had, had an exposure to journalism.  Because I had been working while I was in school. So I decided I would--let me do that. Because it kept me busy. I was always working, chasing stories doing things.  You know, and try to get [page] A-1 stories, front-page stories all the time. So that kept me so busy.  Because that helped me to cope with the loss of my mom.  Whereas law school, the concentration that is required, I was just sitting there with the books opened and can't believe she had passed.
Story_ID: 14899
Speaker 1: How long did you work at the [Washington] Post?
Speaker 2: I worked at the 'Washington Post' actually through my whole Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] time.  From '62 [1962] to about '69 [1969] when I actually left.  I went to graduate school.  But I was still on the payroll up until about '72 [1972].  Because I took--I'd taken a leave of absence after I'd written a chapter of a book we did called, 'Ten Blocks from The White House'.  And all the reporters of the 'Washington Post' put it.  And, and I got a fellowship as a result of that.  A Consortium Fellowship both at Syracuse University and Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  And they were doing consortium degrees.  That was a very popular thing at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is a consortium--just the group?
Speaker 2: Well, consortium degree was a couple of colleges.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Colleges, okay.
Speaker 2: You could, you could take 50 percent of your course here,
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: That sort of thing.  I would do it and so that's, that's what, so I took a leave of absence in 1969 and went up to, to Syracuse  and Cornell.
Speaker 1: And you want--you got your masters in Public Administration.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm--yeah in public policy.
Speaker 1: Public policy.  Okay. And so, what were your thoughts about what you wanted to do at this point in time?
Speaker 2: Well, what I thought about, all my friends are going to Harvard [University Business School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and to [The] Wharton [School of Business, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But I still had this notion that was like the evil empire. Because this was, you know, men in the gray flannel suit. And I didn't really think of corporate America 'cause I didn't think black people had a chance in business anyway. So I wanted to go in the area that I thought I could be effective.  So I wanted to deal with public policy.  And, and public administration.  So I did that.  And my--you know, and I, I stayed and came back to the 'Post' and then went back to graduate school.  And I pursued my doctorate. And then I left because having done all my course work; I only had two Bs in graduate school.  I had all As.  I was a very good student when I went to professional school.  I wasn't all that good in undergrad 'cause I did a lot of things and enjoyed life. But when I went to graduate school I was a very good student.  And--and a--an associate dean, majority male said, that they were not committed to blacks at the doctoral level. And, myself and two other black males were the first three to be admitted.  And we walked out in protest, to make a statement because I was a '60s [1960s] child and you don't talk to us like that. So that's why I, I have an 'ABD', all but the dissertation, 'cause I--I just walked out. And my black life in corporate America, the forerunner to it, it became a book. But the forerunner to it, the dissertation topic, I just reached--I changed it.  Was, 'The Unequal Life Chance Of Black Public Administrators, An Historical Analysis From 1950 to 1970'.  And what I wanted to do is take a look at the people I'd gone to school with--McGeorge Bundy and Henry Kissinger, like at Harvard which--McGeorge Bundy was a better student than Henry Kissinger in class at Harvard. And take a look at them and see how they had fared compared to their peers. And that was my topic.  And I was in the process of getting ready to write it when this happened. And I just, you know, I was still, you know, I had a big 'fro [Afro] and I was into my thing.  And you just didn't talk to me like that.  And I walked out and became a consultant with Booz Allen and Hamilton [Inc.].  Reorganizing corporations all other the world and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 14900
Speaker 1: And what did you think of that Booz Allen [Hamilton, Inc.] experience?  What did you
Speaker 2: That was a very--I felt very raped by that experience.  I wasn't--it was like getting in a ring to fight Joe Frazier and I wasn't prepared.  Not Muhammad Ali, 'cause Ali would be more compassionate. It was a very brutal experience for me. I--I was so trusting when I got there.  Because the person who brought me in was--iss a Jewish man who was very--Marty Comroy--was very was like a godfather to me. By the time I got there he had moved on.  And I had gone there because he had persuaded me to come.  And I was sort of left to the wolves and I had no protection. And so it was just--and I really wasn't ready for combat.  And I always wanted to go back to fight them, again. It was like, like a fighter who had a fight early in his career and he didn't knock the person out. I wanted to go back when I got my skills together and take 'em out.  But I felt I was not managed well.  That experience was a very unpleasant experience. Now you must understand there were only three blacks on a professional staff for 1,300. So that was a new experience for Booz Allen to have black people.  And so we were not used properly and we were not treated properly.  So, I stayed there however about three years.  And--because--I am so--I was not going to quit except on my term.  And I moved on my terms.
Story_ID: 14901
Speaker 1: Even though you hated it and it felt like a prison, were there things that you learned in that environment?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was a harsh lesson, but it was a good lesson.  Because I became fight ready when I showed up at Xerox [Corporation]. I mean I knew the difference between a clenched fist and an opened hand.  And Booz Allen [Hamilton, Inc.] taught me that.  But not the way I'd hoped to have been taught that.  And so--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You know, I--can you be a little more specific?
Speaker 2: Well, I went in with a tremendous sense of naivete'. That I was a hot ticket and--but I didn't understand the resentment that--there were three levels of management, a officer, an associate and a consultant. And, and so what happened was--and I was a consultant. When the federal judges ordered the integration of the Richmond [Virginia] Public School, I was the lead consultant to, to let that happen. Booz Allen was chosen to do that and I had to go to Richmond and do that. I didn't really realize how unfamiliar the company was to having blacks in a leadership role, even though there was a black corporate officer there, who had been trying to pass, at the time, for white. And therefore anytime you would bring things that I would find offensive, they would say, "Well, that's funny, you know, Al never brought that up.  I mean, he never said that." So, I, I--finally when I realized that he was an impediment in that regard, I went to him and said, "Listen, if you don't want to be black, why don't you learn to speak Spanish and then pass something else.  But you can't be holding up the gate, like that.  You know, 'cause this is not right." And, and, it helped to radicalize him, because he had just sort of been lulled in a position that everything was fine 'cause he was the only one there and what have you. So it helped me to grow.  It helped me to see how people decide to accommodate things, even terrible things just to get by and he clearly had been accommodating things that he should have raised his hand.  Maybe because the numbers weren't there and he was the only one. I don't know. But in any event--so that was--and, and then I also came to understand that the people who I was reporting to resented me being there.  But this--my godfather, who was Jewish, had brought me in.  And he wasn't there and they were gonna sort of take me through the coals, and boot camp in effect.  And, and so--but what, what it did, what happened is, and the process that really toughened me was, was the following. If you were a 100 percent billable to a client, you wouldn't be able to get any of the work in the final presentation to the client. You couldn't get a sentence in a paragraph, and a paragraph in a chapter and a chapte in the final report, unless you could defend it with your peers. So that process, which I wasn't sure at first whether or not it was racist or not, became a very good process for me.  It would be lawyers would say, like moot court, it became a very good process. It helped me you know--and I learned a lot.  I mean, there was--every client that we had, we had an interdisciplinary approach to the problem.  So Booz Allen would be called in to fix the plumbing. And we would fix the plumbing for a client.  But we would say, "By the way you also have a leak in your roof.  Whether you want us to fix it or not, you know.  You're gonna have a leak in three months." So you, you did a complete diagnostic.  So it gave me a very good view of how when I went into Xerox to look for things that nobody would say anything about sometimes. And it sharpened my blade.  That if there was gonna be a cutting match, I would have not just knife in my hand, but sometime a machete, which was good.
Story_ID: 14902
Speaker 1: How did Xerox [Corporation] happen? How did that opportunity happen? You're disillusioned with Booz Allen [Hamilton, Inc.].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I wouldn't say I was disillusioned with Booz Allen. I mean I am going along, young neophyte.  And really I'm, I'm just going in new territory. I don't understand this so-called business world. I mean I was so into it that I went to work on Sun--on Christmas day and forgot it was Christmas.  That's how much I was into my job.  But that's the kind of person I am. I got in my car by the zoo here in Washington [D.C.] and just went right down to 1025 Connecticut Avenue, Blake Building.  Went upstairs to the fourth floor.  And then I realized it was Christmas.  I mean that's just how much I was so deep into the thing. But, I was trying to prove that I belonged there.  And I--which was crazy.  I should not have been so one-dimensional. But anyway.  But, but, in any event--so I was just going along and experiencing.  And it turns out through a headhunter--you know, they, they track people. And they called and said, you know, "We want to talk about--just let's get together and have lunch." And I went to Clyde's Restaurant on M Street [Washington, D.C.]. And we had--you know, we talked.  And, and this guy said, "Listen, you know, Xerox is interested in you and what have you.  And they said you could start in Chicago [Illinois], you can start in LA [Los Angeles, California]. You can start in Rochester [New York], or you can start in Washington.  You don't even have to leave D.C." And so, you know, I listened and they called and we talked.  And when I decided I was going to fully explore it, I did my G-2 work and found out no one had been successful in Xerox who had not worked in Rochester. So I said, you know, raised my hand and said, "Let me go there first, get that out of the way," 'cause I'd lived upstate and I knew how brutal the winters were.  And I'd promised myself not to go back.  But I said, "Hey, you know, this is time to do it.  Punch the ticket, get out of here." And all that. And a year in Rochester--and then I decided to join Xerox.  And I started in Rochester in '76 [1976]. '76, '77 [1977]. I agreed on '76.  I, I think I started January '77.  But I mean I really had agree. And I, you know, relocated to Rochester, lived in a house that Eastman Kodak [Company] had that the slaves used to live in. Frederick Douglass lived in Rochester.  The Underground Railroad stopped there.  And--and I lived in like a slave quarters, which is very nice.  I mean they had fixed it up real nice. I mean but just the history of the house, I mean--and, and I had such a big 'fro [Afro]--as big as your screen here, that I used it as an umbrella, with the snow to go to work. I'd walk 'cause I had a little 450 [SL] Mercedes and I parked it.  I mean I'd garaged it 'cause I didn't want it to get rusty and dirty. And I walked to work, which was about ten, thirteen blocks.  And I used my hair as an umbrella with the snow.  And I'd go and just shake it off.  It was incredible.  I had such a big 'fro. And nobody could see my face, you know.  And I thought it was kinda cute. Anyway.  So I went to--I joined Xerox in Rochester and I worked there.  And in a year in there I got a promotion to Stamford, Connecticut, the corporate headquarters. And then I was in Stamford, worked there for about oh eighteen years or so.  And then I went back to Rochester. I mean to work, but not to live.  I commuted. By the time I went back to Rochester, the last seven years, Xerox has jets and that's how I'd fly to work.

Speaker 1: Can you describe the positions you've had and the years you've had them [Xerox Corporation]? Just, you know, for chronology?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, well, I had-- I started off being a manager of compliance, government compliance--Xerox. And then I did HR, human resource work.  And then I became a manager of higher education.  And then we created an Urban Affairs Department. I became manager of higher education and urban affairs. And then I became manager--then I became vice president from that position in 1994, I think it was, until now.
Speaker 1: And what, what would you say if you describe the things that you're proudest of?  You know, and the things you've done during your tenure?  I'd like you to sort of recount those.
Speaker 2: Well, I think the thing that I'm proudest of when Xerox was in South Africa, I took a lot of abuse in defending Xerox's position.  Because [Nelson] Mandela wanted us out in terms of the sanctions. So any corporation that was in South Africa, the ANC [African National Congress] wanted--the cities passed ordinance to forbid us that if you--if you're in South Africa we won't do business with you. Well for Xerox, that was a lot of business.  So I put together a team and we went and testified around the country at the various cities.  Houston [Texas], major cities, New York City, everywhere.  California, LA [Los Angeles, California], San Francisco [San Francisco].  I had to testify in some cases.  Some cases I knew the people well enough, like Tom Bradley, when he was mayor of LA, that I could meet with him without having to go. In Houston--or sometimes the competition would reveal that Xerox is in South Africa.  And say to a city, "How could you be doing business and they're in South Africa?" But--so, so we worked hard.  And we were able to as a result of that, convince them that we had an exit strategy that made sense.  Which we did.  And which we had put together.  And not to penalize us. And it saved Xerox $464.9 million. So I'm very proud of that. I'm proud of a lot of the fact that when I went to Xerox there were no black direct reports to a vice president, and I lived to see two black males were candidates for the presidency at Xerox.  Neither one of them made it, even though both of them had made the most money for Xerox in the last 25 years--they passed them over.  But at least two of them were candidates for the presidency. And a guy by the name of Addison Barry Rand, A. Barry Rand. He became chairman of Avis [Rent A Car System, Inc.].  He left Xerox. And the other person was a guy named Rich Barton.  And he left and, be--and set up his own company on the West Coast.  And so--both brilliant individuals, either of whom would have made wonderful choices.  So again you know--and, and I feel I played a role in that, because Xerox had a chairman by the name of David Kearns, who had an open mind, and was from Rochester, New York, had not really encountered blacks until he went to the [U.S.] Navy.  But he was not one of these bleeding heart people.  As a matter of fact, he was a Republican--was very progressive guy on social matters.  And, and I think one of his best friends in the Navy was a black man. Because when his daughter was in school in the University of Chicago [Illinois], she lived at their home, this black man's home.  That's where she went to school and lived, and they remain. So he's a outstanding--and he adopted a black child. He lost his sight and he became Undersecretary of Education during George [H. W.] Bush's administration; [George] W. [Bush]'s father's administration.  Sometimes confusing but anyway. And he was Undersecretary for Education.  But a very--one of the nicest human beings you'd ever want to put eyes on. So in a way, I feel I contributed to moving the ball better for the people of color by the various jobs I had and taking on assignments inside Xerox that a lot of people had thought that it would be the doom for your career.  And I felt I could take it on and still prevail. I'd never done affirmative action.  I didn't go to school to learn anything like that.  But I raised my hand and said, "I'll take the job." Even though it--people say, "Your career will die." Now, I do understand that it took me a longer time to become a vice president.  So I did pay a price for that.
Story_ID: 14904
Speaker 1: And I also wrote 'Black Life In Corporate America' while I was at Xerox [Corporation].  Which was very tough. And I also taught as an adjunct professor at the Yale [University] School of Management [New Haven, Connecticut], SOM. And so I, I realize I paid some price for writing that book.  Because it--it brought and opened up people's eyes to the conditions that black people and women and people of color were living under inside these corporations.
Speaker 2: So let's, let's talk about the book and how the book even came about--the idea of the book came about.
Speaker 1: Well, the book came about because I wanted--and my co-author at the time, George Davis, who had been a 'Washington Post' reporter with me, and a colleague and a friend.  We wanted to do a book that had never been done before.  I didn't, you know--and no one had ever written a book, turned in a manuscript on Friday, and show up at work on Monday morning--black or white in America. The closest was this gentleman [J. Patrick Wright] who had written this book, that 'On A Clear Day You Can See General Motors'.  But knowing that he had to leave to do that.  No one had ever done that. So I wanted to do that. And no one had ever captured--it was an unreported story in terms of what people of color went through, and women and others. So I wanted to take a look at that.  But it really wasn't about that.  It really was about people who had power and people who did not have power and how it affected those who didn't have power. But the popular thinking at the time by Doubleday [Publishing], who was our publisher, that whites would never read a book written by two blacks, and black people don't read.  And, therefore, there was no need to publish more than about 5,000 copies. Well, the book of course wind up selling about half a million copies.  'Cause I always had to go back to print.  And we marketed it very vigorously. And so, you know, we got a lot of help from other people. We went to churches.  We did a lot of things, alternative marketing. I did about 368 TV shows.  Every major show I did in the country at the time and interviews, and what have you. I mean radio, TV, print, everything.  And it became "the book", so to speak.
Speaker 2: Now what preparation did you do for writing the book? You know he was--you were the inside person.  He was the outside person.  How did the roles really work?
Speaker 1: Well, 'Washington Post' is very good.  You know, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein wrote, you know, 'All The President's Men'.  They do co-bylines very good at the 'Washington Post'.  Because the 'Washington Post' is a writer's paper. The 'New York Times' in contrast is an editor's paper. If you really wanted to write, when I came along, you went to the 'Washington Post'.  I can't make judgment about how--what they are today.  But that's how it was.  So that's why, why I went there.  'Cause it's a writer's paper.  And so I went there to do that. And so, we've always had shared bylines.  And, the prospective was different.  We interviewed the various people.  And over 300 corporations.  And we put roughly about 175 or so in the book. And we interviewed people at the major corp--'Fortune' 500, in the middle and at the bottom end of it.  So we had a sort of a range and spectr of that. And--like your project.  When somebody--we would interview a person.  They'd say, "You really need to talk to so and so." That sort of thing.  And of course, what we did was provide anonymity.  That people would be free to speak.  It's not like somebody now would be able to know who I am.  In this case, they--we protected people, gave them pseudonyms and we, we spliced a lot of--and merged a lot of their characters together.  Because what we wanted was the message, not to deal with the messenger. And a lot of the messengers, who have the best information, are reluctant to speak if they're on record.
Speaker 2: Now what was the message that the book actually ends up conveying? What, what, what did your, your, your interviews show?  And what does it talk about in the book?
Speaker 1: Well what the interviews--what the research showed was that, at that time--we understand it's 1982. I'm trying to do an update on that called, 'Not One Of The Boys'.  Subtitled 'Reflections on Power In America'.  What it showed was that blacks were not participating at that time in key jobs. And that they were resourced--and corporate America then, was like baseball, before Jackie Robinson.  And what we really wanted to do is to bring the Jackie Robinsons in baseball in the corporate world inside.  That they could have opportunities to play. And so that really was the message.  That we want to--and we wanted the decision makers to be able to have a reference. When they see a person of color that may skin and grin, and in silence, it didn't necessarily mean they were in agreement with how they were being treated. But there may be a lot of issues that underline that behavior.  And they need to understand that. So what we really want to do is sort of just begin the dialogue twenty years later.  Next year what I'd like to do is turn up the volume on that by coming out with a book that reflects that called, 'Not One Of The Boys'.  Subtitled, 'Reflections On Power In America'.

Speaker 1: What was Xerox [Corporation]'s reaction [to Watson's book, 'Black Life In Corporate America'] ?
Speaker 2: That was a very interesting reaction.  A lot of people were reluctant to get close to me because they felt that they would be quoted in a future book or something. So it was almost like having AIDS or leprosy or something.  People backed away from me.  Strangely enough, the former chairman of Xerox held up 'Black Life' at a [National] Urban League EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] dinner, at the Waldorf [Astoria Hotel, New York, New York]  and said, "A friend of mine wrote this book.  If he's in the audience, I'd like him to come forward." And they came forward--I came forward.  And we hugged, as two men can hug without any other implications.  And we just hugged.  And, you know, he said, how proud he was of me. Now after that everybody walk up to me, "You're my main man!" Suddenly, you know. I took--"I was on that same boat that came from Jamaica with you, when you came up."  Suddenly now that the white man had blessed me and said it was okay, suddenly. And that was a very disconcerting thing for me.  And so that was dividing time for me.  It was very--I was very conflicted by that. That we needed the approval and the sanction of others to say something, how we feel. So I learned.  But, you know, I try to learn in all--a lot of experiences.  So I learned. But, but it was a very difficult period because a lot of people thought it was about Xerox.  And they didn't want to be associated with it because they were doing well.  And if they were associated with me, they may get fired. And I think Xerox was in a very difficult position, because it--I was on every show.  And I think they couldn't--I had the senior management, mainly the chairman and the vice chairman--[William F.] Bill Glavin. was the vice chairman, was like a godfather to me.  A big brother and godfather, and so was David Kearns. So I had them.  But my immediate boss was very resentful of me.  And what was interesting is that I would do a lot of shows and tape like, you know, all hours and stuff. Then I'd be at work.  So they would be turning on the morning news and see me and or something.  It would be taped and then I'd be at work.  So they would be freaked out.  They couldn't understand how I was doing all these things and still not letting my job--I was determined not to let my job say, "See he's out on these TV-- What is that?" Now I had a lot of vacation time.  Because I'd you know, I'd gone nine years once without taking any vacation.  I was just into the job so much.  Because the way it was at Xerox, they made you feel that in effect, this was your company.  And so, I felt I had to run it like my own business. And so I was so much into it, I felt guilty.  Because I traveled so much, I felt that, that was the vacation. And, you know, even though I was traveling to go to business meetings and stuff.  So I hadn't taken vacation.  So I had so much vacation accumulated over the years that I could have--I don't know. I still think, you know, I mean, if the truth be told, I may have over a year's vacation easily.

Speaker 1: Really this was the first book of its kind, ever.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It was the first book of its kind.
Speaker 1: And there have been subsequent--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No question.
Speaker 1: --you know, books that have been written.  And your views on those? Are any of them that stand out in your mind?  Or, you know, that you'd be critical of? Or you think are, you know.  You know.  Follow in the footsteps or--I'm just trying to understand--you know, you, you were--you know, a lot of times people are pioneers.  You know, and they're the start of something.  You know, they're either copycats that happened or they're things that sort of build upon the analysis that was stated there.  That's what I'm just wondering what?
Speaker 2: Well, Robin Wright wrote a book about professional families and the effect and all that has. Which is from a chapter of her book.  You know.  And they say imitation is the best form of flattery. I have a lot of respect for her. There're some people who have written a lot of different books over the years. I'm not terrible critical of them, because I've never felt any of them could ever write my book.  And, and even though I haven't written another book since then, they still haven't written the book I'm gonna write.  So I've never--it--you know, for me, the--it's big enough.  That would be like a I'm a singer and I'm--but I know there's some other singing talent.  And I'm trying to keep it down 'cause I don't want nobody to hear it. They have their audience hopefully.  And I still go through airports.
Speaker 1: I thought the truck was louder than I heard--go ahead.
Speaker 2: I go through airports. I go places and people come up to me and still want me to come out with the book. So, I don't feel-- It's like a singer has a sound.  You know, a lot of people imitate Smokey Robinson.  But they're no Smokey Robinsons.
Story_ID: 14907
Speaker 1: You had the inside part of working with human resources, and you talked about that, you know, the, the role you helped play within the organization. At the, you know, the head.
Speaker 2: And the image part of the corporation.  I had corporate affairs area.  I worked in corporate affairs, which was in Xerox [Corporation].  Well it's the image.  We--we made sure our core values was consistent with our business practice. So I interacted with major customers.  For instance, my saving Xerox $464.9 million was a function of relationships I had either when I was a reporter at the 'Washington Post' or re-organized corporations that I was able to leverage.  That it caused Xerox not to lose those businesses. [Los Angeles California mayor] Tom Bradley says, "Glegg, I'll hold up until you can get Xerox to get out of South Africa." [New York City mayor] David Dinkins would say that.  Our dear friend, Ellen Terry, who is like a godmother to me, had a dinner at her house.  And bring the mayor there without a cameras so we can talk.  And says, "You know, you're both my godchildren.  Don't hurt, you know, if you do this also." And he would say, "Glegg, you gotta get Xerox out of there.  And I'll hold it as long as I can  'cause I promised Nelson [Mandela] that I'll crack down." So, so, so I--when, when--when people will tell you.  And that's the problem with academicians.  Academicians write books based on survey.  I'm a--I'm a journalist by background.  I deal with the reality of it. I don't let the numbers tell me what the issues are. So you could do any kind of numbers and you could come out with something and then write to those numbers.  We don't do that. You go and you interview people.  You get to find out what the real story is.  Why a person who had gone through Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], where they say, "We make generals, not sergeants." And all the people who come out who are generals look the same.  And, and yet there were other people of color and they don't. I mean--so you know, those are the kinds of issues that I would deal with. What is--what are the barriers? Why is it?  And you talk to the people, you know, who are in a position to make those changes.  Which mean you talk to white majority manager--male managers. What are the problems? Why? That has not happened. Why wasn't [A.] Barry Rand chosen to be or Rich Barton to be head of Xerox? [Kenneth] Ken Chenault has made it at American Express.  You know.  And there was even a story in the 'Wall Street Journal', a rare column that said, "Jewish mentors did a better job at transitioning over than WASPs [White Anglo-Saxon Protestants].  Because they had suffered and they understood that.  And they, you know--and I think that was the case in, in American Express.
Story_ID: 14908
Speaker 1: Something is wrong about the amount of people that went to school in my time, in the '60s, [1960s] and equipped themselves.  And it's just a handful of blacks who are presidents or chairmans of these corporations. So something is still wrong with that.
Speaker 2: Why do you think [A.] Barry Rand got passed over [to be chairman of Xerox Corporation]?
Speaker 1: I don't really know.  I think he'd be the best person to answer that question.  I mean, you know, if you talk to him. I would still like to know why 'cause I think he was prepared to be chairman--president and CEO [chief executive officer]. But--And even president CEO before chairman and CEO.  So he had done everything to prepare himself. He had worked hard.  So did Rich Barton.  They both worked hard. One of them should have made it.  You know?  I mean--but neither one of them made it.  So--I-that is still a source of puzzlement.  And by the time I finish this book ['Not One of The Boys: Reflections on Power in America'], I hope I might get a better handle on that in my own mind.
Story_ID: 14909
Speaker 1: Are there other things that you are proud of that you accomplished while you were there?
Speaker 2: At Xerox [Corporation]? Yeah.  I felt good that I worked at a company for twenty-four years, that I felt that I was able to shape its image--in my community anyway.  And that I was able to keep the company making sure that it had lived up to the promise. Which was never stated publicly, but one of the core values.  And so I feel good about that.  And I feel good that we were able at the height of all of this, we had about twenty-seven black vice presidents and when I went there, there were none. So there--to some degree even though we're back to where we were--there are several now.  But they're not--And there's none in line to be president like we did before. So we've just--you know, it was like an earthquake.  And it just shook our foundation. And we just--we don't understand how we got back in this position.  It's hard to explain.  But it represents how fragile this whole question of who is moving forward.  Because also not everybody who leads that pack feels beholden to bring the rest through.  The truth of the matter is that in some companies, a lot of blacks will get together and push a person.  And when they get there, they don't really reach back and help the others.  Or they just help a few that they have personal relationship with, and they don't help the rest.  They don't see that. And I think part of what I noticed in terms of the younger blacks who have come in the company, they really believe that their progress is ultimately based on their own ability  'cause they went to Harvard [University] Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They don't know that [H.] Naylor Fitzhugh graduated in 1934 and actually Wharton [School of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in 1933 graduated first black in their MBA program. But they suffer from the sense of anomie in terms of their history.  And--which is a problem for black people.  Because we just don't take time to understand the richness of the contribution we have made on--within the [African] diaspora. And so you're inside there.  And, and so you have part of coping.  If you're a black professor at a major institutions like Harvard or Stanford [University, Stanford, California] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] or what have you, you say these things.  You know, you say these things, "Well, you know, to do--the only way you can get ahead and become candidate, to be in the line operation." Well, blacks been going in the line and outperforming everybody and still don't make it! So, you know, it's insane not to deal with the reality of that. That's the problem I have with some of my colleagues.  There's a lot of, what I consider in effect, you know, just dishonesty.  Intellectual dishonesty not to deal with that.  Because I'm not gonna get up--I taught at Yale for four years in the School of Management.  I never--none of my students, black or white or what have you could've walk away thinking that Professor Watson told them it was red when it was white.  That sort of thing. It's, it's important that you, you come clean with people. Let them decide how they may want to do it.  So, so it's easy for, you know, people to say, particularly professors who have never had the practical experience and just write books about what they think, how to get. And some students coming back and said, "Oh, you know, I'm doing very well," 'cause when you come out of business school, you do very well for a while.  And then you hit that plateau.  And then you realize that your elevator will not go to the top floor.  But it's not because you didn't push the highest button in the elevator.  You're just on the wrong elevator. I was--I remember a experience will always stand out in my mind.  When I--I was in Xerox a year.  I got this big promotion to come to the corporate headquarters in Stamford [Connecticut]. And I had this corner office.  And, you know, I could look out and I had just read Michael Korda's book on power ['Power! How to Get It, How to Use It'].  And I--here I had this big corner office.  I could watch the ducks on the pond.  And then, you know, I said, "My God!  If my mom could only see me now.  She'd be so proud of me." And I went outside.  I went outside my office and to go out in the lobby area.  And a limousine driver came up.  No. This white guy came up and he ran up to me and he said, "Limo, limo?" He thought I was a limousine driver. So one thing about the system, it, it always helps you with reality.  In a way I don't mind it, in a way.  Because it helps a lot of people who drift away.  It reminds you.  And a lot of us have to be reminded who we are sometimes. And I don't--I'm not one of those people.  But I--you know, I don't think I am.  People who know me would not tell you that. But, but, but, you know.  But a lot of us drift.  And here I was.  You know, I was on cloud nine, feeling good.  I'd just come back from a presentation.  And I thought I was doing so well! I also discovered I was not in the building that the chairman and the vice chairman and president was in. I was in an annex.  No wonder I had this big office.  A corner office.  But I didn't know that.  I thought I was big stuff! So, it's all in perspective.  Now I could always be happy that they let me come that far.  And be happy that, you know--because sometimes when you talk to black folks and you say, how well they're doing. It's always in relation.  If you go in and you're interviewing people inside corporate America.  And they tell you their making so much money.  It's always in relative to each other.  It's not in comparison to a white colleague who may take less risk and have less preparation, who sits across the hall from them. You know, and they'll say, "Man I'm killing it!" Because they're making more than a brother and a sister.  And--because that's how we judge ourselves. Now so one or two, you know, have broken in the money. I call them the "money boys" have broken through and make the big money.  But by and large--and even in those cases where the--where blacks are making the big money, some will be making it big and they don't make--they don't make--they don't work hard to get anybody close to them.  The conditioning is that they hear footsteps.  And so they just find ways to shoot anybody close to them, including another black. In part, it's part of the nature of that.  But I--their, their models of others who have helped white males, who have helped each other. They got in a situation and said, "Hey, look, one of us gonna be president.  Whichever, take care of the other." And they work hard and do that. But we haven't got to that point yet that we can trust each other to work and do that.
Story_ID: 14910
Speaker 1: So what do you think would help us get to that point [equality for blacks in leadership roles in corporate America]? What do you think is really necessary? And that one question.  And the other is why should any black pursue a career in corporate America?
Speaker 2: Well, what I think might be helpful, and I don't know this for a fact.  But I think it--when you read, 'Not One of The Boys'--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Don't, don't, don't do that.
Speaker 2: (laughs) Okay.  You know, I will share some of that.  But anyway.  I do believe--you know, you can edit that out.  I do believe that the more people are in the pool the more likely people will trust the life savers. And so, so you need more.  And that's just a optimistic view. And quite frankly, when I used to give speeches to--whether it's commencement addresses or management addresses and stuff. I used to always think that was the way to do. You go and you come out of these professional schools 'cause a lot--not everybody's doing business.  And sometimes they're lawyers--law schools. Like Reggie [Reginald F.] Lewis, you know, and Ken [Kenneth Chenault] are not MBA's.  They got law degrees from Harvard [University Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. But in any event what my--my sense is that some of the new models that we're seeing with this new hip-hop generation, particularly in music and not in the traditional business sense.  But they're--they're doing different forms of business.  You know. Because I've maintain that 60 percent of American culture is black culture.  And obviously these young generation decided, "Why shouldn't we participate in making the money off this culture? All these other people, Tommy Hilfiger, and all these people are selling our stuff.  Why can't we be designers?  Why can't we produce our own stuff? Why do we have to go through these people? And think about all the Temptations and all these other groups got ripped off and stuff." So they have decided that they found a way to bypass the middle person and go directly to the consumers. And I think that it--that's very encouraging for this generation.  Because I don't think--I don't think that they're gonna come out of business schools or professional schools and go into the IBM [Corporation]s and the Xerox [Corporation]s of the world. Now that was good.  Because that was considered the best way to learn the business.  And you made money using what they call, "OPM", other peoples' money. You made mistakes off other peoples' money. So you'd come into Procter and Gamble having come out of Stanford [University, Stanford, California].  You become a product manager and you deal with all aspects of running a business.  From the market research, the pricing, production, time to market.  You do all of that. And you get that experience using somebody else's money.  Then you take that experience and you go out and start your own business. That was considered the proper way to do. But now--I mean the success of a lot these younger people, they're obviously in businesses that their, their hit rates are so high, so even those who are failing still will be encouraged to go that way.  Rather than going and spend time. And they may go in these companies and spend long time like myself and stay too long.  And therefore, you get comfortable with that lifestyle, but you really have not generated wealth, or created wealth. These younger generations and these entrepreneurs now are creating wealth. Now what will be interesting and different from their predecessors is whether or not they'll come together and do things like buy a football or baseball team and do things. Because, you know, Michael Jordan's money go straight up in the sky in Chicago [Illinois].  Like the Sears Towers and Patrick Ewing's money go up just like the Empire State [Building]. It doesn't come together. That's a function of how they're managed.  There's a function on a whole lot of distrust.  But there's no reason why, Oprah [Winfrey] and Bill Cosby and these guys couldn't get together and buy a basketball franchise or football--I mean, you know, do all that. They could do that.  It don't have to be the Harlem Globetrotters to, you know, to that. And they could buy a baseball.  They could buy--I mean, but it's not happening. Blacks are becoming partners.  Like the [Washington] Redskins, [Daniel] Snyder, this young very aggressive Jewish owner.  He has a black friend from school days.  And he's a partner with him. And I think a lot more people like that, who came up with blacks and say, "Look, I know this guy.  As a matter of fact I used to look off his paper.  I know he's bright.  So this is crazy.  And, you know, Bob let's go in together and try this? Why don't we try to do this thing?  I want you to be a part of that." I think there's more hope for that than the traditional way.  Because the corporations, I mean, believe me.  It, it is a hard nut to crack. You could be there and do everything.  And one minute they just say, "We don't want you anymore." And so life inside corporate America for blacks and whites still remain very different.
Story_ID: 14911
Speaker 1: So do you recommend or not recommend it [a career in corporate America] as a career track for Black Americans?
Speaker 2: I used to recommend it. I'm not recommending it any more. I am very fascinated with the new approach these younger generations of blacks are taking. Grant you it is not in all the businesses and certainly not in traditional businesses.  But if they are successful in some of these businesses, they may acquire some of these other businesses.  And make them, if they became a holding company, a conglomerate make them buy out pieces.  Xerox [Corporation] may be selling some operation.  They could buy it and make it work for them.  Because they have a certain pizzazz. I don't mean the shoot up gang stuff.  I mean I'm not talking about that thing. But clearly Russell Simmons, people like that.  I mean there are some people who have their feet on the ground.  They're doing some fantastic things and there's a lot of fascination with that.  And you won't get that in Harvard [University] Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And you won't get that at a Wharton [School of The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  You won't get that at a Stanford [University], [Stanford, California]. And they're--they're making money.  They're, you know.  And I think the society is having a difficulty dealing with them. And a lot of them don't understand what they're doing.  It's like winning the lottery and still wearing the same clothes and looking the same way. They don't know what they've done.  So they're not being managed well in terms of what their behavior ought to be.  So they wind up in trouble.  All these people in trouble. You know.  'Cause it's so easy.  Because of some lifestyle issue-they don't know.  And they're not trusting enough to turn to a elder in the race to help them because their agents have told them, "These guys just want your money." You see.  And they were--and the agents were there giving the appearance, buying them a house or a car when they were an athlete or something like that.  So they still are tied into them.
Speaker 1: Now so if--do you think it's important that black pursue businesses?
Speaker 2: Oh, by all means.  I think--I think if blacks become successful in business as their capable of and they ought to be. Then the issue of whether or not you're invited to a country club and get to play at this club is irrelevant.  I mean why would you want to be around people that don't want you to be there? Even though the deals are being cut there.  You know that.  And the most important hole on a golf course is the 19th hole, not the 18th hole, in the clubhouse. But why be around people that don't want you?  I mean when Jews got turn down from all these country clubs, Congressional Country Club [Bethesda, Maryland], that had an ordinance to let in all these people. And they got turned down.  They just formed their own club.  Burning Tree [Country Club, Greenwich, Connecticut], they just formed--set up their own. I mean and that's how you have to do.  You just have to create your own.  'Cause America will allow you to do that.  And create your own and just don't focus on that.  Because you can die so frustrated because you're waiting for people to approve of you. Now grant you it's still difficult because you have to get capital and all of that. Financial institutions are still held by these people and what have you.  But, you know, there are ways to get inside of that too.  There are alternative ways to do that. I mean when the movie 'Malcolm [X'] was done, Spike [Lee] got a lot of people to put up their own money to do it.  Because the traditional way it couldn't be done. So, that's why it--that's why this new group of entrepreneurs are so fascinating.  Because they're going around the traditional way of doing business. They have found an alternative way to success.

Speaker 1: You have been critical--or at least that's what I--read about sports. You know, black sports figures.
Speaker 2: Oh you read--you read all of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And I was wondering if you could comment on that? It was sports figures and who else? It was--I don't think it was religious. But it was the Oprah Winfreys.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I was wondering if you could comment about that?
Speaker 2: Well my, my--my disappointment was that these athletes who are not using their wealth, which is calculated with the general condition of black people in this country.  So when they talk about income per capita and how well blacks are doing, that means Michael Jordan's wealth and Oprah's are factored into it, to the person who's homeless. Yet--yet they--they don't really--they're not--their agents control so much, that there are cases of black athletes, whose parents have to go to an agent to get to their own son. Now, you know, I don't care who that person was.  I would disown them.  I could never have a child that I would have to go to an agent, a majority male to get to my child. So I--I mean that--something is wrong about that, now.  Now in part, that's because, you know, we also think that we can't money--manage money as well as others. But [Kareem Abdul] Jabbar lost $40 million.  He had to play as long as he did because his agent, a guy named Scott, a white guy, took his money and invested in Arabian horses.  And so he lost all his money.  This means that's why he had to play long throwing the skyhook. He wanted to retire long before he did. So there are enough examples of that.  And my--my concern--my issue is that these people are not having wealth formation. That's how you build a race.  That's how you build a community.  You have to build wealth.  And you have the capacity.  They have the capacity to do that. And if--if Michael Jordan were to say, "Every Nike shoe that the lace that goes in it must be built by a black manufacturer somewhere in North Carolina," it would be done. It wouldn't cost him nothing to do that.  But he's not socialized to understand the importance of that.  So he has been chosen, and he's been well taken care of, and he stays on that side.  And that's my issue with people like that. And I--you know.  I've been in his company, in his presence rather. I don't know the man.  I don't--it won't make a difference in my life if I ever get to know him or so. And the only thing we have in common, we're both Aquarians.  But I mean I don't--so is Oprah.  But I don't have any--I'm just saying if you're gonna be a role model then you gotta do it. Now, [Earvin] 'Magic' [Johnson], on other hand is building businesses in the community by contrast, as an example.  So to me, so that's, that's the issue I have with that.

Speaker 1: Are there people, blacks in business that you've admired over the years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you admire now? And I was wondering if you could tell me who?
Speaker 2: Well [H.] Naylor Fitzhugh was a professor of mine at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And he was somebody I admired. You're talking about just blacks?
Speaker 1: I don't care.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh, okay.  Well Cliff Alexander I've admired him.  I mean he's--that's a big business.  He ran the [U.S.] Army and he also run private sector business.  He's been a good role model for me.  I've admired [Addison] Barry Rand, what he's been able to achieve.  [Kenneth] Ken Chenault.  As a matter of fact, I admired his young brother, who just left the company out in Iowa, John--that had this problem. When he left they said, "His numbers weren't right." But I think that was a case where they thought they were getting something and got something else. In other words, I think he's a stand-up brother.  And I admire David Kearns, who was at Xerox [Corporation].  I have tremendous admiration for him.  I admired Coy Eklund, who used to be the chairman of Equitable [Life Assurance Society, now AXA FInancial Inc.].  I admire Darwin [Nathaniel] Davis who was at Equitable.  I admire Frank Savage. There's a lot of people I've admired.

Speaker 1: You're of West Indian heritage.  And there has been often West Indians have been--people of West In--you know, of Caribbean heritage, I should say.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Like Peter Bynoe.
Speaker 1: Right. Have done better. You know than average--I mean not average but--
Speaker 2: African Americans.
Speaker 1: African Americans.  Those born in this country as oppose to those who, whose parents migrated here. And I was wondering if you have a comment about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My comment about that is it's a, that's a trick--that's a trick question?
Speaker 1: It's not a trick question.
Speaker 2: No not from you. It---I've been--that question has been raised with me a zillion times. I've never done an interview which it's never would come. I'm--and that's why I you know, I should have prefaced that to say that. My sense is that, that it tends to be--when I was at the 'Washington Post' there were five black report--I mean seven black reporters, five were of West Indian heritage. [Robert C.] Bob Maynard is a Bajan [from Barbados], Leon Dash is as well. And one of things that--it can be divisive if you don't--I worked very hard not to do a piece about the contribution of West Indians to the Civil Rights Movement.  Because what happens it put--pits one against the other. And I'm very uncomfortable with that.  Because in the end, unless I decide to speak patois, which I can, when I want to--and I'm walking down the street, I'm just another 'N-word' person. I mean nobody knows who I am, unless I, you know, I decide I want to speak that. And so--and that's when you get when you're walking down the street regularly you get the full import of what people think about you.  So I've always liked that. Now granted of course there're differences. I mean--and Ossie Davis, just recently at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was talking about when he got his award.  He was talking about why he learned West Indians and hung around with them. But my sense is that--my sense is that slavery--it has had something to do with the history of slavery.  Because I feel that people of West Indian heritage have had a longer time managing their own affairs, even during the colonial period, than African Americans. So they have had more experience of doing that. And they have found a lot of things that African Americans tolerated intolerable long time ago. So Marcus Garvey. Thus you got the, you know, Malcolm [X], I mean a lot of are like that.  And so, you know, it also has to do with if you're in a country, as a lot of these West Indians, where everything that operates is run by a black person, the light, everything.  You know, your doctor, your dentist.  You know, you have all these things. You really don't think it's a big thing for you to do that. So you're expected to do that. Whereas if you're in a country, where the only time you may see a black role model maybe on TV doing the evening news or something like that.  Occasionally, sometimes, certain markets. You don't think certain things are possible.  But I would say a child raised in the island, there's no limit in their mind about what is possible because they have seen people who look like them doing everything. Whereas here, you had all of these laws that prevent you from doing it, even if you had the capability, for a longer period of time. Let's face it, Civil Rights Act was only, you know, in 1964.  So, I mean--and look what it took.  The lives and you know, good--you know, wonderful white people, who got--[Michael] Schwerner and all these people went south and got killed.  And--just trying to register people to vote. And so that was not an issue for somebody growing up in the islands. Plebiscite had passed and people had a right to vote.  Pick their chief minister as they called it, at the time and stuff.  So I think the sense of self was formed much earlier. That's why I resent it as a young man the idea of bowing to some woman.  Some white woman named Queen. I--that offended me.  And so I didn't--I didn't want to go to England to school or something like that. I mean I knew if I'd been a tennis player it would've been difficult if I won Wimbledon [Championships], what to do 'cause I knew I wasn't gonna bow.  I'd probably just shake her hand.  And I'd be the first to do it.  If I were that good to have won Wimbledon. I would never have bowed to anybody.  I, I don't care what the protocol was.  That offends me to bow to somebody. I may have bowed to Nelson Mandela because of what he endured.  I mean, you know, that sort of thing.  But I mean to me that's not a proper place for me.  Because the history of our people have been spent with our heads down so long and on our knees. I didn't want--I wouldn't want to extend that in any kind of, you know.  Even if I was Ambassador to the Court of St. James and presented my papers, I wouldn't bow down.  I wouldn't kneel.  I would hand them my papers, shake their hands and that's the way I would do it.

Speaker 1: Do you consider yourself Caribbean American, Jamaica American or African American or all of the above?
Speaker 2: All--E.  All of the above.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: Because I've been physically here.  My heart's been in the Caribbean. I never left it.  I mean I still love my food.  I love my people, I love my friends and I have friends on both sides. And I think I act as a plank to help to translate both sides from time to time and I like that role. And I like it because I like my--at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] I had African friends.  I still have them today.  I mean we play together. I cleared a lot of things up in my mind.  Because I'd never really been around Africans. I had been around people who had been to Africa, who were from the Caribbean.  I had had teachers who had been.  But I'd never really had a lot of experience. So, you know, I--I think I consider myself a black man within the [African] diaspora. The fact that I was born in Jamaica and grew up in America is not that relevant.  I, I am, you know, wherever I am--I am who I am.  Which is a black man.
Speaker 1: And what does it mean to you to be of African descent?
Speaker 2: I'm a very proud person.  I'm, I'm proud of the contribution people of color have made to civilization.  And you know, I'm constantly amazed of the lack of respect and understanding others have for the contribution people have made. Not just for the stoplight and all these things and you know, the Duke Ellingtons and stuff like that.  Not just in the artistic field and all that.  But just, you know, in all walks of life.  The [Dr.] Charles Drews. I mean, you know, and the major contributions people have made. I mean, you know, for Arthur Ashe to have played tennis as a young man in tournaments in the South.  But he couldn't go and wash after.  And his father would be in the, in the car waiting for him.  And how he endured that.  Of course, you internalize that often enough it will affect your heart.  And obviously both Jackie Robinson and he died prematurely. And I'm sure the internalization of all of that, you know, can affect you.  So, I, you know I--I'm proud to see and I respect the great contributions all over the world that black people have made. Jomo Kenyatta, Nelson Mandela. Jomo Kenyatta was to me what Nelson Mandela was when I was in school.  And, you know, and I am extremely gratified to be a part of a race of people that I don't wear it on my sleeve.  I know who I am. And I'm really amazed of the ignorance of a lot of other people don't understand that.  And so I don't--you know, I just--my biggest regret at this point in my life that people of color have not come together both in Africa--in Africa because of the colonization they also rely more on Europeans to help them to move into the new millennium.  And even in the Caribbean they would pick somebody that look, elsewhere.  Look differently from their own.  Yet, you know, it's been documented that the most educated people of color are in North America. And yet they would go Europe and pick somebody other to do a project or something like that or run a business for them and stuff. So the vestiges of that, that kind of inculcated self-doubt remains.  And I don't think as a people we can celebrate.  Which is why I don't really try to focus on the differences between West Indians and African Americans.  I focus on the things that unite us more than the things that are so different.  Because I--I love the food here and if you're exposed to my food, you may love it, too. But it's a function of what you're accustomed to.  So I don't see that as a real divide.  It's not of a major.

Speaker 1: You've been on the Board [of Trustees] of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  You've served on a board of one of the premier historical black colleges in the country.  And that's an institution you, you attended. What are your, you know, what are your thoughts about historically black colleges and the direction that you would like to see them go in this country?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they clearly--I have never felt wanted for my education and my preparation. And one of the things that I liked about the education at Howard, it was universal in nature. And I learned as much from my professors that I'd admired as I did from students because of the differences in where they came from.  And they--and the professors were tough on me because at the time, there were 30 million black people in America.  And I felt I had to balance fifteen on one shoulder and fifteen on the other. And so, I couldn't really slouch around and give an excuse.  I had to be prepared.  And they were harder on me at Howard than when I went to other schools.  You know, the other schools.  I've been to majority schools.  Work was easier for me there. Now--and I think there was a lot of racial pride in forcing me to make sure I didn't use anything as a clutch and--a crutch rather--to say, you know, "They didn't like me because of this," or whatever.  So I liked that. I think historically black colleges play a role and they will--they will go out of existence when there is no all women's college, no Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts], no Yeshiva University [New York, New York], an all-Jewish university. They exist for the same reason these other schools exist.  To prepare students for a global kind of world.  But they realize that students in that particular segment of the population their alarm clocks go off at different times. There're people at Howard, who when I was there, you had from Rhodes Scholars candidates. Van Johnson (ph.) was from Jamaica, was a Rhodes Scholar transferred to Howard  'cause he--he wanted to be with his boys ,so to speak. And then you had people came out of, you know, deep South somewhere.  And they were butchering the language, the English language and you wondered why they were there.
Story_ID: 14917
Speaker 1: What do you think that HBCU's [historically black colleges and universities] need to do to prepare themselves, you know, for, for the, for the--for this new millennium, you know?  Well, obviously to attract the brightest and the best, to attract the faculty that is commensurate with that.  That the students coming in do face a challenging kind of environment where it's not easy for them to run by the faculty 'cause the faculty has not upgraded their skills.  So they need to do that.  They need to bringing--creating more of a--a lot of the HBCU's are managed by black like--just like a black business, whoever owns it, if they don't make a decision about ordering pencils, nothing get done.  You're from Chicago [Illinois].  So I know you know about those black businesses out there.  They have that history.
Speaker 2: But you can't refer to me.  But that's okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, there's a city in this country where a lot of black businesses are.  But a lot of--and in a way you understand that.  Because if you work to build a business, you want to make sure that nobody is spending your money wrong. But you have to get to that point where you can delegate and--and, there's not enough delegation in a lot of these black institutions of responsibilities. The head president winds up doing everything.  Sometimes because he thinks, he's the only one can do it. Sometime he feel he's the only one he can trust. He has not built a team around him.  Like--and it's a business that you can delegate things and hold people accountable for it, which is what you do.  Nobody who runs a successful business does--makes all the decisions. And so universities and HBCU's have to get into that mode where they understand that you hire competent people and you delegate and you trust their judgment.  And if they do wrong and they don't do the right things; you fire them and get good people in there. But that's what you have to do.  If you have to go over that process to, to get to the right mix; you, you continue to do it. And, I think that's a major--the management structure is still very insulated.  And if somebody's traveling for instance sometimes on a campus, if the president is traveling, nobody is there--is in a position to make a decision.  And that is not good. So I think they need to, to move into the new millennium with a more determined effort to upgrade the management decision-making process in terms of administration.  That's a very key thing.
Story_ID: 14918
Speaker 1: Glegg, you are somewhat younger, you know, than some of the people we do.  But I always end with one question. And that is: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That--that for the time, you know, when it puts born and die, really what I did inbetween and what I--and if it just said that I tried to make life better for all people, and particularly those who look like myself, I mean I'll be very happy for that.  Because I think those who were fortunate to have been exposed as I was to a place like the 'Washington Post', where people run this country and make--shape opinions and stuff, and get expose to the thinking of these people that I would have failed my kind and what I represent.  And no one elected me, but I think I--I'm part of a generation that feels a certain way about who we are and the contribution our people have made. If I didn't stand up at the times when I had the ears of people and whisper--it's not everybody--I, you know, I didn't take to the street and hold up guns or march.  But there are ways you can bring about change.  And if I passed every opportunity I had and I passed on that, not to have tried to push the ball closer to the goal line, I would have failed.  And so I would hope that those who would take a look at what my life has represented, particularly my adult life when I grew into manhood, that I had tried to demonstrate that I had some creeds to live by. I mean, I don't drink and I don't smoke, never have.  And if when I tell somebody that, that's because I don't do it.  But also other things I don't do that, you know. And, so, I, I--and I believe in that.  So I don't want to be considered--I wouldn't want to be considered that, "He just did that because he got paid to do that." or that sort of thing. I mean, "He did that because he had something to say."  And, and I have about six or seven children that I mentor.  That I've been in their lives and they're in various--some in Wall Street [New York, New York], one is in an international agency in Geneva [Switzerland]. A couple are down at Wall Street.  One is in dental school.  These are people, maybe a single parent and, you know, women.  Like there're maybe two women and five men. And I've gotten involved with their lives.  If they needed tuition.  Whatever they needed, I have been there for them.  Helped them with the "birds and bees" conversation.  And because I'd been single such a long time in my life.  But I'd been involved in that way and tried to do it in my own way.  And I have been that.  As a surrogate to friends of mine kids.  Been a godparent and reach out and tried to point them in that direction, instill certain kind of values that I think is important. So that to me is important.  And you know, whatever--My writings when I--where to go.  That it had some value and people's lives and eyes were opened up as a result of that.  And they became a better person, or they fought harder before they started celebrate before the game was over. And that's why I don't touch too much of the West Indian, African American thing 'cause I think that would be celebration and the game hasn't been won yet. And we tend to as a race celebrate on the twenty yard line and not in the endzone. I'd like to get us in the endzone before we celebrate.  Once that--and it may--It probably won't never happen in my lifetime.  But if I die knowing we're headed towards the endzone, I know some kind of way there'll be a celebration.  And that's what I would like. That would--that, that, I would hope to be judged in that way.  What did Glegg do while he was here? Did he speak up for his race? Did he stand up and try to make life better for those that he came in touch with?  And I've chosen jobs in my career that help me to advance that.  And so I'm not disappointed that I'm not president of Xerox [Corporation]. I never went to Xerox thinking I could ever be president.  I knew I couldn't.  So I chose not that path. I--the jobs I've had--I got the job at Xerox, I went there to get.  'Cause I know that in my mind, I felt there would never come a time that a black person--I don't care how well prepared you were, you could become president of Xerox. So I didn't have a problem. I didn't also think that a black person would be an editor at the 'Washington Post'.  So I did my time there and I moved on. So, you know--and I, I--and I try to manage that frustration and, and at the same time give hope.  But I don't stand in front of a bunch of kids at a commencement and to tell them "All you need to do is punch this ticket.  Get this parchment and that's--it's all over.  You--you'll make it once you get this degree.  You go from here to there." I also believe a child of mine, I think if raising children, I would want them to go to a historically black college first.  For the first degree.  The fundamental underpinning degree.  And then go to a majority institution for the second degree. I think that provides a very good balance in terms of the reality of the world.  And friendships and lasting friendships--not the superficial one that one gets because you're in a study hall group.  And once you leave you never see--which happens in these other schools. So, you know, the friends that I have today that are the most lasting friends are friends I knew from undergrad days.  Not the ones at Syracuse [University, Syracuse New York], Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] or Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or anything or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], you know.  It's the friends that I went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] with.  And they're across the range of stuff. I have some other professional friends I've acquired over the years. So that to me is an important thing that I would always--it served me well.  And--and I would want to see anybody I care about have a chance to (unclear) because I thought it provided me good preparation to fight in different worlds.
