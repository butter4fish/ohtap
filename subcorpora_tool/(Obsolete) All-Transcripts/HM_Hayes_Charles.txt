Speaker 1: What person or persons influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] is one. And his fight for civil and equal rights. Certainly the international vice president of my union, Russell Lassley, who I worked with down through the years. Travelled throughout this country 'cause he headed our civil rights department. And opened up doors in many plants and factories that we represented. Particularly, the South, New Orleans, Atlanta, Georgia and all these places. And yes, more recently I've had real working relationship with the Reverend Jesse Jackson. I worked with him and I had great hopes. If he hadn't of been an African American, he would have been president of this country, according to my thinking. And a lot of other people have felt that way. And these are the kind of people that have great influence. I had an English teacher--graduated from high school in Cairo, Illinois who was a cousin of mine, Miss Effie Woods, who had much to do with my staying on the right course and spending the time that I spent trying to get whatever education I could. Of course, I would let you know, my mother and father kept me on the straight and narrow path. And that goes without saying when you're one among twelve and the second oldest you have a responsibility that you're going to be a role model for those who follow you in the family.

Speaker 1: What events influenced you? What important events in our history have influenced you the most? Or would you like pinpoint as very important to black people.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that has the most influence on my life was being a part of a very poor family. I had always--it just became a part of me to always have a desire to help people who needed help. Employment--find a decent job, make a decent living. And certainly, in order to do that--I became really interested in unions. And I guess the thing that turned me in the direction of unions most was a job I had--because I had no desire to continue to be a laborer in a hardware flooring plant. I just wanted to make a little money and get enough stashed away to maybe go to an institution of higher learning after just graduating from high school. But the thing that I found out, you can't do it alone if you work in a factory. You have to be together. And that's where unionism became a part of me, down in Cairo, Illinois when I left there and came to Chicago and at the help of my uncle got a job in the stockyards. And the same thing existed dealing with an employer on a one on basis is not the kind of thing where you'd get very far. So, collectivism meant a lot so I started toward unions. And organized in order to improve ourselves financially and yes, be treated like human beings. Some places they didn't treat you like human beings. If you were African American, you were certainly on the low end of the totem pole, you had the worst jobs. The most laborious and dirtiest jobs in the stockyards. It changed when we got organized. So that influenced my life. And I decided that I should stay and stick with unions, work with unions. And I became to be an elected official of a union on both local and international level and then I got into politics as a correlation between politics and a way of life for people. And when I came to Chicago, I worked for [US Congressman William] Dawson and a lot of others--most of the Democratic party, but there was just one of these "me too" Democrats, I never was so hung up with the party label as I was with what they stood for and the kind of program that they were pushing and that's what I supported. So I was characterized more as an independent kind of Democrat. Rather than a, I guess, based on law, they based on label. So that influenced my life when I got tied up in unions, tied up in politics. Yes, when I went into the Congress in 1983 as the successor to one of the greatest people I ever knew--mayor of the city of Chicago, first black person elected the mayor of this great city--Harold Washington. I supported him, fought within the ranks of labor, they didn't want to support, a lot of--didn't want to support a black leader to head--be the chief executive of this city. But we fought. At least neutralized some them to the point where they didn't--wouldn't make an endorsement in the primary rather than endorse Harold they left it up to each individual union to go on their way and endorse whoever they wanted. And then for me to succeed him as a Congressperson is something I never dreamed of, it certainly wasn't my aspiration. I went to my own union in Washington and asked--they asked me after he was elected, who are we going to get to succeed him? I said, "I don't know, we gotta think about it and talk about it." Already a member of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, one of its leaders. And so I said--they said, "Well, why don't you run?" I said, "Who me?" "Yeah. We' ll help you raise the necessary funds." And it took almost $400,000 for me to be elected, all of it didn't come from labor. But they certainly had the PAC [political action committee] funds. They supported me without it, with thirteen different opponents, it was difficult to win. There's no question about it. So this had great--and when I went into Congress, my interest and concern was to be a voice for the voiceless and it's still that way. Poor people on our society, their needs are neglected. Their desires--the homeless we have, people who have no insurance and all these kinds of things I think it's something government needs to do something about. We still have hungry people. I'm very much opposed to the continuation of spending our money in the interest of people overseas--and the neglected people right here at home. This is my background--this is the way I've been all along.

Speaker 1: My involvement in both people who work for a living in a factory or in a plant certainly made me know, but also I was successful I guess in being elected in Congress because of my participation and my name recognition and the Civil Rights Movement. We dared to build the first real union hall--which was a community center--at 49th and Wabash--at a time--right across--adjacent to the [Jean Baptiste] DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] and I was advised by some you shouldn't build a union hall or buy a union hall in the black area--in the heart of the black community. But we faced that challenge. And we built an edifice that was not just a union hall, it's a community center. And it took courage to do it, but I also had to have help. I had a lot of help. It's tragic to see what's happening to it today though because we couldn't get the resources to continue its existence. I guess the thing that--I think we're losing a lot and it disturbs me a lot is that there's such--human life has such little value in the mind's of people, many of them. And we--our communities are being torn about by crime stimulated by the trafficking of drugs. But even law enforcement from the federal government on down is focused, in my opinion, in the wrong direction. You're more apt to be imprisoned while being a user of drugs than you--and a trafficker of drug that you are--drugs are big business. The people who make the big bucks off of drugs, they don't have to worry too much about going to jail. They don't live in our neighborhood, yet they contribute to its destruction. I think that--this is one thing I would like to see is government on a local, state and federal level concentrate more on stopping the trafficking of drugs across our border. Our men in the service--and women should be used for that purpose. But some people, even in government, are tied in with it.

Speaker 1: What would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered for having stayed what I call the course. Of trying to put bread and food in the mouths of those who are hungry. Give them a decent place to live. Not do as they're doing now in some area of this city. They want to do away with public housing. It was built, I remember, on what it's built--it was done on a political basis at that time too to keep blacks in certain area of this city. They didn't want them--for political purposes--spread in the wrong areas or the wrong wards. They'd lose political control, so they shot them up in the air with federal dollars. Somewhere along the line, I'd like to be remembered for fighting to see people getting a decent place to live, stop our babies from dying because they can't get proper medical care, help our seniors to live longer and God knows everybody on public assistance--they doesn't want to be there. One of the best ways to look at it is we could reduce our deficit immensely by helping people find gainful employment. Let them pay taxes. But don't continue to take care of the wealthy and trod over those that don't have. I'd like to remembered as one who stood up and stood out. Didn't do enough, but it's in my bone, I'll die with it in my system.

Speaker 1: What would you like to tell future generations?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a great emphasis--as I tell my grandson, "Get your education. Stay in school." Whatever inequities exist in the access to education in our system, it should be corrected. That's what elected officials should do. You don't spend $5000 a year in this state for a kid to go to school in a suburban community versus $2000 for one or $2500 in the inner city. They ought to all have equal access to education. I'd say to young people, take advantage of it. Fight for that and fight  Don't let them privatize the public educational system as they're leading in this direction not only here, but this is all over this country. And I want to see it--I'd advice them to stand up and fight for those rights and for those things that they deserve and need. That's what government is all about, that's what I think life is all about. I happen to be a deacon of my church and Lord knows I think churches could do more to help young people stay the course and stay on the right direction and yes, fight to improve the economic and social conditions.

Speaker 1: Thurgood Marshall is a person I knew--first met when he was an attorney for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. I was active in the NAACP--used to be the one of the leaders of the Chicago chapter of the NAACP. Travelled all over the country to conventions and everywhere supporting and fighting for the rights of people. I remember, he used to have great influence on me. Of course, Ralph Bunche, I didn't know quite as well. I was very happy when he was given the role to try to get justice for Palestinians, 'cause as a leader of labor at that time, there was only a few of us who took the position, even in the old CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations] and AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations] at conventions that we think that the Palestinians entitled to a homeland, I still feel that way. They shouldn't be treated as they're outcasts. And so far as Jesse Jackson is concerned--I had gotten to know Jesse when he was on the staff of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] working with Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.]. And I can remember having marched in the South, marched in Chicago for equality is housing and jobs and education with Jesse. And I think that he certainly has been one who--while younger than me, I have a lot of admirations or admiration for him. Now what the fourth one that you mentioned was--I'm trying to think. Well there are several others than I know I have--Harold Washington, God knows, he had a great part in my life, not just politically, but who knows how to work as a coalition kind of person. We only represent roughly 41 percent--which is a big number--of the population in the city of Chicago, but we don't control how the dollars are spent. And this is--this is what the fight is all about. You can't wrap yourself up just in blackness, the favored color of the people in power is green. And you have to get in the position where you can have something to say how this is distributed and this is where out shortcomings are here and [Chicago mayor] Harold Washington did a lot. And yes, people like Margaret Burroughs who have fought and struggled and built the DuSable Museum, certainly has done a lot to improve and record the history that a lot of our people have played. Ralph Metcalf when he stood up in defiance of the police brutality in this city, will long be remembered in our work--and stood with him. And we've--Addie Wyatt, a person I've known and certainly a religious leader now, but was a labor leader, she certainly has played a great part--a role in my life, and I'll always remember. Along with her husband, Reverend Claude Wyatt, we grew up together, our in Altgeld Gardens. I lived out there in public housing. First decent apartment I ever had in this city, was public housing. And I'll always want to see that these people who live there are not pushed out just because big developers want to make big dollars.

Speaker 1: We've had a long longevity in this country--what would you contribute that to? Under a lot of adverse conditions.
Speaker 2: Well, we certainly haven't lived as long as I'd like to see us live, a lot of us. But, we're living longer, but you watch the trend now is, don't separate longevity from your economic status. I have accused some of my colleagues in Congress who hoping poor people die. They want to do this so that's not too much dependence on government. But I contributed to people living longer and some progress we've made is to--certainly the activities of our leaders who stood up and they--we've had some leaders--they don't after all, they haven't all been black. God knows, we're not from--the biggest argument I ever heard around my table when my mother made a declaration to my daddy that she was going to vote for [President] Franklin Roosevelt. He had traditionally been a Republican. He was mad. He said, "You don't mean it." She said, "Yes I do. I'm tired of having nothing with all these kids." My daddy got up from the table so mad 'cause his daddy was a Republican down Said, "I knew it was a mistake when they gave women the right to vote." Well my mother stuck to that position, my daddy eventually switched when he got a job on the WPA [Workers Progress Administration]. But there are people that have stood up for our rights. Stood up for the right to education. Stood up for us to have a right to get proper healthcare--which I hope we'll have national healthcare where we won't have 37 million people with no healthcare at all. These are the things that I think that stick out in my mind the most that will cause us to live longer. Have decent food, this kind of stuff. And so, it all helps. But education and let's stop killing one another--drive by shootings and stuff, it's ridiculous, you know. But, I'm not sure---there's going to be a big arguments over guns. With the gun lobbyists as pretty powerful.
