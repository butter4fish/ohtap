Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Observing is Shawn Wilson.  Our videographer is Neculai Burghelea.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Arthur French, A-R-T-H-U-R, F-R-E-N-C-H.
Speaker 1: Now because you're actor, I'm going to ask you, is that your real name?
Speaker 2: That is my real name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  It's Wellesley, W-E-L-L-E-S-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's actually, officially, it's really Jr., Arthur Wellesley French, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because that was my father's [Arthur French, Sr.] name, and that's also, my son [Arthur French III] is the III.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I never give my year of birth.  But it's November 6, and it's in Harlem [New York, New York], U.S.A. (laughter).
Speaker 1: No year?
Speaker 2: Never, never, never.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an actor, and I've also directed and taught.  But I would guess that I'm an actor, or a theater artist, I guess it would be.  That would cover the whole spectrum of what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is June 7th, I believe, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at Teachers College, a part of Columbia University in Manhattan [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --New York [New York].

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I'm supposed to ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's a warm-up, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, there's a warm-up.  Well, I mean, start with the light stuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: These are easy ones.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, sir, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food?  I think it's just about anything that doesn't eat me (laughter.)  I mean I can pretty much eat anything.  I do like pastas, and I guess I do like--if I had to pick, it would be veal.  But, no, I don't.  I really eat pretty much anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, an omnivorous person.
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.  Carnivorous, or omnivorous, right.  Vegetables.  I eat vegetables too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  It probably is blue, if I were to think about it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: A favorite time of the year?  I like winter, I just like winter better.  You know, it's sort of cold.  I like the cold weather for some reason.  So, I like winter, it kind of makes you alert and alive.  So, that's my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It's so rare I take vacations.  But now, right now, it's Los Angeles [California] because my daughter [Antonia March] and her husband and my grandchildren live in Los Angeles.  So if I get some time, when I get some time I try to sneak out and see how they're doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  It always changes.  I kind of just look straight ahead.  I guess that might be--if I had a saying, that's kind of what I do.  I just try to keep moving forward.
Story_ID: 261489
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Arthur French, Sr.] side of the family.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: But I'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And then we'll go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Sounds good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Ursilla, U-R-S-I-L-L-A, Idonia, I-D-O-N-I-A, Ollivierre, which was her maiden name, O-L-L-I-V-I-E-R-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her--well, before we go to that.  Now, that's an unusual name--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in a sense that--maybe not for New York [New York], but for other places.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Probably.
Speaker 1: But what's her background?
Speaker 2: Well, Ollivierre is her, is a Portuguese name, which was my grandfather's name.  He was Emanuel Ollivierre, and that's where she got her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in St. Vincent [and the Grenadines] in what was then the British West Indies.  Her date of birth was April 19, and I believe it was 1901.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about, first of all, the ancestors on your mother's side, the people that are no longer with us who were not here when you were born, the ancestors?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  I think my grandfather, who I said his name is Emanuel Ollivierre, he came from, he was one of the assimilados.  You know, one of the things that Portugal did is they invaded and kind of wiped out everyone.  And they were there to assimilate the population into the Portuguese population, and to bring them into Christian religion.  I think in reality they killed 90 percent of them, and assimilated about two percent.  And he was one of the two percent that I guess was called an assimilado at that time.  And so, somewhere he got to the West Indies in his travels.  I think everyone in my family went out to sea, and I guess that's where he met Letitia, my grandmother, Letitia, L-E-T-I-T-I-A, and Gill was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about her side, the Gill side?
Speaker 2: The Gill side, I think if you go to Barbados, I think every fourth person is named Gill.  It's a big name on the island.  And that's how they got from--actually she was--I don't know if she was born in St. Vincent, but my mother was born in St. Vincent.  They migrated to Barbados when she was a little girl.  So, she was raised in Barbados.  So, I'm not sure how far back they go.  I think the Gills have been on that island since anybody knows.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that are passed down through the Gill side or through the Ollivierre side?
Speaker 2: Um, I don't know of any real stories.  I think the stories were that there was a lot of spirits about the old Gill people, you know, who were connected with the family.  I think my aunt--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they practiced--it was kind of a tradition of an African religion sort of, or like a derivative of it?
Speaker 2: I think, I don't think they did.  But I think it was part of it.  I think, my mother was actually was raised Catholic, or went to Catholic school.  But I know that--and I can't think of my aunt's name because I never met her.  But Letitia is my grandmother's sister [sic.], who was sort of, kind of a spiritual person into, you know, not into it so much as being part of, believing in that part of the culture, the Obeah.  And I guess by the time my mother came along, they were, you know, she went--she was raised like a Catholic at that time, but not the older members or the other members of the family, seemingly.  Ninen [ph.], they called her, but I don't know what her real name was.
Story_ID: 261490
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] talk about growing up? Do you have any stories that your mother told you?
Speaker 2: Oh, told me about growing up?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, they had like I think chickens and pigs, you know.  They had a yard, and that's kind of where she grew up and went to school until she--she was married there.  She actually had two children there with her first husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's before she moved here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, before she moved here.
Speaker 1: And did she go to school there too?  I guess she went--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to school there.  I think by the time she came here, she was an adult.  And she went to work actually in the factory, and was one of the early people dealing with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, trying to organize and, you know, get better working conditions in the factories.  And that was after she got here.  I think when she got here--I don't know if she did any work when she was in Barbados.  I think she was very young, and came here and went to work here, and actually supported her children from New York [New York], from America.  I think first her journey took her, I think, to Cuba, then to Miami [Florida], where she had leave.  Because there was actually a white man who the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] was after who had hidden out where she lived, as she tells the story, in Miami.  And he hid out there, wherever she was staying.  And the word went out that if they found any of the people who helped this man, they would kill them.  And so, she decided to leave.  She was a young woman, and that's how she came to New York.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you tell us--I mean we all assume that the reason why she moved from--she moved Barbados to Miami?
Speaker 2: I think she, she was in Cuba for some time.  I don't know--you know, she went by ship.  But somehow she wasn't going to stay there.  I mean, it seemed like she wanted to go to a place with a better opportunities.
Speaker 1: So, she was determined to come to New York or someplace better than the place--
Speaker 2: Yeah, someplace better than where she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, was there some sort of upheaval in the [Caribbean] Islands or something?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I just have a feeling that with both of my parents--when we get to my father [Arthur French, Sr.]--it wasn't big enough for them.  I mean, you know, these are the islands and they're beautiful, and now they're tourist things.  But you can go around the island in a day.  And I just think that they both had other ideas.  They both were kind of adventurous people, and wanted to do other things and see other places.  And I think that was kind of her trail.  So, I don't know why she picked Cuba or why she had lived in Cuba for a time.  But, from Cuba to Miami, and then to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, do you know about what year she arrived in New York, or how old she was?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, okay.  I would guess she was a young woman, maybe in her early twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that would be in the early 1920s, right?
Speaker 2: That would probably be in the mid-1920s, I guess, or somewhere in there when she got here.
Speaker 1: Now, was she--
Speaker 2: I think she, I think her first child was like, she was sixteen when her first--her son was born.  So, she was a relatively young woman, even though she had been married and had two children.  And was she still, I think at that time married.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, are there any stories about those early days in the '20s [1920s] in New York?  I know the [Marcus] Garvey [Pan-Africanism] Movement was big, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't really have any stories that I remember her telling about that.  She was, she never talked a lot.  You know, she told a couple of stories, but she never really kind of talked a lot.  I think it was--whatever was going on then.  Maybe, you know, we don't always tell our children all our hot stories, I guess (laughter).  But no, I don't have any stories.  I don't remember her telling anything specifically exciting or interesting.
Story_ID: 261491
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's [Arthur French, Sr.] full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: The same as mine, except he was Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 22, and he was also born in St. Vincent [and the Grenadines].  And I think he was born in 1889, I believe.  I think that was--yeah, he was born in the 19th century.
Speaker 1: Okay, in St. Vincent.  So, he's, his ancestors were assimilados from--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, that was my--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's your mother's [Ursilla Ollivierre French] side, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't know as much about--
Speaker 1: This is the French side?
Speaker 2: This is the French side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What I knew was that my grandfather, who is Albert French [ph.], actually was listed in the book of St. Vincent.  Because seemingly, what he did, he found--it was hard to trade in St. Vincent because of reefs, or shoals, or something.  And he found a way to get in and help to trade.  So, they kind of listed him in the book of St. Vincent, and--
Speaker 1: Now, what's the book of St. Vincent?
Speaker 2: It's a book, sort of an historical book, I think that's what you call it.  It may not, that may not be accurate.  And also, I think there's a little square or something that my sister told me is called French Square [ph.].  And I guess it has to do with--at that time when he discovered it, in what I would gather was in, somewhere in the mid 18-something.  It was a big deal, so that the ships could get into the harbor, and things like that.
Speaker 1: So, he found this passage?
Speaker 2: Yeah, through the reefs or whatever the shoals that they had there.  So, he was that.  He and my grandmother, my paternal grandmother Mary [French (ph.)], she had like a cook shop.  That's what it was called, where she cooked, and where the sailors used to come to eat, and I guess to get a drink of rum or whatever they had at that time.  So, that's as much as I know about them.  I had, my father had a big family.  We kind of lost track of all of them, except my Uncle Damar, D-A-M-A-R, when he came to this country, and I knew him.  And I had an uncle, George French [ph.], who died when I was a little boy.  I remember him, and I remember going to his funeral.  There were some other brothers who migrated the other way.  It seems they all left St. Vincent and they went to England.  And so, very recently I actually met a young man who we think we're kind of related; he's much younger.  Because is like the grandson of one of the brothers who went to England instead of migrating to America.  And there are some who were just kind of lost.  They came to this country and no one knows--they went south and no one kept up with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father--well, I guess he finished school or went to school in St. Vincent?
Speaker 2: He went to school in St. Vincent.  He was a printer by trade; that was his trade.  And then he went out to sea.  He traveled all over, and he was one of the people actually who worked on the Panama Canal [Panama], which was almost built by West Indians.
Speaker 1: Right.  You know, you'd be surprised at how many people we've interviewed who have a relative that worked on the Panama Canal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, they're a lot of stories about that.  They're from, you know, all the different [Caribbean] Islands.
Speaker 2: All the different islands.  They were, most of the people who built it were Caribbean people.
Speaker 1: And it was dangerous work, too, from what I understand.  Okay, did he have any stories about--
Speaker 2: Well, he had, he always told me I should get to Japan, because he kind of liked that better.  But he went out to sea and traveled all over the world before he settled in New York [New York].  He just left, and I don't think he--I'm almost sure--I don't know if he ever went back.  He always kept in touch, and he sort of--his father is Pat [ph.].  They would always keep in touch, he kept in touch.  But I don't really recall him going back.  I know my mother took a ship back one time, but I don't know if my father ever went back.
Story_ID: 261492
Speaker 1: I think the little story about my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] I can tell is that when my mother was a little girl, she moved to Barbados.  And she was also born in St. Vincent [and the Grenadines].  So, if we switch forward like almost thirty years in time, they meet in New York [New York].  And when they decide that they're going to get married and they write back, they literally lived on the same block in St. Vincent when my mother's parents [Letitia Gill Ollivierre and Emanuel Ollivierre] moved to Barbados.  So they knew, the families knew each other, and had literally lived as little kids on the same block in St. Vincent, but they didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Now, is there a story about how they met in New York?
Speaker 1: I don't know what the story is.  I think they all were just hanging out, kind of.  Because they all talk about dancing.  And my father was, had the reputation of being a great dancer and kind of taught my mother how to dance, because she wasn't a dancer.  And I remember my godparents, my godfather and my godmother, they were like dance people, they knew how to dance.  My godmother used to play tennis, which was kind of scoffed at, because no black people were playing tennis, except how she knew about it.  But they all talked about how many dances they went to, and how good--and who danced.  So, I have a feeling they danced.  In fact, in the jazz review that this guy did for television, I'm going to have to look at it again.  Because I thought I spotted my mother in one of those quick--so I think they were, I guess, having a good time.
Story_ID: 261493
Speaker 1: Do have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?  I hadn't even thought about that.  I can't remember what the first thing is that I ever thought about.  I know the first thing I remember was wanting to be a preacher.  But I don't remember what my memory is in saying earliest childhood memory.  I don't know.  I just, I have to think.  Maybe by the time we finish talking, it'll come to me.
Story_ID: 261494
Speaker 1: What did your parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, he was a printer by trade.  And of course, he could sail or run any kind of, anything that ran on the sea, anything that was on the sea.  It didn't do him well coming here, because of course they didn't let him into the printers' union.  But because he worked in that, I was the comic book king, because he worked where they made comic books.  But he would train people, and he knew that trade, but he couldn't get into the union.  So, he did a lot of other things.  He did hotel work, whatever he could do.  And of course, he could run things, but they wouldn't let him run a launch here or run a boat.  You know, he could work on the boat, but he couldn't run it, which I guess he did at the Panama Canal [Panama].  And he was, he sort of could anything, as far as boats were concerned.  He was very knowledgeable about boats.  So he ended up working in the hotels and doing kind of things like that rather than--because, you know, he had no place to go in the places that were in the u- in the maritime service, he couldn't get promoted.  In the printer's union, he could work there, but he couldn't be a master printer or anything.  They wouldn't let him in.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about how the limited opportunities--I mean this is the land of opportunity on one hand, but then there's a limited opportunity because you can't--
Speaker 2: You can't--well especially at that time.  I mean we're talking about maybe the '30s [1930s] or the '20s [1920s] when he was trying to get in.  It was a joke.  I mean there were no black people in any of the trade unions.  So, no matter what he knew, he trained people to do it.  And then he couldn't take that, he left.  Because he was training people, and then they would be his boss, and didn't know what he knew.  Since that was--it seemed that every young man in St. Vincent [and the Grenadines] had to have a trade.  You had to have some kind of trade when you went to school.  And so, his trade was printer.  But you know, coming to a country where he could only go on the lowest level--they would not let him in the union.  Or in some of the maritime things he could work as, you know--but not to run a boat or not to take out a launch, which I guess working on the Panama Canal he traveled all around the world anyway as a merchant seaman.  He, you know, he knew those things, and of course--so that was his story.
Story_ID: 261495
Speaker 1: I grew up as an only child, because I was the only offspring of my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.].  But my mother had two children who were born in Barbados from her first husband.
Speaker 2: That's right, you said that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I feel stupid asking you if you have brothers and sisters, and you told me.
Speaker 1: And my father has, had one child by a previous union.  So, I know where they are.  My brother on my mother's side--I have a brother, he's retired and living in Orlando [Florida].  His sister, his natural sister, lives in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].  And my sister on my father's side, she lives in Wyandanch, [Babylon] Long Island [New York, New York].  And we talk pretty much every day or every other day.  We keep in touch, yeah.
Story_ID: 261496
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you grow up in, or neighborhoods?  And just tell us something about what the neighborhoods were like.
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in Harlem [New York, New York], as I said.  We moved I think from 2902 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard], but I grew up, mostly I remember at 2749 8th Avenue, which still exists.  I think one day I planned I would just go back and see what it's like.  We lived on the top floor, because the higher up you went, the cheaper the rents were.  So, we were on the top floor.  And I guess an apartment like that, I think I remember the rent being something like $28 a month or whatever it was.  And I'm sure that that same apartment, if it still exists, is probably maybe in four figures now.  I mean even though it was a poor people's apartment, if you lived on the top floor, it was cheaper.  And it was a walkup, so you had to walk up.  So I grew up there.  I went to P.S. 90 [Manhattan, New York, New York] in Harlem.  And then I guess to move up, I moved, we moved to the Bronx [New York, New York], I think, by the time I got out of P.S. 90.  I went to Junior High School 40 [J.H.S. 40, Bronx, New York, New York], which was Prospect Junior High School [ph.].  And I lived first on 168th Street.  I can't remember, 747 I think, but I may be wrong.  But I did live at 1186 Jackson Avenue.  We moved around the corner, which was the very last house on Jackson Avenue, where it intersected with Boston Road.  So, those were kind of the neighborhoods I grew up in.
Story_ID: 261497
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Of Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Of growing up, yeah, that you remember.
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  Well, I remember going to the movies.  There was the Odeon [Theatre, New York, New York], which I think was on 145th Street.  And the Roosevelt [Theatre, New York, New York] was a little upscale, and that was on 7th Avenue.  But you could go, and your parents would get rid of you on the weekends, because you would see two movies, two features.  You would see a western; you would see a chapter, a serial.  You would see cartoons, and you would see coming attractions.  So, for fifteen cents they could get rid of you for like six or seven hours (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, I never thought about that aspect of getting rid of the kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, so it was a place where you were safe.  You were in the movies, and they could be alone and get you out of the way (laughter).  So that's one that thing I remember, going to movies.  I mean I think I saw every movie and knew everything, because I would go every weekend.  And my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] were big movie fans, so they would go in the week.  The movies changed like three or four times a week, you know, at the place.  There would be one movie Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and it would be weekend for kids and the serials.  So, I remember that.  I remember that my father used to take us to the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York].  We would kind of dress up and go down to the Apollo once a week.  Usually the show changed every week.  So, you would also see--I saw almost every big band.  I saw Count Basie and Charlie Barnett.  And all of the bands would come, and they'd have the full big bands, and Duke Ellington.  And there was no one that didn't come in there, you know, (unclear)--Billy Eckstine.  So that was one of the things.  I mean, I saw all those people, I just saw them all.  And I saw, you know, the great comedians.  Pigmeat Markham, still I think was one of the funniest men, you know.  And you know, all those--
Speaker 1: Moms Mabley.
Speaker 2: Moms Mabley, Butterbeans and Susie, and 'here come,' they were doing, 'Here come the judge,' when I was a little boy.  You know, they talk about other people--and Sammy [Davis, Jr.] doing it later.  I saw that when I was a kid with what's his name?  I just mentioned it.  Pigmeat.
Speaker 1: Pigmeat.
Speaker 2: Pigmeat, yeah.  So, those are the things I really remember--going to the movies and seeing all these people.  I didn't realize it, you know, I guess at that time, but that's what we did.  Once a week we would go and we'd see a movie, we'd also see a movie in between the stage show.  So, I saw like all the comedians of that time, I really remember that the most.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: No, I think one that--I guess at that time, you know, Harlem--I guess I was protected, because my parents--but I knew that there were, there were a lots of numbers running.  The numbers were pretty well--we all knew about the numbers.  Everybody played the numbers; that was open.  There was a still a couple of--there was an Italian place called Sally's on 7th Avenue where the guys hung out and gambled.  There were still some white people there.  Most of the white people owned all businesses anyway at that time.  You know, and there were, you know, we kind of knew who the pimps were.  But it wasn't that they were separate, they were just part of the neighborhood.  I mean, you didn't look down on them or anything.  You know, so-and-so's a pimp; so-and-so, you know, takes drugs; so-and-so is a whore, you know.  But we didn't, you know, you spoke to these people.  They weren't people you were afraid of or anything.  I guess my parents were, you know, to see that I didn't get into that.  But they were just part of the neighborhood.  I mean, I knew more about that then than I do now, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 261498
Speaker 1: I do remember also, you know, seeing the Muslims, you know, that great store that was there, and the man speaking about the oppression of black people and--
Speaker 2: You mean the--
Speaker 1: The Black Muslims, I guess is what we called them.
Speaker 2: The big bookstore on 120th and Lenox [sic. 125th and 7th Avenue, Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yes, what's the man's name?  I can't think of it.
Speaker 2: Michaux?
Speaker 1: Lewis Michaux, yeah, yeah.  We saw him, too, you know, as well.
Speaker 2: The [African] National Memorial Bookstore [Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then they would, they would be there.  And no one really listened too much.  We said, oh, those people are crazy.  A lot of people were saying that.  But they were always there, I remember them there.  You know, as a kid I just remember them.  And I remember they had--
Speaker 2: Did you ever see Malcolm [X] speak there?
Speaker 1: I don't recall that I did see him speak.  I can't say that I did.  But I know there was always someone speaking and saying, you know, about preaching the gospel of Islam.  We would listen to it, but I think Malcolm is the one that kind of made it popular.  It became where he attracted more people.  But there was always people there.  I always remember the Muslims being present when you would go into Harlem [New York, New York].  And even having, you know, entertainment.  In fact if you look at an old documentary, one of the dancers is Esther Rolle, when she was thin.  You see it, and you see [HistoryMaker Minister Louis] Farrakhan playing the guitar.  So, I do remember that.  I don't remember it vividly, or what they were saying, but I always remember that they were always there.  And I guess one of the memories I have, maybe as even a childhood memory, was of this man, we used to call him shell shocked.  And he used to walk up and down 125th Street, just talking.  And I remember asking, and my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] telling me he had gotten shell shocked in the First World War [World War I, WWI].  I just remember him, I can see him now, and he always wore a suit and a hat.  He would just walk up and down talking.  It was--
Speaker 2: And that was a common expression used for someone that came back from the war kind of demented in some way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They'd say he was shell shocked.
Speaker 1: Shell shocked, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's a word--I used to try to find out what exactly that meant.  And nobody could tell you, except--
Speaker 1: Well, I think the explanation--I haven't got an explanation.  When I asked--it's that those big shells and those big things--seemingly if you stood around them a lot, it would mess with the hearing and do something--rattle your head.  Because it wasn't like it is now.  You know, they would recoil, if you see the movies of them.  And that was the explanation I got.  I don't know if it's real, but--
Speaker 2: It makes sense.
Speaker 1: I remember this man, and saying wow.  You know, he was just always there.  But anyway, that's my kind of memories of the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 261499
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of freedom to roam the neighborhood when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Had none.  My father [Arthur French, Sr.] was very strict.  I didn't go out without supervision, ever, especially when I was in Harlem [New York, New York] as a kid.  They knew that someone was with me pretty much at all times.  They walked me to school, and was there when I got out, even when I would stay after.  I didn't want them to do that, you know, because it messed with my schoolmates.  But he would wait across the street as if he wasn't with me, so I could kind of walk home by myself.  But there was always somebody there.  He was there, or my mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] was there.  So, my father was very strict.  After, when I got up in the Bronx [New York, New York], I was very young at that time.  I was going to junior high school [J.H.S. 40, Bronx, New York, New York].  And I mean if he said to be home, say, at eight o'clock, then he could not--there was no reason why I should be home one minute after eight.  So, I've gotten beatings.  I don't say I was abused, but I got beatings, and that was the way my house was.  There was no democracy, there was no discussions.  He said what you did, and you did it.  That's kind of what it was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't regret it, because I probably--a lot of people I knew in those--in junior high school, they are dead or in jail, or addicts or something.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, was--
Speaker 2: --I guess it was necessary.
Story_ID: 261500
Speaker 1: Were your people religious?  Were they in the church?  Did you go to church a lot?
Speaker 2: I went to church.  I don't--neither of my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] were religious.  My mother, for some reason, had become disenchanted with the Catholic church.  I never knew what my father's religion was.  I went to St. Philip's [Episcopal Church], which is in Harlem [New York, New York].  I went there, where the H.A.D.L.E.Y. Players are.  It's a theater group there.  I went to Sunday school, I was confirmed there.  So, I did go to church, and I did go to Sunday school.  I'm not a churchgoer now, but I sent my children [Arthur French III and Antonia March] to church.  And--
Speaker 1: St. Philip's is a--
Speaker 2: It's an Episcopalian Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and you know, you studied and you went to, I went to confirmation class, and I was actually confirmed in St. Philip's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you end up at St. Philip's?
Speaker 2: I don't know why my parents sent me there.  I can't--I figured--you know, I think maybe I do know why.  I had a couple of classmates who went there, who were going to St. Philip's Church.  I don't know if that's why I went there or not, but I did have a couple of classmates there.  That's where I ended up anyway, and that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Cause neither one of them had like a church base or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My mother would go to church occasionally.  And I don't know that my father went to church, except to see me in my plays, or whatever the church activity I was involved in was.
Story_ID: 261501
Speaker 1: Now you say you were like--you were the comic book king of your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was, because my father [Arthur French, Sr.] was a printer.  And at that time he was working where they made these comic books.  So, and my mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] one time threw them all.  But I had Superman one, you know.  And I think back what that must be worth now, you know, and Batman one.  So, I knew all about all the comic book heroes, you know.  I knew all about them, and I just had piles of them.
Speaker 1: So, did you spend a lot of time reading, you know, at home, and listening to the radio?  Or--
Speaker 2: I knew how to read when I went to kindergarten. I don't remember not knowing how to read, because they taught me at home.  So, by the time I actually got into school--I'd skipped a lot of grades.  Because before I was--my father was sort of good at math, and I think that's something that sort of runs in the family.  Before I ever went to school I could read, I could add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do what they call long division; it's a different system now.  So, essentially, they didn't--I skipped like three terms because they really didn't have anything to teach me, because my father and mother had taught me a lot at home.  So, I don't remember a time when I didn't know how to read or add or do things like that.  So, they were big believers in education.  "You've got to learn, you've got to know how to do things. You're going to have to, if you're going to make it in the world."  So, there was no playing around with that.  That was, again, you did it; you learned those times tables.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in any other aspects of the arts when you were growing up?  Did you draw, or play an instrument?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was--they saw that I got that kind of--I have to give them credit, now that I think back.  I was good at art; I was good at drawing in school.  But they did--I did--they did have me take piano lessons and singing lessons and dancing lessons.  I don't know that I was good in any of these things, but they did see to it that that was part of, you know, what I did--that that was just part of--and again, this was not a discussion.  This is just what you did.  You went to school, you went to church, you had these disciplines of, you know, dance and singing and things like that.  Art, we had actually in public school, I had art in public school.  I didn't--no one in my family was an artist or anything like that.  But we had art, and we had music appreciation when I went to public school.  I don't know that they even have those classes now.  But we had to listen to--
Speaker 1: A lot of places they don't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we had to draw, and things like that.  That's why I made things.  We had shop.
Story_ID: 261502
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: I was a bookworm.  I was a goody-goody kid.  I read voraciously, I would say.  I would read at least, I think I read everything there is to be read.  I mean, I don't know what I didn't read at that time.  I read mysteries, I read Jack London; I just read.  They used to tease me, seeing me coming with books from the library.  If I ever get rich, I'm going to give them a big donation.  I mean, because it's a great place to go and read and learn.  And it's there, and it's free.  So, I spent a lot of time in the library reading, with all my other activities.  But I love to read, I love to read.  And so, a lot of--sort of later on, I found out that it had some value, you know, and that I did know about some things (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of friends as a kid?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know, sort of. When you're a smart kid--because I was a little smart kid, as I told you--nobody really liked you.
Speaker 1: It's changed now, of course, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But I remember as a kid--you know, because you know, you would get high marks, and a lot of people weren't getting them.  And it didn't seem to be, it didn't seem to be anything big to me.  It wasn't something I bragged about.  It was, like I said, I learned stuff at home.  So the tests they gave me were, you know, they were like--I guess at that time, they were jokes.  I mean there was no reason that I wouldn't get them all right.  And plus, I had--my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] were the kind of people that, you know, if you did get 98 [percent], they'd want to know what happened, you know.  What happened--especially my father would want to know, what happened to that other two points?  You must not have been concentrating.  You know, so that's kind of, you know, what I came out of.  But I, the other kids sort of didn't appreciate that fact, so I got picked on a lot at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I guess my favorite subject is math, it was math.  And I guess I liked it because it didn't matter if the teacher liked you, or what they did. Or it didn't matter what, because figures are figures.  And if you knew those formulas, and you knew it, there's nothing anybody could do about that.  You know, it's not like a composition where someone says, well, I don't like--you know, you didn't do this or you didn't do that.  It's math.  I'm right or wrong, or whatever.  So, I guess I gravitated toward that, and still do like math, by the way.
Story_ID: 261503
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any teachers that you would consider like favorite teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: I remember that P.S. 90 [Manhattan, New York, New York] we had a black, I think she was a principal.  I think her name was Miss Long [ph.].  And I remember her, because I remember she--when I graduated she wrote in my little book, "There's always room at the top."  And I just remember that most of my teachers were white.  And so I think she was, you know, a principal or assistant principal, and I was very impressed.  Because at that time, if you saw a black person, I think it was just startling.
Speaker 1: So, it was rare in the public schools of New York [New York] for a black--
Speaker 2: Well, it was rare when I was going.  You know, I don't think it's that rare now.  But at that time, she was not a teacher.  She was either the principal or the assistant principal.  So, she impressed me.  I remember her name, you know, after all these many years.
Speaker 1: It was Lum?
Speaker 2: Long, I think was her name.
Speaker 1: Long, okay.
Speaker 2: Long, I believe her name was.  So that was, that was, she was like the first.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about in high school or junior high school [J.H.S. 40, Bronx, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Junior high school, I don't remember any particular teacher.  There was a teacher when I was in public school who kind of encouraged me.  Her name was Goldstein [ph.], I just remember her.  And I guess she used to talk to my mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] about, you know, seeing that I went on with my education.  I do remember a Miss Goldstein that used to say that I should--you know, she encouraged them to keep me studying--
Story_ID: 261504
Speaker 1: Were you in involved in sports at all?  I didn't ask you about that.
Speaker 2: I became involved in sports, I think, like when I was, when we moved up into the Bronx [New York, New York].  And I think I switched over because that's what, you know, it's like peer pressure stuff.  And that's what got you out.  That's what made people like you, you know, sort of. So I did get involved and, you know, I played a lot of, you know, basketball.  I played everything, you know, just to get into another arena, I guess.  I don't if-I was a very sickly kid, by the way.  I don't know if that's important or if you care about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.  I think is.
Speaker 2: I was really terribly sick.  I used to go to Columbia Presbyterian [New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York] for allergy and asthma shots.  I used to have to go three--it was different.  I used to have to go three times a week.  And they'd stick needles in your arm; it wasn't the patches at that time.  And I used to get a lot of asthmatic attacks and, you know, things like that.  So, that was part of my growing up.  Now strangely enough, I didn't--you know, so I never did a lot.  I never had to do a lot work around the house and get wet.  So, it had its pluses (laughter).  But when I got, I guess, into the Bronx, I started playing and it sort of went away.  It doesn't bother me.  And so, you know, there are people who believe it's all up in your head anyway, most of those illnesses.  So, maybe it was.  But I did play a lot of sports; I played a lot of basketball.  I played with, actually, Floyd Lane was on that City College [of New York, New York, New York] team. And I knew that they had won the double NIT [National Invitation Tournament] thing, and that was the coach.
Speaker 1: Oh, the City College team in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that the team that had the scandal?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But before the scandal, Floyd was, he was our coach.  And I sort of knew those guys.  They were older, but they were like the heroes, you know, and they were the guys that played basketball.  So, I played a lot of basketball.  In fact, I think when they wrote about--there was an article I think where people were talking about the school yard legends of basketball in that time, and I think I was listed as one of them.  I played a lot of sports, but I think it was interim thing.  I think I did that because, you know, that's what was recognized, kind of.  That was recognized, and playing the piano wasn't, you know.  You know, it was, it was called like sissy stuff, I guess you would say.  So, I had to get into the macho world (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you play organized basketball in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't play.  It was sort happening at the same time.  But I did most of my stuff outside of school.
Story_ID: 261505
Speaker 1: In high school were you involved in like clubs, and--
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Did you run for president, and--
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing (laughter).  I didn't join anything.  They wanted me to join the track team, not because I was fast.  But they wanted me to run cross country, because I could run--I had a lot of endurance.  I wasn't very fast, but you know, when you run--I could run like all day and be fine.  So, no, I didn't join one single club.  I think--you know, did I join--one club I did join, yes, I did.  I don't remember--it was in junior high [J.H.S. 40, Bronx, New York, New York]; I joined the chess and checker club.  So, I kind of enjoyed that.  But no, nothing else.
Speaker 1: Are you a good chess player?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, when I play regular.  But you know, I don't have anyone to play with.  I play--I have a computer, and sometimes I'll play on the computer now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you get involved in drama in high school at all?
Speaker 2: No.  Drama was something that was always on the outskirts.  I didn't really ever--I did plays in school, and I did plays in church [St. Philip's Episcopal Church, New York, New York].  You know, on Easter they would have a play, and a Christmas play.  So, when I was involved in the church, I was always in those.  And I did some plays in school.  But I didn't think of it as something for me to do.  It was just that I enjoyed it, but that was it.  I had no ambitions toward it whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Did you have any talent for imitating other people, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: Well, your parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] had a West Indian accent, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I can do accents.  I mean, that was just something I could do; I never thought of it as a particular skill.  Usually if I hear somebody speak, I can do it.  And French, by the way--my name--French is actually an Irish name.  And probably as they brought the slaves across, they dropped them off.  Because if you can do a West Indian accent, you can do an Irish accent.  I mean, they're very close.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Scottish sounds close too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Especially close to a Jamaican accent.
Speaker 2: So if you can talk like a West Indian, you can kind of talk like an Irishman, because it's close.  But yeah, I could always like imitate things and do voices, funny voices and stuff.  But I never thought of it as being anything (laughter).  It was just something I could do.
Speaker 1: Was it something that would amuse your friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I would do funny voices, and things like that (laughter).
Story_ID: 261506
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school--
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: --did you, what did you project as your career?  Were you going to college, or what were you going to do?
Speaker 2: I thought two things.  I didn't know what I wanted to do, I guess.  I thought of becoming a doctor, you know, going into the medical profession.  Then I kind of switched off it for some odd reason.  I really didn't know what I wanted to do.  I took a course in economics when I went to Brooklyn College [New York, New York].  And then I started to work, I sort of had to.  My father [Arthur French, Sr.] had died by then, and it was just my mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] and I.
Speaker 1: Now, when did your father die?  Did he die while you were--
Speaker 2: My father died approximately, I guess when I was about fourteen or fifteen when he died, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's about, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I don't know exactly. But anyway, he had died.  And so, by the time I got into high school I was, I guess I was about fourteen.  So, then I went to work.  And the first little job I had, I was delivering jewelry.  But then the first real job I had was working for the [New York City] Department of Social Service[s].  I took the test for the city for what was then called a Grade 2 clerk.  And I was, I passed the exam.  And you could pick whatever department you wanted to.  And I think the reason I picked social services, which was previously called the welfare department--it was the [City of New York] Department of [Public] Welfare and then they changed the name--was because at one time we were on welfare.  And I thought it was just, it had a sense of irony for me, that having once been on welfare, now I was working for the department, and that's why I picked it.  That was my reason at the time.
Story_ID: 261507
Speaker 1: What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to [The] Bronx [High School of] Science [Bronx, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, Bronx Science.
Speaker 2: But then I ended up--because of things, I ended up going to Morris High School [Bronx, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Morris?
Speaker 2: Morris High School, yes.  That's in the Bronx [New York, New York].  They were both in the Bronx.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated from Morris High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not good on dates, I'm sorry.  And I should, I don't kind of keep dates and times.  I always ask my son [Arthur French III], because he's good.  You know, I'll ask him, what year did I do that?  You know, if he was here now, I'd say, what year did NBC start?  And he'd probably give you--
Speaker 1: Well, high school graduation is such a big deal for most kids.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it wasn't for me.  And I didn't, it wasn't kind of--I don't know.  It was at the time when I was kind of finding out where--what the heck or who I was, and what I was going to do or whatever.  So, it wasn't, it wasn't like a memorable thing.  I didn't go to the prom.
Story_ID: 261508
Speaker 1: Your father [Arthur French, Sr.] died when you were about fourteen, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, was that a real hardship on the family?  You know, it was just you and your mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] there, right?
Speaker 2: It was just my mother and I there.  And my mother was working in the factory, and she didn't want me to work until I got out of school.  So, she did not allow me to work.  One of the things that she did do was that you could bring home work from the factory.  So, it was like embroidery and stuff like that.  So, she would bring that work home.  And as long as she kept it a total secret, I was really very good at it.  Because the more you worked, the more you did, the more money you would get.  So, she would bring work home, and I learned how to do embroidery and make French knots on the pattern and all of that.  So, I did that, I did that.  And I was as good as she was, okay, and I could do it faster (laughter).  But that was only the house, and she was sworn to secrecy never to mention it again.  Because, you know, hey--
Speaker 1: You can't be--
Speaker 2: Hey, you can't be sewing, you know, and I'm a guy.  You know, come on (laughter).  But no, I did sew.  We did that; that was part of it.  And I never had a job, though.  She would insist that I would never have a job.  I never had a job until I was out of school, because she didn't want me to have a job.  She wanted me to concentrate on my studies, so I never worked until I got out of school.
Story_ID: 261509
Speaker 1: Do you think you had good counseling in school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think I had good counseling.  I think--and it's not changed, because, you know, they would sort of say--well, you know, they wanted you to take shop, or they wanted you to--you know, and all of these things.  And my father [Arthur French, Sr.], one of my father's sayings, which I guess keep coming to.  He used to say, you need to go to school, because you should never lift anything in your life heavier than a pencil.  You know, we'd see people lifting things and moving stuff.  He said, never, not unless you want to, you should never have to do that.  I don't want you to ever have to do it.  And I never have (laughter).  I don't know if that's good.  Even my sister, that's his daughter, never, never, never thought about doing anything resembling labor or anything physical.  And I don't know if that's good or bad, but that's just his--
Speaker 1: You say counseling--was Morris [High School, Bronx, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Well, you would always get this thing about, you know, shop, or you know, or a trade or something--you know, to work for the next generation I guess.  And it hasn't changed, because my daughter [Antonia March], who went to C.W. Post [Campus of Long Island University; LIU Post, Long Island University, Brookville, New York], they told her--she wanted to be in communications.  And her grade advisor told her, well, that's a tough field.  You know, why don't you try the culinary arts?  Which, of course, this is now.  This is not now, but I mean it's like seven or eight years ago when she was in school.  So I don't think that attitude about what black people should be doing, or where we need to head is there.  Of course, I told her that--you know, of course, I went kind of ballistic on that.  Because why should she?  You know, why are we getting the next generation of cooks for people?  So she, of course, stayed with communications.
Speaker 1: Now, was Morris High School an integrated high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.  And my junior high school [J.H.S. 40, Bronx, New York, New York] was an integrated school.  In fact the neighborhood at that time was, we had blacks, Jews, Greeks--some Greeks were still there, some Hispanic people were there.  It was really totally integrated I think at that time, but when I went to junior high school it was totally integrated.  And I guess people were moving out, but they were still there in my graduating class.  They were, you know, I remember Spanish people, I remember Jews, I remember Greeks.  And even I remember one Italian.  I don't know if there were a lot of them, but there were a couple Italians in there.
Speaker 1: Now, would you figure that blacks made up what percent of--
Speaker 2: Of that?
Speaker 1: School population, yeah, in those days.
Speaker 2: At that time I guess we were, there were more, I would say maybe we were forty maybe, getting close.  Because black people--
Speaker 1: That was a pretty good--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was pretty good.  There were a lot of black people there, yeah.  But it was still mixed.
Story_ID: 261510
Speaker 1: When you got out, you didn't have anybody who hooked you up in school anywhere, or anything like that?  Or--
Speaker 2: In terms of what?
Speaker 1: When you got out of [Morris] High School [Bronx, New York, New York], did you have any real connection to going to college, or--
Speaker 2: No.  I did go, but it wasn't, I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I really kind of just didn't know.  So I went, and then once I started working for the city--well, the city is the kind of job I had that you could have forever.  I mean, you know, you can just be there.
Speaker 1: You started right after high school?
Speaker 2: I started--yeah.  I was, I remember having, I was working on my like twenty-first birthday.  But one good about the city was that as long as you passed the exams, you could move forward.  And that was something that was kind of in my mind.  Because again, you were restricted.  They never appointed anybody in certain areas.  But as long as you could pass the exam, you could move ahead.  When I left, I was like--what was my--I was an office manager for a social service center.  So, that was, so that was good.  I would pass the test.  Because what they would do when they'd want to make a test hard, they'd put more math on it.  So, that was kind of like right up my alley (laughter).  Because, you know, so what would happen, it would eliminate a lot of people.  But if you know math--that's why I like math.  So, there were fifty math questions.  I would look at the exam and say there are fifty math questions.  If you needed seventy to pass, that would mean that it's almost like a gift, fifty points.  You know, it would be like, I would say well, I just need twenty out of the other fifty.  Because these fifty on that side, you know, that's just money in the bank.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you work for the City of New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I guess I worked there about fifteen or sixteen years, actually.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--
Speaker 2: I was working there when I was acting, even after I started acting.
Speaker 1: Now, what was it?  You worked for the city?
Speaker 2: I worked for the [New York City] Department of Social Services, which is a civil service job.
Story_ID: 261511
Speaker 1: You're working for the New York City Department of Social Services?
Speaker 2: Social Services, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a wonderful job, a desk job.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a desk job.
Speaker 1: You've got it made, right? I thought so (laughter).
Speaker 2: Why would turn to acting then (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You know, the first thing I ever did when I got there--you know, they assign you.  You know, you go to a big pool, and they assign people.  And they assigned me to Hart Island [New York, New York].  And Hart Island--nobody--I didn't know what the heck that was.  But what Hart Island, they had a thing called the division of congregate care.  And at that time they would take--they weren't homeless people, but they were bums, you know.  They would pick up these people off the Bowery [Manhattan, New York, New York] and they would give them an option.  You could go to jail for whatever the sentence was, or you could go to Hart Island and kind of be rehabilitated.  You can spend your thirty days on the island, it was outdoors.  It was, it's an island, a city island.  And you could--they would drive them out.  They would get clothing, they would get fed three meals a day.  I ended up working in the storeroom.  And Hart Island was in three parts at that time.  It was a sewage disposal plant for City Island [Bronx, New York, New York] on one end, and that's where potter's field is, which I never knew.  So I was, we were in the middle of the sewage disposal plant and potter's field.  And this, at that time it was a rehabilitation center for alcoholics, and I worked in the storehouse.
Speaker 2: So, it might have been--
Speaker 1: It was a great job.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Sounds like it could be depressing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you met a lot of people, and I learned a lot.  I mean I was, I was just nineteen or something, or twenty.  So you know, you think, oh, these are the bums from the Bowery.  Well, I met more people that have been--oh, I met a guy who was an All-American football player, ex-bankers.  You know, these were people, you know, they were bums, they were in the Bowery.  These people were smart, you know, from good families.  But they were just alcoholics, and they were there.  So I worked in the storehouse ordering food and getting stuff to the mess hall, and ordering supplies and things like that.  That was my first job.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I had a great adventure.  I want to say my adventure with Social Services was great.  I had some great assignments in there.  They kind of woke me up.  I mean I was very, kind of sheltered, as much as you can be growing up in Harlem [New York, New York] with a strict family.  So, it opened up a lot of things.  I went from there to veterans welfare center.  I went to Domestic Relations Court [New York City Family Court].  I went to medical payment.  So, I had a great adventure working there, and at the Neighborhood Youth Corps [program] that paid (unclear) all the things you were talking about.  So I learned a lot in the time I spent there.  It opened up a whole different kind of, you know--and of course it's all about people's problems, which is I guess what life is about.  So--
Speaker 2: Now this is, I don't mean to trouble you with dates, but--
Speaker 1: No, go ahead.
Speaker 2: But we have to try to ask about, get some kind of bearing on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this is a time--we can pretty much guess this is the late '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s], I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in there somewhere.  I don't remember.  I'm not trying to hide--you know, it's one of those things, you know, when you ask about dates. It's not that I'm trying to be younger or any older than I am.  But in this business if you go in, let's say, and they say, how old are you?  And you say, whatever you say.  They'll say, yeah, you look about that age.  Say if you said forty, and they say, yeah, yeah, that's right.  Well, this is a part for a guy forty-five, or this is a part for a guy thirty-five.  Or they think, they kind of bracket you by what you say.  So I always say, I'm not going to tell you.  You know, whatever you think, you know, use your own judgment.  I don't care if you think I'm ninety.  Fine, you know.  But, so I never say it.  Not because I'm trying to be evasive, or trying to say I'm thirty-five or something, but just because people, you know, put you in certain categories, or do that.  So, since I haven't totally retired--when I retire, I'm going to write you and I'm going to give you the exact date, time of birth (laughter)--
Story_ID: 261512
Speaker 1: Now we're approaching the part of your life where you're out on your own now?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're getting involved in the cultural life of this rich place we call Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of rich things are going on, and I just want to get a sense of that.  What was going on?  Did you start to get--I know you got involved at some point.
Speaker 2: At some point I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, when did you start, and where did you go?  Did you know about the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You talked about the lectures in front of the bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore, Harlem, New York, New York], I mean, the music when it would come to Harlem.
Speaker 2: What I did, I had no ambitions about being in the theatre at all.  A couple of my friends, as we were playing basketball we formed actually a doo-wop group.  And this is like the late '50s [1950s].  And I had a little bit of a car, a old beat up car.  So, I used to drive them around.  It was a group called The Crickets.  They were right out of the Bronx [New York, New York], and I used to drive them around.  So, that was my introduction.  It was the first time I ever went in a nightclub.  Because they used to, we'd travel around, and they would sing in clubs and doo-wop in clubs.  And I'd never been in a nightclub, and that was all new to me--or had a drink in a bar or anything like that.  So that was the beginning of, I guess, the corruption (laughter).  But it got me out into the world.  The theater was--well, I can tell you what happened.  I got sick one time.  I got sick, I don't get sick, and I had this weird rash, and I had to stay home from work.  It was just my mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] and I, and I started watching television, which I never watched.  And I watched it all day long because I couldn't read, I couldn't concentrate.  And I couldn't do anything for fun but for so long.  So, by the end of a week at home looking at this I started to say, look at something and say, I can do that.  I think I can do that.  There were other things I looked at, and I said, I don't know how in the world anybody does that.  So, when I decided--and this was like in, I know exactly when this was.  This was in, the end of 1959.  And I decided then--I saw a little article in the paper, and I thought I'm going to just find out about this.  I'm going to go to acting school, or I'm going to school and find out about it.  I was interested in two things.  I wanted, at the time I talked about, I was thinking about being a DJ kind of person.  But I decided, I ended up going to acting school.
Story_ID: 261513
Speaker 1: Were you part of that first generation of rock and roll people?  I mean people that--
Speaker 2: It was the doo-wop era, the guys I knew.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean in my neighborhood, it was--
Speaker 1: Doo-wop and the transitioning into--
Speaker 2: Coming into rock and roll.
Speaker 1: Fats Domino and Little Richard and all of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  When I went with my little doo-wop group, The Crickets, and later I went out with Lillian Leach and the Mellows, Alan Freed was still in Cleveland [Ohio].  You know, Alan Freed--
Speaker 1: Alan Freed is the great disc jockey--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --famous for all those voices--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and radio stints.
Speaker 2: Right, he had the hound dog.  He used to call himself Hound Dog [sic. Moondog].  And when I came back actually from Cleveland, I told people that if Alan Freed ever came to New York [New York], he would take off everybody that was on the air.  I mean, it was just--.  But that's where he originated.  So, that was kind of a little show business connection, being with those guys.  I would never get up and sing, I never sang with them.  I set up the mics, I'd do all the other stuff, but I was not going to get on there--
Story_ID: 261514
Speaker 1: But anyway I went to acting school, just, not to be an actor, but just to find out what it was about.
Speaker 2: Now, what school did you go to?
Speaker 1: I went to a place called the Dramatic Workshop [New York, New York], which was then in the old Capitol Theatre building [New York, New York].  This was in January 1960.  These dates, I know.  That's when I went there.  I didn't know anything about acting, and I didn't know about any of the groups around.
Speaker 2: Now, is this a black repertory?
Speaker 1: No, they're not black.  It was pretty much all white.  I don't think--maybe there was one black student.  [Lee] Strasberg was there, but I was not in his class; that was the advanced group.  So, I had a teacher named Peggy Feury, F-E-U-R-Y, who became like a monumental acting coach in later years.  She, in fact, the year she died Lily Tomlin won the Tony [Award; Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre], and Anjelica Huston won the Oscar [Academy Award].  Those were her students.  Martin Landau was her student by that time.
Speaker 2: When we interviewed Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.], he said that he was taught by Peggy Feury--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well, she was like, she was back there.  But I had no idea who she was, or who any of these people were, because I had no theater contact whatsoever.  I just went out of curiosity, really.  And then from there, there was an actress there--I don't where she is.  She was a student named Evelyn Scott.  She asked me, she told me about a black group [American Community Theater] in Harlem [New York, New York] run by a man named Maxwell Granville.  And she asked me if I knew who he was.  And of course I didn't know him.  I didn't know anything, I didn't know any black actors.  I guess I knew, you know, the people I saw in the movies--Mantan Moreland, Willie Best, and those people.  But I didn't know--
Speaker 2: So, you didn't know anybody doing serious acting?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: You knew the people that were basically the comedians and clowns and all that?
Speaker 1: I mean I saw--I didn't know anybody.  I mean, when I went to school--
Speaker 2: Except the ones you knew about?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so I didn't know anyone who was doing serious--I was not aware of people like Canada Lee or Charles Gephardt [ph.] or those other people. I had no knowledge of them.
Speaker 2: It was kind of hard to find out about them I guess, for a young person in those days, about who was doing serious--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I certainly had no idea of anybody outside of the movies.  I was totally ignorant, which I felt was really the best thing, as I look back on it.  I didn't have any preconceived ideas, I didn't have any expectations.  I just went in with a clean slate, just to find out what is this stuff about?  How do people--I was fascinated by the people who did things I didn't think I could do, you know.  I would watch some actor do something, and I'd say, how can anyone do that?
Story_ID: 261515
Speaker 1: At that time had 'No Place to Be a Man,' [sic.] or 'Blackboard Jungle' come out yet?
Speaker 2: I think maybe 'Blackboard Jungle,' but 'Nothing But a Man' had not come out yet (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Nothing But a Man,' yeah, with Ivan Dixon.
Speaker 2: No, they hadn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I wouldn't have known if they did.  I went to plays, but I wouldn't say I knew anybody or anything.  So then I went to this group in Harlem [New York, New York], which was Maxwell Granville's group [American Community Theater, New York, New York], which was a black group, and I met all these black people.
Speaker 1: Tell us about Maxwell Granville.  Who is he?  Because we don't hear a lot about him.
Speaker 2: You never heard of him at all?
Speaker 1: I confess.  I probably have heard of him, but I don't know a lot about him.
Speaker 2: He had a group in Harlem.  He was back with the old American Negro Theatre [ANT].  And these were the older actors, these were before me.
Speaker 1: They called them the ANTS, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And they were disbanded by the time I came along.  Something had happened with the old Negro Actors Guild [of America], and there was a Negro Actors Guild.  Something had happened there.  I don't know what it was.  It was always kind of secretive, people didn't want to talk about it.  Whatever happened, it broke up.  And Maxwell Granville decided to form his own group, because of that split.  So he had a group in Harlem, a group that did plays, where they had playwriting classes where they did, you know, productions and things like that.  So, I came up with this woman Evelyn [Scott] to audition.  I'd never seen black actors.  I never saw a play read.  [HistoryMaker] Gertrude [Hadley] Jeannette's play, 'Light in the Cellar' was the first I ever heard read by a professional actress.  I think [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne might have been one of the people reading, but I'm not sure.  But I just, I thought it was fascinating.  I was fascinated by the whole thing of watching these actors.  And one of the incidents that happened there--finally Maxwell--he was a big man--and he taught me more about the theatre and about just surviving than anyone else in the world.  As far as the theater goes, he's the guy.  And he said, he said, "Well, when are you going to do something?  When are you going to do a scene or something?"  He had a big voice.  In fact, I just saw him on 'The Iceman Cometh,' [Eugene O'Neill] which is the old thing he did with Jason Robards.  And we said, "We'll do our scene next week."  So we did this scene from (unclear), Evelyn and I.  And when we were finished we got--we got into the pro workshop.  And there was a man there named Austin Briggs-Hall, who had been a theater person, I understand, but who couldn't do it, and he'd opened a haberdashery shop.  And he gave us some pointers on how to do this scene for class, and we would do it downtown.  And he said, "Don't tell them."  He said, "If they ask you who helped you, don't say anybody."  So, we said, "Okay."  So we went back, and we were in Peggy Feury's class.  And we did the scene, and what was the first thing she said when we finished?  Who helped you? (Laughter) We said, "Nobody," (laughter).  She said, "Well, you don't need to do it anymore, because you've gotten as much as you can out of it."  I remember that incident, because it kind of set off a light bulb.  I said, well, these people, these black people up in Harlem, they know what they're talking about.  I mean, they know about this stuff.  And it never dawned on me, because I was going to a kind of prestigious school [Dramatic Workshop, New York, New York].  A lot of the old method people were there, you know, in [Lee] Strasberg's class.
Speaker 1: Now, those are the method people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's when I started--but I mean, you know, this was a group in Harlem.  We were over a church, you know, on Monday nights.  So, it struck a chord that--oh, my gosh.  And some of that--I think that kept my interest in it, and I just, you know, went forward.  That was kind of--and I knew it was something that I would always do.  I kind of knew that right away, that I--maybe for the first time in my life I had found something that I had chosen myself, that hadn't been chosen by my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.].  It wasn't because I was under any peer pressure.  It was like the first thing that I had found and chosen for myself.  And so I guess I knew that I would always do it.  I didn't ever think of becoming a professional necessarily, but I knew it was something I would do.  I still had my job, so I wasn't about to quit.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of his school?  Did you tell us the name of it?
Speaker 2: The American Community Theater [New York, New York]. The school I went to originally, downtown?
Speaker 1: No, Granville's--
Speaker 2: The American Community Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who would guess that was in Harlem, right?  (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right in Harlem, over a church.
Speaker 1: Which church was it over?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember.  It was a small church, and we were upstairs.
Story_ID: 261516
Speaker 1: Yeah, I continued, I continued to take lessons.  And then I kind of involved myself in everything.  I did all the stuff that no one wanted to do, you know, down at the school.  No one wanted to, you know, build--you know, I'd build flats.  Or no one wanted to be behind the scenes.  I did everything.  I mean, you know, stage manager, I did sound effects.  I learned how to do--just because I loved the whole concept of it.  And so I did everything that I could do, just to steep myself in the whole area and with Maxie [Maxwell Granville].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now, did you get a chance to see 'The Blacks[: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet], or any of the big shows?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Maxwell Granville was the original production stage manager of 'The Blacks.'  And so, he invited us--he said to his group, those of us who were there, Well, if they're not sold out, you know, during the week or something, you can come down and I'll let you in and you can watch the show, watch and see what professional actors do.  And of course, I went down.  And I would go almost four or five nights a week to just see black people in this kind of play.  You know, I mean I'd see--all my experience was movies and stuff.  And to see black people in a play--and of course, the people in that cast.  [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou was in that cast; [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones; Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.]; Godfrey Cambridge; you know, people like that.
Speaker 2: Cicely Tyson.
Speaker 1: Cicely Tyson was in it.  What's his name?  Lex Monson and actually Charles Gordon, who became later Chuck Gordone, who wrote 'No Place to Be [Somebody].' So, you could see--so I could see these people for free.  And I would go four or five times a week and just watch the same show every night, because I was just fascinated seeing black people doing this kind of play and this kind of work.  It was very fascinating to me.
Speaker 2: It was sort of a high brow kind of comedy, I guess?  Would you describe it like that?
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say it was a comedy.  I think it was written by this man, by--
Speaker 2: Jean Genet.
Speaker 1: Jean Genet.  So, it was a strange play--I don't know if I understood it, about the blacks holding a funeral.  And of course he was white, writing about blacks, which probably--you know, it was just what they did and how they did it, and how they spoke.  That kind of fascinated me.  And I never thought of course--I never could do anything like that.  But it was something that captured my attention and my imagination immediately.  So, I must have seen that play a hundred times, easily.  I would go every week, every time it wasn't sold out.  And when Maxie left, and a man named Ed Cambridge took over, he would let me in.  And I would learn just to work out with the understudies and be around it.  So, I was kind of hooked.
Speaker 2: Could you mouth the lines along with them?
Speaker 1: I pretty much knew them by that time, yeah (laughter).  But still had no thoughts about doing it professionally--
Story_ID: 261517
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you're still working for the [New York] City [Department of Social Services]?
Speaker 2: I'm still working for the city, and in the meantime I got married (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's kind of like an avocation or a hobby or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a hobby, it was something to do.  But the story about that, it was actually a play that we did up there written by Hal DeWindt; I don't know if you know Hal DeWindt.  And it was written by Hal DeWindt and Reni Santoni, called 'Raisin' Hell in the Son.'
Speaker 1: I've heard of that play.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think either [HistoryMaker S.] Pearl Sharp or [HistoryMaker] Janet [Angel] MacLachlan --I think Janet MacLachlan was in it.
Speaker 2: Janet MacLachlan was in it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: She was--
Speaker 1: 'Raisin' Hell in the Son.'
Speaker 2: Raisin' Hell, R-A-I-S-I-N' apostrophe, Hell in the Son.  I think it was S-O-N.
Speaker 1: It was a parody of '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry]?
Speaker 2: A parody of 'Raisin in the Sun.'
Speaker 1: It was by who?  How do you spell the names?
Speaker 2: Hal DeWindt, H-A-L, D-e-W-I-N-D-T.  And Reni, R-E-N-I, Santoni, S-A-N-T-O-N-I.
Speaker 1: Now, are those black writers?
Speaker 2: Hal is black.  Reni Santoni isn't.  But they wrote this together, and it was a takeoff of 'Raisin in the Sun.' And Janet MacLachlan was actually in the production.  That was my first production, the first professional production.  We did it first at Maxie Granville's [Maxwell Granville] place [American Community Theater, New York, New York].  And we did it in the loft of an old actor called Richard Ward; Dick Ward had a loft.  And the story of that is we were doing it there.  And it was raining one night, it was a pouring rain.  And we decided to go home.  And three people came in out of the rain.  I guess they had nothing better to do.  And they said, "Well, what do you want to do?  Do you want to do it for these three people?"  It was a big cast, "Or do you want to just go home?"  It was still raining, so we said "Well, let's do it, you know, what the heck."  So, we did this play, and one of those three men produced that play off-Broadway.  His name was Dr. Houston Brummitt, he's still around.  And that's how I became a professional actor.  I never thought about it, but he took it off Broadway.  That was my first job.
Speaker 1: So, when it came off-Broadway, you had to get in the union?
Speaker 2: I had to get in the union.  When Hal DeWindt, who was my friend for the rest of my life until, you know, the end--he called up and said, "You got to, you've got to join the union."  I remember I said, "What union?"  And he said, "You've got to join Actors' Equity [Association], you know, it's going to be off-Broadway."  I said, "Seriously?"  So anyway, I went to sign the contract.  And he said, "Come up."  He had an office, and he said, "Well, read it, read it."  And I said, "I can't read it."  I couldn't read it, I couldn't see it, because it was just too wild; it was just unbelievable to me.  So, I remember signing it, and I said, "Well, you won't cheat me," (laughter).  So, I signed the contract.  And then for the first time--it wasn't the first time, because I had been born in New York [New York], and I went to the theater and I'd walked around Broadway.  But I went out, and I just walked around the whole Theater District.  It was the first time it hit me that I thought, well, now I'm a professional actor.  I'm actually going to, I'm going to be here.  I mean, it never dawned on me until that day that this was something that maybe I would do.  So, that was the beginning of this madness.
Story_ID: 261518
Speaker 1: Now tell us about being married.  Now you got married--
Speaker 2: I got married in 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On July 1; I know these dates now (laughter) in Tyler, Texas.
Speaker 1: In Tyler, Texas?
Speaker 2: That's right, because my wife [Antoinette Williams] was from Tyler, Texas.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you meet her?
Speaker 2: I met her here.  I met her--she was going to [The] Juilliard [School, New York, New York], and she was the roommate of a woman who my friend was engaged to.  I met her actually at his engagement party.  They were roommates, and I met her there, and then we starting dating, I guess.  And so, that's when I got married, July 1, in Tyler, Texas which was her hometown.  So, that's--her name was Antoinette Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was she, now she's married to a person with a good city job [at the New York Department of Social Services] who has decided to become an actor (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was going to acting school when I met her.  I think it must have jarred her a little bit.
Speaker 1: Did she, did she, did that kind of shake up her a little bit?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't.  Actually, she had, she was a member of the Fisk Jubilee Singers when she was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And she also had sung--this is before I met her--with the Dallas Symphony [Orchestra] when she was like sixteen or something.  So you know, she was I guess part of--she had toured Europe with the Fisk Jubilee Singers.  This is all before I met her.
Speaker 1: So she was a singer and dancer, right?
Speaker 2: She didn't dance, no.  She just sang, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, a singer who went to Juilliard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, she was studying at Juilliard, you know, post-graduate stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was just going to acting school.  She was much further along than I was.
Speaker 1: Did she get involved in the theater, too?
Speaker 2: She came up to Maxie's [Maxwell Granville] place [American Community Theater, New York, New York] when I was going up there.  You know, she sat and she acted in some of the stuff.  I don't--you know I guess she was there.  Maxie wouldn't let anybody just sit down; you had to do something in his place.  So, yeah, so she came up when we were first married and all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I got married shortly after that.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you're in 'Raisin' Hell in the Son'?
Speaker 2: Right.  And actually, unfortunately she didn't see it, because her father [Dr. Frank Williams] became ill at that time.  He was, he was a doctor, and he took ill.  And so, she was away.  The first thing I ever did, she was down there.  He had a stroke and stuff.  So, he never--she didn't see the first one.
Story_ID: 261519
Speaker 1: At the time when [HistoryMaker] Janet [Angel] MacLachlan told me about this play ['Raisin' Hell in the Son,' Hal DeWindt and Reni Santoni]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I didn't think to ask about it in detail.  And later I tried to do some research on it.  There's not a lot of information about it.
Speaker 2: No, it didn't last long.  I think we ran for two weeks, we didn't have a big long run.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a synopsis of what was satirized in the play, and what the significance of it was?
Speaker 2: Okay.  What it was satirizing--it was a lot of controversy about the play even being done in the community theater.  Because the leading character was a man named Sidney Bellafunky.  And some of the people felt that it was making fun of our two of our heroes, you know, of Sidney Poitier and [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte.  So, it was a big discussion; they didn't want to do it.  They felt it was---but anyway it got done, to make a long story short.  So, the story was what happens when the white family, when they move into the white neighborhood.  You know, that's the end of '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], and they're moving into the white neighborhood.  So, this was a takeoff on what really happens when they moved into the white neighborhood.  And what really happened was they were throwing bombs, but it was done in a humorous way.  And you know, the little daughter--Bob Rantell [ph.] was in show, in fact.  That was--so it was that kind of ridiculous kind of way-out story of what happens when you do move into a white neighborhood.  You know, the little girl is running around with a sign saying, Don't be race conscious, every time somebody would say something.  So, there were a lot of jokes and humor, and it was just far out.  It probably should be done now (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Because I was trying to find out the content, and I couldn't find any information.  But that's good.  That's--
Speaker 2: And we had a white maid.  That was, that was the whole thing, moving into the white neighborhood and how we had a white maid (laughter).
Speaker 1: So kind of, as people say "flipped the script."
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And it was done way out--wild and ridiculous, and that was it.
Story_ID: 261520
Speaker 1: Right I'm married now [to Antoinette Williams French] (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're married.  Now, do you have children?
Speaker 1: We have, my first, my son [Arthur French, III] was born in '65 [1965].  So, we had like three years before we had children.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, you--
Speaker 1: So, I'm working--
Speaker 2: You're in 'Raisin' [Hell in the Son,' Hal DeWindt and Reni Santoni], but it didn't last long?
Speaker 1: It didn't last long.
Speaker 2: It lasted for two or three weeks?
Speaker 1: Two weeks, two weeks.  We were out of there.
Speaker 2: So, it starts off as a small production and goes off-Broadway--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to a bigger production.  And two weeks later--
Speaker 1: We're out of work.  Actually, I lost money, because I was making more money--I think my first official union paycheck was $45 a week; that was off-Broadway.  And I was making more than that anyway.  But it didn't matter, because it was a professional show, and that was the start of all of it.
Speaker 2: So, did you continue with the [New York] City [Department of Social Services]?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.  I continued with the city until 1971.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Because what I did, is when I decided--I made a decision I think right around this time that I would pursue this, I'm going to give this a shot.  And what I decided, I said that I would never take another day off, never.  That was my own promise to myself, unless it was to deal with the theater, unless it was to act.  I was not going to take vacation, I wasn't taking any days off, sick leave.  I just said I can't get sick, I'm going in.  And of course what happened is I didn't get any work for a long time.  I piled up a tremendous amount of time.  At that time, you could accumulate up to fifty-four days of vacation, maximum, and up to 180 days sick leave maximum.  And I did accumulate that.  I ended up at one point taking days off so I wouldn't lose them, because after that you just lost them.  So, I actually was a good employee in many ways, because I was always there.  I worked--if they wanted people to work overtime, I worked overtime.  Because I just felt that somewhere down the line, I would need that time.  I don't know what made me think that, but I did think that at some point I would need that time.  And it did happen, actually.
Speaker 2: It kept you attached to a security--
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, yeah.  I had a paycheck coming every week.
Speaker 2: You had a family--
Speaker 1: And I had--
Speaker 2: --and they didn't have to worry about you--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, they didn't have to. Nobody was missing any meals, and we weren't going to be put out or anything like that.  I mean, I wasn't that crazy yet.  That came later (laughter).  So I had my job, so actually the theater was like extra income.  You know, if I got a little job, that was good.  Or if I got to be an extra on the soap opera or in a movie or something, that was a little extra income, you know.  So, but no, I had my regular check.  So, if I didn't work, I was still a city employee.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, 'Raisin' Hell in the Son' that was 1961?
Speaker 1: That was 19--no, I guess, I'm trying to think what year it was.  I guess it was '61 [1961].  I'm trying to think if it was '61 [1961] or '62 [1962].  But it was, it was, I think it was maybe, it might have been '62 [1962].  I'm not sure, it's either '61 [1961] or '62 [1962].  You probably can look it up.  But it had to be one of those years.
Story_ID: 261521
Speaker 1: When did your next show come out?
Speaker 2: The next thing I actually got, I got to go away in summer stock.  And I'm not sure, I didn't have any children yet.  So, it must have been '62 [1962] or '63 [1963].  I got to do 'Purlie Victorious,' Ossie's [HistoryMaker Ossie Davis] play.  That was a big play, you know, there weren't many things in summer stock.  But I got this job to go to the Hedgerow Playhouse [sic. Hedgerow Theatre Company], which was in Moylan-Rose Valley in Pennsylvania.  They had a famous theater man named Jasper Deeter, who at that time must have been, I don't know, eighty years old, but he was out there.  So I did three plays for summer stock.  I did 'Purlie Victorious,' not the musical ['Purlie'], but the original 'Purlie Victorious' by Ossie Davis.  I did 'The Death of Bessie Smith.'  I can never think of this man's name [Edward Albee] who wrote it, but anyway he's still writing.  You'll find out, you'll ask somebody.  I can't think of it.  I will think of it as we go along.  And 'The Hostage,' those are the three plays I did.  Brendan Behan wrote 'The Hostage.'  Oh, Edward Albee, that's it.
Speaker 1: Is that 'The Death of Bessie Smith'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'The Death of Bessie Smith.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, those are the three plays I did in summer stock.  And I also worked as assistant director on the fourth play, which I wasn't in, called 'The Caretaker' a Harold Pinter play.
Speaker 1: Now, that's all over the summer?
Speaker 2: Over the summer, over one summer.  I think it was, I guess it was the summer of '63 [1963] or something like '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: That must have been quite an experience, to have the whole summer to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was, it was great.  You know, I'm doing three different plays in summer stock.
Story_ID: 261522
Speaker 1: In the meantime, I was auditioning for everything and, you know, doing extras and things when I could get them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did you--did you do a movie during this period?  I mean, were you an extra, or--
Speaker 1: I never had a part in anything at that time.  You know, I think I ended up joining, I think I joined...  Around the time when, again, [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, who keeps popping up, was in--he directed 'Cotton Comes to Harlem.'  It was somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: Well, that's somewhere later in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: That's later, yeah.  But this time I guess that's what I was doing.  I think the next major thing I got into was 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence.'
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, tell us about--
Speaker 1: I think chronologically I might be out of order, because I'm not good at that.  That was--
Speaker 2: Oh, you said--
Speaker 1: That might be--I'm trying to think if that was before or after summer stock.  It might have been before.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  'Day of Absence' was in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Then it was after, it was after summer stock.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was the next thing I got into.  And--
Speaker 2: Tell us about, how did you meet [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll tell you how I met Douglas Turner Ward.  I was aware of Douglas Turner Ward because Douglas Turner Ward, he was in '[A] Raisin in the Sun,' [Lorraine Hansberry] the original cast.  He was the moving man.  I didn't know him.  But Hal DeWindt wanted to form a theater, Douglas was one of the people he mentioned as an actor in it.  I did not know Douglas Turner Ward at all.  I'd seen him around town.  And when the auditions came up, of course, for 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' every black actor in New York [New York] I'm sure sent pictures.  There wasn't that much work.  I had sent a picture and never had gotten a call, never gotten an audition.  And finally near the end I got a, I did get a call to go in and audition.  And I wondered--I'd sent in a hundred, you know, pictures and stuff.  When I got in, the assistant director was Hal DeWindt.  And Hal DeWindt had got them to have me come in.  And when I went in and I saw him behind the desk, we looked at each other.  I didn't acknowledge him, and he didn't, we didn't acknowledge each other.  And I just went ahead and read for it, and I got a part in it.  And that was the first--well, Doug was there.  He was not, he didn't direct that.  A guy, I forget the director.  Oh, Philip Meister directed it.  But Doug was there at the audition.  And I guess my meeting and my getting to actually know Doug happened when we started rehearsing, and he was introduced.  He was also in the play, so that was my first really association with Douglas Turner Ward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In the rehearsals of 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence.'
Story_ID: 261523
Speaker 1: What did you think about those plays ['Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward]?  These are two plays that have been done quite a bit in black theater--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --over the years.
Speaker 2: Well, they had never been done when I did them (laughter).
Speaker 1: What did you think about them?  They were both about, somewhat about the other side of the coin.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There's two different sides of the same coin, the black--
Speaker 2: Well, 'Day of Absence,' the thing about that was is what happens if one day they wake in this southern town, unnamed town, and there were no black people, there were just no black people around.  What would happen?  And of course it's farcical--so, the madness of things that happen.  Who cooks the meals?  Who feeds the baby, you know?  In fact, there's one scene where he says, "Whose behind am I going to pinch?"  You know, what am I going to do?  And the whole town--the mayor, which is the leading part which Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] himself played--is panicking.  They're saying, "You've got to find them.  Who's going to do the work?  Who's going to clean the toilets?"  You know, we got to get them back.  And it ends up with like a nationwide television broadcast begging the "nigras" as they called them in the play, to return.  But it did have a comment on--you know, it was the time of the boycott around that time where people were not going into certain stores.  So, while it was cutting and biting, it had a real social, you know, content about what do we do?  How valuable are we in this society?  What does society want?  Can they do without us, as they're always telling us?  We did all the work, but we're still the shiftless darkies, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: We get the criticism of being worthless.
Speaker 2: Worthless, yeah, and shiftless.  But we did everything, we built everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, that was that.  The other play, of course, dealt with--we find a couple of maids.  They're crying because their boss, their employers, have split.  The white people they work for have decided to split up.
Speaker 1: To divorce.
Speaker 2: And we come in and we meet these two black women who are just broken up about it.  And of course the young man who [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks played comes and says, "What are you crying about?"  Then they start telling him where they get the meat, where they get the clothes he wears, because the boss only wears them once, and you know, all of the things that they get by being maids and what not.  And of course at the end of it, he starts crying, too (laughter).  But it dealt with, you know, what that relationship is--that employee and employer relationship, whether you're part of the family supposedly or not.  So it was at that time--it may not be now, but it was very political.
Story_ID: 261524
Speaker 1: Because the attorney general of Alabama came to see the play, and wanted to meet us afterwards.  He was running against [Governor George] Wallace at the time.  He was a segregationist, I'm sure himself, but he was a little less than Wallace.  So, he came with his group.  And you know, so you can imagine being backstage and having someone say the attorney general--his name was Richmond Flowers [Sr.], I remember.  His son [Richmond Flowers, Jr.] played in the National Football League [NFL].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a track star too.  Richmond Flowers, I remember.
Speaker 1: I think the son, the son--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the son, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: The son.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the son.
Speaker 1: But his father--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is the father.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He came to see the play with his entourage, there were three or four of them.  He said he wanted to meet us, and said how impressed he was with the play.  And I think he was then seeking the black vote down there.  So it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Richmond Flowers had a reputation of being a liberal--
Speaker 1: He was a liberal--
Speaker 2: --Alabama politician.
Speaker 1: And he was a--
Speaker 2: A lot different.
Speaker 1: He was a lot different.  And Wallace was in power at that time, and Wallace had stopped the integration.  So the plays ['Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward], when we did them, in addition to being plays and being entertaining, they had like a social comment without saying that--without coming out and saying, we're saying something.  The plays made a comment about our society at the time, and the changes that were going on in the society and in race relations, and in the country's reaction, all of that.  So, the plays had another message besides just being entertainment.  So the people-- politicians, stars, it was kind of the place to come.  So people who came into town came to see our show.  You know, almost every star came.  I mean Barbra Streisand came, Burt Lancaster, and naturally Sidney [Poitier], you know.  If they were in town--Craig Stevens, you know.  So that was the place to come see these plays in this little theater [St. Mark's Playhouse, New York, New York], because it just had that double edge of being entertaining, and also making a great social comment on our times.
Story_ID: 261525
Speaker 1: Now, you were in another play that a gentleman that I know wrote, 'Perry's Mission.'
Speaker 2: 'Perry's Mission,' yeah.
Speaker 1: It was around the same time.
Speaker 2: It was about the same.  It was a one-act play, I remember.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I can't remember a lot about 'Perry's Mission.'  I remember Shauneille Perry [sic. HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] I think directed that play.  And of course, in a sense, a lot of black women weren't directing plays.  I think Shauneille still credits it with--I don't know if you ever interviewed Shauneille.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  She's I guess out of town this week. So we're going to do her next.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But she did that play.  And I'm trying to remember the plot of it, it's been a long time ago.
Speaker 2: It's a bar--
Speaker 1: It takes place in a bar.  And--
Speaker 2: --in a horrible rainstorm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And people were gathering in the bar.
Speaker 1: I know I played kind of a drunken guy or whatever, the character that I played.
Speaker 2: There's a white guy in there, and he's scared.  He--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, because he's surrounded by black people.
Speaker 1: And I said, Mrs. Perry over there, I remember that was one of the lines that we used to get a big--
Speaker 2: And I think, I think the drunk recognizes the white man is Mr. Perry.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he keeps denying he's Mr. Perry.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think that's--it's been a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  That's Clarence Young III's play.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: So, Shauneille.  How do you spell Shauneille?
Speaker 1: S-H-A-U-N-N-E-I-L-L-E, [Shauneille] I think.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm not sure about the double N.
Speaker 1: The double L?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The double N.
Speaker 1: I think it's just one N.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right, it's one N.
Speaker 2: And two L's I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  She was the director, and we should interview her, you're saying too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there weren't--
Speaker 1: We'll try.
Speaker 2: There weren't many black directors, you know, and black women directors, it was hard.  I think she was the first woman to direct a play.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is she Lorraine Hansberry's sister or cousin, one or the other [Hansberry's cousin].
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think.  I don't know, I think--I don't know, I didn't know she was related to her.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yes.
Story_ID: 261526
Speaker 1: From around the country, black people--when other black folks get involved in the theater they look to the Negro Ensemble Company--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as the place to be.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of that, being in it?
Speaker 2: Well, at first, well, after, this was after 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence.'  So, I don't say I had a sense of it.  I was very happy to be part of it.  And I'd worked with Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] before.  The same people who were the head people at the Negro Ensemble Company were the same three people who produced 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' which was [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, Douglas Turner Ward, and Gerald Krone.  So, I was happy to be there with this company.  I knew every black actor in the city [New York, New York] wanted to be part of this, so I felt privileged to be part of it.  I think what happened is that we were there and we were in the same theater [St. Mark's Playhouse, New York, New York] where we did 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence.'  And we opened, our first play was 'Song of the Lusitanian Bogey' by Peter Weiss.  Well, what happened, and I guess it was surprising, is that we did our first play.  And we just did a play, and I'd done plays before.  And almost overnight it seemed, you know, when we got reviewed, suddenly we would read about being compared to the Moscow Art Theater, and being compared to great theaters of the past.  There were lines around the block, mostly all white, coming to see us.  So, there was that immediate--it was just, just happened.  So one day we were a group of people putting on a play, and the next day we were kind of getting all this publicity and a lot of press.  And we became--like international press.  So it was, it was--but Doug kind of kept us.  Doug would let us enjoy that for about twenty-four hours.  And then he would say, "Okay, now we've got to start, we've got to start rehearsing the next play."  So, we went on and moved on to the next thing.  But suddenly that became the place to be.  Every reviewer was there.  I mean everyone wanted, you know, to find out what these black people were doing, how did this happen?  So, we were known throughout, you know, the country almost immediately.  I mean it was, I don't think--I personally didn't understand or was aware of the scope of it at the time--
Speaker 1: Now, how--
Speaker 2: --of how far reaching it was.  To say it was known all over the world in a very short time.
Story_ID: 261527
Speaker 1: Now, by 1965 or so, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] coins the term black power.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And people are starting to use the term black to describe our people.  In 1968 there are still quite a few Negro organizations still called Negro.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968], this is after [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s assassination, people started gradually changing from Negro to black.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was anybody in your company [Negro Ensemble Company] resentful of the term Negro?
Speaker 2: No.  No one in the company that I know of was resentful of it.  I think it came up, you know, and different things.  And I think, and I'm sure Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] will tell you, that the word Negro was a perfectly valid word when it started.  And he wasn't about to change it because this was the latest thing.  I mean at one point he wanted to call us baloians[ph.], you know, we went through that stage.  And then we went from--so it was a matter of either keeping it--and Doug will speak on this--or saying, you know, what are we going to be?  Now, are we going to the Afro-American ensemble?  Do we change it every time a new word comes up to describe us?  And it was decided it was a good word when it started, and it was going to be a good word when it ended (laughter).  And I think that was kind of--whatever was said.  I don't know of anyone that--I certainly never objected to it, never thought about it.  I felt if people didn't notice that we were black, it was--
Speaker 1: So, there was no agitation about it as far as you know?
Speaker 2: No, not as far as I know.  I never heard about any.
Story_ID: 261528
Speaker 1: 'Perry's Mission' [Clarence Young III] came after 'Song of the Lusitanian Bogey' [Peter Weiss].
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.  Yes, it did, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was like '69 [1969] or--
Speaker 2: It came, I think 'Perry's Mission' was the next year.  We did three one-act plays as I remember, and 'Perry's Mission' was one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking now that maybe Shauneille [Perry] didn't direct that.  Shauneille might have directed--no, Shauneille directed 'Rosalee Pritchett.'  I'm sorry, don't put that down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She didn't direct that.  She directed 'Rosalee Pritchett' [Barbara Molette and Carlton Molette].  There were three one-acts on the bill, and I got it confused.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which you might find is--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] is rolling pretty good at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, we were rolling along.
Speaker 1: And there's one thing, I mean this is from my own experience and things I've seen out in the world.  Away from New York [New York], a lot of people started doing a lot of the black plays that appeared in anthologies, including 'Day of Absence' and 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward], and plays by everybody from Ben Caldwell to HistoryMaker Ed Bullins.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, we had copies of 'Black Fire,' [Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal] and we'd just go the Xerox machine, you know. Xerox them off and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there a real serious concern on the part of the authors about not getting royalties for these plays?
Speaker 2: Well, as a person who doesn't write anything, I don't know (laughter).  I don't know if they had problems or not.  But I know that at that time, those plays began to be produced.  And so, I don't know what problems the author had.
Speaker 1: You never really heard about any--
Speaker 2: No, I never heard about it.  But I'm not a writer, so I don't know what problems they may or may not have had about getting those royalties.
Speaker 1: So, we're all still safe then (laughter).  Okay, so what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it went on for three years.  We did lots of wonderful plays.  I thought every play we did was worth doing, whether or not they got whatever critical things or not--good, bad, or whatever the critics said.  We went on, and people came to see it.
Story_ID: 261529
Speaker 1: Did you care about the critics, what the critics said in those days?  I mean, a lot of black people were saying, we don't care what the white man says.  I mean, were you all a group that felt that way?  Or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I think I always read reviews because some people don't read them.  I always read them--good, bad or indifferent.  I mean if they say--I don't get--fly off the handle if they say I was good, and I'm not going to commit suicide if they said I was bad.  What was, what I found interesting about reviews at that time--we would get like--every paper--since we got like every paper and every magazine review, we got like ten or twelve reviews.  So, you would read them and see where they--I would always read them and say well, where do they coincide?  You knew that some papers didn't like us [Negro Ensemble Company].  Some people, you know, they ridiculed us and what not.  And you knew that some papers favored you.  But then you would get a consensus opinion about it, just to see what people thought.  It wasn't going to stop us from doing plays, but I always found it interesting to hear how people see things.  I mean, I read reviews of movies I see if I go see a play.  It's not going to stop me from seeing it, but I'd be curious to see how other people see it or how they view it, or what not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't think reviews stopped us from doing what we did, or did we kind of set the season to please reviewers.
Story_ID: 261530
Speaker 1: But I felt the community, the black people who became--like, the people who came all the time who became subscribers, that they felt--I felt that those people that I talked to always felt satisfied, whether it was a play about black life, whether it was about an African play, whether it was a Caribbean play, whether it was a southern play, whether it was a comedy, a tragedy, whatever.  But it was about black life, that they could recognize, and not when we see a play and we don't recognize it.  When you see a black play at certain points, or black television, or a black movie, you say, I never knew anybody like this.  Not to say that they can't be bad people, or crooks, or whatever, but it was never anybody like this in the whole world, you know, that we have here.  So I think if we did anything, one of the things we did was supply a variety of black people from all cultures--writers from all, from different countries.  We did Wole Soyinka, Eric John [ph.], Derek Wolcott, and people here, [HistoryMaker] Michael [A.] Schultz, who I mentioned before was our first director who directed the first play.  He was a new director that, you know, we weren't--no one kind of knew that much; he was working.  So, these were the things that happened in that three year period.  We went to Europe, we went to, traveled across the United States.  So, it was a hot three years.  It was three years that you couldn't pay for.  Because how many actors, black actors, get to work three straight years doing new plays all the time, constantly challenging yourself?  So, artistically, it was great.  And I think politically it was great.  It was just a wonderful, a three year period that was just what it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] started in '68 [sic. 1967] and ran through--and you were in it for three years?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it ran past that.  What I'm saying is that the original grant and the commitment to it was for a three year period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At which time we were there fifty-two weeks a year.  We were on salary fifty-two weeks a year, working pretty much most of those weeks, and being together all that time.  Now after that, it continued, but it continued on a production basis.  So, whether you were in the production--and you understudied if you weren't in a particular play, for whatever reason.  But after that three year period, it continued way past that.  But it was, then you would be hired on an individual basis for an individual production.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, for three years, did you do nothing but theater for three years?
Speaker 1: I had my job.  I don't know how--because I accumulated all this time that I told you about.  So, if you think of 154 days' vacation--about fifty-four days' vacation--and 180 days sick leave, that's 234 working days.  That's like a year, pretty much.  Then as you work, you're still accumulating them.  So, even though I was losing them gradually, I would still accumulate days as I worked.  So I was still there, I was still working.  And then of course by then I had children, too.  So, I had to work.
Speaker 2: That sounds like a pretty good situation.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I mean it was just, you know, you do what you have to do.  And you're young, and I had the energy to do it and wanted to do it, so it was fine.

Speaker 1: Now, were you tempted to go to Hollywood?  I mean we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Janet [Angel] MacLachlan who was in 'Raisin' Hell in the Son' [Hal DeWindt and Reni Santoni] with you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was, I think she went right to Hollywood in '62 [1962] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --got in some commercials and she was in movies.  She was on 'I Spy' and--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, Janet, you know, Janet actually was doing commercials here.  She was one of those people--I remember being at home before I was married, and kind of--when you saw a black person on television, you know, you would, say, look, look, look, look.  This is how it was.  And Janet was one of the first people to do commercials and what not.  And she's a wonderful actress, and she decided to go out to California.  I kind of never decided to do it.  I decided to do it once.  I'll tell you this, it's interesting.  I said, I'm going to go out to Hollywood.  I already had my two kids [Arthur French III and Antonia March], and it was summertime.  And I went out to Hollywood, and I was there not twenty-four hours when I got a job back here (laughter).  And it was starting in three weeks.  Israel Hicks [sic. HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] was directing the play.  It was called 'Daddy Goodness' which was a musical version of a play that Eddie Seid [sic. Richard Wright and Louis Sapin] did.  And so at first I said, no, I'm not going to do it.  And they thought I was bargaining, so they called back and offered me more money (laughter).  And I said no again, and they called back again.  Israel called and said, "Look, come on back and do this thing."  So what I did, this was my Hollywood adventure.  It started, like, rehearsal in three weeks.  And my wife [Antoinette Williams French] had been complaining a little because she had the two kids and she was home, and all that.  So I called her up and I told her what happened.  And I said, "Put the kids on the plane, take a vacation.  Take off, I'll take the kids."  So for the next two and a half weeks, my two kids--who were I don't know, four and seven--the three of us just went to all over.  We went to [Six Flags] Magic Mountain [Valencia, California], and Disneyland [Anaheim, California], and Marineland [of the Pacific, Los Angeles County, California] in the Pacific, hung out on the beach, ate at different restaurants.
Story_ID: 261532
Speaker 1: We were talking during the little break in tape.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we're going to go way back--
Speaker 2: Way back--
Speaker 1: --to junior high school [J.H.S. 40, Bronx, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Turn the way back machine to junior high school.
Speaker 1: You were taking me way to back junior high.  And what--
Speaker 2: I was saying that the tests came up for The Bronx High School of Science [Bronx, New York, New York].  And they had sent some students over to demonstrate things and to open it up, and to see if anyone was interested.  So, I was one of the people that was interested, and a few other students.  And my teacher called two of us in and said to us--the other young man was German--and said that we shouldn't take the exam because we didn't have the faculty or facility or whatever to pass it.  We would fail it, we couldn't possibly pass it, and that we would be disappointed and hurt by it, and that we should withdraw our applications.  And the end of the story is we were the only two kids that did pass it.  But that was what my teacher--this was something to say to a kid in junior high school.
Speaker 1: And you were saying that the German kid--why didn't they want him to take it?
Speaker 2: I'm not going to even touch that one (laughter).  I'll leave that alone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not everybody was sympathetic to Germans during that period, we could say.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Well, I guess that was essentially--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the war [World War II, WWII] and what not.
Story_ID: 261533
Speaker 1: Now you're in Hollywood, and you and your kids [Arthur French III and Antonia March] are on vacation having a good time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's all I ever did in Hollywood.  I never really wanted to go out there.  We went out there to do a show, and that was fine.  But I never had the Hollywood bug.  I liked New York [New York], and my family was here.  And I didn't feel like upheaving them; they were happy and I was happy.  So, I never did.  I went out there to work, but then I would always get the first plane back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's fast forward.  I guess by 1970 or '71 [1971], the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] kind of run--I mean that three year--
Speaker 2: That had run out.  That had run out like either early '71 [1971] or late '70 [1970].  That was gone, so you kind of just--they would--I did other work there, but on an individual basis.  So, that was that.
Speaker 1: So about that time, you said about that time you resigned from the [New York] City [Department of Social Services], right?
Speaker 2: I resigned from the city in 1971, in August 1971.  See, these are dates I remember, because I'd gotten into my first Broadway show.  I'd gotten into 'Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death' [Melvin Van Peebles] and I'd about run out of time.  And the time had come for me to make a decision.  I'd been doing both of these things for a long period, and I knew then that either I would, I had to leave the city or leave the theater.  Because I could no longer, I'd reached a point where I could no longer--and I thought that day would come when I could no longer do both.  So, I had to leave one or the other.  And it wasn't--I'd really made up my mind the ten years when I said I wasn't taking any more.  My time was running out, and I just left.
Story_ID: 261534
Speaker 1: Now, 'Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Die a Natural Death.'
Speaker 1: --is based on the poetry of--
Speaker 2: Of, by [HistoryMaker] Melvin Van Peebles.
Speaker 1: Melvin Van Peebles, right.  This becomes a big hit, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it even had segments on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and so on.  I mean, what, tell us about--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, first of all, they, we didn't get, we got--they hated 'Ain't Supposed to Die,' most of the critics.  Essentially, they did.  In fact, one critic went so far as to say how dare they do this in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre [New York, New York]?  Because it was a theater named for a white woman (laughter).  It was like corrupting the whole theater, with us being in there doing this play.  So, but eventually, Melvin Van Peebles said something I'll never forget.  He said, "The show's going to run."  Because really they, you know, they talked about it being blasphemous, a whole lot of nonsense, really.  And so, he says, "Because I'm going to run it."  I think he'd made the money on 'Sweetback,' [sic. 'Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'] so we stayed open.  And eventually we did get people.  And eventually they kicked us out of the Ethel Barrymore Theatre because they can, you know, if certain things don't happen.  But then he got, went to the Ambassador [Theatre, New York, New York], I think, where he just got the rental.  Because in the theater rental, it's not about whether you can pay the rent, you have to bring in a certain amount of people.  You can't just rent it.  In other words, they say you have to bring in a certain amount of people in the box office.  If you don't bring that in, whether you pay the rent or not, it's immaterial, and they can put you out, and do put you out.
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: They just put out, what's the August Wilson play?  They just put them out.
Speaker 1: The newest one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Gem of the Ocean' they just put them out.  So that's part of it.  So it's not about paying rent.  It's not like if you pay your rent in your home.  As long as you pay, you can have one person; you can do what you want.  That's not true.  You have to pay to rent, but you also have to bring in a certain amount of people in the box office.  So, if you don't have enough people from the box office, whether you pay your rent or not, they can kick you out.  That's just part of, that's the way it is.
Speaker 1: Is that--well, explain what that's about.  I mean, if there's--
Speaker 2: Because they, in other words, the theater owner--there's a rental which you must pay, because everybody pays rent.  But then the other part of that agreement is you, you have to generate a certain amount of box office, a certain amount of people coming to see the show.  So if you don't do that, they have the right to take you out, to evict you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but my question is why?  Why would an owner care?
Speaker 2: That's just the way it is, I don't know why.
Speaker 1: As long as he's getting his money, why would he--
Speaker 2: He probably could get something in that he feels may make him more money. And it's always been like that, I mean since I've been in the theater.  It's always been--it's not new.
Speaker 1: Does the owner have the concessions, and so forth?
Speaker 2: I'm sure they do; I'm sure they do.
Speaker 1: That's probably--
Speaker 2: They probably run--the people working the box office have that.  So, I'm sure that's why it is.  I mean, but that's not new.  It's still the same way.  It was like that when I started, and it's that way now.
Story_ID: 261535
Speaker 1: What role did you play in 'Ain't Supposed to Die [a Natural Death,' Melvin Van Peebles]?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have names.  I opened both the first act and the second act (laughter).  But it was, the experience of that--it was--how serendipitous the whole business is--it's that when the auditions came up, being in my usual ignorance, I wasn't really aware of the 'Ain't Supposed to Die' album.  I was doing a series out of Baltimore [Maryland], a television series called 'Our Street' with Whitney LeBlanc.  I don't know if you know Whitney.  Did you ever interview Whitney?  Whitney LeBlanc, and who was down there?  The young Howard Rollins was down there.  And when the auditions came up I'd just gotten a contract, like ten out of twelve weeks in Baltimore.  So, I was about to quit anyway my job.  I don't think I'd quit then yet.  Anyway, I couldn't go to the audition.  And the agreement was, it was like you're going to be there ten out of twelve weeks, but we'll tell you which two weeks you can take off.  So, I missed the auditions.  But after the first week they said, "We have to go back and shoot an episode before your character was introduced.  So, you're off next week."  I'd only worked one week.  So I came back and kind of called the agent.  They said, "We're seeing people on callbacks."  But they saw me, and they got me, I got me in and I got a part in the show.  I didn't have to go to a callback.  But if I hadn't had that week off, I'd never been in it.  So I opened the show singing, 'It Just Don't Make No Sense.'  And it was a period of songs and street scenes and what not.  And then I opened the second act singing, 'Good Morning Sunshine.'  It was a great cast.  Garrett Morris was in the cast; Dick Anthony Williams; B Winde [Beatrice Winde]; who else?  Phylicia Rashad came in after.  I'm trying to think of the people--Sati Jamal.  It was a big cast, lots of wonderful people, Albert Hall.  And I'm going to forget somebody.  But don't print it, don't say any names, because I'll never remember them all.  But anyway that was, that was, you know, my first Broadway experience.  We ran for like eight months.
Story_ID: 261536
Speaker 1: What was [HistoryMaker] Melvin Van Peebles like?
Speaker 2: Melvin was, Melvin came in, and I didn't know Melvin.  And when I was--I was commuting back and forth, and I said, "Well, what is, where is the script?"  Because three people--I was doing 'Black Girl' [J.E. Franklin].  I was commuting.  I was commuting, and I was doing 'Black Girl' in New York [New York] at night, in the evening.  And in the day, I was in Baltimore [Maryland] rehearsing and filming 'Our Street.'  So, I would commute four days a week doing both things at the same time, and ending up my job (laughter).  So, so, but I said that to say what?  So all of, four of us, five people from 'Black Girl' got into 'Ain't Supposed to Die [a Natural Death]'-- Carl Gordon, a buddy who I didn't mention; Jimmy Hayeson, Gloria Edwards; who else?  Minnie Gentry was in it, and myself, and Dick Anthony Williams, who was the associate producer.  So, I would come back every night from Baltimore, and I said, "Did you get the script?  Did you get the script?"  And they never had it.  So one day Jimmy says, "Yeah, we got the script."  But they were these poems, you know, just these poems.  And I said, "What the heck are we going to do?  Are we going to stand up and recite these poems?"  I said, "I'm going to tell these people of 'Black Girl' that I'll come back as an understudy."  I said, "We're not going to be there long."  But when we rehearsed separately after the first day, all Melvin ever said was, he said, "Y'all got it.  Y'all show them who these black people are."  And he went away to work with the music, so we didn't see him.  So, a lot of that had to do with Gil Moses, who really put that show together.
Speaker 1: Gilbert Moses.
Speaker 2: He had a vision of that show that I didn't see.  I mean, and then we rehearsed separately; we rehearsed separately.  And at the end of the week, you only saw the people that would be in the scenes you rehearsed, whether you were--your number, or you were in a scene with someone else.  I was in a scene with Marilyn Coleman, who would shoot me if I didn't remember her.  And at the end of the week we all got together to see what the other people were doing.  Well, when I saw what the other people were doing, I knew it was something special, I knew it was.  I said, oh, my gosh, I couldn't have imagined.
Story_ID: 261537
Speaker 1: Gil [Gilbert Moses] was the leader of what that show became.  But when I saw it all together and saw the other actors I hadn't seen for a week were doing, except those that were involved in my stuff--I think the only person that was involved in anything I did was Marilyn [Coleman]; it was her number.  And you knew it was something extraordinary.
Speaker 2: Tell us, Gilbert Moses is now passed.
Speaker 1: Yes, he has.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us something about Gilbert Moses maybe.
Speaker 1: Gilbert, you know, I didn't know Gilbert very well when I got into 'Ain't Supposed to Die [a Natural Death,' Melvin Van Peebles].  I had seen him, I know he had directed 'Slave Ship from Nine Pages,' [sic. 'Slave Ship: A Historical Pageant,' Amiri Baraka] so I knew him.  He was teaching, and I saw him, but I never talked to him.  I mean I never had a conversation with him until then.  And he was a very intense man, very focused.  I met him, because at one point I almost went with the Free Southern Theater.  That's a whole other--I never was with them.
Speaker 2: John O'Neil, was that him?
Speaker 1: Maybe it was him.  But Gil was the artistic--he was the guy that took the shows out.  So, I'd met him once in an interview.  And I almost went down with him, but I didn't, because I was just married and I didn't want to go away for a long time.  And so, but he was very intense, very focused, very much--you know, he would smoke, and his leg would shake.  He'd be just... but he put that show together, it was in his head somewhere.  And I met him later on, when he couldn't--he needed a bone marrow, and he couldn't get that.  And he was teaching at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], teaching.  And I worked with him with his students in his--he was teaching video classes, and I did some of their scenes for him at that point.  And that was the last--he never did get a match on the transplant.  And so, when I saw him I remember he said, well, they were doing--they found some other procedure where they could do something three times.  But then it was--and then he died a little after that.  But he was a very imaginative, brilliant man, very.  I mean, 'Ain't Supposed to Die' was his head, and that's what I say about Gil.
Story_ID: 261538
Speaker 1: What happened after--it ran eight months?
Speaker 2: It ran approximately eight months, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that takes us to--are we still in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess we might have run through into '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or something like that, you know.  I know we were on the Tonys [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre], we performed on the Tony Awards.  So it must have run into this Tony time.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right.
Speaker 2: We were still running when the Tonys were on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you win any Tonys?
Speaker 2: You know we weren't going to win any Tonys (laughter).  What happened, what [HistoryMaker] Melvin [Van Peebles] said--Melvin said, "They'll turn around."  He said, "I'm going to keep the show running, and it'll turn around."  So even critics who would say it was, you know, amateur, disgusting, they changed.  And they said, "Well, even though some part of 'Ain't Supposed to Die [A Natural Death]' is brilliant, even though there's a brilliant area here--."  I remember Caroline Kennedy came.  And you know, everyone was coming to the show, all the politicians.  Adam Clayton Powell was there.  In fact, Shirley Chisholm first announced that she was going to run for president on the stage of 'Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death.'  That's when she made her first official announcement for running for president.  So, we had, everyone was coming to see the show.  Eventually, we were nominated like in seven categories.  We won nothing, of course.  But when we were there I remember people like Henry Fonda was there, and Ingrid Bergman.  And he was saying, he said, "That's real powerful stuff," you know.  You know, no one ever had ever seen what we had done.  The only person--Kyle Klerman [ph.], I don't know if you know him--said in his review of 'Ain't Supposed to Die,' that what should be done with it, it should be put in a space capsule and sent into the future, because the theater people now were not caught up enough to understand what they were seeing.  That was one review that I remember.  So, while--then we had one show; I will not name that show.  That was a rip-off of 'Ain't Supposed to Die,' just a rip-off show that they hailed as brilliant.  Of course, that was an integrated show.  So--
Speaker 1: Stop (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I shouldn't say that?
Speaker 1: No, I'm just kidding.  I thought I was--I was trying to be funny (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, no, that was absolutely true.  It was a total rip-off.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) By saying stop.
Story_ID: 261539
Speaker 1: 'Ain't Supposed to Die [a Natural Death,' Melvin Van Peebles] ended with kind of a stinging curse.  "I'll put my curse on you."
Speaker 2: Yeah, Minnie Gentry, who would put the curse--that was the final thing.  This woman would go around, she was at every scene picking up artifacts when people got killed or people got shot or something.  She would pick it up and put it in her homeless lady bag.  And at the end of the show, she would look out and she would put a curse on people.  And people, there were people who left the audience.  There were people who ran out the audience, and would cover up when she put the curse on them.  And the curse, it was called putting a curse on you, but it was like saying, I wish for you just what you wish for me.  I hope your daughters, you know, (unclear) rich old dudes and have limousines, too.  I just wish for you what you wish for me.  And people would leave the theater, and cover up.  Because it was not cursing anybody, it didn't name anybody.  It never said, "You," or named any race or creed.  It just said, I wish for you the same thing you wish for my children.  So--
Speaker 1: It sounds like America's worst nightmare.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 261540
Speaker 1: What [HistoryMaker] Melvin [Van Peebles] did at the beginning of the show ['Ain't Supposed to Die A Natural Death']--and it was not jazzed up or anything.  And we didn't do this when he started.  He would play 'The Star Spangled Banner' straight.  There was no--the band would play it, and there was no clowning around, no disrespect to it, just played 'The Star Spangled Banner' straight.  And it was such a time that by the time that was over the audience was fired up.  Because there were people who would not--we didn't tell anybody to stand.  Some people would stand, some people wouldn't stand.  Some people who were standing would want people to get up.  And some people who were sitting down were telling people to stand up.  So, it was a time in the history where that's all you had to do.  We didn't disrespect it.  It was played straight out, beat for beat, just played, and then the show started.  So even with that, we were in such a time that just playing it straight was a--
Speaker 2: It was a controversy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was controversial, about those who stood and those who didn't, and those who wanted people to do the other thing.  So it was, that was kind of the atmosphere of things at the time.
Speaker 2: That's powerful stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you ever have, did you ever get any verbal feedback from people about that?  About that closing scene, and the curse and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, it was always, even for people who watched it--you know, I mean Minnie Gentry was, you know just--by that time she was--whatever she was doing, it was frightening to be there.  You know, we were on stage, the whole cast was on stage when she would give the curse, and then we would move forward.  But it was chilling, even for us, where she would go with that curse every night.  There was one night where accidentally something went wrong in the building (laughter) and it started to leak.  You know, it was just an accident of nature.  And it happens just when she gave the curse (laughter).  Suddenly these little drops starting coming down, and I was saying oh, my goodness, she's brought forth a real demon (laughter).  But she was, people were really, a lot of people were really kind of scared, they would leave.  And that's the end of show.  I mean they'd seen everything, that's the end of it.  When she gives the curse, show over.
Story_ID: 261541
Speaker 1: Well, after 'Ain't Supposed to Die [a Natural Death,' Melvin Van Peebles] what did you do?
Speaker 2: I just did, I don't remember the sequence, but I did what actors do when they're not working.  You know, I started--when 'Ain't Supposed to Die' ended, it began my lifelong relationship with the unemployment office.  Because I no longer had my [New York] City [Department of Social Services] job, and so that wasn't there.  And you couldn't get unemployment if you worked for the city anyway, because there's no reason for you to be unemployed, because you have a job for life, essentially.  So I went to the unemployment office, you know.  And I'd saved, you know, tried to save while I was making some money, of course.  And I just went around looking for work, you know, auditioning.  I went away a couple, you know I went, I was at the Actors Theatre of Louisville [Kentucky] one year; I was at the Norfolk Stage Company [sic. Virginia Stage Company].  And I did work, did some plays around the city.  I worked down at New Federal [Theatre, New York, New York].  I just did what actors do.  You know, you go out auditioning and looking for work, trying to--you know, doing some extras on movies and on soaps, getting a little part on the soap opera here and there.
Speaker 1: Was it tougher than working for the city, you know, when you had your foot in a secure kind of place?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, I kind of expected what would happen.  I mean I had made up my mind to do that, and so I was, I was comfortable doing it.  And I was blessed really, because I kind of did work.  I kind of did get other jobs.  I worked, you know, I did work with Circle in the Square [Theatre, New York, New York], I did some plays there.  I did, you know, a couple of Broadway plays.  So, things were fine as far as that.  Even '[The] River Niger' [Joseph A. Walker] went to Broadway.  I worked at NEC [Negro Ensemble Company].  By that time I'd become kind of someone around town that they knew, kind of knew who you were.  Or, you know, not everyone knew you, but certainly within the black community, you know, people knew that you worked.  And I had something on my resume, so I just became a working actor, I guess.
Speaker 1: Did you, when was your, well, there's a number of plays on your resume here.  And I don't have dates next to them. I don't know if they're listed--
Speaker 2: Right, I don't remember these dates. But tell me the play, and I'll remember.
Speaker 1: But some of them are--you know, 'Mule Bone.'
Speaker 2: 'Mule Bone,' that was [produced by] the Lincoln Center [Theater].
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a collaboration between Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston.
Speaker 2: Hurston.  And [HistoryMaker] Michael [A.] Schultz, again, who was instrumental in finally getting that done.  It was written somewhere in the '40s [sic. 1930], I think.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And they fell out, and I think--
Speaker 2: They fell out, and they couldn't ever adjust it.  But George [H.] Bass, who was up at the, up at Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], was really trying; he worked very hard to get that done.  And he finally got it done and then passed away before the actual production went out.  But that was with Michael, back with Michal Schultz again.  I had a recurring thing--I think Michael Schultz also directed 'Car Wash' that I was in.  So, that was--
Speaker 1: Was that your first movie, I mean Hollywood type movie?
Speaker 2: That was my first Hollywood type movie.
Speaker 1: Now, this is '73 [1973] or so? 'Car Wash'?
Speaker 2: I guess so.  Yeah, it's still on all the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  Richard Pryor--
Speaker 2: Richard Pryor--
Speaker 1: The Pointer Sisters.
Speaker 2: Richard Pryor, the Pointer Sisters, yeah.  Garrett Morris was in that; Garrett and a lot of people were in that.
Speaker 1: A lot of people, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my first Hollywood movie when I went out to Hollywood.  So, Michael got me out there.  I was out there about eight and a half weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When was 'Mule Bone'?
Speaker 2: It was fairly recently.  It was, I'm bad on years.  'Mule Bone,' maybe it was ten years ago now.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, it wasn't that long ago?
Speaker 1: It wasn't that long ago, no.  And then Michael, again--did he direct 'Mule Bone'?  Yeah, he directed 'Mule Bone,' we were on Broadway.  It was a Lincoln Center production, but we were on Broadway with that.  I had, Marilyn Coleman was back in that one again.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, some of these--now, you've got 'Death of a Salesman' [Arthur Miller] and 'Design for Living' [Noel Coward].  I mean they were-- 'Design for Living,' I know was an old famous--
Speaker 1: It's an old Noel Coward play.  It's a Noel Coward play.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  And they made a movie out of it with Cary Grant [sic. Gary Cooper]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not Cary Grant, but--
Speaker 1: James Stewart.
Speaker 2: Gary Cooper.
Speaker 1: It was Gary Cooper?
Speaker 2: Gary Cooper.
Speaker 1: I thought it was James Stewart, but it may be Gary Cooper.
Speaker 2: Gary Cooper and another guy and a woman.  There's about three--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, 'Design for Living' and what's the other one?  'Death of a Salesman.'  It was done at Circle in the Square with George C. Scott, who directed it and played Willy Loman.  And he made the next door neighbors--I think it was Charley and Bernard--black.  So, you know, we were his neighborhood buddies.  I played his neighborhood buddy, Charley.  And we had--so we were black, the father and the son.  Chuck, Chuck Patterson played the son [Bernard].  And we had, it was a great cast.  We had Teresa Wright, Harvey Keitel, James Farentino.
Speaker 2: That's fairly recently too, I guess?  That's fairly recent?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's maybe fifteen years now.
Speaker 2: Okay, in the '80s [1980s], the late '80s [sic. 1975]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 261542
Speaker 1: --'The Iceman Cometh' [Eugene O'Neill] I did that at Circle in the Square [Theatre, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Now did you play the same role that your old teacher, Max [Maxwell Granville], played?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones played Hickey [Theodore Hickman] in this production.  So, I did that.  'Design for Living,' I thought 'Design for Living'--when they said that, I knew that was a Noel Coward play.  But in the description, it wasn't actually non-traditional casting at all.  In the description of the character who comes in act three, scene two, it says, "A comely black man," or "a comely colored man" or something like that.  So I guess in those days I was considered comely, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, I don't think he appears in the movie version.
Speaker 1: No, of course not.  Of course, he doesn't appear in the movie version, because black people don't play in movie versions.
Speaker 2: Do you think, did he appear on Broadway in the original play, do you think?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  Actually, the production of Circle in the Square was the longest that play ever ran anywhere.  It was banned in England, and I think it was shown here first.  Because what, the plot of the play is this woman who has two lovers.  And that was unspoken of.  So, the production I did--
Speaker 2: Now, these guys are roommates, too, from what I remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they know each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--
Speaker 1: She kind of jumps between the two of them.  So, they had an all-star cast.  They had Frank Langella, Raul Julia, Jill Clayburgh.  And you know, so it ran.  We had a longer run than any show, any place that play had ever run in its history, even though it was written sort of, almost fifty years before or something.  Because in England they banned it, and then they had a limited run here, because it was too risque for people to think that--
Speaker 2: I don't think they even showed--I saw the movie at Lincoln Center [for the Performing Arts, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: And I think that they--
Speaker 2: --the film festival.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think they scurried around the issue that she might have two lovers at the same time.  I was shocked myself (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you played the comely colored man.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You know, I was the waiter.  I came in and did my thing and left.
Speaker 2: But this is work, though.
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, it's work; it's great work.
Speaker 2: 'You Can't Take it With You' [George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart] that's another one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was on Broadway with Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst, and that was great.  The thing about that, for me, is I got to work with Rosetta LeNoire, and that's a whole experience in itself.  She's just a wonderful lady, who'd been doing this before I'd been doing it.  And she was the most, she was so full of life and energy, and had such a history and knowledge of theater.  I think, was it Bojangles [Bill Robinson] who was her godfather?  So, she had stories that--I could just listen to her all day long.  And so that was, that was a dream.  In addition to the job, it was just a dream being with Rosetta.  And what a wise and sharp lady she was, yeah.  So, I'm in love with her, so what can I say?
Story_ID: 261543
Speaker 1: What I was doing when we were going over these plays, I was trying to--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --get the smaller parts out of the way first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so that we could talk about 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' [August Wilson] and 'Joe Turner's Come and Gone' [August Wilson].
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have small parts in any of those shows you named, actually.
Speaker 1: Now, even the distinguished colored gentleman?
Speaker 2: Oh, in 'Design For Living' [Noel Coward].  Yeah, that was small, yeah, that was small.
Speaker 1: And 'Death of a Salesman,' [Arthur Miller] was that a pretty good part?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's a featured part.  He's Willy Loman's buddy, they're like neighbors.  And the boy's part, there's the son, as opposed to Willy Lohman's son in the play--Willy Loman's son doesn't live up to his expectations, and especially Biff [Loman] doesn't.  But whereas, the successful son [Bernard] is the neighbor's [Charley] son.  And so, what George C. Scott did, he made those, that family black.  And in our version the black guy was the more successful guy than the white son, the way it worked out.  I mean nothing like that was said in the play, they just cast it, he just cast it that way.
Story_ID: 261544
Speaker 1: In terms of how they came, I guess 'The River Niger' [Joseph A. Walker] would be first, before 'Ma Rainey,' ['Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,' August Wilson] right?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'River Niger' was first.  I think I just put that up.  Well, I took over for--Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] actually originated that role.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Douglas and Joseph [A.] Walker played in 'The River Niger.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'The River Niger.'
Speaker 1: It was a big hit, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was first done at the Negro Ensemble Company.  And then I think Douglas got it extended, it kept getting extended.  And when Douglas had to go away to fulfill his obligation he had made previously, I took over the role [of Johnny Williams] then.  Then when it went to Broadway he had to get out of it, he couldn't stay very long.  I don't know how long he stayed--a couple of months or whatever, and then I took over again.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw you play that role, you know, the lead role in that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's a great part.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: And it's a wonderful play.  And that was actually-[HistoryMaker] Barbara Ann Teer revived it maybe four or five years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, over at the National Black Theatre [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: The National Black Theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This play, Roxie Roker was in it.
Speaker 2: Roxie Roker and Les Roberts, and a lot of people came--[A.] Dean Irby, who's now up at the Purchase [College, Purchase, New York].  I think he works up there in the drama department.  And Frances Foster was in it.  So it was--it had a good run on Broadway.
Speaker 1: They even toured, I know they toured it for a while.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, they toured it all across the country.
Speaker 1: Now this was something new, you know, that a black drama would go on tour like this.  Unless I'm wrong, you know, correct me if I'm wrong.  But I think, you know, that was one, and 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men' [Lonne Elder III].
Speaker 2: 'Dark Old Men,' we went across with that.  But I think, you know, you have to go back before that.  I think maybe you have to go back to the tour, like, 'Anna Lucasta' [Philip Yordan] was one that went across the country.
Speaker 1: 'Or Raisin,' probably, '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].
Speaker 2: 'Raisin' of course, was the one before that one that went, that was there forever.  And both [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward and [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks were in that touring company.  So, that ran a long time on the road.
Story_ID: 261545
Speaker 1: What about 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men' [Lonne Elder III]?  Now, that's later on in the '70s [1970s], I think.
Speaker 2: That was done the second season of the Negro Ensemble Company.
Speaker 1: 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men?'
Speaker 2: The original production was--
Speaker 1: Oh, so that originally in 1969?
Speaker 2: Yeah, whatever the second year was.  That was the second play of the second year, 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  I got my chronology--
Speaker 2: No, well, it switches, because then it was--after it was done there, there was an independent production over at the Pocket Theatre [New York, New York].  And then it went, we went on tour.  And then people--that's a play that's been done all over the country, and actually we found out all over the world.  Because I remember Lonnie [Lonne Elder III] said it was done in some strange country, I don't know, Greece or Algeria or something.  And we wondered why it was done, and I guess the political thing and the separation was similar, even though it was not racially different.  But he had that play done in, a lot of foreign countries did 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' with their people.  I don't mean their company or anything, but with their actors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have you ever seen a black play performed by a European cast, you know, with white people in the roles?
Speaker 2: No, I can't say that I have (laughter).  No.  I did see, I directed a production of 'Fences' [August Wilson] up in Vermont.  And what was interesting, they had, it was a big thing where this was the first black play they had done I think with a black director and what not [at the Weston Playhouse, Weston, Vermont].  So, all the schools--they toured it.  So all the colleges and all came to see it, and we were doing scenes.  So this girls' college did a scene from 'Fences,' with women playing the parts.  And they had one guy in it who was--and it really was fascinating.  Because the play had--the scene they did hung together, even though there were women doing it.  And I guess that shows its good writing, and universal.  And they worked very hard on it, they learned their lines.  Their teacher was there.  And so it, it was kind of amazing.  And they were all white.  There were no--because in Vermont, when I got there they gave us a list of states.  It is actually like a 97 percent white state.
Speaker 1: And then there are some Indians [Native Americans].
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: And then there are some Indians.
Speaker 2: I guess so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Then you have--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But we didn't see them. The only black people I saw in that town were people who came up to watch the leaves change, because it's unbelievable beautiful.  It's like you're in a picture postcard up there.  But they were very, they were very nice to us, they treated us well.  People would invite us into their home and what not.  It was the first time in my life--you can imagine a kid in Harlem [New York, New York] going up where they didn't lock the front door where we stayed.  You know, they said, you know, this is where you're staying.  They had a nice room, and it was in the house.  And we said, "Well, where is the key?"  They said, "Key?  We don't lock the door," (laughter).  I had never lived in that environment, it was strange to me.  But it was good.
Speaker 1: This is, this is where you're supposed to die a natural death, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in western Vermont (laughter).  You know, that's where I slept for the first time with the door open.
Story_ID: 261546
Speaker 1: We mentioned 'Ceremonies [in Old Dark Men,' Lonne Elder III].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have anything to say about Lonne Elder [III]?
Speaker 2: You know, Lonne Elder, I met Lonne as an actor in the original production of 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].  We were Clem and Luke, the guys that opened the play.  We, in the original production we're the two guys that opened that play.  Many people forget that Lonne was also in the original cast of '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], he was Bobo.  So, that's, so I knew Lonne a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was actually an honor in a way, that by the time when we were going to do 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' I was asked to be in his play.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about August Wilson?  Now he kind of emerges in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], as a real force.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he still is a force, yeah.  I don't know, I mean I've met him and I know him to say hello to him.  I don't know him well.  I was in the, I was an understudy in the original production of 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' [August Wilson].  And so, I got, I didn't get to know him. You know I saw him because I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when they were already doing it.  I saw it when it was up at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]. So, he's somebody I've met but I can't say that I know him well.  I know him to speak to him and say hello.  But certainly, he is a force in the theater.  And he's finishing up his tenth play of The [Pittsburgh] Cycle.  They're doing it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Go ahead, finish.
Speaker 2: Oh, and then I did direct this production of 'Fences' [August Wilson] up in Vermont.  And I directed a production of 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' for the Classical Theatre of Harlem [New York, New York] two years ago, two or three years ago, before the Broadway production, before the second Broadway production.
Story_ID: 261547
Speaker 1: You received a Best Actor Award for 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men' [Lonne Elder III].  Now, is that your--
Speaker 2: And the revival.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The one that was done at the National Black Theatre [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You didn't say you were in it.  You didn't tell us that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, I was in--in this production at National Black Theatre, I played the other part [Mr. Williams Jenkins].  [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner [Ward]--I played the part that Doug played in the original production.  I played the buddy in the original production, and I played the lead role in the revival with [HistoryMaker] Barbara Ann Teer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, was that--now what award was that?  Was it Best Actor by--was it AUDELCO [Audience Development Committee, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: It was an AUDELCO award.  The AUDELCO awards are given for excellence in black theater.  And so they, it was done, I guess it's about thirty years now.  It's kind of an answer to other award shows that ignored black theater and black artists.  It's not just actors.  Its set designers, costume designers--smaller theaters that don't have the budgets, you know, to do the kinds of things that you can do--you don't have that kind of money--but to recognize that those theaters existed.  And they were professional, done by professional actors, as I discovered when I--we talked before about me going up to Maxwell Granville's thing above the church in Harlem [New York, New York] and finding people who knew as much about theater as the people I was paying a lot of money to work at downtown that was pretty much a white organization, or 99 percent white.  So, this, these awards were set up to kind of fill that gap, and to honor theaters and people who worked in the theater on all levels who were not being recognized by the general media.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you won a Best Supporting Actor Award for 'Joe Turner's Come and Gone,' [August Wilson] right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was from, at New Federal Theatre [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 261548
Speaker 1: I got a note here from--to ask you some more about Rosetta [LeNoire].  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, some more about Rosetta (laughter).  Rosetta, of course, I knew of her.  I just always knew of her, I don't remember when I didn't.  She was just a force in the theater.  She had her own theater, Amas [Musical Theatre, New York, New York], which is still in existence, which does musicals, I think mostly musicals, and that she's devoted herself to.  And I know one of the things that she always talked about, that she wanted to leave behind, was a Eubie Blake children's theater.  And she worked, she turned down a lot of jobs in California, in Hollywood because she wanted to be here to take care of her theater.  I think she did one series at some point, but it was really to get money for her theater.  And she was just totally committed to doing theater and doing integrated theatre.  It was important to her that it be integrated.  It was important to her to do new works.  And so, she was just a wealth of history, you know, to have somebody sit down and start talking about Bill ["Bojangles"] Robinson, you know, who was pretty much gone by the time I started.  I mean I saw his movies and was aware of him.  My father [Arthur French, Sr.] was always aware of him because my father liked to dance, and he certainly thought that Bill Robinson and Fred Astaire were the two greatest dancers he ever saw.
Speaker 1: How far back does Rosetta LeNoire go in terms of--
Speaker 2: I think Rosetta probably went back to the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That far.
Speaker 1: People like Charles Gibon [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because Rosetta, at the time we did it--even though you couldn't tell, to look at her, and you couldn't--but I was looking in her face, and she admitted to being in her eighties then.  And I didn't see any wrinkles, you know, wrinkles.  And if anybody had more energy than Rosetta, or was sharper--sharper in understanding what was going on, not just on stage, but in the politics of theater and who did what--you know, she, that's who Rosetta was, the Rosetta I knew.  And I mean I met her--I auditioned with her at Ellis Rabb, who put her in everything he possibly could, Ellis did.  And I auditioned in his apartment with Rosetta for the part in 'You Can't Take it With You' [George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart].  And when it was over, I think he spoke to Rosetta, and Rosetta said, "Oh, he'll be fine."  And he turned to me and he said, "Well, we'll contact your agent."  So, and later I found out that you had to--whoever he was going to cast in that part had to have Rosetta's seal of approval, so I felt very honored.  Because if she didn't want me in the play, I wasn't going to be in it, and he told me that afterwards.  That's the only reason I was there, because--so that was it.  So, I just fell in love with her then, and had a great relationship with her.
Speaker 1: And when did she leave us?
Speaker 2: Not long ago, I guess about five years ago, five or six years ago.
Speaker 1: About 2000 [sic. 2002]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But she had her faculties up until I last saw her, when she had the cane here.  And she was still sharp, she wasn't getting--but you know, she was probably about eighty-six, eighty-seven years old at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to interview [HistoryMaker] Gertrude [Hadley] Jeannette.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Gertrude's like ninety-two I think now.  That's an interesting lady that will take you back, take you way back.  I was there one day when she just decided to talk.  And that should have been filmed, you know.
Speaker 1: So we're going to give her some--write down some questions for us before you leave--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --so we can get some good ones.
Story_ID: 261549
Speaker 1: You were in 'Kinsey,' and I saw it, and I'm trying to remember what--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was just one of the people--when they interviewed people--you know, when they showed the people coming across talking about their experiences, I was the sharecropper talking about when I first experienced sex.  So, I say it's the one movie where I was talking about a subject that I don't know if I knew that much about (laughter).  But yeah, so that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You've been in a few of them.  You were in 'Crooklyn,' 'Malcolm X,' 'The Out-of-Towners,' ''Round Midnight,' 'Music of the Heart.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, 'Around Midnight' was good, because I got to meet Dexter Gordon.  And I think, you know, even that was just outstanding, you know, to meet him.  He knew a lot about acting, and then he acted before he went off to Europe and what not.  So that was, that was great.
Speaker 1: You've got 'Crooklyn' and 'Malcolm X,' two Spike Lee movies.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How was Spike Lee to work with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I met, actually I met Spike Lee because Spike Lee's sister [Joie Lee] was in 'Mule Bone' [Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston].  So I kind of met him previous to that.  And you know, he's been around for a while.  So, 'Crooklyn,' I was like in one scene in both of those movies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and then television shows, 'Law and Order,' '[Law and Order:] Criminal Intent.'  You're on that show now, right?
Speaker 2: I'm not a regular on the show, but I've done like I guess one 'Criminal Intent' and I think three or four 'Law and Orders.'
Speaker 1: '[Law and Order: Special] Victims Unit.'
Speaker 2: Yes, that was two specials, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had so many of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As we speak in 2005, 'Law and Order' rules television.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dick Wolf is doing fine.
Speaker 1: You've got--
Speaker 2: I didn't even put everything--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure you didn't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I had a little recurring role on 'Search for Tomorrow' for a while.
Speaker 1: That's a soap opera?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And on 'Another World.'
Speaker 1: Another World?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Two soap operas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I've been on them, you know, off and on.
Story_ID: 261550
Speaker 1: What do you like doing the best, of television, film and stage?  What do you like the best?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my basic training was for stage, and I did more stage.  Sort of, lately, I've done movies.  I kind of like them when I'm doing them, you know, they're different.  And you know, you learn as you do it.  They're just so different.  But I've kind of--you learn.  I learned--when I did 'Car Wash' I'd never done a featured part or a long running part in a movie until 'Car Wash.'  So I learned a lot doing that.  And you learn a lot if you're doing television, you know, if you're doing a soap opera, with the three cameras.  You begin to know which camera is on, and what not.  My first soap opera that I ever had a speaking part in--I'm just telling you this.  You can edit it out.  But I had a, I was a guard in the jail, you know.  And so my lines--I was under five, you know, times up, or something, so I got this little running part.  And so I rehearsed it, you know, and I timed it out, you know, because then it was live.  So, the sound--we were going--on the soundtrack, you had to open the thing.  I did everything fine, and when it came time to do it, I did everything good.  I opened it up and I said, you know, time's up, and I like closed the gate.  And at the end of it--they didn't do this in rehearsal.  They had that organ music (laughter).  So, all of a sudden I said, 'Okay, your time's up' (sounds).  (Laughter) The organist never came in until it was time to do it.  It was an older man who I became friends with.  And he, he just came in and, you know, he knew when to do the stuff.  But, you know, it kind of--I was lucky that the camera wasn't on me.  It was on one of the principal actors.  But it scared the life--I thought I had screwed up and they were, you know, giving me the--pulling me off the stage or something (laughter).  But that was my first--that's when you don't know.  You know, you're not knowing what's happening.  Now nothing is live, so you don't have to worry about it.  Nothing's live at all.
Story_ID: 261551
Speaker 1: Do you have any other stories, like, you know, from stage or film?
Speaker 2: No, I guess, you know, my NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] story is that--and I guess anybody that you may remember--maybe even Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] will tell you.  When we were in London [England], it was right after the assassinations here and all of that.  I think Enoch Powell was the guy, the prime minister [sic.].  He was really like a right-wing guy.  But their people, in the middle of a performance, started throwing down pamphlets.  We were at the [Royal] Strand Theatre [London, England], and they were throwing down pamphlets, and saying, you know, we hate civilization and stuff, right in the middle of a performance.
Speaker 1: Saying you hate--I mean it was--
Speaker 2: It was like, they said--they were saying that we were promoting hatred of white people, which it wasn't anything like that.
Speaker 1: You were doing 'Day of Absence,' [Douglas Turner Ward] right?
Speaker 2: We were doing 'Songs of the Lusitanian Bogey' [sic. 'Song of the Lusitanian Bogey,' Peter Weiss].
Speaker 1: Okay, 'Songs of the Lusitanian Bogey.'
Speaker 2: And so they starting throwing down pamphlets and interrupting--nobody in the audience knew, because they thought it was part of it, because it was very presentational.  And I just remember thinking at that time, because we were on stage and it was right after the assassination.  We were all out there, and I'm thinking that they were going to shoot us.  I mean it was a strange moment, and there were people on stage who were crying.  But we went on, and we finished the act.  Doug was there, and he came over and said that we didn't have to do the second act if we didn't want to, with this kind of--.  But we did it.  But it kind of focused--it was that moment when you're there and you sort of say, well maybe somebody's going to shoot, you know.  You're lit up, you know, you'd be a perfect target (laughter).  But we did go on, the whole company went on.  And I just thought--I don't know how brave I was.  But it wasn't out of bravery, it was just that we have to do this now.  It was kind of that moment of reality and life and the play all being one thing at the same time.  And we did go out and do the second act.  But I think that's the incident that will always stand out in my mind, of having that, and having just had the assassinations, and wondering if there's somebody up there.  And no one left, I mean nobody, we didn't panic.  People were angry and people were crying, but we went on.  And I think that's the one experience at NEC I will always remember.  And it was just enlightening, because then you say, oh, this is what this is all about; this is what we're talking about.  It's not--these people exist and what not.
Speaker 1: The moment of truth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, yeah.
Story_ID: 261552
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite role?
Speaker 2: You know, it's the role I'm doing now, whatever it is.  Because it's investigating and finding out about a new person, you know, or even revisiting.  You know, there were plays that I did like twenty-five or thirty years ago, you know, like 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men' [Lonne Elder III].  And I had played that part, and now you come to it at a later date.  When I first, in fact when it was first done, I was a man, a character, who was fifty-four years old in 'Ceremonies,' and has grown children.  And I was, you know, then I had little children.  So you kind of say, well, what does a man fifty-four do?  You know, how is he?  Does he function?  I remember thinking, you know, how do they walk?  What do they do?  You know, is there life at that age?  By the time I went back to do it again, I was thinking, do I remember what I did when I was fifty-four?  (Laughter) Do I remember?  Can I remember now what it was I did?'  So, you come at it, even if you do it again, from a totally new perspective, you know.  Because when I did it, by the time I did it again, I was actually a man with grown children.  And so, it wasn't about thinking about it.  You just, my experience--I had experienced what I had not experienced, of course, at the time I originally did it.  I always played a lot of older people, even when I was young.
Speaker 1: I was going to say that, I think that, you know, when you described the roles, it sounds like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You played Arthur in 'Happy Ending,' too, right?
Speaker 2: I took over for Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] in that, when Doug left.  But I always did.  I never kind of was the guy that got the girls somehow.  You know, I was always the buddy.  Or even when I was doing plays in Sunday school, I wasn't a professional actor, but I was always the father. You know, I was always the guy that was the father.  And you know, so I think people really think I'm about 100.  I'll tell you, this is an experience.  I met a man, I won't name him.  He was an actor, and he--I met him again and we were doing--.  He said, "You know," he said, "I remember years ago I did a show with your father."  I said, "With my father?"  I said, "I don't think so."  I said, "My father was not an actor."  I said, "That's not what he did."  And he said, "Yeah, but he was named Arthur French, and he was a black guy."  He said, "I don't know, he must have been related to you."  Then I realized afterwards that it was me that he had done a play with, like twenty-five years ago (laughter).  And I guess he assumed I was his age at that time.  So, I think what happens is that--that's one reason I don't say it.  Because people always say, "Gee, you look good."  You know, I say, "Yeah, I look good for ninety (laughter)."  But that's, so that's--I've always done--I don't know why that is.  But even in school or what not, I was always daddy or the postman.

Speaker 1: So what are you planning to do in the future?  Are you--
Speaker 2: Well, what I did last year, which tells me that I'm headed into senility--is that I actually produced a feature film, and I'm in the process of cutting it and putting it together now.  And I did it because my daughter [Antonia March] ended up doing a short film.  And I thought, after she did that, I thought--well I read the script and I called the playwright up.  He had won some award, and we had a reading of his play up at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] a couple years before.  And so I thought well, you know what?  I'll just call him and see.  He had three budgets.  One was like ten million, one was one million, and then a lower budget.  So he sent me the breakdown.  So, I immediately threw away the ten million and the one million dollar budgets.  And I ended up actually finishing it.  We're just working on finishing it up now.  So that's something I did.  And probably, I might do it again.  That was something I had never thought about doing until actually my daughter did a film that won awards, and stuff like that.  And I was kind of--
Speaker 1: Your daughter is a writer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she and her partner wrote this film that was on Showtime and what not, a short film called 'Move.'  And so I thought, well, listen, you know, maybe I should do it.  Maybe it's something I should talk about.  So, I did it.  So anyway, hopefully it will be out maybe by the end of the year.
Speaker 1: What's the name of it again?
Speaker 2: The name of the film I--'Bellclair Times.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Bellclair,' how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-E-L-L-C-L-A-I-R, Times. I hope I'm spelling it right.
Speaker 1: Bellclair Times.
Speaker 2: And the man who wrote it and directed it is Chriss Williams, C-H-R-I-S-S, Williams.  So, I think I may be producing another short film.  And you know, depending on the way things go, I might fool around with another feature if I get my nerves up for it.  So that's kind of a new--it's a new area, you know.  And I'm not in the film my daughter did, I'm not acting in it.  I have a part in this one.  So, that's kind of maybe what's down the line.  I do teach a class at HB Studios [HB Studio, New York, New York].  I don't know if I wrote that down.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: A scene study class once a week.  So, that's--the future--I guess that would be one of the things I'm considering in the future, of maybe going more into production.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause--
Speaker 2: And also I've been doing some, people are--I'm starting to do some directing.  So I guess maybe that might be the next phase.
Speaker 1: Do you enjoy directing?
Speaker 2: I do enjoy directing, I do enjoy it.  It's harder on you, only because--you know, if you're acting, you only really worry about--in the long run you're concerned with yourself and your relationship to the other people, of course.  But if you're directing, then you kind of have the overall view of it, of the whole story.  You start playing all the characters, dealing with all the characters--male, female, young, old.  And so it's a wider scope.  And of course if you direct film, then you control everything (laughter).
Story_ID: 261554
Speaker 1: You were talking about the theme of 'Bellclair Times.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's about passing, you say.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, essentially, it's a murder mystery.  There's a murder in the present that relates to a murder in the past.  And one of the things they discovered was that at one point, you know, white couples would kind of take in a light-skinned black baby, and that in the future, you know, that information either gets disappears or is found out, somebody finds out about it.  So essentially, the plot is there was a murder thirty-something years ago, and there's never been a murder since.  And now thirty years later there's another murder, and they of course, as you might guess, connect it--that's not giving anything away--and why it happened, you know, and why they were committing--the reasons for it.
Speaker 1: So, we kind of segued into a conversation about rumors of people passing--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in entertainment.  Recently Carol Channing said she was black, according to her family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that other people have--
Speaker 2: Well, there've been rumors about various people, and you don't know if it's true.  I know there was one person--I'm not going to name anybody.  But my mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] said that she knew about their family, and that they were certainly not--you know, they were certainly black people pretty much more than they were white people.  But you know, they, in order to get by in the industry, the people who gave the children up actually thought they were doing the children a favor.  Because they would get a better life, they would have better opportunities; they could go further in the world.  Even this movie, 'The Human Stain' dealt with that issue of, it's better in the white world.  You know, you can go further, you can go places--you can--especially in that time, if we flash back thirty or forty years.  You could places you couldn't go.  You could go in a store and shop, which you couldn't do up in the '60s [1960s].  There were stores in the South where you couldn't try on anything.  So, if no more than that, you could go in and try on a dress.  You couldn't try it on if you were black.  And that's in the '60s [1960s] that I know of that.  So, it deals with those kinds of things--that people would try move into what they felt was a better world, and what they felt would give them greater opportunities.  So I don't--and I guess the people who gave them up felt that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean this was not anything that was forced.  These were not kidnappings, these were just kind of business deals.  They would get paid, but essentially they felt they were doing something good.
Story_ID: 261555
Speaker 1: Do you have a philosophy of acting?  How do you, you know, how do you approach it?
Speaker 2: I think, I guess my teaching was in the method I guess, in order to give it a name.  And so I did all those exercises--you know, effective memory, sense memory, and things that [Lee] Strasberg brought in; things that [Konstantin] Stanislavski talked about.  Actually, Stanislavski influenced Strasberg, who had no interest in theater until he saw the Moscow Art Theatre.  So, I guess that would be to try and find the truth in the character.  Who is this person?  How does that person think, breathe, act, eat, sleep, that's different from the way you are?  What makes them that specific individual that's different from any other person in the world?  And to try to find what that is--whether emotionally, philosophically, and physically.  What does that person want?  What does that person need in order to get by?  What are they trying to do when we meet them?  You have to create the life--in other words you meet a character, and the character is whatever, forty years old.  Well, what in the heck has that character been doing up to now?  You know, what's their education?  What have they done?  Are they married?  What is their work?  Did they go to school, or did they not go to school?  What are their goals in life?  So, I think the emotional part of that, of using your own personal experience, which is kind of what people talk about with method acting, which is to experience rather than pretend.  You know, I'm crying, I'm sad, but to really find within you, what is it that makes you sad?  What is it that makes you happy?  What makes, what really makes you angry?  Not just to say I'm mad at you, and not have anything truly behind it--just kind of making a face, or saying a bad word that is indicating an emotion or a feeling that you really don't have.  What do you have to do or invest in order to really be angry, but still be in control of what you're doing?  So, I don't--the stuff about mumbling, that doesn't--I mean that's just something people made up.  I never heard Marlon Brando or the people they're talking about, I never heard him mumble anything doing [William] Shakespeare.  So I think it's just something that demanded more naturalistic acting.  So, you know, historically when people wrote plays, it was all about gods in the beginning.  And as they began to write about people, then you have to find the truth of that.  I can't--you know, because we know people.  You know, who knows how Thor or any of these people did was okay, because nobody heard them.  But you hear the guy on the corner.  You know the postman.  You know what it is if you see a father with his child.  You know that.  So, if that's truthful, then the other things--then the play becomes, or the movie becomes truthful, or the person becomes a human being with emotions and feelings and fears and faults, and all of that.  So you try to find that person with your techniques, with your searching, and say, well how is this person--what in my life is like that person I'm trying to be?  What makes me angry?  What is it that makes me angry, not a pretend anger, and how can I find it here in this environment?  And also, to be aware of your surroundings.  You know, it's always a set, especially if it's a play.  In a movie, you can go on location.  But if I'm out in the park and it's a set, and where I am in a theater enclosed--you know, so you've got to get a sense of reality.  Well, is the sun shining?  You know, am I warm or am I cold?  Am I, you know, how do I feel?  What do I physically feel, in addition to what my mental state is?
Story_ID: 261556
Speaker 1: I know in the '70s [1970s] it was debated in the black intellectual publications like Black World, the former Negro Digest, The Black Scholar, it was talked about--and in other publications--it was discussed whether or not there's a black aesthetic.  And I was wondering if you as an actor know of--is there any distinct contribution or aesthetic to black acting, I mean in black theater?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't, I don't know how to answer that.  I think you have to be truthful as an actor, whatever color you are.  I think what black people bring to it is what we have as our experience, of our lives, and what we've experienced as an individual and as people in general.  We've talked about some of that today, about our exclusion about a lot of things.  So, I don't know that there's a general aesthetic that all black people bring to anything that's outside of our color.  I think we want to find the truth of who we are, since very often we look on the screen and we see a play, or we see a movie or something with black people in them on a television show, and we know we've never seen anybody like that.  We know we don't know any black people that do or say things like that.  We know that those words never came out of a black person's mouth.  Really, you know, somebody wrote it for them.  So, I don't know that there's an overall aesthetic, except hopefully to do as truthful and as good a work, and to represent black people as they are--good, bad, or indifferent--not to make--you know, suddenly we're all angels.  But to say, this is how these people work; this is what happened here.  And we're not being excluded or we're not having people in paint, and in all kinds of--you know, the horrible black people in '[The] Birth of a Nation' were done by white actors.  So, and we have the switch.  You know, if you talk about it as in the past--but in, what is it, 'Cold Mountain?'  Was that the movie?
Speaker 1: 'Cold Mountain,' right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the character that won the Academy Award, Renee Zellweger, plays a black character--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in the book ['Cold Mountain,' Charles Frazier].
Speaker 1: We were discussing that on the break, too.
Speaker 2: That's a black character.
Speaker 1: In the book she was black, right?
Speaker 2: She was black in the book.  But in the movie, she can't be black.  That, that's not in the past, that's not in the '20s [1920s].  That's in the '90s [sic. 2003].
Speaker 1: She could have been, but they decided not to--
Speaker 2: Well, if a character--if a playwright, if a writer in a novel writes a character as a black character, why, when we go to film is that character now a white character?  So, we're not talking about 'Birth of a Nation' now.  We're talking about--and that might be the 21st century.  I don't know exactly when that was shot, but it probably was shot in 2000 or 2001.  And we have a, it's a strong black character.  So, Renee Zellweger was wonderful in the role, she's a wonderful actress.  But in the book, the woman was black.  So how do you--?  So we still have a long way to go in having true representation in these things.  And that's a small, that's just a recent example.  But if you investigate any of these things, it's in lots and lots of things, especially historical things.
Speaker 1: We were discussing '[The] Last of the Mohicans,' where the colonel's, one of the colonel's daughters is black, or descendant of a West Indian mother.  And that's not--they're both white girls in the movie.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, there we go (laughter).
Story_ID: 261557
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The community in general?  I would think maybe more involvement in all areas--in political areas, if we can.  In the arts, in business.  Just to, I think it's important just to get in there some way, because there are places that we're still not yet.  So I don't know if I could say--I think it's better than it was when I started.  I know it's certainly better than when the people who started before me had it.  But there's still areas, areas where you see--you look at television.  And I had a young man call me.  Maybe this will answer your question.  He was saying, well, you know, he wanted to talk about--we were talking about 'Amos 'n' Andy' and you know, those shows.  And I told him I thought 'Amos 'n' Andy' was a militant show compared to most black shows today.  Because we still have the clowns.  We still have, you know, shows where people do things that, you know, might make Amos and Andy blush.  They're done on a higher level, we're more visible, but a lot of what we're visible in is not any different or as good.  'Amos 'n' Andy' was funny.  If nothing else, they were one of the funniest sitcoms ever in the history of television.  So, I think we have to be aware of that, whether we're making a lot of money--which I don't blame anybody.  Make as much money as you can.  I'm not one of those people that has turned money down.  But hopefully I have integrity, enough to at least be a true representative, rather than knowing well I can make another million dollars.  "If I talk like this, and I grin and I smile, I know I'm gonna get on, ain't I right, brother."  You know, so you do that and make a lot of money.  But that's, that's not even on the level of 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  So I think we have to be careful of being very happy.  I'm happy about people who make millions of dollars; I would not turn down a million dollars.  But to have that in mind, of what happens with these images we send out.  And that would be what I would hope for in all areas, that we don't become--you know, clowns and politics, for instance, you know, where you know, where you know, you're like--you know there's somebody behind them.  So that would be my hope, just to--for that.  And I hope for my children to have a bigger voice and to speak out on what they need.  Because it's their world, essentially now.  So I think that's where--that would be what I would wish.  So what I would turn on, I would like to laugh at a sitcom, and not have a laugh come because somebody says, "Yo, Bro."  You know, that's black, that's what we--you know, we have a lot of that.  And I think we can have comedy, and we can laugh, and we can have a good time without reverting to what is going to please.  You know, I mean, and I think it's a hard choice, to say am I going to do what's going to please this man who's going to pay me this million dollars, or am I going to do what I know is right?  And it's a hard choice.  And I don't blame people who make the choice to make millions of dollars.  I just, I guess, you know, I don't blame them and I think they should go ahead.  But I think they should just maybe think about it.
Story_ID: 261558
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything that you've done up to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No.  Only because I never expected to get to a point where someone like you would want to interview me.  It has gone far beyond what I could ever have dreamed about in terms of the things I've done, and the people I've met, the places I've been, and the fact that I've actually been able to have a family and support a family doing this.  It was not something--that's why I kept my job all that time, because I never even wrote it on tax returns--you know, that I was an actor or something.  So, to be blessed, because there are many talented people.  There are many people who are multi-talented, and brilliant people--who for whatever reason, because of whatever you want to call it--chance, fate, karma, belief, trust, God--don't manage to do that.  And if you do do it--I just consider myself fortunate.  But it was nothing I would have done differently.  I've just had a great ride.  I still enjoy everything I do.  I enjoy the next challenge.  I enjoy the new, you know, the thing of being new at something, like doing a movie, or saying okay this is as crazy as leaving a job that you're set for for life to pursue something that you're not set for anything.  But why not?  You know, why not?  And see what happens.
Story_ID: 261559
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back over your life up to this point, what would you consider at this juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  I think--the thing I thought about--I always wanted to have a family.  I mean growing up, you know, even when you hit those years where the guys say, hey, you know, "why get a cow when you can buy the milk" and--.  People were telling me, I ain't going to get married.  I always wanted to get married.  I always had it in my head that I wanted to get married.  I always wanted to have children.  And what I always wanted, I would hope that my children, I would leave them something to be proud of--that they could say, you know, my father did something in the time he was here.  You know, besides just eating and sleeping and dying or something, there would be something, you know, that would be left behind.  Maybe some student in the future will look and research one of these plays, you know, and say, "Who is this guy?"  You know, I think--that's all.  I think, I always wanted to leave something that my children [Arthur French III and Antonia March], and now my grandchildren, can be proud of and say that's what he did when he was here.  As he passed this way, he left a little something behind for them and for anybody else.  One of the things--I hear stories often of people, young people, who come up and say, "Well, you know, I wasn't going to do this until I saw this play.  I wasn't going to be, I wasn't going to go into the theater.  But I saw this play, I saw this movie."  And it always amazes me to think, well, you do affect peoples' lives doing this.  You do affect their lives in some way that you don't even know.  You make them think about it, just as people affected my life that I wasn't aware of, you know, seeing people and saying, oh, you know, that guy can do it.  Here's a guy, you know, he's just a guy.  I see him on the subway and you know, he's just an ordinary guy.  And he's able to do this and make a difference.  So I would hope that the legacy--as myself, and part of being with the Negro Ensemble Company.  And I've been in plays that are now classic plays, you know, that I didn't think about at the time, saying, I'm going to do a classic play.  I was glad to have a job, and to get a paycheck at the end of the week.  But that would be, if there's such a thing as a legacy, I would, like--that they can, that my daughter can look at her grandchildren--her children, my grandchildren--and say you know, that's your grandpa, that's what he did.
Story_ID: 261560
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Ursilla Ollivierre French] get a chance to see you become a successful actor?  I mean as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  My mother, I found this out about my mother.  You know, you never know what your parents--they always have those little secrets.  And my mother was a very quiet woman, you know, and she worked very hard, especially when my father [Arthur French, Sr.] was ill and then he passed away.  And she, she said to me at one point when I was doing this, and I was telling her--and she always encouraged me.  Both my parents always encouraged me, and they always told me that I could be successful in anything I wanted to do.  So, somehow I'm not bragging, but I'm kind of, I just kind of accepted that as a fact.  And one day she said, I'm going to come and see if you're wasting your time doing this.  I'm going to come.  But she told me a story about herself, that I had never, would never have believed.  She said that when she was a young woman, she'd auditioned for something.  And this alone stopped me cold in my tracks, because I couldn't even imagine her doing that.  And she said she got a callback.  She was, it some dancing thing or something.  And my mouth was open, because I couldn't even picture my mother doing that.  And she said when she told her family, her family said, "Dancing in some kind of show?  Only whores do that.  Only lowlife people do that."  And she never went back to this callback.  So she said to me, "I don't know--."  She said, "I don't know if I could have been Lena Horne, or maybe the man just liked my legs or wanted a date."  She said, "But I don't know."  She says, "But you need to find out, either way."  So that was--mothers always surprise you.  And remember I said--going back to method and stuff.  And when I first started doing, you know, learning about effective memory, how you go into your past, and sense memory and all of that.  So I came home one day and I said, "Mother, listen, listen.  Do you know how those actors get to be angry and how they, you know, they do these emotional things?  Because I never could figure--."  That was what I couldn't figure out when I watched television, how they could do those things and convince you.  I said, "Do you know how they do that?"  And she said, "Well, I guess they would think about a time, you know, in their past, when they felt that way.  And that's how they would do it."  So, again, you know, my mother stumped me.  And I said, "How could you know that?  I mean I just learned that in class."  And she said, "Well, how else would you do it?"  So, I just tell those mother stories, you know, how wise she really was, and how little I knew about life and how much she knew.  But I must say, if anything, I think I always wanted to be a good parent, because I think my parents were good parents.  They were parents who always encouraged me, whether I was--yes, I had strict discipline, but it didn't do me any harm.  You know, I'm not, I never was scarred by it.  I never was beat up, or there was--you know, it was because I did something wrong.  You know, it was not done in any terrible way.
Story_ID: 261561
Speaker 1: I try to instill in my children [Arthur French III and Antonia March] the fact that you can do what you want to do, and you need to go ahead and do it, no matter what anybody says, and no matter what misinformation you have.  I had misinformation--you talk about misinformation.  A kid called me one time, they were teaching him about John Brown.  And they told him that John Brown was black.  And when my daughter brought this home I said, "Come on, the teacher never told you this."  I said, "John Brown was not a black man."  And she said, "Yes, they did."  I said, "No, they didn't."  And sure enough she went back to school, and the teacher had been teaching them that.  And this was a private school.  Because I guess she figured anyone that would be opposed to the institution of slavery had to be black.  This is, this is not in the past.  So I went and I got books and mimeographs and stuff, and I sent it to school.  And I got a big apology.  And they were unaware.  So these are the things that, you know, the people are teaching us.  So I think, getting back to parenting, I thank my parents [Ursilla Ollivierre French and Arthur French, Sr.] for instilling--whether it's true or not, that you can succeed at whatever you want to do, that you have to go after what you want, and that you can accomplish it if you want to.  But then, and you have to fight sometimes.  You have to fight within a system, to get what you want.  So that's, I guess I'm rambling on, but that's kind of how I feel about it.  And to have--when the city--you talked about working for the city [New York, New York].  But in the city, the thing that I liked about it is you would get promoted if you could pass those exams.  Now, I had a job in the city where the person in the other boroughs was doing what I was doing.  I was working in Domestic Relations Court [New York City Family Court] and was getting, I was kind of provisional, on the next level.  You could get a provisional appointment, but this was by someone saying that you were doing the work and you should get the job.  And I was doing the same job in the Bronx [New York, New York].  So, my supervisor put in that I should get a provisional raise based on that.  Now I went, I went down to city hall, the then controller was Abe Beame [Abraham Beame] before he was mayor.  And I never did get that provisional appointment, I never did.  But what was the difference?  Well, because they weren't doing that.  I wasn't in, and I wasn't the right anything.  But so you have to just go; you have to just have the qualifications.  Of course, then would I get, you know, promoted, you know, what do you do?  So, they had to just deal with that.  But I think you had to, I had to do that on my own.  If I didn't pass those exams, I would have been right down--where people who had less experience were making more money.  So that's one of those things that you find throughout everything--where the black actors are getting one salary and the white actors are getting another salary.  I once did a show where I had like a little scene or something.  It was a good part, you know, a leading part.  And this young white actor was there, and he was kind of like a nice kid.  You know, he said, "Oh, man, you know, this is good."  He was a good kid.  But then you look--I happened to see the contract.  And of course, he was making twice as much as I was, because you have that--they didn't want to give--you know, even there you have to fight.  So, that's it.  You know, I'm just rambling on about those kinds of things that you always have to be aware of, and always be ready to fight for them.  So, and always believe that you can do these things.  You know, you can be successful at what you're doing, and not listen to my great advisors, or even my daughter's [Antonia March] little advisor, telling her, you know, to study--you know, to go and be a cook for her daughter, which is essentially what that is, rather than go ahead and be--because communications was too hard for her.  So, this is a generation later, and she's telling her to go into--that communications is too hard for her, the same way it was for me to go into science school, which was too hard for me.  It never ends.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is there anything we haven't asked you that you think you need to address before I ask the last question?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, the last question.  You know, maybe I ought to just run out of the room.
Speaker 2: It's not the last question ever, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.  No, I don't really think I have any big statement to make, except to say that I really confess every day that I have been blessed to be here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  (Unclear) people.  I guess I'd like to just be remembered as, I'd like to be remembered that I was from Harlem [New York, New York].  Because Harlem people have a bad connotation about it, or you know, they think everyone who comes out of here is--you know, it has a negative--so, I think I'd like to known as the kind of kid who grew up in Harlem, who managed to do all right and do good in the world, and not, you know, managed to get through this without being institutionalized for whatever reason (laughter).  But I think that's what, you know, just to be remembered as a person--and you know, I did the best--I don't think I've harmed anyone, at least not deliberately harmed anyone.  To live essentially what I was taught, a kind of Christian life, even though I don't go to church every day, if they remember me at all (laughter).  But I would hope, you know, that they'd move on with their lives, and if they remember me, remember me as somebody who at least tried to do something, whether I succeeded or not is another thing.
