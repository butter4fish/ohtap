Dorothy R. Robinson:
This is November 29, 1979. I'm at Natchitoches, Louisiana, in the company of Mr. Tom Whitehead of Northwestern University in Louisiana, and I'm realizing a great dream of my life—I'm sitting next to Mrs. Clementine Hunter, known as the "Black Grandma Moses." It is a delight to visit with Mrs. Hunter, and I'm hoping that, as a result of this visit, we shall have a permanent record of some of the fascinating experiences that this great artist has produced and is now sharing with the public.
Mrs. Hunter, I'd like to know something about your early childhood. Will you share some of your early experiences, tell us about your parents, your grandparents—if you remember that—how old they were, how long they lived, and that kind of thing. Just whatever you want to say about it. I assure you, it will be of interest to everybody who reads it.
Well, my grandmother, she was 110 when she passed, and my grandfather, well, I don't know exactly how old he was, because he got killed. He fell off a roof of a store, and he got killed. But she was 110.
Did you have other sisters and brothers?
Yes, I had other sisters, four sisters, and they're all dead but one.
So you have a sister living now? Where does she live?
Clementine Hunter: Dorothy R. Robinson: Clementine Hunter:
In Alexandria. She lives in Alexandria. Did you have brothers?
Oh yes, I had about seven brothers, and every one of 'em dead.

lot more, but I don't know all of them, but I got 'em, got a lot of them.
DRR: I suppose you have great-grandchildren.

DRR: When you were in Catholic school, were there certain things you had to regard, like eating meat—could you eat meat any day?
* Tom Whitehead﻿3

Where would you go when you'd...
In the road, and sit down until the school out.
DRR: What did your mother say when you'd get home?
Well, she thought I went to school, until she found out. When she found out, what did she do? CH: She found out when the other children told her. DRR: What did she do?
She whipped me and send me back to school, but that didn't do no good.
When you quit school, then what kind of work did you do? After you stopped going to school.
CH:	Pick cotton. DRR: Did you like to pick cotton?
CH:	I liked to pick cotton.
DRR:	How much could you pick?

DRR:	Was that a Saturday night dance?
CH:	It was a Saturday night dance.
DRR:	Did you fall in love with him when you first met him?
CH:	No, not when I first met him.
DRR:	I guess he had to court you pretty ardently to get you to say yes.
CH:	Yeah, that's right.
DRR:	Do you remember where you were when he asked you to marry him?
CH:	To the dance, to the dance.
DRR:	Did he ask you that first night?

DRR: I see. Mrs. Clementine, you've lived in Louisiana all of your life.
CH: All of my life.
DRR: How do you feel about relations between white people and black people?
It seems you and Mr. Whitehead and Dr. Bailey* have a very good friendship. Do you think that's generally the case in Louisiana? Do you have many white friends?
CH: I got a lot of them.
DRR: Do many of the black people have white friends?
CH: Well, I don't know about that, but I know I have.
DRR: Well, that is great. Well, tell me this one things You've heard a lot
about the civil rights movement and women's lib and all of the marching and whatnot, and the integration of schools. Do you have any thought about that kind of thing?
CH; No, not too much.
DRR; What do you think about the women's lib? Do you think women have enough liberty, as we live now? Would you change anything?
CH; Well, I don't know how might we change. I don't know.
DRR: But, as it stands, you're pretty happy now.
Dr. Mildred Bailey﻿6

DRR:	What do you think about the condition that the country is in now, with
the hostages over in Iran—do you listen to that on your radio sometimes?
CH: Sometime.
DRR: What do you think about that? Do you think Mr. Carter's done a pretty good job?
CH: Well, I think so. I don't know. I got to look over that.
DRR: I know what you mean. I think he hardly knows either. He's in a tough spot. [laughter]
CH: 'Cause I sure had to look over that.
DRR: Do you belong to any other organization...any organizations like lodges,
or anything besides the church? You belong to Eastern Star or some of those organizations?
CH: No.
DRR: When you were younger, did you...
CH: No.
DRR: You have earned so many honors with your paintings—how did you first start painting? How did people learn about your skill and___
CH; Well, I just start with a little piece of cardboard, just any kind of old paper. That's the way I start.
DRR:	How old were you then?
CH:	Oh, I had three children.
DRR:	When you first started to paint?
CH:	Yeah.
DRR:	What did you paint with? Did you have oils then?
CH:	Oil.﻿7
DRR: How did you get your first oils? CH: Well, they give it to me. DRR: Who gave it to you?
CH: One lady—they call her Miss Alberta? She paint, and she'd come to the
Big House 'n' paint magnolias, and when she would go home, she'd leave me some paint. I never did buy no paint.
DRR: Now you say s.he came to the Big House. What was the Big House?
CH:	Yonder where I was cooking at.
DRR: Did that house have a name?
CH:	We called it the Big House—Melrose Plantation, that's what it is.
DRR: Melrose Plantation. I think I heard you say something about the African House, and I believe you painted something about the African House.
CH:	Yes, the African House is there, is on the place.
DRR:	Was that where the servants lived?
CH:	That's what they told me. I don't know. I wasn't there in them times.
DRR:	Where did you live? In the big house?
CH:	Unh unh. On the place.
DRR:	Do you still go to Melrose sometimes?
CH:	Yeah, I go every October.
DRR:	Well, that was how you started to painting—the lady gave you the paints. Now, when did the public begin to recognize you?
CH: Oh, I don't know. I just painted and give 'em away, I just give the pictures away. I never tried to sell none.
DRR: You just gave the beautiful pictures away?
CH: Just give 'em... I gave 'em away.
DRR? How did you finally decide to sell some, or how did you learn that you could sell some?
CH; Oh well, somebody would come down and ask me if I wanted to sell one, or I'd sell them for twenty-five cents, and the highest one was fifty.
DRR: Oh, Mrs. Clementine. *
Alberta Kinsey﻿8
CH: Yeah, that's all.
DRR: Now, this is a very personal question that I'm going to ask now. If
you don't want to answer it, you could just tell me, "Dorothy, it's none of your business." [laughter] But would you mind telling us the highest amount you've ever received for a picture? Now, I'm thinking about you started with twenty-five cents, and now certainly you get much more than that. Would you...
CH: A hundred and fifty.
DRR: That is beautiful.
CH: That's all I get.
DRR: You've seen quite a change, then, haven't you?
CH: Yeah.
DRR: Did you enjoy it at first when people'd come in to see you? Like I just breezed in here today wanting to see you, Mrs. Clementine Hunter. Did that worry you when people first started to come to see you?
CH: When they first started, yeah, I was kinda worried. I didn't much want to mess with them, but now I don't.
DRR: No, you're a very gracious hostess, and a wonderful interviewee. I want you to know that, and I'm so glad you're letting me talk to you.
CH: 'Cause it don't worry me, no.
DRR: You've mentioned that you have grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I
hear so many people say young people are worse now than they used to be, that they are bad, and that they do bad things. Do you agree with that, or do you disagree?
CH:	No, I don't.
DRR;	You think they're as nice as we were when we were kids, huh? Or better?
CH:	Not now.
DRR:	Not now?
CH:	No. [laughs]
DRR:	You think they're worse than they used to be?
CH:	Yeah, they're worse than they used to be, I'll just tell you straight.
DRR:	Well, why do you think they're...﻿9
CH: Well, 'cause they don't... I don't want to go out, that's why I don't go nowhere, 'cause I don't fool around young people, and I don't like the way they do. They cuss, they drink, they do everything, and...
DRR: I know what you mean.
CH: And that's something that I don't like and I don't fool around them.
DRR: Why do you think young people are worse than they used to be? Do you think parents have stopped raising them...
CH: No, they ain't raising them like they used to do, they ain't raising nohow. They ain't raised like they used to, not when I come up.
DRR: How did you come up?
CH: I come up just hard, and they made me do what now they don't make the children do. They let 'em just grow up, that's all they're doing. They're just growing up their self. And they don't want to whip 'em, they don't want to do nothing to 'em, just let 'em grow. If it wasn't for the Lord, none of 'em, tfeey couldn't raise none, none of 'em.
DRR: Well, thank you for that. Now let's get back to your pictures. I
notice you do a great deal of painting of cotton-picking scenes. And you've told us that you picked cotton, and that you liked to pick cotton. Do people still pick cotton around here? Have you noticed a change in that?
CH: Just some times.
DRR: How do they gather the cotton here now?
CH; With the cotton pickers.
DRR; With the cotton pickers.
CH: Yeah.
DRR: Are there many young people around who would like to work and cannot find work?
CH: Some of 'em work a little while and quit and walk the road.
DRR: Do you think they could find work if they wanted...
CH: They could find work if they want, but they don't want none. Some of 'em don't want no work.
DRR: How do they make a living? How do they get along?
CH: Just walking the road, I guess. 'Cause I know I got to work, old as I is.﻿10
DRR: I know what you mean.
CH: I got to work. They don't work. They walk. Then they work a day and take that and go drink it up and that's all.
DRR: I see what you mean. I believe you painted some pictures of Martin Luther King?
CH: No.
DRR: You didn't ever see him, but you admired him a great deal, I guess.
CH: I saw his pictures.
DRR: You saw his pictures. Did you think of him as a very fine person?
CH: Well, I think he's all right.
DRR: What about___ I believe I saw a picture of John Kennedy? Did I?
President Kennedy?
CH: I don't know. I don't believe I got it now. [pause] Oh yes, that's it.
DRR: I gather you admired him a great deal, you liked him a great deal?
CH: Yeah, I liked him all right.
DRR: If you were to pick out a person that you, that would be your hero, or somebody that you think is one of the very, very fine Americans, who would you name?
CH: Well, I don't know. I can't tell you that today. 'Cause I don't know I can...
DRR: Could you tell me some woman that you admire very much? Above most?
CH: Unh unh.
DRR: Well, I could tell you one I admire—Clementine Hunter.
CH: Yeah, maybe. [laughs]
DRR: You're one of the best. I understand that at one time in this state
there was strict segregation or caste between dark-skinned Negroes and light-skinned Negroes. If you remember anything of that sort, do you want to comment on it? How was the difference made? What is it that the black...dark-skinned Negroes did not enjoy that the light-skinned Negroes enjoyed? Could you tell us something about that? If you had any experience.
CH: Well, the light one didn't like the black one. That's all I know. And
right now, there's some of them don't like the black one, and some of them﻿11
CH: (cont.) don't like the light one. And now they're getting so they're liking the black and the light, all of them together.
DRR: And I suspect that's the way it ought to be, because God made...
CH: It's ought to be, yeah, 'cause God made us, and there ain't but one God. He made white and black, 'cause some of us white, and some of us black. But them light ones is making the different with the black. But you see, now, look like they done change it. They ain't making no different. They got 'em all the same.
DRR: Yes. Now, back when they made a difference, how did they show it? Would the light ones refuse to marry the black ones...
CH: They wouldn't marry the black one.
"DRR: What would a mother do if her daughter was going with a black man?
CH: Well, I don't know, she might would kill her, all right.
DRR: You think it might have been just that bad, huh?
CH: Yeah. They didn't like it, but now they don't mind.
DRR: I see. What would you say has been a great influence in your life? Would you say your painting, your friends, or the church, or your parents, or just what? What influenced you, what made you Clementine Hunter that you are?
CH: Well, the church, and the people, my people. I got---had feeling for my
people, and I prayed for them, and I'm praying for 'em till yet. I'm trying to make heaven my home, that's what I do.
DRR: A beautiful statement. If you wanted to give a bit of advice to your great-granddaughter over there, how would you tell her to live? What would you tell her?
CH: I'd tell her, the church. Go to church and go to school to learn something. And don't forget the church and her prayers at night. That's what I try to teach her.
DRR: What is your hope for her? I don't mean now that you want her to be a painter or a teacher or a nurse, but what would you hope for her?
CH: Well, I don't know. I hope she'd be something to help herself, a teacher or something. Something or other.
DRR: That's a beautiful expression.
CH: I wish she would.
DRR: When do you intend to stop painting? Let's go back to painting again.﻿12
CH: I'm thinking to stop now.
DRR: What do you mean, today? [laughter] You're not going to stop today, are you?
CH: No, not today, but I don't know. I'm getting kinda worried that way.
DRR: What do you mean? Your hands get tired, your mind gets tired...
CH: No, my hands don't get tired, but I got	arthritis in my hands, and they
hurt. I even can't sew. And some days	I can paint, and some days I can't.
DRR: What time of day do you usually paint?	When do you paint?
CH: Some time in the morning, when I get up I start painting, and then I ■quit till the next day.
DRR: What time do you go to bed?
CH: I go to bed about ten o'clock sometime.
DRR: I understand that your paintings are exhibited in various galleries and museums about the country. Have you ever gone to New Orleans or to some place to see your pictures on exhibit?
CH: Before you get through talking, I just tell you, I don't go.
DRR: You don't want to go.
CH: Don't want to go, and I ain't goin'.
DRR: Well, when somebody comes and says, "I read something about your paintings," do you want them to read it to you to see what was said about your pictures?
CH: They can read it if they want.
DRR: But I mean, do you want them to read it to you?
CH: Yeah, if they have a mind to.
DRR: How do you feel when they say something nice about Mrs. Clementine Hunter?
CH: I feel good, I feel fine, but that don't make me go. [laughter]
DRR: I've noticed that you've done flowers, cotton-picking scenes, Christmas scenes—what are some of the other things that you've painted?
CH: Well, not too many other things.
DR: How do you decide what to paint?﻿13
CH: I don't know, it just gets in my mind.
DRR: But does it stay in...does it come on all at once?
CH: Yes. At night, sometime be a time when I get to painting. Sometime it don't come on till I be wanting to paint something.
DRR: And you may start the picture and think of something new to add to it as you paint?
CH: Yeah. That's the way.
DRR: And when you end the picture, it may not he what you had in mind at first? Or maybe you've changed it...
CH: Well, just let it get in my mind, that's what I put in the picture.
DRR: That's what you put in. But you get it in your mind as you go along sometimes.
CH: Uh huh.
DRR: How long does it take you to paint, say, a picture the size of this machine [tape recorder]?
CH: Well, about three days.
DRR: About three days. What is the longest time you worked on one picture?
CH: A week.
DRR: Now I read something about a big mural that you had done. I believe it
was___I think in a church. It was a great big picture. How long did it
take you... Was that the three-week...
CH:	That took about, near about a month.
DRR:	Well, that "African House," how long did it take you to do that?
CH:	Took me a long time.
DRR:	Do you go back now and look at the house every now and then?
CH: No. Just every October I go when they got some kind of to-do that I go, but I don't go look at it.
DRR: But you don't go anywhere but to Melrose.
CH: No, I don't go nowhere.
DRR: Now, when you were young, and you worked at the Big House, do you know where any of those people are that you worked for?﻿14
CH:	They all dead.
DRR:	They all dead. None of the youngsters keep In touch with you?
CH:	They ain't got but one.
DRR:	Does that one keep in touch with you?
CH:	Just now and then. He in Natchitoches.
DRR:	He comes to see you?
CH:	He kinda light, but they...
DRR:	But does he come to see you at Christmastime sometimes?
CH:	Yeah, he bring me present in the Christmas sometime.
DRR:	Tell me something about Mr. Jranpois Mignon, you know him?
CH:	Yeah.
DRR:	A friend of yours, too, I believe. Has he helped you in some way with your painting? Well now, here's Mr. Tom Whitehead, how has he helped you? I know he helped me to get out here to see you.
CH:	He helped me to get my boards and paint and e?verything.
DRR: That's wonderful. What about Dr. Bailey?
CH:	Dr. Bailey do the same.
DRR:	How did you find them, or how did they find you?
CH:	Well, they find me!
DRR: How did Mr. Whitehead find you?
CH:	Well, they find me, and I find them, and---Dr. Bailey. Both of them,
they good people. I like 'em.
DRR: Yes, I think I like 'em, too, because it was through them I found you.
I understand that you had an opportunity to go to Washington for a Mardi Gras ball, someone promised you that you could meet the president if you went there. Did you go?
CH: No, I didn't.
DRR: Well, how did you answer that question___
CH: Well, the way I answered that question,"If the president wants to see me, he would have to come here to my house, 'cause I don't go nowhere."﻿15
DRR:	And you meant that, too.
CH:	And I meant it, and I didn't go.
DRR:	You sound like a very independent lady. How do you feel about the
critics who look at your paintings? If they say they're not good, do you care?
CH:	I don't care how it is. If they want 'em, just let 'em get 'em, and if they don't, they can leave 'em there.
DRR:	If they like them, it's okay, and...
CH:	And if they don't...
DRR:	___if they don't like them...
CH:	... it's okay.
DRR:	It is still okay.

DRR: And the ones you leave here, you'll leave 'em for Quida and the other grandchildren?
CH: Yeah, they'll take 'em if they want 'em. And they might go ahead, time I die, and sell them. [laughter] I can't never tell what the children going to do.
DRR: That might happen. Well, I think everybody knows you, and certainly your relatives will be pleased with all the publicity and the historical materials that you're leaving. Mrs. Clementine, before we close this interview, could you tell us some more about Melrose and Mrs. Cammie Henry? She ran Melrose or owned Melrose at one time?

CH: No, I don't know.
DRR: You were a widow quite a long time.
CH: I was a widow a long time.
DRR: A long time. Did you find it hard to be a widow after having been a married woman? Was it hard for you to make a living for yourself and your children?
CH: Well, not too hard. Just went on to work. I knew I had to work for a living by myself, then. And I just went on to work.
DRR: Well, how did you keep the other fellows from wanting to marry you and coming around...
CH: 'Cause I just tell them no.
DRR: Just tell 'em no, it's just that simple.
CH: That's right.
DRR: Mrs. Clementine, you talked about the noisy services or worship that the
good Baptist folk used to have down at Melrose.. It sort of seems sometimes that we black people are pretty emotional, and certainly we show our emotions a lot at funerals. Have you seen Ipeople] exhibit a lot of emotionalism at funerals?
CH: Yes, a lot of 'em.
DRR: Do you go to funerals?
CH: I used to.
DRR: Why don't you go any more?
CH: I don't go no more 'cause it worry me, 'cause I don't like all, all that, 'cause I got a sister, it'll kill you—you know, it can make too much,,.. They do too much—them, you know, but not me, 'Cause I can't even cry.﻿21
CH: (cont.) I ain't cried when my mama died, you know, when you don't
cry when your mother died, well, you ain't gonna cry. But it hurt me, but I just can't cry. Can't do that. That's why I don't go.
DRR: Well, thank you for that. Mrs. Clementine, I understand there's going to be an exhibit at the University of Texas in Arlington next February, and that some of your works will be on display there, and I want you to know, I plan to be there, and I'll just point out, with so much pride, "I know this lady. I had the opportunity and the honor of interviewing her." And if you should change your mind about going to your own exhibits, you might come up and be my guest for a while.
CH: Well, I'll just tel-...
DRR: ...don't, I'll surely be there.
CH: Well, you can be there. I hope you be there. But Clementine ain't going to be there. [laughter]
DRR: Okay. This interview will be sent to the Schlesinger Library, at Radcliffe College in Boston, Massachusetts, and as Mr. Whitehead pointed out before our interview, they selected you as one of the women to be interviewed because you had made such an unusual contribution to the field of art with your folk art painting. And they consider it an honor to have had this interview with you. Do you want to say any word to them, did you want to say thank you, or you're sorry they bothered you or anything?
CH: No, I'm not sorry, and I thank 'em. I'm glad.
DRR: Good. Thank you very much, Mrs. Clementine.﻿CLEMENTINE HUNTER
