Speaker 1: And what does the "H" stand for, sir?
Speaker 2: Silent.

Speaker 1: And can I have today's date and our location?
Speaker 2: Okay, today's date is 3/16/2002, Fourth Street Baptist Church, 222 Fifth Street, Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And your profession, sir?
Speaker 2: Pastor and minister.
Story_ID: 7006
Speaker 1: Now, I'd like to start out with your, your parents.  And I know your father was a minister also.  Can you give his name and what you know about his background?
Speaker 2: Okay, he was [Johnie] J. H. Flakes, Sr.  And he worked as a mill worker at the Eagle and Phenix Mill [Phenix City, Alabama] until he was about thirty, thirty-five.  Then he came out of the mill and started his own business, a small grocery store, and a barber shop.  And he served as a missionary for East Alabama Association up until his death.
Speaker 1: And did he talk a lot about growing up himself, you know, where was he--was he raised in--?
Speaker 2: He was reared in Alabama, but we didn't get into lots of discussion about his upbringing.
Speaker 1: What kind of person would you say he was, sir?
Speaker 2: He was a very good father.  My mother died when I was two years old.  They had four children, and he would not give his children away or let them be separated, but he chose to rear them himself.  So he worked two jobs, and, of course, at night, around twelve, he would pick us up and take us home from the babysitter until he was able to marry [Jessie Flakes] when I was seven years old.
Speaker 1: And your, so when your--you say when your mother passed away, you were two--?
Speaker 2: Two years old.
Speaker 1: Two years old, so you don't really have memories of her.
Story_ID: 7007
Speaker 1: Can you share with us your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I was thinking of that earlier, and I went back to the forties [1940s].  I was born in '35 [1935] and around '42 [1942] I can vaguely remember when I started to school at six years old, going to Cogwood Hill School [Phenix City, Alabama] in a place called, a neighborhood called Pumpkin Bottom.  And the school was on the hill, a little red school.  That seemed to be the thing, a little red school on the hill.  One teacher with six grades, and I went there until I graduated and went to Father Hewitt School on Fifth Avenue in Columbus [Georgia].
Speaker 1: So you're saying you went from--what was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Cogwood Hill School.
Speaker 1: Cogwood Hill, but it was on Pumpkin, where?
Speaker 2: In Pumpkin Bottom [Phenix City, Alabama neighborhood].
Speaker 1: Pumpkin Bottom.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Alabama, in Phenix City, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and you said you went to the twelfth grade?
Speaker 2: No, sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And then you came--you--?
Speaker 2: Left there and went to Father Hewitt School on Fifth Avenue which was a Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, were you raised Catholic, sir?
Speaker 2: No.  I was reared Baptist.
Speaker 1: And do you, can you describe your family life growing up, you know, much--any other, you know, if you could share just a couple of--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, my family life growing up was my father and my, my three siblings.  And as I say, my father worked most of the time.  And when he, we were in school and after school, we would go to our babysitter.  And, of course, after that we were home, and we lived in a house that was not sealed.  It had its cracks, and we called the air condition and the sunlight.  You could see the sunlight in the morning when you awake.  So it wasn't a, the house wasn't a life of affluence, but it was a life that was pretty impoverished.  And my father reared us and kept us.  We had the Sunday clothes.  We didn't get, have clothes for everyday changing.  We had a Sunday suit.  I would get one when Christmas, and my brother get one Easter.  My sister got a dress every year.  But the boys got a suit every other year.  And we had to wear our shoes for two years because we didn't wear them during the week.  We went barefooted.
Story_ID: 7008
Speaker 1: Now, where do you fit in the family tree, sir?
Speaker 2: I'm third.
Speaker 1: You're third.  Can you give your, your siblings in order, their names and in order?
Speaker 2: Okay, Charlie James Flakes is the oldest, Elizabeth Flakes, my sister, second, Johnie Flakes, Jr., the third, and Joseph Flakes, the fourth.  Of course, my mother had the son prior to marrying my father, and he was older than all of us, John Henry Samuel.
Story_ID: 7009
Speaker 1: And did you have a lot of extended family in the area?
Speaker 2: Not in the area, but Pumpkin Bottom [Phenix City, Alabama neighborhood] was a family.  We knew everybody, everybody knew us.  And whatever happened in any family in Pumpkin Bottom, everybody was there to help out.  So it was that kind of communal family.
Speaker 1: Do you know why they called it Pumpkin Bottom?
Speaker 2: As near as I understand that, that a fellow was going through selling pumpkins, and the wagon sides fell off, and all the pumpkins rolled out right in the bottom.  So they call it Pumpkin Bottom (laughter).
Speaker 1: Anyway, so you, you--any other memories about growing up around that time, anything else?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, during that period in time, from '40 [1940] to '50 [1950], that was a very difficult time because of segregation.  And if the police come to Pumpkin Bottom, you don't stand around, you run because if you stood, you would get a whipping by the police.  And if you run, and could get away, I mean you were saved.  So we would be standing and see the police car coming and just dart like rabbits because we knew that was a no, no.  Any crime that took place in the lower part of Phenix and particularly in the white community, they always came to Pumpkin Bottom, and you were always guilty until you were proven innocent.  I remember one night someone broke in a store down in the lower part of Phenix City, police came to my father's store and J. B. Colquitt and myself had just come from the school function on the hill.  And when the police walked up, they said, okay, those are the ones.  And they were going to take us down to somewhere to be, just for the man to say whether we broke in the store or not.  Well, this scared me to death.  I had not broken in a store.  So I asked my father if he was going with me.  When the policemen discovered that my father--well, I was my father's son, he said, well, we're gonna leave your boy--they called him [Flakes's father] 'Johnie'--but we're gonna take this one with us.  So they carried the older boy down, and the man looked at me, and he, he just said, no, I can't lie.  That's not the fellow.  They tried to make him say that J.B. was the one.  They brought the owner of the store back to our store and when the man walked in, he said, no, that's not the one.  And they tried to make him say that I was the one.  And that's--I, we were just proven guilty until that man said that we were not the ones.  And that's the, the recurring situation that we had at that time in Phenix City.
Speaker 1: So how did that make you behave and feel and what was the community?  The community felt sort of under siege, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Well, it created a lot of hostility, a lot of anger because my father never got to be a man.  He was always 'Boy.'  He was always 'Johnie,' and one day he went to a store downtown.  I was with him, and the man was trying to sell him a razor.  He was a barber.  And like anybody, my father was telling him, well, I'll give you this much for it.  And this was a, you know, a Jew.  And he went off on my father and said some ugly things.  And that created a hostility in me that took, you know, a long time to get rid of, as to why this man would talk to my father this way.  And my father apparently was older than he, but at the time, I, I--it just didn't dawn on me that, that kind of thing ought to be happening.
Speaker 1: And did your father--did you ever have a discussion with your father about that incident?
Speaker 2: It's interesting, we never discussed it.  My father was a strict disciplinarian.  And he just did not share a lots with his children.  Whatever problems he had, he dealt with them.  And whenever he told his children to do something, he meant do it with no back talk.  So we did not get a chance to share.  He died at forty-nine.  I was only nineteen when he died.  So we didn't talk a lot about those things at the time.
Speaker 1: And so you had a clear sense of what were the boundaries within, within Pumpkin Bottom, you know, within that, that place.  It was okay.  You were a real community.  It's just when whites came around?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, when white came around, I mean, even the insurance man had no respect for blacks.  He just--they'd just come in and they don't knock, just walk on in the house.
Speaker 1: Collecting money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, collecting money.  They'd--whoever came white, they, they, they were the tyrants and we were, and we were just there and had no voice.
Speaker 1: Now, were you working in the fields or things like that?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't, in Pumpkin Bottom, we didn't have a field.  We, we had horses.  We had cows, but it was mostly--the people in the area bootlegged a lot (laughs).  So we didn't go to the fields.
Speaker 1: Did you have a, like a wild, wild West in Pumpkin Bottom?  My father was from the wild, wild West, I don't think they had any fields, it was a steel mill at the time (laughter).  But was it like a wild, wild West?
Speaker 2: It, it was--you had a lot of shooting and cutting, yes.  On Saturday night, I mean that was kind of the pasttime.  Somebody got cut every Saturday night or got shot.
Speaker 1: So who, was there a local doctor to take care of them or who was servicing people in Pumpkin--?
Speaker 2: Dr. Brewer, Dr. Brewer lived in Columbus, and you have heard someone talk about him getting killed some years ago--I don't recall the time, back in the '60s [1960s], I think, when he got killed here.  But he would take care of Pumpkin Bottom.  He would come to Pumpkin Bottom, and he would take care of all of the elderly people.  He made house calls.  He would come to our store, and he would sit and eat peanuts and just--he was just a regular fellow.  But he took care of the people of Pumpkin Bottom.
Speaker 1: Now, how far is Pumpkin Bottom, sir, from Columbus?
Speaker 2: About roughly five miles.
Story_ID: 7010
Speaker 1: Why did you end up going to Catholic school?
Speaker 2: That was my father's choice.  When we finished at Cogwood Hill [Elementary School, Phenix City, Alabama], he had heard about the school.  And he thought that would be a good place to go for discipline.  He wanted us to be in a place where people, where we're under strict discipline.  And Father Hewett and the teachers there were strict disciplinarians.
Speaker 1: Now, your father, the white community thought your father was okay if he let them go--you know, that one time when, you know, they were--the police were trying to pick him up?
Speaker 2: Well, he had gained respect because he owned the grocery store.  And, you know, a black man owning a grocery store back then, he was kind of upscale.
Speaker 1: Now, the, the school that you went to, what was--was that, was it a still, was it a segregated school?  Was it a mix--?
Speaker 2: Oh, segregated, yeah, segregated.  And we had six classes in one room with one teacher.
Speaker 1: And the teacher was black too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but Catholic?
Speaker 2: No, no--no, no, the Cogwood Hill.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cogwood Hill had six classes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you there.  Okay, was that teacher a good teacher?
Speaker 2: She was.  She was mostly a disciplinarian, but a good teacher.  Yes, she had to be to handle all those students in six classes.
Speaker 1: So what, were the teach--were the kids helping teach the other kids?
Speaker 2: No, she just made them be quiet.
Speaker 1: And then when you got to Catholic school, did you, was that a whole different set up?
Speaker 2: It was a different set up because you had, you had Mrs. Day, Mrs. Hewett and Father Hewett.  So you had three teachers.
Speaker 1: And that went from seventh grade to--?
Speaker 2: From the seventh to the ninth.
Speaker 1: Ninth, okay.  And did you find that it was--was that experience different?
Speaker 2: It was very different because we had those teachers there, and they, they could spend more time with us, and they could give us more understanding of the lesson that we were studying.
Speaker 1: And, and were you a little--your father was concerned that you were sort of roaming around and sort of getting in real late or--?
Speaker 2: Well, going to the public school, it meant that you had a little more freedom.  But in that school, it was, they were strict.
Speaker 1: Now, after you finished that school, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Went to South Girard High School [Phenix City, Alabama] for one year.
Speaker 1: Spell Girard, Girard, spell Girard?
Speaker 2: South--.
Speaker 1: S-O-U-T-H.
Speaker 2: Yes, G, and I have to look that up because right off it, it's not registering with me.  South Girard High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you went there for one year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what happened after that?
Speaker 2: Drop out.
Story_ID: 7011
Speaker 1: You stayed in, in Pumpkin Bottom [Phenix City, Alabama neighborhood]?
Speaker 2: I stayed in Pumpkin Bottom with the intention of getting a job and buying a car.  And after I dropped out of school, of course, my father prevailed with me to stay in school, but when I dropped out, he said, well, you have to pay rent if you gonna stay here.  So instead of getting a car, I couldn't even afford a bicycle because I had to pay rent, and my rent took up everything I was making.  I had no skills to offer so it was just a difficult thing.
Speaker 1: So what did you end up doing?
Speaker 2: Getting married (laughter); even worse.  So, yes, I, I--I got married, and after I got married, I found a job.  Just the Lord placed it in my way because I went to look for a job.  I went to several places and I went by the Pontiac place, William Pontiac place, asked the man if he needed some help.  He said, no.  And I turned to walk out, and his son said, well, daddy, you said you were gonna hire somebody at the house.  He asked me could I cut grass.  I told him yes.  And he hired me and sent me out to the house.  I became the yard man, the butler and the chauffer.  And so I worked there for about, I guess, eight years or longer.
Story_ID: 7012
Speaker 1: And then what happened after that?
Speaker 2: I was called to preach.
Speaker 1: And was your father preaching at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were what age at that point?
Speaker 2: That was, I was about seventeen, eighteen.
Speaker 1: Seventeen, eighteen, and he had been preaching how long?
Speaker 2: My father was preaching when I knew him, so I don't recall how long he preached.
Speaker 1: And he, and he pastored at what church, sir?
Speaker 2: The Bethel Full Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and this was Pumpkin Bottom [Phenix City, Alabama neighborhood]?
Speaker 2: No, that was out in Bleeker, Alabama.
Speaker 1: We're very close to Alabama here, right?
Speaker 2: Right across the river, yes.
Speaker 1: Right across the river, that's what we just realized.  Okay, and so, so these communities are almost, even though someone was in Columbus, Georgia they were servicing, you know, like the doctor servicing--?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, in Pumpkin Bottom.  So, so the church, the Baptist church was always a very important part of your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, always.
Speaker 1: And even when you went to Catholic--what they taught you there didn't, you know--were you impacted at all of what they taught you there?
Speaker 2: No, no, because I was active in church at the time, and I went to the Catholic school, but I was pretty much settled in what I believed.
Speaker 1: And, so tell, so how did you come to be called?
Speaker 2: My father died when I was nineteen.  I had a habit of gambling.  I was married, and had a child.  And prior to his death, he would take care of my family because I just threw everything I was making, just could not take any money home.  When my father died, it was like my whole world crumbled.  And instead of getting better, I got worse.  I got so far down until I couldn't even take money home to take care of my family.  And one day, I--in gambling, I lost everything I had, the money in my pocket, money my wife had made in the little store, money I'd made from cutting hair.  And it was just a devastating thing.  My wife called my brother and my mother and my grandfather.  And they all came, and they just went down on me and made me feel less than dirt.  And in that process, I, I really felt that I didn't have anything to live for.  And that's when I really tried to take my life, and it was at that point that God saved me.  And in the process, he revealed to me that my life belongs to him, no longer to me, and that was to preach.  Of course, that was a real shocker because it had been in the paper and everybody knew what had happened.  And in my little in Pumpkin Bottom, everybody knew me and that was the buzz word, and me preach?  And I just felt that no, this can't be.  So I prayed and asked God to give me some assurance.  The assurance he gave me, my, my family, it was on the verge of extinction.  And from my father, the Flakes name was going to go under because there was no boys after me, after my brothers.  And I asked him to give me a son to give me some assurance that this is what he was calling me to do.  And when my wife became impregnated I, I named him before he was born.  I named him Johnie the third.  And when, the night that he as born, we had a midwife.  I was in the room, and the midwife said, "Well, you got another girl."  I said, "Oh, no, that's a boy."  She said, "Boy, I've been delivering babies for fifty years, and you're gonna tell me--?"  I said, "But that's a boy."  And the people in the room said, "You, you don't know what you're talking, hush."  My wife said, "Why you arguing with her?" I said, "You, you look again."  And when she looked again, she said, "That's the first time I made a mistake, say, it's a boy."  I said, "His name is Johnie the third."  And that was my affirmation for preaching.
Speaker 1: And you started, then you started in Pumpkin Bottom?
Speaker 2: In Pumpkin Bottom.
Speaker 1: At what church?
Speaker 2: Central Baptist Church, where I was licensed, ordained and everything.  My pastor from there even performed my marriage ceremony.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a difference, sir, between being ordained and, and really sort of accepting Christ in a, you know, in a real way and learning  And I, and I'm wondering what--if you could describe the journey, you know, that you, from the time that your father died and you decided to change, you know, to--I just want to have some idea of the journey.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I joined--I, I gave my life to Christ when I was nine years old.  And, of course, I worked in church, I served in church, and went with my father on missionary journeys.  And, of course, in that, in that process, I was not the true Christian that I should have been because I was doing those things that you would do at that time that pulled me away from my father's teaching.  And when my father died, that's when my world crumbled, and at that point, I, I, I really wasn't sure I knew how to prayer because I had gotten a distance away from what he taught me, and my whole family turned to me at his death and wanted to know what are we gonna do?  And I didn't know what to do because I was drinking, and I was in, in, in that gambling world, and as a result, you know, I prayed and the Lord helped us get through that period of his death.  And after that I went right back to doing the things that I was doing before he died.  And it was about two and a half, three years later that I really came to the, the dead end.
Speaker 1: And then, but I'm saying from the point that you came to the dead end, to you, you know, you decided that you wanted to preach and, and move in that direction, that's what I'm curious about?  I mean to this process today, this--.
Speaker 2: Oh, to, to this, okay, okay.  Well, after, after I was called to preach, and I, I believe--I didn't just decide.  I, I was really called to preach.  And after that I gave my testimony to the church, and at that point, I was given a license.  And after being licensed, I preached for about three years, and I was called to the Good Hope Baptist Church in Phenix City [Alabama], where I've been serving for forty-four years, and later called to Fourth Street [Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia], where I've been serving for forty years.
Story_ID: 7013
Speaker 1: But I had not been to school.  I went to the off-campus service center here in Columbus [Georgia] and I had picked up what training I could there.  But after being called to Fourth Street [Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia], I recognized that if I was going to serve as pastor, I needed to go to college.  So I made arrangements with my wife and with the church that I would be away during the week.  And I drove to Nashville [Tennessee] for four years to the American Baptist College [Nashville, Tennessee] to study.
Speaker 2: And how did you end up choosing the American Baptist College?
Speaker 1: Well, there was a young man--well, he was in Chicago [Illinois] at the time, and he came home.  And he told me about American Baptist College.  Of course, he was attending at the time.  And after he told me about American College, being a, a school drop out, I didn't know whether any college would take me.  So I went to American Baptist and talked with the dean, and the dean said to me, if you can take a GED and pass that test, that you can come on study for your academics.  And so I took the GED and passed, and they took me in.
Speaker 2: Do you think that the training that you got there has helped you here?
Speaker 1: Oh, most definitely, yes.
Speaker 2: What do you think was lacking in your first, you know, the first part of your ministry?
Speaker 1: Well, experience and, and the training, knowledge of ministries, just really everything but faith in God, and the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
Story_ID: 7014
Speaker 1: And, but you were at that church how many years, sir?  You said, the first [sic, second] church [Good Hope Baptist Church, Phenix City, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Forty-four.
Speaker 1: Forty-four, and then from here [Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church, Columbus Georgia], how many years?
Speaker 2: Forty years.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)  That's a long time cause--.
Speaker 2: It don't count up so much (laughs).
Speaker 1: Eighty-four years?
Speaker 2: Experience.
Speaker 1: Did you overlap?
Speaker 2: No--yes, I'm sorry.  I'm still at the church in Phenix City.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're still at the church, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm still there and still here.  I see what you're saying (laughter).
Speaker 1: I was gonna say--I said that's too young--.
Speaker 2: (laughs)--my age.
Speaker 1: So when you, when did you start--I mean, you, you started--when did you overlap?  I'm just trying to figure out.  When did you go to American Baptist College [Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Oh, in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: And you had been pastoring how long then?
Speaker 2: I had been pastoring at Good Hope about four or five years then.
Speaker 1: See that helps-- (laughs) (simultaneously), I was like somethings not working here--.
Speaker 2: (Laughs), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so how did you come to, come to this church here?  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Interesting, interesting.  Some of the members--well, let me back up.  Yeah, some of the members heard me preach at a church called Bethlehem Baptist Church on Crawford Road in Phenix City.  And when they heard me preach, they asked the pastor to invite me to come and preach here.  At the time that I was to go to Bethlehem, my son was deathly ill.  The doctor said that if he made it through the night he would live.  And I had to make a decision whether I would go from the hospital to preach that night or whether I would stay with my family because they did not want me to leave.  But, after I had thought about and prayed about it, I went on and preached that night at Bethlehem. Got the invitation from that sermon to come here.  And after I preached that Sunday morning, I've been here ever since.
Story_ID: 7015
Speaker 1: We were talking about how you, you know, came here, and, you know, how you came, ended up coming to this church [Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came here as a youth minister, and I came here on the third--the second and fourth Sundays.  And I served in that capacity until the former pastor became ill, and he asked me if I would come and just be here each Sunday.  So I came here, and I was here every Sunday.  I didn't preach every Sunday.  But when he didn't feel like preaching, then I would preach.  But I have been here, I came here three years prior to his death.
Speaker 1: And what was the community that you came to, sir?  You know, what was, cause you were living, you know, really, I mean you're familiar with a different community.  It's not far away, but I'm just wondering what was the community that you were, you know, the youth ministry for?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, and when I came here, there was houses all around the church.  And people could walk to church and fill it.  It was a lot of problems in the community in terms of people working and policemen, brutality and lots of violence because of segregation.  Lots of people was abused, and not just in this area, but in Columbus period.  And lots of police brutality at the time.
Speaker 1: And this was what year, sir?
Speaker 2: I was called to pastor in 1961.
Speaker 1: So this is sort of in the mix of the Civil Rights Movement in the South?  Okay, what, what work did you start about doing then?
Speaker 2: As pastor?  Well, the first thing I did was went to school.  And I had to get some training so I would know what to do other than preach.  But when I, while I was in school and began to learn about the various ministries that we ought to be part of, then we went farther to develop the youth ministry which was already here when I came.  And we sought to enhance the youth ministry, and we also developed a, a stronger music ministry, and we began to develop stewardship, evangelism, mission, those kind of ministries.  And, of course, we put in what we called 'a call to talk'.  I'm working today with VIM [Valley Interaction Ministry] and seeking to bring about a better relationship between the races today.  At the time, when I came, I was very, very vocal and people called me more of a troublemaker than anything else because people did not understand where I was coming from.  And I was trying to call attention to people the fact that we had some problems in the community.  And as a result, the word is, "you're not a team player".  And I was the, I mean was a outcast because I wasn't a team player at the time, back in the '60s [1960s], the '70s [1970s] and part of the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: And so what, what were you doing that they considered a sign of being a troublemaker?
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, I was president of the Interdomination Ministry and Alliance of Columbus [Georgia] and Phenix City [Alabama].  And there was, women at a laundry, Wade Laundry, who were not being paid adequately.  So we, we called a boycott.  And we set up funds that we would take care of them while they was out of work.  I spoke out against police brutality.  When the strangulation was going on here in Columbus, and they were stopping blacks without adequate reasons, just suspect.  And I, I spoke out and called attention to the chief that it was not fair to just stop blacks because they were black.  There ought to be a reason so that blacks will not be intimidated and feel every time they go out, they're going to be stopped the policemen and maybe held because they could hold them for a length of time before they let them go.  I was president of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the march counter to the Ku Klux Klan.  The Ku Klux Klan had announced that they were gonna come to Columbus and march, and nobody said a word.  So I said, if the Klans march, we will march.  And we did.  The Klans had their march out in one area, and we had our march downtown.  And those kind of things, people couldn't tell me not to do, that, you know, you're supposed to--if somebody tell you don't do it, you're supposed to do what they say.  And I didn't do what they say.  I did what I was convinced was right.  And so I was not a team player.
Speaker 1: And what repercussions did that have for you here?
Speaker 2: As far as the community or far as politically, I, I wasn't appointed to too many boards.  I did not get to, invited into the high functions, and there was an effort one time, on the part of some to try and dilute, I guess, my influence, assassinate my good name or whatever they were trying to do, but it didn't work.
Speaker 1: Will you give an example of that, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, a group of ministers were called together by a group of laymen in the community and told them that they had to stop me because I was too influential.  And these unfortunate ministers went around saying that I was no longer a leader in the community.  And as a result, they were trying to stop black and whites from recognizing me as such because the lay leadership in the community did not feel I was a team player, that they couldn't tell me nothing.
Speaker 1: And you--but how did you get over that, I guess is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I always go back to the Lord because had it not been for the Lord, I couldn't have survived.
Story_ID: 7016
Speaker 1: And what were some of the important things that you think you've done like, you know, you started here in '60 [1960], '61 [1961], you said, and so, you know, you said in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] and even part of the '80s [1980s], that you were (unclear) viewed as an ica--you know, outcast.  And I'm just wondering what things did you, you know, what was happening during that time period and what, and what were, you think, programs you were putting in place that started giving you the respectability or, you know, a view that you could sort of stand on your own?
Speaker 2: Well, in the community I was president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and brought some structure to NAACP in terms of a regular meeting time and in terms of, we had the musical extravaganza, and we started bringing and had a forum set up where we would bring in people to hold them accountable for the things, particularly, elected officials in the community in what they were doing, from the state and the national as well.  I served as vice moderator of the association here in Columbus, and I worked to develop the constitution and to bring about a structure for the association, which was thirty-six churches in the community.  And in Fourth Street [Missionary Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia], we worked to put in voters registration, and we developed what we called a leadership forum where we also brought people in and causes them to be accountable to the community for the things that they were doing.  And, of course, that leadership forum became one of the premier organizations in the community for a while to the extent that people were forbidden to come to that meeting if they worked at the city.
Speaker 1: Now, describe the NAACP at that time too?  Who was heading it up and who was heading up the efforts here?  You know, who were you reporting in to?
Speaker 2: The NAACP had several presidents prior to my presidency.  Mr. George Ford, Mr.--what was Mose' last name?  Can't think of Mr. Mose's last name.  He, he served as president for a long period.  Then John Charles served as president, and, of course, I served as president.  And we all had connections with the national NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the national?  What mandates were coming out from the national at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, during that time, basically, national was dealing with a lot of cases in court with reference to discrimination.  And that's what we were dealing with, a lot of cases, reference to discrimination.  While we did not have a lot of cases in Columbus, but we were dealing with the same thing that national was dealing with.  We had, after my presidency, the case of the school board versus, NAACP vs. the School Board, and that lasted for years and years.
Speaker 1: That was Brown versus Board of Education [Topeka, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that was part of it.
Speaker 1: That was '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you're saying at your presidency, you, you're saying that one of the cases here was the NAACP?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was NAACP, not under my presidency.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was one of the hallmark cases that the NAACP had here in Columbus.  Of course, and we, we did not win because the Supreme Court ruled that the school had met the qualifications, of course, and, that never happened.
Speaker 1: For desegregating?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who were the leaders in the national office at the time that you were president?
Speaker 2: At the time I was president, Dr. [Benjamin] Hooks was the president--was the executive director.
Speaker 1: Did you have that, much contact with Dr. Hooks?
Speaker 2: Not with Dr. Hooks, but with Julius Hope who was, worked with the ministers, religious organizations.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was the one who worked--so that's how the, NAACP had actually people who would work with the, the ministers organizations?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, as a separate unit?
Speaker 2: No, no, it's a part of the structure of NAACP.  But Dr. Hope is the one who was the director of the religious activities.
Speaker 1: And what were they hoping that the, the ministers would actually do and what role they were playing?
Speaker 2: Oh, give one percent support to NAACP.  I just in Baltimore back in October at the invitation of Dr. [Rev. Julius C.] Hope and [Kweisi] Mfume, and where we had a national gathering of ministers.  And one of the main objectives is to seek to get full support from faith-based organizations.
Speaker 1: And that support comes in what ways, sir?  Is it financial?
Speaker 2: In terms of membership, in terms of finance, in terms of voter registration, in terms of whatever is needed from NAACP.
Story_ID: 7017
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about what you did with voter registration be--and I want you to sort of give us a sense, at the time that you started voter registration, how many people were registered and, you know, and what the results of the efforts happened in terms of that, cause this was a community--what you're saying would, that was in some respects very quiet and backward and scared.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Voters registration during, during the time that I served as president [of the local NAACP] and as I served with the leadership forum, we registered during that period at least seven or eight hundred people.  And the impact we had, there was a mayor, a mayor's race and needed about, at that time, eight or nine votes.  And because they could--we had the structure in place, we could get people out.  We had voters registration, voters' education and voters' participation.  So we had a transportation system where we could get people out.  And we were able to cause that mayor to win the race because we had that structure in place.  So eight hundred people voting, getting eight hundred people to vote at that time was quite a number for this area.
Speaker 1: And what, so your candidate got in, I think you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, the other thing is, can you describe what things were actually being done at the polls at that time?  You know, what, when people were trying to go vote, what, what things were being done?
Speaker 2: Yes, number one, if people got to the polls at just about closing time, they were not always allowed to vote.  Sometimes they had lost some of the ballots and had to send back and get more ballots.  Sometimes the people who couldn't read, they got very little assistance, and most times, the people at the polls were white.
Story_ID: 7018
Speaker 1: What other things were happening in this community at that time?  You know, you said that there was a lack of registered voters.  You said that, you know, the community had other ills, and I'm wondering if you could sort of address that?
Speaker 2: Sure, lack of promotion on jobs, low pay scales.  If you expressed yourself about some of the things, injustices that was happening on the job or in the community, you're subject to lose your job.  It was the kind of job where professional people just didn't speak out because if they did, that was, even the teachers, they would lose.  At that time, I [as a preacher at a black church] was, I felt that I was free and I had nothing to lose.  And, and whatever needed to be said, I felt the need to say it.
Story_ID: 7019
Speaker 1: And who was, who were the people you were admiring at the time?  Was there anyone that you were trying to model yourself after or--?
Speaker 2: Dr. Thomas H--H. Brewer, he influenced me quite a bit.  And he used to come to our place and come to our store, but he was very vocal in Columbus [Georgia].  He challenged Columbus to the hilt.  Martin Luther King, Jr. and, of course, Primus E. King, I learned of him later and what he had done.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the last person?
Speaker 2: Primus E. King.
Speaker 1: Primus?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's Primus E. King.
Speaker 1: P-R-I-M-U-S?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And who was he, sir?
Speaker 2: He was the one that caused the six, or 16th district in New Orleans [Louisiana] [ref. to the the 1946 U.S. Supreme Court ruling King v. State of Georgia] to give the voting rights to black in Columbus [Georgia] and the surrounding area.  He challenged the courts, and I understand they tried to get him to back down, tried to pay him off, but he stood and no, I want my people to vote.
Speaker 1: And then who was the first person you mentioned, Thomas Brewer?
Speaker 2: Thomas H. Brewer.
Speaker 1: Brewer, and where was he from, sir?
Speaker 2: He, well, when I came to know him, he was here in Columbus as a doctor, a medical doctor.
Speaker 1: He's a medical doctor?  Was he the one--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 1: Was that--he wasn't the one who serviced King and serviced--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, so he was the one.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So he was active also politically?
Speaker 2: Oh, my Lord, yes, yes.  In fact, was killed for it, right in Columbus.
Speaker 1: Then you, you were gonna tell that story, and you didn't tell it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was killed on First Avenue, and at the time of his death, the district attorney--I don't recall his name, said that we don't need the [U.S.] Justice Department in here.  And there was never an investigation of his death.  And I would--I don't know whether it was a conspiracy or not, but it was a strange death.  He was shot down right in front of his office on First Avenue.
Story_ID: 7020
Speaker 1: Who was also fighting along with you?  What other parts of the community were fighting along with you?
Speaker 2: Well, there was several, [Rev.] Rudolph [Carter] Allen was very strong at that time, Albert McCovey (ph.), [Rev.] Fred [C.] Lofton, William B. Howell, those were some of the people that was part of Interdomination Ministry of Alliance, and we, we had a strong group of that little nucleus.
Speaker 1: Now, at the time, you know, there were people coming in, you know, a little later, I mean I don't, you know, maybe more mid-60s [1960s], but students were from SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Council], you know, from--and I'm wondering if they ever came into this community, and how--?
Speaker 2: (nods no.)
Speaker 1: They never did?
Speaker 2: Never did, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: So then did you have any people coming from the North into this community, any black students or--? None of that, not one?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Ever?
Speaker 2: Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came here once, and he was not invited then.  And it was suggested that he shouldn't come back, and instead of trying to locate here with all--we never had the national activities that you had in other cities here.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was because of the leadership thought they could work it out.
Speaker 1: And who was part of that leadership, sir?
Speaker 2: You had George Ford, [legislator] Albert Thompson, [Mayor] A. [Arthur] J. McClung, three prominent men that stood out in the community who were kind of the shakers and movers that I can think of right off.  They were the men out front, and they felt that they could handle it, got the lunch counters desegregated, the signs down, some bus drivers and policemen, but never a real movement to bring about a basic change in Columbus that you had in other areas.
Story_ID: 7021
Speaker 1: So do you feel that Columbus [Georgia] has changed?
Speaker 2: Columbus has come a long way.
Speaker 1: And what do you think was the reason for that?
Speaker 2: I think the men did a good job in going through their procedure and, and doing what they did.
Speaker 1: You think--you're talking A.J. [McClung]--?
Speaker 2: A.J., George Ford, Albert Thompson and those who were leading at that time.  But in terms of the attitude, I think there's still an attitude in Columbus like in no other Southern city.  I think we still have a large group that has not come to deal with the black issues.  We still have segregated schools to a large extent.  And that speaks a volume.  We have--most of our churches are still segregated.  We still have low pay.
Speaker 1: And what are you, what are the things that you have done, cause you I--what you're basically saying is, I started out as a rabble rouser, you know, and I didn't want to accept the status quo.  And, but it sounds like over time, you know, starting really in maybe the '80s [1980s], that you started to become more accepted in some respects.  And you were--I don't, and I can't say what else was happening, but I want you to say what was happening.
Speaker 2: Well, I think first of all that people began to recognize that I was not the rabble rouser that I thought I was--they thought I was.  I do the same thing now that I did then, maybe I'm not as brash.  But whatever I see I need to speak out against, I speak out against it.  I'm still teaching our people the importance of voter registration and still getting people out to vote, and still providing education.  I'm still speaking with the powers that be whenever I have an opportunity to say to them, these are the things that needs to be done.  It's just that they, they recognize that I didn't come here to tear up the town; that I came here to be helpful.  And more and more of that is coming through, cause I been here forty years.  And so that's--.
Story_ID: 7022
Speaker 1: I wanted to just talk about some of the things that you've done, you know, that you were sort of proud of with your ministry and that, along those lines.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, first of all, in the church, we have seen the church grow from six hundred to a number of three thousand.  I say a number.  I'll, I always look for three thousand, but they have them on rolls so I guess we must have them somewhere.  We keep trying to make our roll as clear as possible so we can identify the members.  I'm proud of the stewardship ministry of our church, have lots of people working and they're not looking for pay, but they're putting the time in to help the church to move ahead.  In terms of Sunday school teachers, in terms of choir leaders, in terms of youth leaders, in terms of people who are working in mission out on the field, in terms of people who are working at evangelism, people who are leading on in prayer, these are ministries that was assigned to the church by God, through Jesus Christ.  And we have a good cadre of people working in those areas and reaching out in tutorial, and seeking to set up tutorial to reach out into the community and to bring a lot of the young people in who otherwise would not be in church.  I'm proud of those ministries and the outreach.  I'm proud of them, that interaction ministries.  We just closed out an effort here titled 'One Columbus' [Georgia].  And that's a concept, "One Columbus", but it's an effort to bring blacks and white and Latinos and others together to see if there's a common ground or a common agenda around which we all can work.  That went off real good.  We had a very good attendance, and had very good response.  Out of that we're developing bridge builders.  Bridge builder is an effort to bring together people of diverse culture, that they will sit down and talk to each other and get to know one another, and know why they think the way they think, and how they arrived at the conclusions that they have arisen at as it relates to different relationships in the community.  I'm very proud of the fact that we have, as a church, been very instrumental in helping to move things ahead here in the city in terms of voters registration, in terms of voters' participation, in terms of voters' education.  I'm proud beyond the walls of the church that I've had the opportunity to serve as chairman of the board of trustee of American Baptist College [Nashville, Tennessee].  I started, I went there to study and from there became the president of the alumni association and now chairman of the board.  And to see that college turn around and it's gonna become one of the premier colleges in this nation, owned by National Baptist Convention.  We have now President Forrest [E.] Harris [Sr.] who is doing an excellent job in leading the college ahead.  I'm proud of the fact that I've had opportunities to start churches in Germany.  We have six churches, seven churches in Germany now.  At one time, we had twenty-three, twenty-four churches in Germany, prior to the phase down of the military concern, hoping in the future to plant other churches in Germany.  Each year we go to Germany, we carry about, now, twenty-five to thirty people who go over to teach and to preach and to serve in the German ministry.  We started an association in Germany also.  So those are some things that I am proud of.  I served as president of the Congress of Christian Education of the state of Georgia.  I'm proud of that, and we come together every year in July and bring anywhere from twelve to fifteen hundred people together, with twelve hundred registered delegate and classified in class, studying for the various ministries in churches across the state of Georgia.  I serve as moderator, as lecturer for the moderators' division of the National Baptist Convention.  And I also go to the moderator conference where I lead a class.  Those are some of the outreach that we have as a result of my coming to Fourth Street [Missionary Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia] and reaching out beyond Fourth Street.
Story_ID: 7023
Speaker 1: There's one thing about Baptists.  The teacher said that, about, it's like Abraham and Lot, when they came to the parting of the way.  They said, 'you go your way, and I'll go mine'. So that's Baptists. There's no, there's nothing to hold people together other than the agreement and desire to associate.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me what is the premise or the history of the National Baptist Convention?  Can you go into--?
Speaker 1: The National Baptist Convention is well over a hundred years.  And as I recall, it started in Montgomery, Alabama as a foreign mission board.  And from there, it, it--well, the foreign mission board went on to be established in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And the dates and time, I can't put my hands on, but it eventually evolved into a National Baptist Convention, way back with a president, and I'm, I'm afraid to call the first president's name [Rev. W. H. McAlpine] because I may miss the first one.  But then state conventions, associations and women's conventions were all brought together in a gathering that, that spread across the nation with the purpose of foreign missions, home missions, stewardship, evangelism, teaching and preaching.  The Congress of Christian Education is the educational arm of the National Baptist Convention.  Of course, back in the early days when I started, it was carrying something like twenty-five thousand people.  Today when it meets, it--talk about something like forty thousand or more, for the Congress of Christian Education.  The National Baptist Convention has always had a publishing board, the Townsend Press, where we publish our own literature. Already had, we had the school, but we didn't really give support to American Baptist College [Nashville, Tennessee] as we should have.  Only from Dr. [Rev. T.J.] Jemison, [Rev. Henry J.] Lyons and [Rev. William J.] Shaw have we got the kind of endorsement of the school that was needed to make it purely a national Baptist school.  But the, that's about as good as I can do on the history of the convention. I'd started going to the convention in 1962, and that was the year--no, it was '62 [1962], '63 [1963], that I was at Kansas City [Missouri].  And that's when the ruckus took place, and--.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about that, what the circumstances were?
Speaker 1: Yes, well, at that particular time, there was a desire for the  [Rev. Gardener C.] Taylor faction to be heard as a part of the convention.  And the [Rev. Joseph H.] Jackson faction was not willing to let them be heard.  So as a result, Dr. Jackson tried to open the convention, and the mics were cut.  And when the Taylor faction sought to go onto the stage, the Jackson faction blocked the stage so they couldn't get on.  And as a result, a scuffle ensued.  And later came the announcement that a minister had been knocked off the stage on the back.  And he lost his life; went to court and there was a--the court appointed a minister by the name of Dr. Holmes to preside over the, the split.  And we were there until 6:00 o'clock the next morning voting.  And when the, all the votes were tallied, the Jackson faction won, and that's when the Progressive National Baptists was born.
Speaker 2: What was the difference in philosophy?  What were the factions fighting over?
Speaker 1: Well, Dr. Jackson believed in, from protests to production, and it was his philosophy that the time for protests was over, and there was a need to produce and to do something for ourselves.  Well, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was just coming out.  He had been out from Montgomery [Alabama] and moved on the national scene.  And he was just putting people together all over America.  And they wanted him to speak in Denver [Colorado], and Dr. Jackson would not let him speak.  And that's when they corralled the forces so that the, the--and then the Progressive Baptists now, wanted then, to be sure that they had a voice in the convention, and that protests, at that time was necessary.  And as a result, Dr. Jackson operated with a very, very stiff hand, and he would not, would not change, he would not move.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you vote, sir?
Speaker 1: Well, I voted with the Jackson faction at that time.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm curious as to that because you said that you were sort of a rebel rouser, and I'm wondering why you, why you--it seems to me that you would have voted with the, the Taylor faction?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never, I've never thought that the church ought to split, and I don't think you can change by leaving.  And I've never been one who thought that we should leave in order to correct a situation.  My thinking has always been that you stay with the situation; the cause is greater than the man.  And so I was not influenced to leave and go with the other group.
Speaker 2: Even though Reverend King's--what he was doing in terms of protests was similar to what you were engaged here, in the fight that you were engaged in here?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  But what you have here, you're dealing with a doctrine in the church.  And I, I never thought that National Baptists Convention was wrong.  The leadership was not in order, and I did not see leaving the National Baptist Convention because of the leadership.  I recognized that we needed to change the leadership.
Speaker 2: So don't throw the baby out with the bathwater?  So do you think that then, the National Baptist Convention is an important institution?
Speaker 1: Oh, most definitely.  It is the most--well, it could be the most powerful organization in this country as it relates to blacks; have the largest number of churches and the largest number of members, and if there was adequate unity, it would be the voice to reckon with in this country.  We've had a lot of problems in National Baptists, including the [Rev.] Henry Lyons' situation.  And we're coming out of that now with Dr. Shaw.  We have the World Baptists, the Baptists World Center.  Hopefully, we're gonna pay that off before June.  That will free us economically to start doing some other things that we ought to have been doing long ago.  And we're going to see our American Baptist College [Nashville, Tennessee] come to be a premier college and begin to put together evangelism missions and those things that can impact upon this nation, and putting together people around this country and getting people registered to vote.  Yes, National Baptist Convention is one of the most potentially potent organizations in this country because of the physical status, but spiritually.  And I always go back there because I, I realize what God has done in my life as a person, and I could not be doing what I'm doing now had it not been for God.  And National Baptists Convention has faith in God.
Story_ID: 7024
Speaker 1: What do you see as the potential for the church, you know, through the convention or the, you know, the Baptist church, what do you see as, as the true potential, unrealized potential?
Speaker 2: Well, let me go back and lend a little bit of history to deal with what I want to deal with because when you think of slavery, and you think of 1860, the beginning of the Civil War, two things happened that was an act of God.  The abolitionists were people who wanted to abolish slavery, and they were Christian people.  Many of them believe in God.  So out of that created an environment for the Civil War.  In 1863, Mr. [Abraham] Lincoln had to make a choice, whether he would free the slaves or destroy the Union, and his choice was to free the slaves.  God created that environment.  It was never the intention of the Southern white man to free slaves in this country.  The only way the slaves were freed and their descendants are free today is because of an act of God.  Now, we tell the story of Israel and how God miraculously freed Israel from Egypt, but the black church don't tell our story.  So the first thing we've got to do is to lift up the fact that we only free because God set us free.  Then we have to give praises to God for what he has done.  God expects the black church to be the salvation of this nation.  Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said it, but I've always believed it, that the black church has the responsibility of being catalyst for the salvation of this nation.  Why do I say that?  Because we have everything to forgive the whites for.  We've never abused anybody.  We've never held anybody in slavery.  We've never denied anyone of their rights, dehumanized.  But we have everything to forgive them for.  And we must do that because we're Christians, because that's the Christian way of life.  Pray for those who despitefully use you, love those who hate you.  That's the Christian way of life, and, and God expects us to make this difference in society.  We've got to teach this to our, our members as difficult as it is because that's a strange kind of teaching, coming down in, in 2002, that we've got forgive and we've got to rise above anger and hostility.  But if we're gonna do it God's way, that's what we have to do.  And the National Baptist Convention has that potential and has that power to do what God wants done and bring about a transformation in this country.
Speaker 1: Now, I was asking a question really more about the institution itself and the resources available and how those resources could be better utilized, even down to the individual church member.  But I think that, you know--and that's why I was asking about, sort of, you know, reputations, you know,question, because I think that there is a tremendous amount of resources--.
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: It's the single most important institution in the African American community, still today, it has been and still today.  But the black community still suffers a great deal, and so the question is, how do you think that institution might be able to do a better job at what it's doing?
Speaker 2: Yes, first of all, it's paying off the national--the Baptist World Center [Nashville, Tennessee], then hiring persons to serve as director of evangelism, stewardship, mission, home mission, foreign mission, to serve as directors of voter registration campaigns and just to, to get out into the country and, and, and bring people together around issues that matters, and to fund some of these efforts from National Baptists coffers.  And I think National Baptists will be able to do that in the future, but from yea past to now, National Baptists just have not had the money.  More money was coming in during the [Rev. Henry] Lyons area--era, but that was not the money that National Baptists had to do the kind of things that you're talking about, funding programs, getting out dealing with the AIDS issue, which of epidemic proportions in our country, not just in Columbus [Georgia], but in our country, to dilute illiteracy, to see what we can do to dilute the strength of gangs in this country.  And so National Baptists has that as a mandate.  We have to do that, and the money that is coming into the National Baptists Convention, I feel, will eventually be directed in those areas.
Story_ID: 7025
Speaker 1: Do you, with the church here, with Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church, are you, are there things that you want that you have not been able to accomplish, that you want to see accomplished?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes (laughs).  We, we--we've wanted for a long time to develop a music school, and while we are just getting started, I hope to see that become a full school one day, where we can have accomplished musicians going out of here and being able to serve anywhere in this nation.  I want to develop a grade school.  We have a daycare center, very small.  We're in process now, planning to build a center that will hold two hundred infants and children; then to go on to a grade school.  I'd like see us develop a foster home.  We need to go out--and that's on the drawing board, to go out and purchase several acres of land, at least fifty acres, if not more, to build houses that we can take these foster children to and put parents in them and let them provide a home-like environment for many of these foster children.  We really need to develop some kind of clinic, and there isn't, one that I've learned about in Columbus [Georgia] now.  We need a clinic that's going to reach out to underprivileged people, and that they can have, they can go and, if they don't have any money, they still can be treated, that kind of thing.  So those are some of the aspirations that I have reference to, the outreach into the community.

Speaker 1: And, sir, in terms of your ministry, do you feel that you've matured and if so, how?  How has your ministry matured?
Speaker 2: Have I, as a person, or the ministry?
Speaker 1: As a minister, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, as a minister.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, I feel that I have matured as a minister, and I, I will tell you right off, controlling my temper.  That's one way I've--that's my measuring rode.  But early on, I, I was very quick and wasn't quite in control.  But I've become more enduring, long suffering and that kind of thing.  I've been able to listen more and to evaluate more than to being so quick on the tongue.

Speaker 1: In terms of what is black theology, do you believe that there's a black theology? And if so, what is it?
Speaker 2: Most definitely.  That's why I was, I went back to that little piece about God delivering us from slavery because that's out of the black experience.  And that's the, that's the thing we need to do.  We need to deal with our relationship to God out of the black experience, and that, that's what theology--we study the black experience and see how God relates to us and how we relate to God, and tell our story and do our teaching and our preaching out of the black experience.

Speaker 1: And, sir, I, I have a question from Sam (Adams-interview observer), but they'll say, there she goes again. But, and, you know, I, I have been curious about the mega-church, you know, that is developing currently.  Church--you know, you're in a smaller community, but there are churches now that have, you know, ministries that go up to--I mean not, they have congregations that go as far as, you know, seventeen thousand, eighteen thousand, nineteen thousand, you know.  And I was wondering, you know, what your thoughts about those--I know everyone would like to have--.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: --lots of members (laughs).  But I was wondering if you have any thoughts about that because it sets up a whole--those are, they tend to be--well, they can be more of a enterpr--and they're huge.  And, you know, in the past, you know, if someone had a thousand or three thousand, that was a large congregation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I, I think if, if the pastor of the church can maintain a sense of God and stay focused on the mission and the ministry and lead the church in that direction, they are fine.  But if the pastor lose focus and begin to think he's God, and everything begin to center around him and his wife, then I think that it's not good for the country.
Speaker 1: And what do you think people don't know about, you know, pastoring a church that they, you know, they might be surprised about, you know?  I mean because you have to be a very good manager of your time, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you're actually running a whole operation, you know, and yet, you're also trying to take care of people's spiritual needs, and, you know, and other needs that they may have in, you know, times of sickness or death.  And, you know, or other, you know, catastrophes that happen to them, and I'm just wondering how a person, you know, how a person handles that themselves?
Speaker 2: Well, for me when I, when I first started, of course, I, it was a chore because I had to learn what to do.  But as I grew in the ministry, I was able to coordinate and to do the things that I needed to do, but one thing I think I didn't do so well, and that is to spend the kind of quality time with my family that I should have.  Members don't always realize that the pastor has a family too.  They think when they call, he's supposed to come, don't care what time it is.  If there's a funeral, regardless to what he's doing, he stop it and go do the funeral.  And I did that, I did that.  And my oldest son constantly remind me that I didn't spend the time with him that he would have liked for me to have spent, cause he's preaching now.  And he has a daughter, and he makes sure she has that quality time.  My wife was very understanding and still is.  We've been married fifty years.  And she didn't worry about me going and being and doing what I had to do, but as I look back, I wish I had spent more time with her and the children when we were younger.

Speaker 1: I want to ask you about is, because you've been involved in social activism and social change, and I wanted you to talk about the church's role, you know, really as sort of a change agent, you know, not some place that, you know, not just a spiritual sort of house of worship, but a place that's more active, you know, from a social standpoint?
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's what the church is.  It's, it's, it's task is a change agent.
Speaker 1: Is that the black church or is that all churches?
Speaker 2: It should be all churches, but I, I--I tend to think that it's going to need to start with the black church.  But all churches are tasked to be light, and I have to go there, because light does transform.  And that's what the church is to do, to transform the society in which it's located politically, economically, socially, educationally.  And I'm lifting up to our people that in order for the church to impact upon society, first of all, the members, as they come to worship, must develop biblical convictions.  They must develop principles set by Jesus, like Jesus and moral standards, their convictions, principles and moral standards should be what conducts their daily lives.  Whatever they do in life ought to be based on conviction, principles and standards so that in the voting booth, they vote to represent God, not themselves, and will vote because they like the man.  But does he stand for principles based on the teaching of the Bible.  That's how the church is going to transform society when members are convinced with principles and standards.

Speaker 1: And when you look at your life, sir, and when I think back, you know, to Pumpkin Bottom [Phenix CIty, Alabama], and, you know, in your early years, and you see where you've come to, and I'm wondering, you know, with that what, what would you want your legacy to be?  You know, well, what would you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: The only thing I can think of is, he gave his best to the service of God, and that's, that's what I am.  That's who I am.  That's what I am.

Speaker 1: I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is (laughs), well, I can't even eat my favorite food now (laughs).  But I, I like steak, black eye peas, rice, cornbread, sweet potato pie.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I have not had a lots of vacations.  I had always wanted to do a cruise in the Greek Isles, and I think that because of the study I've done, that might be the highlight of my life.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Look where he brought me from.

Speaker 1: But how would you describe this, this place called Columbus, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Columbus, Georgia is a community of people, some rich, some poor, some learned, some unlearned with some people in the higher echelon with a consciousness to social justice.  And there are, the larger number of people in Columbus, does not demonstrate a consciousness of social justice.  As a result, we have some problem racially, and we have some people who are dehumanized, and there are people who are not making what they could make--what they should make in order to have a decent living.  You have a lots of people who are the working poor.
