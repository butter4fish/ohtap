Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am--oh, observing is Vi Davis, Viola Davis.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Is [HistoryMaker] Geraldine de Haas.  G-E-R-A-L-D-I-N-E, de Haas is lower case or small D-E-space-H-A-A-S as in Sam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of name is de Haas?
Speaker 2: It's, it's really a Dutch name.  It's a Dutch name.  But before I married my husband [Edgar de Haas], my name was Geraldine Weidman Bey.
Speaker 1: Weidman Bey.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, I think you told me one time, a long time ago, if I remember correctly, ma'am, that de Haas means the rabbit or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The hare.
Speaker 1: The hare.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So I got a pretty good memory (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  You certainly do.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, Weidman Bey, now, there's a story behind that too because Weidman would be like a--
Speaker 2: Like either German or, or a Dutch name.  But Bey is like a Moorish name.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am, right.  So it indicates your family is involved in the [The] Moorish Science Temple [of America]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what does Bey mean in the Moorish Science Temple?  Is it a--does it have a particular meaning?
Speaker 2: Well actually, I guess I really don't know.  You're asking--I've not studied under that belief in a long time, since the death of my father [Andrew Weidman Bey].  But, you know, we--I'm from a family of nine people and the first part of the family were all born, you know, under the Christian, you know, their regular name, Weidman, and when the last few kids were born, we were all born Weidman Bey and that was because of, you know, my father's belief in a certain--in the Moorish Science Temple.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you give us your, your place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: My place of birth was Newark, New Jersey, on January 16, 1935.  I was born the 16th and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was born the 15th, so I'm a day after Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation at one time--well, I've done a whole bunch of stuff, you know, in growing up in Newark, New Jersey.  I've had small jobs with department stores and, you know, working as a clerk in many instances.  But my occupation today is just the founder and chief executive officer of Jazz Unites, Incorporated [Chicago, Illinois], which was founded in 1981.
Speaker 1: All right.  And it would be fair to say that you are a singer, a performer?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a singer.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And for many years, I traveled with a sister [Salome Bey] and brother [Andrew W. Bey].  We traveled throughout this country and we traveled throughout a lot of European countries, meaning London [England], Spain, France, Germany, and then when I got married, we lived in Germany for a while and I began to just operate on my own without Andy and The Bey Sisters.  We--I joined Free Street Theater [Chicago, Illinois] in which we went to Yugoslavia and went to France and, and worked the Pierre Cardin Theatre [Espace Pierre Cardin, Paris, France] and we went to Belgium, but we were also in Belgium when I was with Andy and The Bey Sisters.  But a lot of history was made of Andy and The Bey Sisters in Paris [France].  We did a movie with Roger Vadim who was at one time the husband of Brigitte Bardot.
Speaker 1: That's the person that we call Roger Vadim now, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's Roger.
Speaker 1: It's Roger, Roger Vadim.
Speaker 2: Vadim, yes.
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna ask you about that--about all that later.  I just wanted to establish the fact that you are a musician, a singer--
Speaker 2: --Yes, I was a singer--
Speaker 1: --performer--
Speaker 2: --and an arts administrator.
Speaker 1: Yes, an arts administrator at the Illinois Arts Council [Agency, Chicago, Illinois] for ten years.  I started working for the arts council in 1933--I'm sorry, 1983--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I worked there until 1993, and that's when I began to work for Jazz Unites full-time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Now, before we go and--oh, I'm sorry.  What is today's date?
Speaker 1: Today's date is July 30, 19--no, I'm sorry 2004.
Speaker 2: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: We're at the, the South Shore Business Center [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The South Shore Business Center in which the Jazz Unites office is located within this center.  This is like a incubator for many small businesses and Jazz Unites is one, and we are located in this building.
Story_ID: 220236
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth in the interview, we ask five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they only require a short, lightweight answer.  And the first question is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  My favorite food?  I really don't know.  I don't have a favorite food.  I think I like a lot of 'em, you know, in terms of--I love my mother's [Victoria Johnson Bey] cooking.  That's all I can say as it's the way my mother used to prepare things was just wonderful, the way she prepared lamb was just terrific.  And a lot of people don't even like lamb, but the way she cooked it--she made it just fantastic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not too hot, maybe spring, fall.  Fall, just before it gets really cold particularly here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't go on vacation much.  I find myself working all the time, so I don't have a favorite destination at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And finally, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was always do the best you can and then some.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do the best you can in life and then some.
Story_ID: 220237
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Andrew Weidman Bey] side of the family.  I'm gonna start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Victoria Johnson.  That's V-I-C-T-O-R-I-A, Johnson, the way Johnson is spelled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born in Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Do you know her birthdate?
Speaker 2: Her birthdate was March 10, I think 1906.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now how much do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I really can't trace it back far at all.  I mean, I've--I remember my older sister telling me that my mother used to have a farm where they had cows and chickens and all that kind of stuff and that how the--because of racism in that part of the country, they made her--you know, they had to flee in the middle of the night to--for safety.
Speaker 1: So they, they actually left the--they, they had to flee the South--
Speaker 2: They had to flee the South.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: They had to flee the South because of, you know, the racism that was going on there and people wanting their land.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any more specifics to this story you can tell us that you know of?
Speaker 2: No.  I--there really isn't because my older sister told me that, you know, not too long ago, and that's about all she told me.  She said that, you know--I think my mother is, you know--I really think I'm full African descent, you know, I'm a very African woman.  But my mother said that she has some Cherokee [Native American] blood in her and that's possible, but my father was an African man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was like a homebody, my mother, you know.  She had nine kids and that's all she could be was a homebody, just home taking care of the kids.  And growing up in Newark, New Jersey, they--we finally had a one family house, not that we owned it, but I guess with all of those kids, people wouldn't allow her to live in an apartment, you know, with all those kids.  So she was able to get a one family house on Rutger [ph.] Street, 65 Rutger Street, and that's where I used to live in Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five Rutger, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now do you know what year your mother's family had to move to New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea.  I know all the kids were born in Newark.
Story_ID: 220238
Speaker 1: So--and, and my--there was seven--nine--seven girls and two boys--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I know they were all born in Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Well since we're on this subject, can you name your brothers and sisters for us in order and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --tell us where, where you fit?
Speaker 1: Okay, the first one was Lorraine and I really don't remember what year she was born or when she died and, and that may be purposely 'cause I don't wanna remember.  But my first sister was Lorraine and she's dead.  The second one was Katherine and she's--this is the one who told me about my mother [Victoria Johnson Bey] fleeing, you know, where they lived.  And then there was a sister Florence who's also dead.  And there's a sister Sadie.  And then there's a brother Josiah who's also dead.  Sadie is dead and my oldest brother is dead.  Then there's a sister, Salome [Bey] who now lives in Canada and is married with two kids.  And then there's me and I have two kids as well.  And then there's my sister Marjorie who still lives in New Jersey.  And then there's my brother Andy Bey [Andrew W. Bey] who lives in New York.
Story_ID: 220239
Speaker 1: Well, can you tell us about your mother's [Victoria Johnson Bey] personality and, and what she did, you know, for a living, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, she was a homemaker, you know.  She was there with her kids and she was a very good cook and I'm told that once--at one time she used to work at a restaurant where she did some of the cooking, but that was basically what it was.  But she had the --I guess the sweetest, patient personality until you get her angry, and then when she was angry, she was really angry.  I remember one time she saw this pregnant woman being beaten by his wife--being beaten by her husband, and she almost ran out there to defend that woman, and, I mean she was up in age and this was a crazy man, but she just couldn't bear to watch this woman being beaten and she was going to be a mother, and we had to hold her back. But that's the kind of person my mother was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any--did you meet your grandparents on that side?
Speaker 2: I never met my grandparents.
Speaker 1: So, they were dead by, you know--
Speaker 2: By the time--
Speaker 1: --By the time you were born.--
Speaker 2: --I was born, as far as I know, they were gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the seventh child of nine children, so some of my older sisters had the opportunity to meet their grandparents.
Speaker 1: Now did, did your mother go to school in New--
Speaker 2: No, she didn't, she didn't have a school education.
Story_ID: 220240
Speaker 1: And maybe my father went to school as well 'cause I knew he knew how to read.  My mother [Victoria Johnson Bey] didn't know how to read and she was finally trying to learn how to read just before she passed away.  But my father, I don't know what kind of education he had, but he knew how to read.  And he was the type of a man who was always seeking the truth and trying to find out the history of his people.  He said because he knows that, you know, we didn't just come from slavery, you know, that slavery was--we just fell out of the sky and we were slaves.  He just wanted to know the history of African people, so he was always trying to seek knowledge and he would go anywhere to try to learn how to, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --find out about African people.
Speaker 2: Now while we're on him, let-- can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: His full name is Andrew Weidman, at that time when he was born he wasn't a Bey, he was born Andrew Weidman, and he became Andrew Weidman Bey.
Speaker 2: Right.  And--
Speaker 1: And he was born in Georgia as well, but I don't remember what little town or anything like that.
Speaker 2: Do you know his birthday?
Speaker 1: His birthday was--he was March as well, March 20th, probably 1905 or something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What do you know about his side of the family?  Do you know very much about them?
Speaker 1: I didn't know anything about his side of the family.  I just knew my father.  My father was always trying to find out about history and what we were and who we were as a people, and I remember talking to us all the time about how to eat and how to live and how to be and how to learn, and learn not only the history that--the stuff that they taught you in school but how to learn about other history, what they didn't teach you in school, to try to find out who you were as a people or as a person, and that was my father.  And how to eat properly so that you weren't sick, so--and, and as a matter of fact, one of the persons coming to town to, to work with us this summer at the festival is Ahmad Jamal who knew my father very well and, and, and he used to get like beef bacon from my father because my father was always trying to teach us how to eat healthy and how to learn about who we were as a people.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now I wanna get into that into some depth, but can you tell us, did, did your father go to school?  And--well you, you said you didn't really know--
Speaker 1: --I didn't know--
Speaker 2: --what, what his school background was--
Speaker 1: --whether he went to school, but he knew how to read, you know.  I knew that he knew how to read, but I didn't know what kind of education he had.
Speaker 2: Now, now what did he do for a living?
Speaker 1: He was a window washer, and he started out washing windows I guess and--where he was but he ended up climbing those big, tall buildings in New York where he washed windows.  And I know when we [Andy and The Bey Sisters] were on the road at one time, somebody sent us a picture of my father because somehow he was--he missed a step and was hanging from one of those big, tall buildings, and they sent us this picture with him in--not hanging, but he was in--they had a--he was on a stretcher by the time they got him down because he was saved.  But he loved that job.  He, he met a lot of people and a lot of people loved to talk to him for whatever reason, you know, people where he worked in these very big official buildings and, you know, because he was a window washer, and they just wanted to know about Andrew Bey, and, they just thought he was a very smart man.  And he really didn't--I don't know what kind of education he had.  I really just never knew.  But he was a reader and was very much interested in, in the life of our people.
Story_ID: 220241
Speaker 1: Now do you know how he [Haas' father, Andrew Weidman Bey] got started with The Moorish Science Temple [of America] or?  'Cause you, you say--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --he was always digging for information--
Speaker 2: Always digging for information.
Speaker 1: --and about what year did he get involved with Moorish Science?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was before we were born.  It was before I was born, you know.  It had to be around when maybe--I don't know if it's my older brother--my oldest brother [Josiah Weidman Bey] was born, because he had like all of these--four girls before we had a--before we had--he had a son, and maybe around that time, that's when he, you know, got into this way of working and thinking and trying to find out historically who we were as black people.
Speaker 1: You know, there's so--I know there was so much going on the East Coast when--all around--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the country, really.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And it's like a history that really hasn't been fully told.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Parts have been told, but--of the search for our history and culture and--
Speaker 2: --Yes.  Well, he was, he was heavily into that, had searched for our history and culture.
Speaker 1: Now had, he ever been a member of the U.N.I.A. [Universal Negro Improvement Association] do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: Of Marcus Garvey's organization?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: I know around the same--I think Noble Drew Ali founded the--
Speaker 2: Right.  I remember that name growing up as a child.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Noble--now he started it here in Chicago [Illinois; sic. founded in Newark, New Jersey], Noble Drew did and I--well, no, it may not have been here.  I take that back.  I'm not sure where he started, but he did have a headquarters here at one time and there was quite a bit written about, you know, his activities in Chicago.  But, so did, did you--I mean, so he was involved in Moorish Science before you, you were born.
Speaker 2: Yes, before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And other than the name, having the name Bey at the end of your name, and then changing dietary habits and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing, what, what, what other cultural changes were--
Speaker 2: Well, he, he made us feel like we were capable of doing anything we wanted to do and, and persevere and stick to it because all of his life he was always trying, always trying to, to make business and create business.  He opened a few restaurants where they were--he was trying to serve the proper food, but he just never had the, the, the wherewithal to, to get things right, you know.  He--but he was always trying and I think, I guess that's where I got my strength from, from the things that I do right now, never givin' up until we got that park to do that concert downtown in Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois].  Because I thought this was a strange city when I moved here.
Story_ID: 220242
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Victoria Johnson Bey and Andrew Weidman Bey] meet?  Did they have--was there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know how they met.  I really don't know how my parents met.
Speaker 1: Do you know if they met in Georgia or in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Probably--I think probably--well, I don't know.  It could've been New Jersey.  It could've been New Jersey where they met and not necessarily in Georgia, but I don't know, Larry [Crowe].  I really don't know.  And that's something that they--that we didn't talk about as much and should have, you know, should've found out a little bit more about my parents and where they met and how they met and all those kinds of things, but we just didn't.
Story_ID: 220243
Speaker 1: Well, what is your--do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Early childhood memory.  I just remember seeing my sisters dance to the music of [Duke] Ellington and, and Count Basie, and all of those people, but--and then--I'm just trying' to think.  Maybe I should've thought about these things a little bit more.  And during the holidays, how we--the house always smells so much of my mother's [Victoria Johnson Bey] cooking, the sweet potato pies and the baked turkeys and stuff of that nature, and we could smell it while we were upstairs in the bed.  I just remember those smells and those time--that, that time of year when the holidays came around, how we would eat ourselves like pigs, you know, in terms of that time and how--just how good it was to have all those sisters and brothers.  I mean--and the thing about it is our house was called the music house because we always had a piano, always had some kind of raggedy piano in the house where Andy [Andrew W. Bey], who learned to play at the age of three, was like a child prodigy in Newark, New Jersey, and we always had music in our house, whether Andy was making' it or we were singing it or they were playing' it on the victrola that, they called at that time.  It was a musical house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your--either of your parents play any, any instrument?
Speaker 2: My father [Andrew Weidman Bey], they said he played the, the tuba, but I never saw him play.  I've only remembered him sitting at the piano once in a blue moon singing 'Rock of Ages.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I remember about my father.
Speaker 1: So you had a lot of music going' on in the house and--
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: A lot of radio?
Speaker 2: A lot of radio, yes indeed, a lot of radio.
Speaker 1: Records and--
Speaker 2: And records.  And then when Andy learned to play, a lot of music coming from him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they used to take him around a lot and he was like three years old when he began to bang out some music.
Story_ID: 220244
Speaker 1: Can you think back and, and tell us some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights.  I just remember as kids, we--the sights were, you know, the kids on their bicycle riding up and down the street, of Rutger [ph.] Street [Newark, New Jersey], but we never had the--you know, or skating, roller skating, some of that.  But, you know, when other people had, you know, like television and things of that, we didn't have that until we moved to another house in New Jersey.  But, you know, like some of the neighbors' kids, just being with our neighbors' kids and the--they used to barbecue like almost--'cause next door to our house was like a big lot and people in the community used to come out there during the summer and make barbecue, so you smelled barbecue on the weekend all the time or whenever those people came out to do their cooking on that lot next door.  And then, you know, around--in my own house, my mother [Victoria Johnson Bey] making bread pudding and making greens, and lamb, and just good food, you know.  She was just terrific, the way she cooked.  I mean, she could clean out the ice box and make it smell like, you know, a fine restaurant, 'cause that's how well she cooked, and she knew about spices and how to use them.  How she knew that, I don't know.  I don't--I don't realize how she--I didn't realize how--you know, what she knew about spices, but she knew how to use spices, and so that was always wonderful, those kinds of smells.  And sounds--you know, where I grew up, there were--particularly around my oldest brother's [Josiah Weidman Bey] time, a lot of drugs in the community, a lot of drugs, you know.  And as a matter of fact, as a young person, he became involved with drugs, you know.  I mean, that was the only one in our family of nine people who became involved with drugs was my oldest brother.
Speaker 1: What drugs--what was he involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, taking it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, was it--was it heroin or?
Speaker 2: I think it was heroin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: And so that's during the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something' like that, but many--most of those people that he palled around with were dead way before he was.  My brother just died at the age of probably sixty-seven.  He died at the age of sixty-seven.  He lived far past, you know, the people that he used to hang with, but it was a sad situation at that time in the community, you know, where drugs were just rampant in Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And Newark really has a reputation of being one of the toughest urban centers in the country, I mean, for--especially for black people, you know.
Speaker 2: Yep.  It was--it was pretty rough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you remember even when you were young, drugs being a major problem.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 220245
Speaker 1: Now did--was there a Moorish Science Temple [The Moorish Science Temple of America] that you all attended on a regular basis like--
Speaker 2: --I don't remember--
Speaker 1: --people going to church, or?--
Speaker 2: --attending a temple, but evidently my father [Andrew Weidman Bey] did.  I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --attending a Moorish Science Temple.  I remember my father just mainly talking to us and talking to us about, you know, different things and beliefs and all of that, and I, I don't remember going to a temple of any kind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't a, a situation where he brought the family--your whole family to a temple or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, my mother [Victoria Johnson Bey] was still a Christian, you know.  My father had his thing going' but my mother had her thing going', you know, so it wasn't like they were all in sync with, you know, their various beliefs.  And that's why we really never had much of a, --what do you call--a church or a temple going at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your mother go to church on a regular basis?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't remember her going to church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But she was a very spiritual woman, very spiritual.  And I remember my mother's sisters used to get on her about, you need to go to church, Victoria, you know, and, and they went to church every Sunday, and were the biggest crooks you ever wanted to know about, you know.  They were gamblers and, and all kinds of stuff, and they would get on my-- and when they finally cleaned up, they told my mother, you, you need to go to church, Victoria.  So my mother just, just listened and--but she was very strong-willed in her own way, you know.  No one could tell her what to do.  She may appear to be simple-minded, but she wasn't.  She was quite a strong lady.
Story_ID: 220777
Speaker 1: I'm still intrigued about your father [Andrew Weidman Bey] and his readings and studies and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the books that he brought home to read?  Any of the history books?
Speaker 2: I know he brought home books and he read a lot, but I just remember him just talking to us an awful lot about, you know, who we were and that we should, you know, walk tall because we were important people, and you come from a great history, and he really tried to instill that in us and, and I think it was instilled definitely in the younger kids, you know, meaning like my sister, Salome [Bey], and my brother, Andy [Andrew W. Bey], and maybe not so much Marjorie.  But I know he--I just thought so highly of my father in terms of what he has given me and the kind of strength that he has given me to do what I felt I had to do to move forward with whatever I was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he read the black papers?  Did they come to your house?
Speaker 2: I don't remember black papers coming to my house.  Now maybe they did, I just don't remember any of that--
Speaker 1: Like--
Speaker 2: --I don't remember--
Speaker 1: --Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] or the [New York] Amsterdam News or--
Speaker 2: Probably he read all of that.  He probably read all of that and was well aware of Marcus Garvey and all of those people.  He was probably well aware of all of those things and those are the things that he brought to his children.  You know, I know I had some older sisters, one who was a--my sister, Florence, she tried to, you know, work a lot with my father in terms of the store he was trying to build or the restaurant he was trying to make, and she eventually became a wonderful seamstress and used to make all of our clothes, meaning my sister and me, make the clothes that we wore on the stage, and through that--our clothes, wearing them and how unique they were, she got customers like Sarah Vaughan and, and Carmen McRae, 'cause Sarah Vaughan was born in Newark, New Jersey, so she got to know my sister, Florence, very well, and I remember Sarah sitting in my sister's home, you know, doing some sewing on her clothes.  But it--she was determined like my father as well, and my sister, Sadie, as well.  You know, she became a beautician and she also became fascinated with food and trying' to eat right and all of those kinds of things, but that all came from my father, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now where did you go to school in Newark?
Speaker 2: I went to Newton Street School in Newark, New Jersey.  That's Newton Street.  That was my grammar school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go there for the whole--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, I went there for the whole time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I graduated--I'm just trying to remember where I was in the--in, in, you know, in terms of the, the numbers that I, I achieved.  But I really didn't look at the meaning of school and how important it was until I got to, I guess, junior high school, and because my father's teaching, once again, would say you need to learn and this and that, and he encouraged us because of the history that we--that I knew about myself as a human being, that, you know, you are capable of doing or becoming anything you want to become because of what--how he talked to us all the time.  That was in high--junior high school.  And then when I went to high school [West Side High School, Newark, New Jersey], I really, you know, used to question the teachers about some of the things that they would say and I would question them.  I'd say, well why are you saying this or that?  You know, well, what does this mean?  You're making statements that makes no sense to me.  And, and I would challenge the teachers in the classroom from time to time because of my father.

Speaker 1: Let's go back to grade school [Newton Street School, Newark, New Jersey] for a second and--now what--how would you describe yourself as a little girl going to school?
Speaker 2: Rather nondescript, you know.  How could I say it?  What would I say about myself and --I really don't remember.  There was nothing that important to me in grammar school.  I was just a regular person, still trying to learn and trying to--you know, and not really trying to do the best I can be or be the best I can be in school in terms of just a lot of things.  I just went to school every day and I just went to school.
Speaker 1: Now you're rather tall.  Were you--were you tall when you were little?
Speaker 2: I would say average size, you know, not real tall, not real short.  And I wasn't a sports person, you know, 'cause I remember kids in school, those little short girls used to run like--and can run--they could be in the Olympics, they ran so quick, but I was never a part of that.  And maybe--I'm trying' to think when I became a part of the music scene.  I really don't remember becoming a part of the music scene until I got to junior high.  And then in high school [West Side High School, Newark, New Jersey], I really did a lot of singing.
Speaker 1: Now were you aware of the fact that you had a good voice when you were little?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Never thought about that?
Speaker 2: No.  Never thought about it.  It was always my--Andy [Andrew W. Bey] and Salome [Bey] had the voices.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought they had terrific voices.  I never thought of myself as having' a great voice.  And when I was really young, I used to like opera, you know, and that's why one sister used to call me a real phony because I liked opera, and sometimes I was afraid to say that I liked opera publicly in my community because I would be called a phony.
Story_ID: 220779
Speaker 1: Andy [Andrew W. Bey] was a prodigy you're saying.
Speaker 2: You're right.  Yes he was.
Speaker 1: Age three he was playing the piano and--
Speaker 2: Right.  And then around nine years old, he was singing.  He did the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] with Louis [Thomas] Jordan when he was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Gee.  Now we just interviewed a lady [HistoryMaker Doris Humphries] who danced with Louis Jordan for two years and she was a big part of the show, used to do the 'Caldonia' number with--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Louis Jordan, right.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: So Andy was singing with Louis Jordan when he was nine years old.
Speaker 2: When he was nine years old, he did the Apollo Theater with Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you were--you're older than he is, right?  So you--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm older than he is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Andy will be sixty-five in October.  I'll be seventy in January.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got about five years.
Speaker 2: About four or five years on him.
Speaker 1: So, so you're actually in high school when he starts, you know, making a big name for himself as a singer.
Speaker 2: And so--but Andy went to Arts High [School, Newark, New Jersey], you know, which he said and the only thing he liked about school was lunch.  But--
Speaker 1: Now what high school was this?
Speaker 2: Arts High.  That's the school that Sarah Vaughan went to, James Moody, all went to Arts High.  And, of course, I went to West Side High [School, Newark, New Jersey].  That was a college preparatory school, high school, and that's when I really got into, to music.  But when I was in--I'm trying' to think, when I was in, in high school, there was a teacher there who loved my voice and they, they wanted me to try out for the Marian Anderson scholarship, and I said, well, no, I'm not gonna try out for Marian Anderson scholarship because she's having such a hard time and I used to love Marian Anderson, I still do.  As a matter of fact, I do a tribute to her every year because I think her voice is so magnificent and so stirring that it, it--you know, I--she, to me is just one of the greatest.  But I was afraid to, to even try because I felt well, you know, I will never make it as a vocalist singing that kind of music, so I didn't even try out for the Marian Anderson scholarship.  And when I got into high school, I felt that European classical music for me was too stiff.
Speaker 1: Now you liked it earlier, right?  When you were younger?
Speaker 2: But I loved opera, that's right.
Speaker 1: Opera.
Speaker 2: But when they wanted me to do it in school, and even when I was at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois]--now I'm in college already.  But in school, they tried to get me to sing European classical music, but--and I really loved it when I was in school and had to do concerts and performances in school, I thought it was wonderful.  But when I really got into jazz and started singing, because I was the last one to really get into that music, you know, compared to Salome [Bey] and Andy.  Andy was working at it already and Salome was doing some singing and had--you know, she was like the Ruth Brown of New Jersey, but I was not into that kind of music.  And then when I studied in college at Chicago State University and I saw how strict they were, I said, no, this is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna sing this kind of music.  I mean, you know, they're trying to put me in a bag and I can't stir from this.  I remember when I was trying to do a [Franz] Schubert tune, which is a gorgeous tune, but it has such a long ending, I thought I could add a little musical piece to it, a vocal piece to it.  The teacher almost had a heart attack.  When I said, "Well, can I do this?"  They said, "[HistoryMaker] Geraldine [de Haas], you can't do that."  I mean, it's--so, I said, well I know I don't wanna be in this kind of music, not at all, because if I can't bring what I feel to a piece of music, then it's not for me, and I knew that that music could never be for me.
Story_ID: 220780
Speaker 1: How did you first become exposed to classical music?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I--when I was in, I guess, high school [West Side High School, Newark, New Jersey], I used to listen to--I had to listen to Marian Anderson and certain things because of the courses that we had and I was very much into music in high school.  They used to call me The Songbird, so I had to listen to certain programs that dealt with concerts, like Marian Anderson and some of the great classical singers and symphonies; I had to listen to all of that.  So I did.  That's how I began to get into classical music.  And then when I got to college [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], I had to listen to it even more because of--I was studying music education.  I, I got a degree in music education.
Speaker 1: The same for opera?  Did you, did you--you said you liked opera when you were younger.  Did--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, I liked opera--
Speaker 1: --When, when did you first hear opera?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I guess when I was fourteen or fifteen and I used to--you know, liked to listen to it on the radio, and my sister, one--the one that's still living now said that I was a real phony because I liked that music.  And it wasn't until there was another black person in the community who talked about, you know, Mario Lanza and how much she loved him.  And I said well, gee, if she can say that out loud, so can I.  She encouraged me to speak my mind about liking that kind of music, because before I was afraid to say it.
Speaker 1: That's something.  So, so there was sort of a stigma, I guess, for those who liked opera, I guess.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Well, just like a stigma today, you know, if kids are too educated and they wanna talk the way they should be talking, they say, oh, you acting white.  You know and that's that same--
Speaker 1: And that's what--
Speaker 2: --kind of stigma that I was acting--
Speaker 1: That's what Bill Cosby just got in trouble for saying, you know, he said that and got in a lot of trouble.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, but he stood his ground.  He said, it, it is true.  They do that.  They do that, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they should really get over that because, you know, you should be open to listen to anything you wanna listen to no matter what it is because you never know where you're going to get inspiration or what you're gonna get inspiration from.  And you can--you know, I used to love Mario Lanza.  I used to go--and we used to go to the movies and--and that's another thing, I got a lot of classical music from the movies.  I used to love Deanna Durbin and Jane Powell, and all of those people who sang that kind of music; I loved it and used to go home and try to sing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go to the movies a lot?
Speaker 2: We went to the movies a lot, a lot.  And particularly when it came to musicals, we would sit in there and, and come out of the movies--you know, we sit there all day to see the movies over and over and over again until we--when we came out, we knew how to sing every song and know all the music to everything, and it was--it just--it was just incredible.  I loved people like Judy Garland and Doris Day, and all those people singing all those wonderful songs.
Story_ID: 220781
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers in grade school [Newton Street School, Newton, New Jersey] that really served as a mentor to you really?  That--
Speaker 2: There was a Ms. Grinkovich [ph.].  She was--
Speaker 1: How do you--
Speaker 2: Russian.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I have no idea (laughter).  It was a Russian name and she was a Russian teacher and she really tried to get me to stick with European classical music.  I remember that name, but I have no idea how to spell it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Music.  I loved music.  History I didn't like because I thought it was turned upside down, you know.  And you know, when I'd talk to my father [Andrew Weidman Bey] and what they were telling me in school and listening to him, I said, no, something 'aint right.
Speaker 1: For instance, what's--what, what would be something they, they would say that you would take exception to in class?
Speaker 2: Let me see--let me see if I can think about--I really can't think.  I don't remember offhand some of the things they would say, but I knew.  It was like they used to say, well, that's his story.  Now, you know, you have to deal with your story, 'cause that's his story.  That's not history, but his story, and that's always, you know, what still comes back to me in terms of--and when I--as you grow older and you listen to what these politicians have to say, it's really their story.  They're not talking about your story.  And then I have such disbelief when they go into certain parts of Africa and they say this and that and that; I don't believe it.  I said, I don't believe any of that stuff because, you know, it's--it just--it's--it--they're telling their story and they're telling you--telling you what they want you to believe or think about certain people and, and what to believe or think about other people.  And like I don't know what's happening in the Middle East.  I mean, they say all kinds of things that you just don't know about anything, and I--and I would say--oh, I know one time, you know, when people talked about--and I may get in trouble for this, but when they, they said Jewish was a nationality, I said that's a religion.  I said that's not a nationality, that's a religion.  And, and I said, so I, I don't understand why a nation has to be born from a religion if it's not a nationality.  I mean, I don't understand that.  So I said, well, you know--so what's, what's your actual nationality?  And people would say, well I'm French or I'm this, I said, well why don't you say that?  You know, instead of saying that you're a religion.  But that I never understood either.
Story_ID: 220782
Speaker 1: You were in school during the time that--near the close of the war [World War II, WWII], right?  And--when the--when Israel was being formed and all that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  So that was a topic in the news a lot, I guess--
Speaker 2: --Yes--
Speaker 1: --as to why--
Speaker 2: --it was a topic in the news--
Speaker 1: --should it be or not or how should it be constructed and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well tell me about high school.  Now, you went to a different high school than some of your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Most of my family went to Central High School [Newark, New Jersey].  That's where Salome [Bey] went, and that's where Florence went, and that's where some of 'em went, but I went to West Side High [School, Newark, New Jersey] 'cause it was a college preparatory school.  And that--and actually I had to go way out of the community.  I'd have to take a bus and two buses maybe to go to that high school, but that was the school I wanted to go to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have to qualify for that school some sort of way or?
Speaker 2: Sort of.  You had to have good grades in order to get into that school, and my grades were good.  You know, when I left junior high, I really began to apply myself to getting good grades.  And then when I went to high school, I really applied myself to getting good grades because then I wanted to go to college.
Story_ID: 220783
Speaker 1: But the thing about it, when I took the exam for college, I failed miserably 'cause I get so nervous when I have to take tests, and I, I just can't settle down to get the thing right.  And they told me I--that I, I didn't qualify for Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], and I went to Chicago State and I begged them.  I said please give me the opportunity to be here, you know.  I said I know I could do this or that or that or this.  And I was--I graduated a cum laude at, at Chicago State.  'Cause all of--the hardest subjects were my music subjects because I didn't know how to read music, but I had incredible ears.  Anything pertaining to listening, I could tell 'em, oh, I know what that is, you know.  And they--when they--you had to identify certain structures in music, well I could identify it immediately.  But when it came to trying to do--what do you call that?  You take dictation whereas you have to put in, write the notes that you heard, well I failed miserably.  I failed miserably because I had no idea--how can those people do that?  That's so hard.  And then when I had conducting and I learned how to conduct, then I realized what you--how, how to deal with trying to establish those notes and what you're talking about, and then it became easy.  So when I had to go back to Chicago State to talk to some of the classes because they invited me back to, you know, to talk to some of the students, I said what you need to do is have a course--the course in conducting should come earlier in their school year because it gives them an idea as to how to take rhythmic or musical dictations.  Because if they don't--when you conduct, you, you--there's a certain count that you know where all the notes are supposed to go, and I said until you get that, you--it's like a jumble in your head, I said, so you really need to teach them conducting first.  So anyway, but, then I loved the university that I went to, Chicago State.  I was--they gave me so many awards when I graduated from that school and I was like a Mu Phi Epsilon [Fraternity] and I was--I got a degree in--I got a--not a degree, I was--what did it call?  In education, I got--I was written up in one of these books for having in my educational programs to be receiving all A's, so I was like cum laude in that, I mean, summa cum laude when it came to education.  And--but when it came to like first of all music, I had to study long and hard for music because everything for me was done by ear.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, so I had no idea about the written note.  And I also discovered that when you--I thought that when people knew classical music or knew how to deal with European classical music, they can do anything, and that's when I learned is when you know jazz that you can do anything.  It's completely opposite from what I had in my head.  Because I remember trying to sing with one of the instructors and they told me that, oh, I could never--oh, I can't play for you.  You know, but I thought when you could read anything on a piece of paper, you could play for anybody, but that 'aint true.  That 'aint true at all because they--it's too stiff and jazz is not exact, so you have to know how to play in between or bend, bend notes to get the exact feeling for the rhythmic expression of the art form.  Because I really think that that music always allows for individualism, and that's why it's such a great music and, and, and more democratic than any music on the face of the earth as far as I'm concerned because it allows for the individual to bring their own expression to the music.
Story_ID: 220784
Speaker 1: Let me go back to high school [West Side High School, Newark, New Jersey] though for a minute.  We've got--we've jumped over a whole lot of stuff to get to Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], but we'll--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll remember this, but we'll go--let's go back to high school, and when--did you start performing when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: You mean singing--
Speaker 1: --Yes, singing--
Speaker 2: --at, at high--yes, I did a lot of singing in high school.
Speaker 1: Did you sing in the school chorus and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was part of the choir and all that and I did solos of all kinds, and when they had different plays and things of that type, I was at all of those things.  So when you read my, you know, the book that you get, you know, you got your book where everybody signs and makes--
Speaker 1: A yearbook--
Speaker 2: --the yearbook, it's--I was known as The Songbird.  They called me The Songbird at--and it was, some of the things that were just wonderful that they said about me.  I couldn't believe it, you know, the way they talked about me.  And even though I never really tried to do--you know how some people feel they have to try to be friends to everybody and have to fit in with everything and all those kinds of things?  Well, that was never my thing, really.  You know, I felt I had my sisters and brothers and that was enough for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did you--when did--maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but when you--were you performing with Andy [Andrew W. Bey] and your sister [Salome Bey] before you left high school or was that--
Speaker 2: --No, I was--
Speaker 1: --was that after high school?
Speaker 2: --No, I wasn't performing with them. They were the performers in the family.  Salome was--
Speaker 1: So, Salome was--
Speaker 2: --was performing as an individual and Andy was performing.
Speaker 1: And what, what, what kind of music were they performing basically?
Speaker 2: Well, Andy was performing--he was like the Billy Eckstine of Newark, New Jersey.  When he grew up and began to sing, he had his own show.  He, he did a show in New York every week.  He had a weekly television show, and that television show also featured Connie Francis, but Connie Francis was more contemporary signing; Andy was more into jazz, but he had his own weekly show.  And, and, and that's why people thought he was much older than what he--you know, much older at that time because he sang with such maturity and played piano, and he was really our star, you know, the star of Newark, New Jersey, and the star of our family, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--and, and your sister, you said she was a Ruth Brown of Newark?
Speaker 2: She loved Ruth Brown.  She used to sing the Ruth Brown music and, and, and sang more blues oriented things with Salome.  And the thing about it is, when I finally joined them, they--here--here's the difference between my brother and sister and me, is that they used to catch trains and buses and all of that to get to where they had to work or perform, and I know one time when I traveled with them, I said, this is ridiculous.  I said, we need a car.  We have to get a car.  Of course, no one could drive, but when I started going out with them and trying to, you know, be with them and, and work and sing with them, I had to learn how to drive.  So I was the first one in my family of nine people to learn how to drive, and, and that way, it made sense for us to have--you know, 'cause we used to do a lot of performance in New York or parts of New Jersey that, you know, were pretty far, and, and, and to take buses and trains, I said, this is ridiculous and we would be carryin' our clothes on our arms.  I said, no, this, this 'aint workin'.  I said, we gotta get a car.  So I learned to drive, and once I learned to drive, then everybody began to learn how to drive in my family.  But I broke that ice of, you know, trying to deal with public transportation and bags, and this and that.  You know, I said, we have to--we have to get a car.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that makes sense, yeah.  It does make sense.  Now when did you start singing with them?  When, when was it, and how old were you?
Speaker 2: I used to be so nervous when I had to sing with them.  I never wanted to sing alone.  I never wanted to do anything and I always--I really fully relied on Andy and Salome to help me through when we were singing as a trio [as Andy and The Bey Sisters] because I was just too nervous.  And I think--I thought I didn't have the wherewithal to sing jazz.  I mean, you just don't get on the stage singing jazz because you want to.  You know, it's a development you--and you really have to work your way through it.  And I really didn't get into the full understanding of the art form and felt free enough to really do a lot of things until I began to work here in the City of Chicago [Illinois] and singing on my own, you know, gettin' up out there by myself, having to take the stand and do what I'm supposed to do.  But that came with time.  It really came with a lot of time because I couldn't do it on my own for a long time.
Speaker 1: Now what, what year--do you remember when you actually started with them?
Speaker 2: Well, we started working in 1957.
Story_ID: 220254
Speaker 1: So you all [Andy and The Bey Sisters] started in 1957 to sing as a group in public.
Speaker 2: To go out in public and, and, and it--no, it might've been more before 1967 because--
Speaker 1: --Fifty-seven [1957], you said--
Speaker 2: --eventually they began to sing around the house and get music together in harmony, and this and that, so that took a little while, a couple of years.  And then 1957 is when we went--did our first thing in, in Miami [Florida], and we worked with Cab Calloway at the, the Cotton Club [Miami, Florida] down in Miami [Florida], and we worked the, The Lounge [ph.] as well.  The Lounge was where we, we ran into Billy Eckstine and that was my brother's [Andrew W. Bey] hero, really.  And as a matter of fact, he--Billy Eckstine sat in with Andy and Andy played for him.  He just thought that was a treat.  And it was in Miami when people used to try to give us big tips and we said, no, no, no, we were afraid to take tips from people because we felt we were there to sing and we got paid, so we didn't--I said, no that's all right, you don't have to tip us.  We were literally afraid to take that money from people.  And when we'd go back in the dressing room and sit with the girls who were in the--dancing on the stage in the Cotton Club, they said, y'all must be crazy.  I said, but--you know, I don't know.  What do they expect of us?  Why are they giving--and I mean they would throw piles of money in our hands.  You know, they asked us to sing a certain song and we would sing it and I said, no, you don't have to give us any money.  We're willing to--we'll sing it.  But after a while--you know, they gave us so much money, it made me nervous, really.  It made me quite nervous.  I didn't understand why people had to do that.  Because when we were singing around in Newark [New Jersey], they didn't give us any money.  I mean, nobody really tipped us.  But in '57 [1957], we were down there in Miami.  And then in '58 [1958], somebody saw us there and they wanted to send us to Spain.  In '58 [1958], we took the [SS] Ile de France to Spain and we worked three different parts of Spain.  We worked Barthelona [ph.] [Barcelona, Spain] as they say, and Madrid [Spain], and Palma [Spain], Majorca [Spain], which is just gorgeous island in Spain.
Speaker 1: Now, now tell me--now this--the, the way you pronounce those names raises an interesting question to--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --like how--
Speaker 2: Barthelona is how they--the C instead of Barcelona, it's like they have this lisp because of the king at that time, he couldn't say C.  He said Bartha [ph.], so it's Barthelona.  And then when, when I met people from Spain, we asked them that and we--they said that's how they--you pronounce it.  It's not pronounced Barcelona.
Speaker 1: What I was gonna ask is that you have wonderful diction and you--and you really seem to take pride in pronouncing even the foreign words the right way (laughter) which a lot of people don't do.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You know, so it--
Speaker 2: --that's important to me because, you know, this funny name of de Haas, you know, not only is it spelled crazy all the time, but it's pronounced sometimes crazy, too.  You know, some people call us de House or whatever.  They call us all kinds of names.  But, you know, when you meet people and you try to get what their inflection is of what they're saying, then that's what you try to do, is to imitate what they're saying, you know, if they were the people of that country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me--
Speaker 2: --And I do know that, that European pronunciation is a bit different from American pronunciation.  Even the vowels are pronounced different.  You know, it's Ah-E-A-Oh-Ooo for--you know, in Europe, E is A, I is E, A is Ah.  You know what I'm saying?  So when you're speaking in their language, that's how you try to pronounce it, the way they would pronounce it.
Story_ID: 220255
Speaker 1: I didn't establish this before, but you graduated from high school [West Side High School, Newark, New Jersey] what, in '53 [1953] I guess or--
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], okay.
Speaker 2: In January of '54 [1954], I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you know then that you were gonna be a performer or did you think you were gonna perform for a living?
Speaker 2: I thought I was going to be a performer.  We were trying to, you know, really try to be a performer.  But, well, you know, once, once I graduated--I'm trying to think what I did between '54 [1954] and '57 [1957].  I think that Andy and The Bey Sisters were basically trying to work on trying to establish a trio.  And we used to work at a lot of little clubs in New Jersey and in New York, and we worked with people like Redd Foxx and Carmen McRae, and, you know, Flip Wilson, and a lot of those folks that we worked with. 'Cause we mainly worked with comedians as we were singers and we worked in Brooklyn [New York, New York] and Harlem [New York, New York] and all kinds of places developing who we were.  And then when we went to Europe, you know, Miami [Florida] first, and then we went to, to, to Spain.  Then we went from Spain, we went to I think England.  We played London [England] and we played a place that was really--it was like a supper club.  You know, we went to Spain first, then we went to London.  And in that--in that club, we had--[HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt came in to see us.  I used to do an impression of Eartha Kitt and my sister did an impression of Pearl Bailey, and she just--she seemed to have loved it, you know, and we took pictures together.  But it was--
Speaker 1: Can you do any Eartha Kitt for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think--I think my voice fell too low.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was born in a little town called North and South Carolina--I can't do it anymore.
Speaker 1: I can hear it, though.
Speaker 2: At one time--
Speaker 1: I can hear it--
Speaker 2: --I used to be able to do that Eartha Kitt up a storm and my sister would really put me down being Pearl Bailey.  And, you know, we'd do 'C'est Si Bon' and we would sing that, and she would call it "Save The Bones."  You know, that was Salome [Bey], you know, really putting me on and saying come down to earth, Eartha.  And then after we went to London, we went--we played different bases in Germany for the [U.S.] armed forces.  We did--and we played many different parts of Germany.  And then--
Speaker 1: Well, how was it to do all that travel?  'Cause you had--I take it you hadn't traveled that much before?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't travel.  Well, the boat took us to Europe, you know.  It was the [SS] Ile de France and that was the last sailing of that boat before they destroyed it in some movie that was made.  It--and it was wonderful.  And it was great going there.  We--and we performed on the boat, and because we did that, we were able to travel like almost first class, and they used to give us a lot of champagne.  And at that time, we didn't touch any kind of alcohol, nothing.  And we used to--would leave those bottles on the table where other people would take it, which was okay.  But--and that's where we met Mr. Five by Five, the one who used to work with Count Basie.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Rushing?
Speaker 2: Just Jimmy Rushing.  Fabulous, he was.  And we saw Lena Horne's mother [Edna Louise Scottron] 'cause she said goodbye to--she was traveling on that same ship when, when we went abroad, and her mother was on that boat as well.  But it was--the food was fantastic, I mean, just fantastic.  Those French know how to throw some seasonings together that's just unbelievable.  It was really delicious food.  And then after we--no, once we got to Europe, then we, you know, we traveled.  And I mean, that's when we used to fly on those little planes.  I wouldn't get into--I hardly want to get into a big plane now let alone those little paper planes that we used to fly in to get from place to place.
Story_ID: 220256
Speaker 1: What year was it that you all went to Europe?
Speaker 2: In Europe, it was 1958.  That's when we sailed for Europe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty-eight [1958], okay.
Speaker 2: 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then European tour.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And were you touring with other acts in specific--
Speaker 2: No, it was just Andy and The Bey Sisters. I felt, you know, when I got on that boat [SS Ile de France] and my family was saying goodbye, I cried like a baby, you know.  I said--because I knew we would never pass by that way again.  You know, those moments were gone and the time that you had with your family was over.  And when you come back, there's a new thing, something new.  'Cause, you know, and my mother [Victoria Johnson Bey] was saying, well why you crying?  I said, I know I'm gonna miss you, you know, and I know that, you know, even when I come back, it won't be the same as it was before I left; it just isn't.  So--but, you know, I was the only one crying like a baby, you know.  And, of course, my sister [Salome Bey] and brother [Andrew W. Bey], they didn't understand me, why I was tearing the way I was.  I mean, you know, we're only going to Europe to perform, but it was wonderful.  Then we went to, to Paris [France], and we were there like sixteen months, and we made movies and we did all the big theaters there, the Olympia [L'Olympia Bruno Coquatrix, Paris, France], the (unclear), and we saw people like Maurice Chevalier, and Marlene Dietrich who came into a club one night and said she was trying to tell us how to dress, and save our money and pay our taxes and things of that nature, but she acted like a real mother, Marlene Dietrich, to us.  But the--one of the biggest thrills was when Marlon Brando came into the club where we were working.  And at that time, he had just completed that movie--I think--I don't know if it was 'On The Waterfront' or 'The Wild One' or that one where he was just stellar, all that yelling.  What is it?  The--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'A Streetcar Named Desire.'
Speaker 2: -'Streetcar Named Desire.'  I thought--you know, as I told you in the beginning that we used to go to the movies a lot, but I never, never saw anybody like that on the screen, and I just thought, this guy is fantastic.
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], I wonder if that was--if he was making 'The Young Lions' at that time with--
Speaker 2: I don't know what he was making, but the thing about it is his good friend used to come to--that's when we were workin' The Blue Note [Paris, France].  The Blue Note was, was where we worked with Bud Powell and--we didn't work with him, but he was on the bill.  It was Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, and Pierre Michelot.  We didn't work with Bud Powell, but we worked with Kenny Clarke and Pierre Michelot and--but my brother played piano for us.  It was a wonderful time at that club.  It was--and that club was where that movie was made, 'Round Midnight.'  I was there when Bud Powell was going through all the changes that he was going through.  We never met Long Tall Dexter [Dexter Gordon] over in New York [New York]; we never met him because it had a lot to do with his life, but a lot of that had to do with Bud Powell's life.  And I remember he was a very sick man in terms of--he was just sick, you know.  But that was wonderful time at that club.  It was--and there, I met Desi Arnaz and at that time, he was getting a divorce from Lucy [Lucille Ball] and he felt he was so sad.  He was saying I don't understand, you know, really almost crying out to me, telling how bad he felt about this divorce from his wife.  But when Marlon Brando came in that night and his friend Christian Marquand, the--you know, Marlon Brando's son was named after Christian Marquand.  You know, Christian, the one who, you know, he's goin' through all those problems.
Speaker 1: Right.  He committed suicide I think or something?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't commit suicide.
Speaker 1: He killed somebody and then he--
Speaker 2: No, he killed somebody.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, his, his--Christian's sister killed herself--
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: She committed suicide.  But he came in that night and he just loved us, Andy and The Bey Sisters.  He said, "I'm gonna tell Ed Sullivan about y'all."  He talked in this kinda funny accent.  But it was very strange, when we--when I was going home, you know, after the, the evening at the thing, he came over and helped me put on my coat and asked me, "What are you gonna do tonight, young lady?"  And I said, "I'm going home."  You know, because I just was in such awe of Marlon Brando because I just thought his acting was just incredible.
Story_ID: 220257
Speaker 1: Did he [Marlon Brando] say anything to you when he was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I--yeah, he wanted to take me home.  I said, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, Marlon Brando did?  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Marlon--I said no, I'm goin' home.  But, you know, I was just too much in awe of him and I didn't wanna be bothered with somebody like that because I might have to slap him down 'cause they were sayin' he was doin' all kinds--he'll do all kind of things to you.  I said, no he won't.  You know, because I was very much in the--I knew what I am as a person and I also know that I mean nothin' to Marlon Brando.  He meant a lot to me because of his acting ability.  I just thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But I knew personally that I don't mean anything to this man and I wasn't goin' with him anywhere.  So anyway, that was a very eventful evening for me with him there.  And we were discovered at--in Paris [France] by George Wein.  You know, George Wein is the person who does the Newport Jazz Festival [Newport, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he brought us back to the United States as our manager.  He wanted to manage Andy and The Bey Sisters, and he brought us back.  And that's--and that was in 19--we came back in 1960.  So we spent from '58 [1958] to '60 [1960] in Europe, meaning the various places, Spain, London, Germany, and then finally Paris, and that's where we made the movies and all of that, and played all those wonderful theaters, and played the--played the club, and that's where we--when Lena Horne came in looking for us one time.  She was--but we weren't working at that time--
Story_ID: 220258
Speaker 1: Movies.  You say you made some movies in--
Speaker 2: We made 'Paris Jazz Jam Session' [ph.] and that movie featured Dizzy Gillespie and it featured Bud Powell, and Andy and The Bey Sisters, and Pierre Michelot.
Speaker 1: And the movie was called?
Speaker 2: 'Paris Jazz Jam Session.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That one must've been exciting to do, you know, that's--
Speaker 2: That was--it was at [Roger] Vadim's house and we--he set up a little thing in his house and he was shooting us, all that was happening in his house and you know, to--you know, for the movie, I mean, at least aspects of it.  But Dizzy Gillespie was not there, just Bud Powell and, and, and Kenny Clarke, and Pierre Michelot, but I guess he shot Dizzy someplace else.  Anyway, then back in 1960, that's when we came home, you know.  George Wein paid for it and we got back here and that's when he began to work on doing things for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you--did you appear at the Newport Jazz Fest [Newport Jazz Festival, Newport, Rhode Island]?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.  He wanted to put us on the Newport Jazz Festival, but we were kind of afraid to do that, and that was the time we saw it, and it was just wonderful, but it was like just taking a stab at just throwin' us up there.  But we didn't do it, you know.  He decided against it.  But I'm just tryin' to think when--well that was in Paris [France], too, where we saw Marlene Dietrich.  When she came to see us, we went to see her.  And at that time, Burt Bacharach was her musical conductor, was Marlene Dietrich's musical conductor, was Burt Bacharach.
Speaker 1: And he was just on the verge of being the arranger and composer for--
Speaker 2: --For [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, correct--
Speaker 1: --Dionne Warwick and--
Speaker 2: --quite a few other people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But at that time, he was working with her.  And, like I said, we came back to the United States and George Wein put us in a, club called the [Cafe] Versailles [New York, New York], the Versailles.  It was a very nice little elegant supper club, and that's where Blossom Dearie was working.  And we worked with the--with, you know, with a bass player and a drummer.  But Andy [Andrew W. Bey], once again, played piano, and we performed there.  And Lena Horne's daughter [Gail Lumet Buckley] used to come in to see us when we worked there, and she told her mother about us.  She said, ma, you need to go down and see these kids perform at, you know, this place.  And she came in one night and sat there; she just loved it.  And then Andy did a sort of a thing on her, you know, with one of her tunes, and he got in his Lena Horne voice and paid tribute to her.  And, and she invited us to her home in New York at that time, you know, where in that home, they had Billy Strayhorn and Miles Davis and his girlfriend came, and the--we had that Carmen--the one that was married to that big, tall West Indian guy.
Speaker 2: Oh, [HistoryMaker] Carmen de Lavallade.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was married to whom?  What's--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder.
Speaker 1: Geoffrey Holder. They were all there at this party and, of course, Lennie Hayton.  And the thing--that was a very interesting party.
Story_ID: 220259
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder, now, he's a character, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes he is.
Speaker 1: I know that.  We've interviewed him.
Speaker 2: They, they were just wonderful.  And, and, and when I was in, in the room--in her [Lena Horne] home, Salome [Bey] was tasting some cheese and Lennie Hayton was telling her, "Try this cheese, try that," and they were trying all different kinds of cheeses.  And then I sat there and--actually, I was in such awe of what was happening at that moment.  That whole atmosphere was just so incredible, I had to go in a corner and sit down to take it all in.  And Miles Davis came over to me and said, you know, have you ever tried goin' for something and you go for it and it don't quite come out right?  I didn't know what to say to him then because at that time, I was working with a sister and brother and I wasn't going to try to do anything except for what, you know, what I was told to do, with Salome and Andy [Andrew W. Bey], because I just didn't have the nerve.  And, and I--and I finally realized what he was saying later on in my life when I began to perform at different places by myself and trying to go for certain things that you hear in your head, and you know that this is going to make it, and you blow it, but it's how you come out of what the mistakes you made, and that's what jazz is all about.  You make a mistake, you, you don't always play it safe.  You try to go for different things, and when it-- when you make a mistake and you know it's a mistake, you try to hook it up, that's all.  That's what the art form is all about.  But anyway, we stayed with him for a while, and at his home, we met so many people, met Duke Ellington and we met--what's his--the one that--Richard Burton, the one that Liz Taylor [Elizabeth Taylor] was married to, and some wonderful people that we met in his home, George Wein's home.  And then of course we parted our ways, you know, and we got another manager.  Because George at that time moved from Boston [Massachusetts] to New York [New York] and he had to build his reputation in New York because there--you know, the, the people there didn't accept him with open arms.  They had--he had to work on building a reputation for the jazz master in New York.  But it was a very interesting period being with him, you know.  We worked Storyville [Boston, Massachusetts] where we met Monk.  He would come in and--with his wife.  He, he was such a wonderful guy, Thelonious Monk.  He really was just fantastic, not only musically, but his heart.  He had a good heart.
Story_ID: 220260
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about Thelonious Monk?
Speaker 2: Well just that he, he wore, you know--he always wore his hats and danced on the stage and, you know--when we were rehearsing with Max Roach because at that time when we were working Storyville [Boston, Massachusetts], we worked with Max Roach.  He was our drummer.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And we were there and rehearsal closed, he said, that's what you should wear on the stage tonight, and they were not clothes that we would wear.  We used to wear some--dress in some gowns and tryin' to look as whatever way we looked, but he felt we should be there in those work clothes, which were just black pants and big bulky sweater, 'cause I think it was during the winter at that time that we met him.  But he used to, you know--our audiences were really incredible.  We would have--be performing and Count Basie would be in the corner or Thelonious Monk, and people like that.  We really had incredible people, you know, tellin' us that you were okay.  You were doin' the right thing.
Story_ID: 220261
Speaker 1: Max Roach played the drums for you for a while?
Speaker 2: He was our drummer in Storyville [Boston, Massachusetts], was Max Roach.  I forget who the bass player was, but I remember Max.  And that's when Tony Williams popped in on the rehearsal.  That was when he was a little kid, you know.  He was really small and playing drums, and Max introduced him to us because he knew this was--this little kid was on his way to bein' a very talented drummer.  But, yeah, that--he was our drummer and I'll never forget Max.  He was a sweetheart.  And I know when we worked with him, when he was goin' with, what's her name?  Abbey Lincoln?  She says, you know Max better than I do and he's a Capricorn and you're a Capricorn, what is he like?  I said, Max is Max, what can I tell you?  You know, 'cause that was before they were married, and they finally ended up getting married, but she was a wonderful person too.  I mean, Abbey Lincoln was--you know, they were all wonderful, really.  But that was--we did that and then Andy and The Bey Sisters worked a few other places, and then I met [Edgar] Eddie de Haas at (unclear) [Cafe] Versailles [New York, New York] and that's--he was working with Blossom Dearie, and that's all history.  The rest is history.  Eddie and I got married.  And when we started having kids, we lived in New Jersey.  We moved from--Aisha [de Haas] was born in, in New York and then we moved to New Jersey.  And then Andy and The Bey Sisters really had a difficult time after I got married because at one time, we used to be together all the time, and then when I got married, I couldn't do that anymore--
Story_ID: 220262
Speaker 1: --When did you get married?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got married--let me just think, '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the group [Andy and the Bey Sisters] kind of had some, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they kinda--we kinda had some battles, you know, 'cause I wasn't able to make all those rehearsals and to develop new material and all that kind of stuff because after a while, you know, when Aisha [de Haas] was born in '62 [1962], I just couldn't do it anymore, you know.  I said I just can't make all of that.  And I lived in New York and they were New Jersey.  But even though when she was born in New York, we moved--when--as soon as she was born, we moved to New Jersey, but still, I couldn't make all of those rehearsals the way I used to, the way we were before.  We were like as tight as a glove at one time when we were developing as a group.  And then after a while, [Edgar] Eddie [De Haas] and I went to, to Cologne [Germany] 'cause he got a job over there, so we went to Cologne, Germany.  And while there, they found out about me and wanted me to work on television and all that kind of stuff, and then that's when Eddie got another job back in America, so we came back to the United States.  So we left Germany and got back here and we worked here for a while and he was on the road with various people from Kenny Burrell to this one, to that one.  And after that, he got a call to come work the London House here in Chicago [Illinois], and that's when we packed up and moved out here to Chicago in 1968.  And we were all moved here.  I finally came out on 1968, April 4th, the day that [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated.  We were completely moved out to Chicago when he worked the London House.  And then while here, I was pregnant with Darius [de Haas], that's my son, and I gave birth to him in 1968.  And then, then I stayed home being the mother that I should be until 1970.  And then in 1970, I started going out trying to do little singing jobs around here in Chicago and I found it very difficult. I found Chicago to be a very racist city.  You know, I'm not saying that the East Coast is devoid of racism because there--it has its share of racism, too, but I thought that Chicago was--this is--I said, this is unbelievable.  They always say it's the city of neighborhoods but it's a neighborhood that you don't dare go into their neighborhood, and that's what I found it to be.  And I found the, the, the parks were not open or nothing.  It was really very difficult.  So when--you know, I began to work with people like (unclear) school for retarded children.  I was on that board and I worked with a lot of different civic and social groups, and was still trying to do a little singing here in Chicago.
Story_ID: 220263
Speaker 1: Now, Eddie [Edgar de Haas], your husband for all intents and purposes when you look at him, people would say that's a white man, but--
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of people--
Speaker 1: --but you're sayin' he's really not--
Speaker 2: Some people are asking.  You know, it's like Stan Getz asking--ask him if he was--are you colored?  You know, for some people he's still colored and other people, you know, he may be white, so, but he's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's kinda--kind of a mixed background you're sayin'.
Speaker 2: He's a mixed bag is all I can say.  And the thing about it is that he was a musician and--you know, in your family growin' up you know, your family has certain expectations of you in terms of who you end up marrying, you know, and, and they were really surprised that I ended up with somebody who looked like him.  And a musician at that, I said, because I would never marry a musician because I've known too many of 'em out there and their behavior's not too cool.  But Eddie was one of the nicest person I've ever met and, once again, he's like a historian like my father [Andrew Weidman Bey].  He loves history and he knows a lot about history.  And--but, sometimes his history may differ from what I think I know, and so he--sometimes we get into little battles about that, you know.  I said "Well, you know, you people have turned history all around and you don't know whether it's the truth or not," I said, "because you've messed with history so much to satisfy"--so he said, "what do you mean your people?"  He said, "You know, I'm this and I'm that."  I said, "Yeah, but, you know, you're a Dutch national and I know what the Dutch have done throughout the world, so I know their behavior."  So now, he says--well he's--you know, he leans more towards his Indonesian type where he was born.  He said, "I'm born in the Far East" instead of sayin' that--and then I don't so much hear that, and that may be because--maybe because he's married to me or whatever, you know, whatever the reason is.  But he begins to throw more of, of his--the other aspects of his life in there, too.  But, yeah, we've been married now for about forty-somethin' years, about forty-two years.  And my son [Darius de Haas] was born here in Chicago [Illinois] in 1968 of September.  My daughter [Aisha de Haas] is September 29th--no, my daughter is September 28, 1962, and my son is September 29, 1968.
Story_ID: 220264
Speaker 1: And I--at one time when I started singing, I used to--I joined Free Street [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] about around 1970 and worked with, you know--and that's when I began to travel around the neighborhoods and see the behavior of some of the people in Chicago [Illinois] in terms of when you go into the black community, you know the parents are, you know, concerned with--that the kids really don't have anything to do and how can we help our kids on the straight and narrow?  And you really had to watch out for things that, you know--there, there was robbery.  You really had to look out for your stuff.  But if you go--when you go into the white neighborhoods, the parents were complaining about their kids too.  What can our kids do?  We're tryin' to keep them from gettin' into this and gettin' into that.  And wherever you go, parents were complaining, whether we went to an affluent neighborhood or a, a--or what they call inner city.  Parents were complaining about what can be done to help their kids.  And some parts were--some neighborhoods we went into, some people were so mean.  I mean, it was just unbelievable.  You know, some of those white communities, which was I'm tryin' to think of one specific, was the Marquette Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Rough.  Rough.  When they saw those black and white people on the stage, they didn't like that at all, you know.  And others were not quite that rough, but they didn't quite understand it because this city--you know, I discovered while living here is that blacks were conditioned one way and whites were conditioned another way and in terms of--and particularly when it came to pass when we were trying to get a concert in the park for the Tribute to Duke Ellington [Chicago, Illinois].  They just could not see any jazz program coordinated by a black group comin' downtown into that main park to do a festival.  They said, no, you gotta be kiddin'.  It'll be riots and this and that--
Story_ID: 220265
Speaker 1: So in the '70s [1970s], you were--you, you were tryin' to seek some singing jobs and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, some singin' job--
Speaker 1: --you, you were doin' some volunteering--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --some civic volunteering.  Now, when did you go to Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois]?  When did you start going--
Speaker 2: I went to Chicago State in 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I--that's--no, that's right.  That's when I went, in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So '77 [1977] Chicago State, and you said you had a--you talked earlier about having a tough time getting in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You didn't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I took the--
Speaker 1: --pass a test or something?
Speaker 2: --test, you know, to get--for entrance into that university and I failed miserably, and I begged them.  I said, please give me a chance to get in here.  I said, I will work hard, and I still save that letter when they turned me down, 'cause it's somewhere in my pile of junk.  And, and I graduated with honors and they gave me--I got so many honors from that university because of the things that I've done in terms of education and, and the music, in music.  It was just unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you graduated from Chicago State, what did you--now, well before you went to Chicago State the park thing went down--I mean, the '74 [1974]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, the park thing--
Speaker 1: So now I'm gettin' ahead of, of you now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So let us go back to '74 [1974] then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: In '74 [1974], '74 [1974] the park--
Speaker 2: It was '74 [1974], that's when South Shore Cultural Center [Chicago, Illinois] became a public facility and they were fighting back and forth whether to destroy it and a group of us got together to say, no, you not gonna destroy this facility because it's--
Speaker 1: Now, it was a country club before, right?
Speaker 2: It's a--yeah, right.  It was a country club.
Speaker 1: An, an exclusive white country club, too--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --where blacks never--
Speaker 2: They--blacks--
Speaker 1: -crossed that--
Speaker 2: --Jews, and dogs were not allowed--was not allowed in that South Shore Country Club [Chicago, Illinois].  And they was--and they wanted to destroy it.  And then there were people who--the Muslims wanted to buy it, remember?  And they definitely would not sell it to them or give it to them in any way, so it was--
Speaker 1: That--that's the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 2: The Nation of Islam, right.  So it was--it became under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Park District.  And in 1975, I did what they call the Festival of the Arts [Mayor Daley's Chicago Festival of the Arts, Chicago, Illinois] at that--when it--before it was renovated.  I did a Festival of the Arts where we involved the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois], all kinds of different activities, cultural and arts activities that I put together for the Festival of the Arts at, at South Shore Cultural Center, South Shore Country Club at that time, and it was quite successful.  But then after a while, we couldn't do anything in, in that club because they were going to renovate it.  But we had to fight, first of all to make sure that they wouldn't destroy it.  So we went back and forth, and we fought them until 1977 when they said they were going to save it, and that's why I was late going to Chicago State University because I was out there fightin', meetin' with the city council and, and gone before that, that board tryin' to say why they should save that, that it should--it would become a great cultural center.  And at that time, you had Henry English and, and, and you had some country club people that were all fightin' to save that facility--
Speaker 1: I remember--
Speaker 2: --for different reasons.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Carol [L.] Adams was involved.
Speaker 2: Carol Adams, Lois Weisberg, every--I mean--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Abena [Joan P. Brown] was involved in it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You had--what's the--not only Henry English but what's the name of that other guy who was--I can't think of his name, that was--Ray or--Raynard Hall?  Remember him?
Speaker 1: Okay.  No, I don't.  But, but that's--yeah--
Speaker 2: He was the--another person--
Speaker 1: Oh, I think I do now, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --very much involved in helping to save that club.  We were all there.  We would stand out there bodily to make sure that they wouldn't come in with the bulldozers and knock that facility down.  I said, that's ridiculous to knock this down just because it's no longer a country club, but it has such value for a cultural center and that's what it should be.  And all of us were tryin' to write different proposals to say what it can become, and they finally ended up saving it.  It was 1977 when they told us, okay, we're gonna renovate the place, and that's when I went to Chicago State.
Story_ID: 220266
Speaker 1: Now before--let's go back some more because we didn't tell the full story--
Speaker 2: About the--
Speaker 1: --of the jazz concert in Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.  Well in 1974, in May of 1974, you know that Duke Ellington died, and people all over the universe were paying tribute to Duke Ellington.  And I think Muhal [Richard Abrams] had called a gathering of people.
Speaker 1: That's Richard Abrams.
Speaker 2: That's Richard Abrams--Muhal, called a bunch of musicians and we met somewhere I think--that was before I was even involved.  'Cause it was Muhal who called these musicians together and I really couldn't do that 'cause I really didn't know them all.  And they were talkin' about doing a tribute to Duke Ellington.  So when they--and, and I guess they were in discussions at least once or twice before he called me in, and he said, you wanna come to this meeting because we're talkin' about doin' a tribute to Duke Ellington.  So when I got there, they started talkin' about this and that and that, and I said, this is wonderful because, you know, people all over the world are doin' a tribute to Duke and we--I'm definitely happy about being involved with paying tribute to Duke Ellington.  Because as you know, as an artist, we do a lot of his music and he's one of the greatest composers in the world, so we should do something to him.  So anyway, when they kept talkin' and, and then they decided that they were going to do it in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], and I said well, you know, Washington Park is wonderful, but as you know, Duke Ellington was a very worldly person, I said, and if you're gonna do a tribute to this world musician, this classical artist, you need to get the main park.  So they said yeah right, if you can get that park, we'll do it there.  So I said, well, you know, I'm willing to try to see.  So I started writing letters to the Chicago Park District and they ran me around like a chicken without a head.  They told me you have to write this one, you have to write that one.  I almost had to write the janitor to see if I could get the place, and they--what--you know, tellin' me all these things to do and which I did, and--but the thing about it is, I never--you know, they--we were talkin' about doin' this, but a group of us, they never gave me any money for what we call letterhead, and at that time, I didn't know what letterhead meant.  I really didn't know.  I was just a singing artist and I didn't know what any of that stuff meant, so I was writing to the park district on anything I can find, the hotel stuff that we got when Andy and The Bey Sisters was travelin' and every time, they would get something with a different heading from me or after a while, it was just plain scrap paper that went out to them requesting a this and a that.  And I--so when--we kept doin' this and I was goin' on and on and on, and as I told you, I used to work with a lot of civic groups, (unclear) for retarded children, it was at one of those meetings that someone said, you know, I know a guy that was, his name was Oscar [S.] Williams.  You remember him, he was the head of some bank on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  He said, "I got--"
Speaker 1: Right, I've heard of him, right.
Speaker 2: "I got a very good friend that--who might be able to help you," and that's when he talked about [HistoryMaker] Commissioner [John H.] Stroger [Jr.].
Story_ID: 220267
Speaker 1: So anyway, he [Oscar S. Williams] talked to [HistoryMaker] Commissioner [John H.] Stroger [Jr.] and he told me to call him, and I called the commissioner and he said, "Look, just meet me downtown [Chicago, Illinois] at the park facility and just bring your correspondence that you have, the last thing that you sent to him."  When commissioner saw that--when the commissioner saw that correspondence that--what it was written on, it was like scrap paper.  He said, "Is this what you sent?  No wonder they ignoring you."  He said, "This is not good--this is not good."  But the commissioner didn't know that if they weren't takin' that, if I would have to iron a paper bag, that's what they were gonna get from me, 'cause my main thing is to communicate with those people.  So he said, well just wait here, let me go talk with that--with the, the superintendent.  And at that time, it was Edmund Kelly.  Do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Yes, Ed Kelly, right.
Speaker 1: Ed Kelly.
Speaker 2: He was part of (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, oh let me tell you, it was something else.  I mean, it was like you couldn't get to him.  It was like they were enclosed in gold or something, that you just didn't--you just never got to anybody like that.  So when, when the--when he went in to speak with the superintendent, in about five minutes, he came out to bring me in, so Ed Kelly says, "Are you the one who's been bringin' me--you were writin' me all these notes and this and that?"  I said, "Yes I'm the one."  So he says, "Well, let me see."  So after a while he said, "Well I'll let you come in and do this thing, and I'll let you have the piano, and I'll let you have our P.A. system, and I'll give you all of that."  So I said, "Thank you very much."  And then, then Ed Kelly began to show--tell--talk to me about what he plans to do in the park and a this and a that, all of a sudden now he's relatin' to me what he wants to do with the park system.  But it wasn't until then--but while that was all going on and these letters, Walter Jacobson did a perspective, a hard hitting one, saying, here, Duke Ellington, one of the greatest composers in the world and people payin' tribute to him, and nobody here in Chicago [Illinois] wants to pay tribute to this person.  Why don't they let this group come down and pay tribute to Duke Ellington?  Anyway, they finally allowed us to do it.  And, and at that time, Rick's Cafe [Chicago, Illinois] was open and I think my husband [Edgar de Haas] was working with [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor, and I asked Billy Taylor to come and, and do this, and we had [HistoryMaker] Merri Dee and a lot of people to come--who agreed to do it.  And then, of course, we had all the musicians-- the local musicians to come in--
Speaker 2: Was the--
Speaker 1: --and say they would do it.
Speaker 2: Was the AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] involved officially?  Like--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, but the thing about it is it took so long for them to say yea that a lot of 'em just fell out, you know.  They didn't--they really didn't bother to really help me to get that park [Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  It all ended up being me because they never believed that I would get that park.  And when I finally got it, I called all of them back and said hey, look y'all, we got the park.  Well, they couldn't believe it.  And then you know how musicians are, once I do all the dirty work, then everybody wants to come in and take over.  I let them take over to a point, but I wasn't gonna let them take over to everything. I said y'all need to work about helpin' me to do this and helpin' me to do that.  And, you know, we had to get flyers around town, and there's a lot of work to be done.  Now we got the park, and they said we can do it at the end of the Grant Park season, which was the end of--like the end of August.  And they said we will leave the piano there for you, they will--and, you know, once I got in to meet the top dog, which was Kelly, he just opened the world for me, you know.  He just opened it up and allowed me to come in.  And then there were times when they would ask me, "Are you gonna do the, the, the tribute this year?"  You know, after I was begging for so long and finally getting in there.  They--you know, one year when I contacted them rather late, they wanted to know if I was gonna come in and do the tribute.  So I said, "Well, yes, I--you know, I'm going to do it, but I'm not tryin' to raise money."  And at that time, I was--I don't know if I was tryin' to go to school or trying to--oh, I was sort of--no, I was not in school yet.  I'm just tryin' to see when I was in school because I had to do--I was tryin' to go to school and also tryin' to do--and that was later on around '77 [1977] when I was tryin' to go to school, tryin' to prepare for this concert, and tryin' to do student teaching and all of that, and it was just like a headache for me.  And I worked so hard in those five years that I was down there, still tryin' to get the park district or the city to help pick up some of that cost, but they never would.  They never would.  And when they finally opened it for--to jazz five days, they went to another group.  And maybe they went to another group because we were--we weren't organized as a non-profit corporation, so they went to a group which was, which was the Jazz Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--
Story_ID: 220268
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me go back some--I mean, to that first one [Tribute to Duke Ellington, Chicago, Illinois] in '74 [1974] and you said [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor was on the program and--
Speaker 2: Billy Taylor.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Merri Dee.  Who, who else do you remember?
Speaker 2: We had Muhal [Richard Abrams], we had Red Saunders.  You know, I--no, I think Red Saunders was such--so much bickering between two groups or something.  But I know that what--Ellis, Morris Ellis, was there and some other people were there, and I can't remember, but I have a sheet which deals with all those names (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that did appear at that.
Speaker 1: And, how was the attendance?
Speaker 2: It was incredible.  Did you see that audience?  You know, those pictures that I showed you?
Speaker 1: Right, right.  We'll show 'em later in--
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was a conglomeration of all complexions there in that park [Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois], kids, families.  It was--well, that's where the, the city got an idea that, hey, this is okay.
Speaker 1: So this is effectively--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--that's--
Speaker 1: --the first jazz festival--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in the City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was the catalyst that opened the doors to the jazz fest, the five days, the gospel fest, the blues fest, the country and western fest.  They had--what do you call that?  ChicagoFest [Chicago, Illinois] was what Mayor [Jane] Byrne [sic. Mayor Michael Bilandic] had, was--right after we did that thing at Grant Park, then Mayor Byrne had the ChicagoFest.
Speaker 1: And now just for the record, the city has like four or five staple festivals that they have--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --at Grant Park.  The jazz--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: --fest [Chicago Jazz Festival], the gospel fest [Chicago Gospel Music Festival], the--
Speaker 2: The blues fest [Chicago Blues Festival].
Speaker 1: --blues fest.
Speaker 2: The country and western.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, and yours [Tribute to Duke Ellington, Chicago, Illinois] was the first.
Speaker 2: And that--my--mine was--the first one was open the doors to make them realize that this is a good thing, and tourism has gone through the roof.  And, and Taste of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], too, because it all came after 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And another, I guess, thing too to bear in mind is that when--I'm--let's see-- I lost my point.  I had a--I really had a good one.  But the--when you started in '74 [1974] and--oh, what I was tryin' to get at is that black arts organizations were really fledgling in those days.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  And there was--there was hardly any money available for any of the black arts organizations--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely--
Speaker 1: --and most of the organizations were not formally organized with a 501(c)(3) or--
Speaker 2: Correct--
Speaker 1: --as a not-for-profit.  So there's always a--so you kinda depended on a large yes of the city if they were gonna give you anything at all, right?
Speaker 2: But the fallout from that was not only did we do that in Grant Park and open all of these doors in terms of what the city was able to do with what happened after that festival, they now have an incredible tourism thing goin' because of the festivals and the taste and all of that, 'cause that all came after.  And in the neighborhoods when we did that first thing in--at South Shore [Country Club; South Shore Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], that first festival that we did there in 1981--I'm movin' a little bit ahead now--was--it helped to open the doors for even the black organizations here in the city.  Because I think they saw well, if they--if she can do it, we can do it too.  And instead of the city giving them something, they got the money, or at least a little of it, to do what they wanted to do in their own communities, and to me, that's extremely important.  It's not somebody always givin' you something, to give you what they think you should have.  But you--if you're gonna spend money in my community, give me the money and let me do what we want to do, and that was another thing that opened the doors for that kind of activity in the African American community.
Story_ID: 220269
Speaker 1: Now you founded Jazz Unites [Inc., Chicago, Illinois] in--officially in what year?
Speaker 2: In 1980 was when we all came together and then we were established as a 501(c)(3) in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when we filed for our papers.
Speaker 1: Now you did the festival [Tribute to Duke Ellington, Chicago, Illinois] in, in Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] how many years?  How many years did you actually do it?
Speaker 2: Five years.  Five years.  But I grew so tired, you know.  I got tired of begging for support from the city and they just couldn't see it, so I had to bail out, you know.  So 1979 was when they did their first five-day concert with [Mayor] Jane Byrne as mayor, and they did five days, and they--and the Jazz Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] did it.  But I taped the radio--no, I didn't tape it.  Yes, I taped the show that [HistoryMaker] Billy Taylor was on, and they had hired Billy Taylor for the jazz festival that they--the Chicago Jazz Festival [Chicago, Illinois] and he said it on tape.  He said are you all just a continuation of what [HistoryMaker] Geraldine [de Haas] started?  I said, well, there it is on tape.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and people haven't forgot that history either, recently--
Speaker 2: You know, people don't really know that history at all.
Speaker 1: Well, very few know it, but there are significant people that still remember 'cause we, we just got this article from the internet where somebody, you know, really remembered it.  But yeah, you're right, it's not general knowledge that that's what happened.
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: So Jazz Unites was formed officially in 1981.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you started doing--you moved the venue for your--after the city took, took over the jazz fest in Grant Park, you moved the venue to South Shore [Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Well, I really wanted to move it there in the first place 'cause I, I felt that South Shore was so beautiful and the atmosphere for jazz was just perfect.  Because I saw Newport [Rhode Island] and I thought Newport was just beautiful for the art form, and I thought South Shore was just as beautiful if not more.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So that--now, describe the setting for this South Shore Jazz Fest [South Shore Jazz Festival, Chicago, Illinois] for those who have never seen this area.
Speaker 2: Well, the setting is like, you have a nice good size stage.  I think, I guess it's on the north end of the park [South Shore Nature Sanctuary] of South Shore Cultural Center.  'Cause, you know, South Shore is beautiful with a lot of greenery and it has a little beach, a beach area where kids can play on the beach if they'd like.  But my main thing is they always ask, do you have activities for the children?  I said, no.  I mean, I said the main thing is I want the kids to be there with their parents, exposed to this music like in Grant Park when they had European classical music, they don't have a lot of activities.  They have the kids there with their parents.  I said, that's the same thing I want these kids to sit in and enjoy and watch the expression of their parents.  If you ever watched a kid watchin' their parents enjoyin' this music, it's the most heartwarming thing you ever wanted to see.  And I said, and that's what I want.  I want--I have--I wanna have that, so I don't wanna have a lot of kid activities goin' on while the concert is goin' on.  I don't mind them goin' to the beach, you know, 'cause that's just splashin' in the water and it's further enough away.  But in terms of having all--any kind of children activities, no I just didn't wanna do that.  I didn't want to have that.  I wanted these kids to sit down--and that's how I got a hold of the music, was listening with my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the --I guess the, the major physical beauty of the setting comes from the lake, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the lake is right there and it's just--
Speaker 1: Lake Michigan.
Speaker 2: Lake Michigan is just gorgeous.  And with the surroundings it's just a unbelievable setting and park.  And the fact that they were going to destroy it to do whatever they had in mind to do was just ridiculous to me.
Speaker 1: And, the building itself, the--
Speaker 2: They finally renovated that building.  They started doin' that in 1977.  And I forget exactly when it was--no, that's when I went to school [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  But, no that's when they said they were going to renovate the building back in 1977 and maybe in '80 [1980] or '81 [1981], that's when--
Speaker 1: I think it was '84 [1984] when they--
Speaker 2: Eighty-four [1984]?
Speaker 1: --finally opened it up to the public as a cultural center.  Yeah, '84 [1984] 'cause I just started with the Arts Alliance [Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] that year and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -- [HistoryMaker] Abena [Joan P. Brown] and everyone went over there for a big reception, you know.  There was still people protesting across the street I heard the day that--they were so used to fightin' about it that they couldn't come in and have their--the hors d'oeuvres or whatever (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was a tough fight, but it was a good fight for a good reason.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, to have something--that, that facility in the African American community is, is fantastic.
Speaker 1: Do you remember (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I remember (unclear).  He was right there.  He was one of the fighting partners.  He was one of the warriors.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, I hear the story that they had to coax him in from the rain with his sign on the day that it--they opened it because he was still protesting some point that he hadn't been able to negotiate, but he finally came on in and had some hors d'oeuvres and--(laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 220270
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about how you got involved with--now, in '83 [1983] you got involved with the Illinois Arts Council [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With the Illinois Arts Council.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, and that's the state agency that--
Speaker 2: That's a state agency.
Speaker 1: --that funds arts activities--
Speaker 2: Funds arts organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The 501(c)(3) arts organizations.
Speaker 1: Now, all of this sort of thing is new in the United--was, was kinda new in the United States in those days.  It wasn't that old because I heard that-- it was Jessie Woods, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably, who helped to establish around the state these state arts agencies.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: You know, instead of everybody headin' towards the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] for everything.  They provided support for the states, you know, and from the NEA as well as from the legislature.  That's why some people really don't understand how important it is in terms of government and the arts.  If the government don't recognized what you're doin', forget it, you know.  And when they finally had that jazz resolution that, that was brought to bear by [HistoryMaker] John Conyers [Jr.].  Well, anyway, that's another story 'cause I used to serve--
Speaker 1: Right.  That's important.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's another story.
Speaker 1: I know it's very close to the heart of John Conyers.  He talks about it all the time.
Speaker 2: Well, listen, I was there when they had the Congressional Black Caucus had a forum on jazz and the place was loaded, I mean, with people like Wynton Marsalis.  I was there 'cause I was in Washington, D.C., because I served on the National Endowment for the Arts panel and I saw what they were--the kind of moneys that they had for that panel as opposed to the money that they had for the symphonies and--the symphony panel.  Well, with the jazz panel, they had like $750,000, not even a million dollars.  For the symphony panel, they had thirty million.  I said, this is disgusting, I said, absolutely disgusting.  You know, and I remember when, when the Congressional Black Caucus held a forum on, on jazz, the place was loaded.  I mean, Wynton Marsalis, I think Max Roach.  I--all the artists and then just regular people piled in that place and--
Speaker 1: And you had leadership in the National Endowment with [HistoryMaker] A.B. Spellman and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: That--it was incredible and I was there.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), Winfield [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and those guys.
Speaker 2: Yes.  All those people were there and they were talkin' and they were sayin' well, maybe we have--should have a jazz forum all the time if we gonna get out--if we're gonna get all these many people to come out and listen to the Congressional Black Caucus.  But they talked about the needs for jazz.  And that resolution that was put together, I was part of that.  Bill Brower [William Brower]--I don't know if you remember Bill Brower.
Speaker 1: Is he from [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: He's from D.C. and--
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew him at Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio] when I was in college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we used to work on the language of that--of that proposal--of that resolution together.  And when I got back, I was so inspired that, that--about people talkin' about jazz in that way, that when I came back with the outline of the resolution, I brought it to [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun, and it passed in the [U.S.] House [of Representatives].  Unanimously, that resolution passed in the House even before it passed by the U.S. Congress.  Because I brought it back for them to, you know, to recognize it for what it was, you know.  And then when they passed it unanimously in both Houses, it was incredible.  And I remember going to a JazzTimes convention and some--you know, people who were not involved in the production of this piece of paper were really kinda mean to what had happened.  And, and as you know, it was mainly black people who dealt with this resolution.  It was.  I mean, the other cultures were not there.  It was a Congressional Black Caucus meeting on jazz and they were primarily black people.  So when some of these people at the JazzTimes conventions were saying, look, musicians don't care about this piece of paper, they want a job.  And I stood up, I said, "Listen, the only way that we will get the kind of moneys that we need for all kinds of programming, not just a gig, but to do educational programs and to do all kinds of programming in our community, it is important that the government recognizes this music."  I said, "That is extremely important, so don't say that it's not important.  I don't even wanna hear it 'cause I know how important it is.  I work for the Illinois Arts Council and I know that they have to go to the legislature [Illinois General Assembly] to get their money."  So they immediately shut up.
Story_ID: 220271
Speaker 1: Now, [HistoryMaker] John Conyers [Jr.] tells a story in his interview with us that a couple of southern legislators, he was surprised to find out that they were jazz lovers.  Even though they didn't like black people, they like jazz, and they supported the resolution.
Speaker 2: How could they not--
Speaker 1: I mean it was a--which leads me to a question.  Now, oh, just tell me this.  Now, what year was this when Conyers--just establish the year.
Speaker 2: This was 19--about '86 [1986]. Eighty-five [1985] '86 [1986]. That's when this was, yes.
Speaker 1: But what Conyers found out is that that music brought people together that had not heretofore been together.
Speaker 2: That's the beauty of the art form.  It's--it can speak to anybody.  And that's why, you know, when you--when the people talk about music that coalesce people, there's no music like jazz.  None--no music in the world like that art form because it has the ability to bring people together and for them to enjoy it.  You know, you look at the Louis Armstrongs and the Duke Ellingtons who weren't even allowed to go through the front door, but they loved their music.  You know, it's the kind of music that seeps into your heart, you know.  And it's the music of life.  And people can relate to music that deals with life because everybody who's living can always relate to whatever hardships or whatever good times people are going' through no matter what color you are.  So that's why to me, it's no music like it, and that's why I fight tooth and nail to expose this music to as many people as I can.
Speaker 1: Is that also why the organization is called Jazz Unites [Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's right, 'cause it does unite.  It's a--that's the verb.  I said jazz unites, and it really does.  And not only for music organizations, but educational institutions and everybody.  You know, I was just lookin' at some kids who called me.  They're tryin' to have a youth conference and they called me, and I'm very much interested in that.  Once again, jazz unites.  Whatever anybody is doing, we can relate to it.
Speaker 1: Now, I've been--I've talked to [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell in Denver [Colorado] who's a bass player, and Charles Burrell was raised in Detroit [Michigan], you know, there's a great music tradition in Detroit--
Speaker 2: --Oh, yes--
Speaker 1: ---around jazz--
Speaker 2: --they have a terrific tradition--
Speaker 1: --and classical music.  And he, he went to Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] and he learned both classical bass and jazz bass, and he talked about the--he likes playing classical music, he said, but the atmosphere is not as friendly and it's kind of like you got an authoritarian guy over you and everybody's in competition with each other in the classical venue.  But in jazz, people are free to create.  They add a little bit of their personality to what's goin' on, and he says a lot--
Speaker 2: That's what it's all about.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that--is that part of this uniting concept, you're talkin' about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's--not only--you're not--you know, it's just like some of the first musics that brought different people of different persuasions and complexions and background, whether you were rich or poor or black or white or oriental or whatever.  You know, 'cause I even look at my husband [Edgar de Haas] who was born in the Far East, I said, how did you get to hear jazz or play jazz?  You know, it's--but it's music that captivated his heart, and he said that's why he couldn't wait to get to America, because it would help him to grow as a jazz player because he loved the music so much.  You know, so it--like I said, it brings all kinds of people together, which is the beauty of it, and that's what happened in Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] that year in 1974.  When all of these different persuasions came together to hear the music of [Duke] Ellington.  It was just unbelievable.  But it was believable enough for the city to look at what could be done with this music.

Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about, well some more about Illinois Arts Council [Chicago, Illinois] activities.  Now, you worked there for ten years, right?
Speaker 2: I worked there for ten years.  I started in '83 [1983] and I just needed--I--when I went in, I met with the guy who was the program director at the time and he was--you know, I said, you know, I'm willing to work.  I said I don't know too much about nonprofit organizations even though I do--I did found a nonprofit organization, but I'm willing to work hard to do whatever needs to be done to make whatever needs--whatever, whatever decision you make, whatever you want done, I'm here to get it done.
Speaker 1: Now, I think you were the--were you the first black person hired by the arts council?
Speaker 2: Well, I think so.  I think I was one--you know, there was another guy who was with--who worked with me in Free Street Theater [Chicago, Illinois] who said he had some kind of a relationship with the arts council, but I don't remember that.  I think I was the first one to sit in that office down there to sit--to work in that building under the umbrella of the arts council.  And I don't know if anybody sitting in that office to work that place--because for some reason, the guy who hired me seemed to like me, like what he heard about me, so, in just a little while, they called me and said you got a job.  And I worked under his tutelage.  He was a very nice guy and--
Speaker 1: Who was this?
Speaker 2: I'm tryin'--I can't think of his name anymore.  Oh, wait a minute.  Gallis [ph.].  I think his last name was Gallis.
Speaker 1: Paul--yeah, Paul Gallis, I think, wasn't it?  Paul?  No--
Speaker 2: --No, Paul Gallis--
Speaker 1: --not Paul, right--
Speaker 2: --was somebody else but it was a, a name like Gallis.  But he hired me and I worked very hard.  And I remember him sending little memos to the people who worked in the office saying you need to increase her salary to the highest rate you can because she's a good worker.  And I would work, you know, as hard as necessary to get things done, you know, and read, and deal with people.  And I guess I had a way of dealin' with people that, you know, they didn't have a problem coming and talking to me.  Because I really--even though I had a nonprofit organization and they said, well you can't--some people said, well you don't have to be that, this and that, with a lot of people because the more money you give out, the less you have for yourself.  That never entered my mind because I was always for people getting money, I don't care how much it was, to do what they wanted to do in their communities, and that for me was very important.  And I know that [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun helped to pull the access program together, which I worked with her and we did the access program where moneys could go to individual artists as well as small organizations who never saw money.  I said well, you know, feel free to call me any time and you must, you know, at some time maybe cut some of the big grants that you give me.  Give these people some money and let them do what they want to do in their communities.  That to me was very important.  And I was there for ten years and worked with Shirley Madigan and a lot of those council members and, of course, Eliud.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Eliud Hernandez.
Speaker 2: Yes, Eliud was there.  And we all got hired around the same time, Eliud too.  And I guess at that time, I guess they didn't have any blacks or Latinos there and they were tryin' to, you know, bring some diversity to that council, you know, and about time I would say.
Story_ID: 220273
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was around 1985 or so that there was sort of a--black folks organized basically a meeting with the Illinois Arts Council [Chicago, Illinois] to talk about more funding for black organizations--
Speaker 2: Absolutely--
Speaker 1: --and so forth, yeah. And that was spearheaded by the African American Arts Alliance [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] at that time and the Illinois Arts Alliance Foundation, both of 'em, yeah.  So--and during a lot of what you--now, you're performing in clubs while you work for the arts council--
Speaker 2: --Yes--
Speaker 1: --too.  You, you renewed like a singing career.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: And before that--now, we, we didn't even talk about your association with the Free Street Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I auditioned for that and I was one of the oldest person to work in that theater, and some people said, she's too old (laughter).  But just like I did 'Hair,' I must've been about thirty-six, and I know--I remember one time some kids were sayin' to me, you're not sixteen or seventeen.  I bet you're about nineteen or twenty.  I said yeah, right (laughter).  But I was like in my thirties.
Speaker 1: And you did 'Hair'?
Speaker 2: I did 'Hair.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never got nude.  I never did the nude scene, but I--you know, for those who wanted to do it that was their business.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay--
Speaker 2: --But I said--
Speaker 1: --so you didn't have to do it--
Speaker 2: --I just wasn't going to do it--
Speaker 1: --if you were in it.
Speaker 2: You know, well, I told 'em I'll do the singing, and they hired me basically for the singing.  And I was always ready, you know.  Whenever they wanted me to do certain things, I was prepared vocally and health.  My health, I kept--I took care of myself because of my--you know, and so I didn't hang out at night.  So many of those young kids used to hang out and couldn't talk when they came to work the next day, so they would have to give me the vocal parts.  And that's how I got to--you know, when they hired me, they looked for me.  And, I--many times I would open the show, you know, with 'Aquarius.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was a very interesting show.  I really enjoyed that, that, that program.  And I also enjoyed 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'  I did that for a year or so and I loved it.  I loved that opening thing where the--this wonderful dancer danced to my singing and I just enjoyed that show.  I loved the way Micki--I thought her name was [HistoryMaker] Micki Grant.
Speaker 1: Grant, right.
Speaker 2: She--that was--she told people what was happening in a very musical and eloquent way.  She was wonderful.  So I really enjoyed doing that show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Who was the founder of Free Street Theater?  That was--
Speaker 2: Patrick Henry.
Speaker 1: Right.  Patrick Henry.
Speaker 2: Who died.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was tryin' to think of which patriot he was--I knew he had the name of one of the patriots.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Patrick Henry.
Speaker 1: Patrick Henry.  Right.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I--and when he--when he became ill, I just no longer recognized him.  When I saw him, tears came to my eyes.  And I wrote a--special lyrics to a popular song that I sang at his--at his celebration, and it was--you know, he allowed me to do so many things when I finally got in there 'cause he also depended on me to do a lot of things in the show.  Because, you know, I took care of my voice and took care of whatever needed to be taken care of so I can be prepared to do whatever I had to do.  And I also did--I don't know if it was '[To Be] Young, Gifted, and Black'?  Yeah, it was 'Young, Gifted, and Black.'  And that's--you know, Cookie Boatwright?  Colostine Boatwright?  I don't know if you've ever heard of her.
Speaker 1: I think I have.
Speaker 2: Actress.  She was in that show and I used to watch--and, and Patrick called me to do the understudy of both of these ladies.  I knew Colostine but I forgot the name of the other lady who starred in it.  And I said, no, Patrick, because I'm not an actress.  I can't act and, you know--and if something happens, I'll have to step in there and I'm not able to do that, you know.  I can't--I'm not an actress.  So he said, well, you'd probably never have to step in.  And I used to go in and watch the rehearsals and watch this and that; as an understudy that's what you have to do.  And this Cookie Boatwright was just so incredible.  Her acting was just phenomenal.  It brought tears to your eyes.  She was so wonderful.  When, when we joined it, I think after the first week, that girl quit and I had to go in and take her place.  I said, oh my goodness.  And then when I talked to Cookie Boatwright 'cause I heard her on the radio and I called her, I said, "Cookie, I'll never forgive you for leavin' that show and makin' me have to get out there and make an idiot of myself."  But anyway, that was at Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] when I did that one.  But Patrick is gone now and I really enjoyed-- because he, he had a good head for putting things together and he helped me in terms of when I wanted to do something, I'd put a program together because when I was at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], I used to put together little programs for Chicago State, meaning different Broadway pieces and different this and that.  And I liked the way he handled himself when he'd put stuff together, and I watched him closely.  And I didn't realize I was watching him, but somehow what he did kinda rubbed off on me.  So when I was doin' things at Chicago State to try to put together little musical programs, a lot of it came from Patrick Henry.

Speaker 1: Have you appeared in any other films?  I think I read that you were in--did you appear in any other films?
Speaker 2: I'm tryin' to think.  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so you worked for the arts council [Illinois Arts Council, Chicago, Illinois] until 1993.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you've been devoting your time since that time to the--
Speaker 2: To Jazz Unites [Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: --to Jazz Unites.  Okay.  And right--this year, you're gettin' ready to do your--
Speaker 2: My 2004 Jazz Heritage Fest [JazzFest Heritage Music Weekend]--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --at South Shore [Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Who are some of the people that you've had here over the years?
Speaker 2: Over the--we had Count Basie in 1981.  That's when Count Basie was alive.  We've had Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Wynton Marsalis before--that's when Wynton Marsalis was workin' with Art Blakey, but they were rained out until when I see Wynton even today, I said you owe me one 'cause you never got a chance to perform.  And he had to remind me that he was out there with Art Blakey because I didn't remember him; I remember Art.  And I loved Art Blakey.  He was such a fabulous drummer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's kind of a character, too.  I think he--
Speaker 2: Yes he was--
Speaker 1: --he drives to every place he goes.  He never flies or--
Speaker 2: --And then I--it was Roy Haynes and [HistoryMaker] Gloria Lynne, and Kenny Burrell and Betty Carter who was wonderful.  The thing about it is that the Jazz Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] was scared to hire her 'cause they didn't know how she would act, you know.  So when they hired her, they, they brought me down there.  They said, well could you come in and you just deal directly with her and we'll go through you, but you deal directly with her.  I said, boy, that's ridiculous.  But I did it, you know.  But she was wonderful, sang up a storm.  But we never had people like Ella Fitzgerald but we--of course, we had Ray Brown who always tried to get me to come on the stage and perform with him, and after a while when I was so tired, I would hide so he wouldn't call me.  But whenever he sees me out there in the audience, he said, "Come on up here, [HistoryMaker] Geraldine [de Haas], and do this tune--or do a tune with me."  But, so sometimes when I know he's going to do that, I'll hide from him because I would just be so tired.  But we do have a good show comin' up this--the Saturday and Sunday of August 7th and 8th with people like Nicholas Payton who's a wonderful trumpet player from New Orleans [Louisiana], Nnenna Freelon who is a Grammy-nominated performer, and of course Frieda Lee, and Chicago [Illinois] people--Chicago people like Frieda Lee and Jose Valdes and Fernando Jones who's blues 'cause I always like to have blues as one of the staples in the programming that I do 'cause blues is very important to me.
Speaker 1: And I think [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr., is coming.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Oscar Brown is on Sunday, that's the 8th.  He's there with his two daughters and his--of course his group that he's working with.  And then of course we have the legendary Ahmad Jamal.  And we have some Brazilian music and, once again, blues, Billy Branch, who's out there on Sunday.  So it's always important to feature Chicago-based artists as well.
Story_ID: 220275
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I want them to learn how to try to do for themselves, not to expect anybody to do things for them.  You know, what you want and what you wanna do in life is to persevere, determine to do what needs to be done for you to fulfill your dreams.  Don't look to other people to help you do anything because it just doesn't happen.  You know, and the only thing is like if the government is fair--if people worked the way they supposed to work and they do what they supposed to do and they apply for certain moneys like everyone else does, then they should be able--they should have access to whatever anybody and everybody else has access to.  But in your determination--because many times I would start putting programs together and I wouldn't have a penny.  I wouldn't have one penny.  But I said if we ever waited for the money to--you know, for somebody to give us some money, we would never do anything.  So what we would do is put it together and then ask for small donations from the community to help pay for it.  And that's why--how that 1981 program [Jazz Comes Home, Chicago, Illinois] happened.  It was primarily donations from the community itself which helped to make that program possible.  You know, because if I waited for the city to give me anything--and in a way, I was glad when the city didn't give me because they couldn't tell me what to do or how to do, how to run my program.  I'm gonna run it the way I see fit because, you know, you're not givin' me a penny, so I'll do what I need to do to make things happen.  But like anything else, it's like when I go to the [Illinois] Arts Council [Chicago, Illinois] and when I go to the city for like a grant like anybody else, I expect support like the way they support everybody else.  They say if you have a decent program together that you can be supported.  Well, I expect to be supported like anybody else.  But everything is on you and you need to look to see how you can do it, how you can get whatever you wanna do done.
Story_ID: 220276
Speaker 1: You have two children that are in the arts, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My son [Darius de Haas] is in the arts and right now, he's going to head out to Utah to do some concerts, but he's been in so many plays, meaning the 'Kiss of the Spider Woman,' 'Carousel,' 'Rent,' and now he's tryin' to do a lot--and now, he's done a lot of things at the--what's that center where Wynton Marsalis--the Lincoln Center [for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  He's doing a lot of programs.  They hired him a couple years ago at Lincoln Center where he played--paid a tribute to Billy Strayhorn, and then I think last year, he paid tribute to, to 'Isn't She Lovely'--what's his name?
Speaker 1: Stevie Wonder.
Speaker 2: Stevie Wonder, that's right.  And they want him to come back and do some stuff.  But my brother Andy Bey [Andrew W. Bey] does a lot at Lincoln Center as well, and I know they just did a tribute to Mary Lou Williams, in which I received the Mary Lou Williams award from The [John F.] Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] for education.  And I found out a lot about her, about what a fantastic artist and composer she was, and they did a lot of her music from the early days up to, you know, the bebop era, but she was wonderful, and Andy did that at the Lincoln Center.  So--and then of course he has a record out, which is really doin' well.  He did the--and speaking of Andy and the Congressional Black Caucus, when he did the, the North Sea Jazz Festival [Rotterdam, Netherlands], he ran into Donald Bradley--no, Donald--no, is it Donald--[Donald M.] Payne [Jr.] who is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus from Newark, New Jersey, and they're going to do--they're gonna honor Andy.  The Congressional Black Caucus is gonna honor Andy and maybe, hopefully if we can get something done where we can have him and [HistoryMaker] John Conyers [Jr.] do something maybe at our scholarship program 'cause we do a scholarship program for kids, you know, in the jazz tradition and music, and we've given out fourteen on thousand dollar scholarships so far because that's very important.  And I'm tryin' to think if we do the scholarship program and maybe have my brother as a guest artist and have the--John Conyers that would be wonderful.  But I'm thinkin' about that.  It's not put together yet, but that's on my mind to think about and, and maybe do.
Story_ID: 216388
Speaker 1: Ma'am, if you had to do it over again, to do something over again, I mean, what would--would you change anything so far in your life?
Speaker 2: It really depends on whatever condition you're in, in terms of the conditions of where black people are in terms of--and I don't think I could do it any different from the way I've done it because this is the way the world is.  The world throws you lemons and you just try to make lemonade out of it, you know, and that's what I have to do, is the best way I know how.  But maybe I might've--you know, but if--the only thing I could say is if I knew now--if I knew then what I know now, maybe some things might be different because they say, well, you know, when you going to form an organization, you supposed to form me a board, then your board is supposed to help you to raise the money to do this and that and that, and it didn't happen that way at all for me.  You know, I just had an idea to say, we gotta do this.  And people who believed in what I did--was doin' sorta gathered around me.  But I worked very hard, you know, and that's why back in '99 [1999], I became ill and lost my eyesight and everything else.  So I wouldn't wanna work myself to a frazzle the way I did this time, but if I had to, I probably would do the same thing--it depends on what condition we're in and what condition the world is in.
Speaker 1: So, so what you do, yeah, depends on what you have to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  What I have to do to get--to do what I want to do.
Story_ID: 216389
Speaker 1: When you look back on the things you've done, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy.  Well, other people are always tellin' me what I've done in terms of opening this system here in this city [Chicago, Illinois] and the parks, particularly.  Because I was awarded for bringing the gift of jazz to Chicago's parks.  I received that from the Friends of the Parks for bringin' the gift of jazz to Chicago's parks.  So somebody one time called me the, the Rosa Parks of the parks because she refused to go to the back of the bus and I refused to settle for what they say I can have but what I want.  I was determined to get the park that I wanted for Duke Ellington [Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois] , and that kind of opened the whole system as far as I'm concerned, you know, so that's why they named me those things, the gift of jazz to the parks and the Rosa Parks of the parks.
Story_ID: 216390
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Victoria Johnson Bey and Andrew Bey] feel about the success of their children in entertainment, I mean, and--
Speaker 2: They were very grateful and--you know, I--my father doesn't like to use the term proud, he said, because only God should be proud.  But very thankful for the things that we've done, and they were very happy and thankful for the kind of success that we had.  They just felt, you know, that we should've gone on.  We shouldn't have broken up so quickly.  As George Wein said to me, you know, at the time that you were on the rise, they didn't think too highly--they wouldn't put people who looked like me on television, he said, but now, you know, it's more open for people who look very African and maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  You know, at one time, or for television, you had to look like Lena Horne, and I adore Lena Horne and--but I know I don't look like her, and don't want to.  I look like whom I look like, and if somebody have a problem with my looks, that's their problem.  That's all I have to say.
Speaker 1: You think that--do you think that's really changed these days, or?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  They said it has, but I don't think so.  I don't think it's changed that much.
Speaker 1: So we still got some work to do in terms of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, a lot of work.  But, you know, the way you try to fulfill that kind of work is to continue to forge ahead with your dream, you know.  You continue to move ahead and sometimes they have to catch up because if I don't get television, well, I don't get television.  It'll be something else.  You know, but things happen.  I always feel that things happen the way they supposed to, and no matter what you do to try to make something something, it's--as my brother always said, "It's God's will in terms of what's going to happen."
Story_ID: 216391
Speaker 1: And last question is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess somebody who did the best they could do for what, you know--in terms of following their bliss.  And I don't know about how I'm--you know, whether it's--and I think it's more than just opening the parks here in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean, that's just a small part of my life.  Basically, I want people to know that I tried to do the best I could do and then some for whatever life has thrown at me.
Story_ID: 216392
Speaker 1: So, well just give us a best description of this as you can.  This is the Rosa Parks Award?
Speaker 2: That was the Rosa Parks Humanitarian Award.
Speaker 1: And in the center, if you can just say 'cause you're on mic, just tell us--I know Carol Adams is in the middle.
Speaker 2: Carol Adams is there and a lot of black women who are very active in civic and arts organizations that's--and--
Speaker 1: Here you are, right here.

Speaker 2: This looks like Grant Park, the concert itself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a concert itself, and that was early in the evening when the seats filled up, but--and that's the beginning of the concert.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is a close-up of you, I guess.
Speaker 2: And that's me again, probably talking to the audience, opening of the Grant Park concert, which took place from '74 [1974] to '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, next.
Speaker 2: Is that [HistoryMaker] Madeline [Murphy] Rabb?  Oh, no, that's also downtown Grant Park from--that's my daughter [Aisha de Haas] there and Marian Stevenson [ph.], and I don't think it--there's my son [Darius de Haas] there, so I don't know who else is there.
Speaker 1: So that's an unidentified police officer--that's a police officer--
Speaker 2: Yeah, an unidentified police officer.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is Yvonne Daniels and Joe Williams.
Speaker 1: That's right.  They're at one of the concerts, Yvonne Daniels and Joe Williams.  And she was--that's Billy Daniels' daughter.  Remember Billy Daniels?  'That Old Black Magic'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's his daughter.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  She's the one that's on the radio--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: She used to have a radio program, Yvonne.  But she died relatively young.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: Here's a trio. Here's your husband [Edgar de Haas].
Speaker 2: That's my husband and that's Billy Taylor. Oh, no, wait a minute--that is--who--are there--are those two--now who's the one on this side?

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the one with Madeline Rabb.
Speaker 1: That's the People's Choice Awards.  You know, we did a tribute to Marian Anderson, as I told you, I love Marian Anderson.  And we did that and--several times downtown at the cultural center [South Shore Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], and we were one of the groups to win an award for that year.
Speaker 2: And we have like, left to right, so Madeline Rabb, looks like yourself--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Sandra Royster--
Speaker 1: Is that Mark Williams [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Mark Williams.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Is that [D.] Kucha Brownlee there, I think?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Or--his singing partner, I think that's who that is.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then there are two people on the end I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know either.  I can't say.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Probably 1985.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Okay, here you are in a production here with--
Speaker 2: We were in a production with this girl, the blonde, you know.  She's as blonde as I am black (laughter) and I don't know what year it was, probably in the '70s [1970s] 'cause I know it was when I started workin' with Patrick Henry, it was 1970.  So I'm not sure what '70s [1970s] it was.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: And here's a picture we didn't get--yeah, this is you, I think, once again at the--
Speaker 1: Probably singing in Grant Park.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's my graduation picture.  You know, that's not my graduation picture, but it was the picture that they put in the books for graduation from Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What year?
Speaker 2: That's about 1980.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, very good. Next.

Speaker 2: Well, I don't think we were down there in '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: We went '74 [1974], '75 [1975], '76 [1976], '77 [1977], '78 [1978], so it's '78[1978].  I think that was the last one.
