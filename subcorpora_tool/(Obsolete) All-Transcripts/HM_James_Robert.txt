Speaker 2: During the--my favorite time of the year is the month of January of each year, because it signals new beginnings and I'm excited about doing things in the month of January.
Speaker 1: And, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  It's a little poem that during my baccalaureate of high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] that a minister did at the end of his speech.  He said, and it goes, I would rather be a could-be if I could not be an are; I would rather be a has-been than a could-have-been by far; for a could-have-been has never been, but a has-been was once an are.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I can, I recalled that during my high school years.  I had a very good memory and I heard the minister say that one time and then I could repeat it after that, so I've never forgotten it.
Story_ID: 370764
Speaker 1: We're gonna begin by talking about your family, and I want to start with your mother.  Can you tell me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother was Annie Mae Gee James [Annie Gee James].
Speaker 1: Can you spell it please?
Speaker 2: It's A-N-N-I-E, middle name was M-A-E, and the maiden name was G-E-E, and her last name was James, J-A-M-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when was she born?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know the exact date of her birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: I think she was born somewhere around Hattiesburg, Mississippi, but I'm not absolutely certain of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we talk more about your mother, can you remember your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I remember one grandmother, because she lived with us for a while when I was a youngster and I have a vague memory of her.  Her name was Mrs. Rosie Rogers [ph.]; I believe her last name was Rogers, and she was a very interesting person because she had some Native American background in her and she was unique because her eyes were totally different from ours and, but we had a good relationship.  She lived with us in our, at our home in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, for a few years when I was a youngster.
Speaker 1: Do you know what tribe she might be from?
Speaker 2: No, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said her eyes were different.  They were a different color (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she had a, you could tell that she was, had some Indian in her background or something other than African American, because, primarily because of her eyes and her skin tone.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I never knew a grandfather.
Story_ID: 370765
Speaker 1: Your mother [Annie Gee James].  Tell me, did she share any stores about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  We, my mother was a very active person.  She was PTA [Parent Teacher Association] president in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, for just all of my childhood years.  I think she, every time she would try to not run for president of the PTA of Royal Street High School [Hattiesburg, Mississippi] or Rowan High School [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], they would come back and ask her to continue to serve, so during most of my years she was president of the PTA and she ran her own business.  She was a beautician, and so the beauty shop was the front of our house, so during, when we could come in from school or wherever, we would walk right into my mother's business, which was a beauty shop, and it was a popular place of gathering around in the community, so we saw our teachers and people from the church would be in our house, getting their hair fixed.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Just tell me about your mother; what type of person, you said she was a very popular person and one that kind of took charge of things.  What kind of relationship did you have personally with your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a very, very close relationship with my mother and so did all of us who were siblings.  We, I grew up in a family of five boys and one girl, and my mother was clearly the dominant personality in the family and my father [Jim James] was a breadwinner, a very strong man, who went to work every day, but my mother made most of the family decisions that affected us and, but she was a gentle person.  She was very kind.  She had a soft tone in her voice, but she was very decisive in what she wanted to do and what she thought we should do.  She had a strong conviction and belief in education that that was the way for us to do better in our lives than she had done in hers, but she was a very strong person, spoke kindly of everybody, very active in the church.  She was a missionary in the A.M.E. church [Zion Chapel A.M.E. Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and a leader in the community.  She was the president of the colored women's club in Hattiesburg.  She was very active in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  She was just a leader throughout our community.
Speaker 1: Your mother made most of the decisions, you said.  Was she the disciplinarian of the home?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  My father did not talk a lot, but when he said something we all knew that was it, you know, but my mother gave most of the orders around the house and kept everybody in order and ran the house, ran her business, and she was the one who made sure that we went to school, that we did what we were supposed to do, we stayed out of trouble.  It was pretty much my mother.
Story_ID: 370766
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your dad a little bit.  You told us a little bit about him, but tell us some more about your father (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father's name was Jim James, and he was a very strong man, who worked for the same company all of his life.  He worked for a company called Dixie Pine [Dixie Pine Chemicals, Inc., Hattiesburg, Mississippi].  Dixie Pine was a turpentine extract company, a little small company right outside of Hattiesburg [Mississippi], and he worked there all of his life, so he, his work clothes always smelled like turpentine, and so if you can envision a small little company in Mississippi that cut, that did pine extract from timber, that's where he worked and in 2007, you could probably imagine that he had to breathe a lot of toxics and inhaled a lot of things that probably were not good for his body, but he never missed a day of work, he never drove a car.  He, early in his, in my childhood, I can remember him riding a bicycle to work, but most of the time he walked.  In 1940s, oh sometime in the '50s [1950s], my father bought a 1947 Plymouth, but he never drove it.  My oldest brother [Jimmie James, Jr.] drove it most of the time.  So, we, but he always continued to walk to work and it wasn't a short walk.  He was a very religious man.  He was the treasurer of the church and he was the treasurer of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] of our elementary school [Grace Love Elementary School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and he was a trusted person.  People liked Jim James (laughter).
Story_ID: 370767
Speaker 1: How much education did your parents have?
Speaker 2: I believe my mother [Annie Gee James] might have had about, oh, seventh grade or so, and my father [Jim James] probably about the same.  They never finished high school, but they were, if you had met my mother, you would have thought she had a college education because she was always, you know, presiding at civic club meetings and taking a leadership role with Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi, and you never would have imagined that she did not have a college education, or high school education.  She actually went to, it was called the Poro beauty school in Mississippi, which was the elitist beauty culture school, so she was a trained beautician, and I can remember at her funeral, the high school teachers and things talking about my mother and then the community organizations that she had started and led; for example, my mother was the first president of the retarded children's association in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, which was something that she created, and she worked that organization until it became an established entity in our community that still exists today, but all of that was stuff that this lady created that did not have a high school education, but there are numerous other things that she did in Hattiesburg, that have lived beyond her.
Story_ID: 370768
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to say about your dad [Jim James]?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was the, was the consummate strong male figure.  He was dependable.  He probably kept, spent very little on himself.  He probably, I can remember him having one pair of dress shoes, but maybe two pair of work boots.  He had maybe one suit that he wore to church and to the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meetings, et cetera, but he had a lot of work clothes, and so he was the figure in our family who we depended on to provide the stability of our household and so forth and he was a good role model for a family that had five boys.
Speaker 1: Who do you get most of your characteristics from, your mother [Annie Gee James] or your father?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  I think that most of my characteristics are probably, I'm a blend, but probably most of them are from my mother's and, but there are some aspects of my demeanor around my children in my house that are exactly the same as my father's.  My wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] kind of dominates the affairs of the children and, you know, I have to go to work and she is now taking care of a grandbaby and I'm at work.
Story_ID: 370769
Speaker 1: You said there were six children in your household.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me who they are and let's go in order and so you can tell me where you fit in.
Speaker 2: My oldest brother is Dr. Jimmie James, Jr.  He's chairman of the music department at Jackson State University [Jackson, Mississippi], and he's been at Jackson State for years, and the second oldest is Arthur James and Arthur is, his last major employment was he was the director of the Yazoo City Community Action agency [Yazoo City, Mississippi].  He lives in Yazoo City, Mississippi, and he's now a consultant.  The next one is John James [John L. James], who spent years in [U.S.] military, marine, and went to Vietnam [Vietnam War].  He, after he left the military, he went to work at the post office and moved to Omaha, Nebraska.  He and his wife and his family have grown up there, and he's retired now, so that's three.  The next one is my sister.  I've got them out of order.  My sister went before John (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my sister is Elease James Lindsey, and she is a school, elementary school teacher, but her, she married a husband that was a soldier and they lived most of their early life in Germany, and their children, most of their early education was in Germany, most of their early education was in Germany and now they, they lived, they moved back to Hattiesburg [Mississippi] and have retired there, and then of course, John, who I have mentioned, lives in Omaha.  Then I'm next.  I'm second from the bottom, and after me, there's Bobby Ray James, who lived most of his life in Hattiesburg.  He's the only one who did not leave Hattiesburg for a good time and he was actually living with my mother [Annie Gee James] when she passed, and now he is in the, he's had physical and mental problems and he's in the East Mississippi Hospital [East Mississippi State Hospital] in Meridian, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 370770
Speaker 1: As children tell me about the neighborhood that you lived in, or the area that you lived in.
Speaker 2: All right, we lived on, I can remember during my childhood three places that we lived.  The first was a public housing project.  It was called Jackie Robinson Place [sic. Robinson Place] in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and that was a classic public housing project.  It was clean.  It was orderly and it was a very nice place to live for people who did not have much money and our first house that my parents [Annie Gee James and Jim James] bought was on the corner, right across the street from Jackie Robinson Place, if I recall, and I can remember it being a frame house that was on some high foundation that you could, the young kids could run in and out, underneath the house, and I can remember throwing a rock at the public  bus and running under the house as a little child and then we moved to the house that we lived in most of my life and was on Ruby Avenue in Hattiesburg, and it was a concrete block house that was a very nice place for us and had a little back yard and so we, we grew up, most of us grew up there.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you moved to Ruby Avenue?
Speaker 2: I would, if I recall I might have been, oh, nine or ten, so most of my life was on Ruby Avenue.
Story_ID: 370771
Speaker 1: What is your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, I enjoyed school and I did well in school and so most of my early childhood memories are of things at school and one of the things that I remember, getting into trouble at school one day and the football coach chased me away from the playground and also, and I was able to avoid him and ran home and before I could get home, one of the teachers had already talked to my mother [Annie Gee James] and so it was, the punishment came two-fold.  I got punished at school for whatever I had done and I got punished at home, and I can remember that kind of incident more than anything at school.  The other thing that I can remember that dominated my latter years in high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] was we had an organization called the Esquire Organization for Males [ph.], which was kind of a forerunner of a college-type fraternity, but these were some high achieving high school young men who dressed for school every day, wore shirts and ties and we had a little white jacket with an emblem on it that was called the, it had the Esquire Organization for Males, so we had the EOM emblem on our jacket and if we wore our jackets we always had to wear a tie, and so that organization was kind of the thing that kept, was dominant during my last couple years of school and those people who were in that organization with me, some of them I talked to even today, and to the individual they were all high achieving persons who did well after high school, went to college and [U.S.] military or something, and high achievers.
Story_ID: 370772
Speaker 1: Tell me the make-up of the community or neighborhood of Ruby Avenue.
Speaker 2: It was, all of us were similar.  It was hard-working people who were, who just had children who were in the public school system.  They were, most of them worked for either a small company or some kind of retail operation around Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  Most of the women who were head of households that I recall were domestic workers.  These, this would have been during the early '60s [1960s] and '50s [1950s] and most of them would have worked for some white homeowner in Hattiesburg and a lot of them did domestic work, so, but it was a closely knit community.  People looked for everybody else's children.  If I did something and Mrs. Magabee [ph.] saw me do it, she would call Mrs. Annie Mae [Annie Gee James](laughter) and tell her about what her child did, or she would discipline me on the spot, and so you had everybody in the neighborhood taking care of everybody else's children, and that made for a good family environment; especially, if you had a family like ours, where there were, you know, five boys and a girl, the guys would, there were ample opportunities for us to get into a lot of trouble and during those years, that was during the peak of segregation in the United States and right at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, that was a time when black communities kind of stuck together, and you had no option.  In order to survive, you would have to stick together.  We had a, Hattiesburg was one of the places that during the Civil Rights Movement, that was a, that kind of developed some of the leaders for the State of Mississippi.  It was a place where we had, the Vernon Dahmer residence was bombed, and so you had a lot of things that took place in Hattiesburg; even though Hattiesburg was, for the State of Mississippi, had a smaller black population than most of the larger areas in the State of Mississippi.
Story_ID: 370773
Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school.  What was the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to a school called Grace Love Elementary School [Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and it was a very interesting way that I ended up at that school.  It was not the closest elementary school to where we lived, but my mother [Annie Gee James] was a good friend of the principal at Grace Love, and so, and her, and the principal's wife was a client at my mother's beauty shop and so forth and so for some reason we ended up going to that school, and it was actually a good walk from our house, because we walked to school every day, and there was no school bussing and that kind of thing.  We walked and it was, we would probably end up walking through a, if I recall we walked through a white neighborhood to get over to the other black community where this school was, and it was an all-black elementary school and it was a good school.  We had some real good teachers, and teachers who were really concerned that we learn something that would benefit us in the future, and I can remember Ms. Radcliffe [ph.], and some of the other teachers actually really taking a serious interest in our well-being, and it was, Mr. Bailey [P.C. Bailey] was the principal and he, his family was close to my family and we, he took a special interest in us, and it was a really a good, good nurturing environment and, of course, my father [Jim James] was the treasurer of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], so if we did anything wrong, he would find out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother was the PTA of this school also?
Speaker 2: My mother was the president of the PTA of the high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] that we eventually went to.
Speaker 1: Oh, high school, okay, all right.  So, you mentioned a couple of teachers who really seem concerned about your education.  What were you interested in in elementary school?  Did you like to read or what was your interest?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I was always a serious student.  My, and I had some friends in high school and elementary school who were also good students, and so I read a lot.  I was always dreaming and I had a vivid imagination of what I wanted to be and I could remember later on a friend of mine sitting on his front porch and we're both saying we're gonna own businesses, and we both own businesses pretty much (laughter), and so we, I can, we were very active young people.  We did all the things that boys do.  One of my good friends broke his arm jumping out of a swing at the elementary school, and that arm is still out.  I was visiting with him in Washington, D.C., a few months ago and he still can't straighten his arm.
Speaker 1: Who is this?
Speaker 2: His name is George McFarland.  He owns the McFarland and Company [sic. McFarland and Associates Inc., Washington, D.C.], which is a very successful company in the D.C., Maryland area and he even gave my son [Robert James, II] a summer job when he was a student at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], so those were high school, elementary school friends.
Story_ID: 370774
Speaker 1: Besides reading, did you belong to any outside organizations like the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was involved in everything from elementary school [Grace Love Elementary School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] right through high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi].  I was involved in the student council, for example, in high school and--
Speaker 1: But let's just stay in elementary school, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In elementary school, everything that moved, the Y, during those years, I think church organizations pretty much dominated what we were involved in.  We were very involved in A.M.E. church [Zion Chapel A.M.E. Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and my godmother was an advisor to the women's missionary young people department of the Women's Missionary Society, and so every Saturday I was at a church, at a YPD [Young People's Division] meeting in Mississippi, and we travelled throughout the state, so I, I got a chance to go to all little churches on Saturday.  If I wasn't playing Little League baseball, I was at church and I played a lot of Little League baseball.  My mother [Annie Gee James] liked athletics, and so we were, all of us were heavily involved in some kind of athletic program.  I was a very good Little League baseball player, and I would have thought that I would have been a professional baseball player by now, because I was very good and so during those elementary years we played a lot of baseball and participated in all kinds of youth activities around the school.
Story_ID: 370775
Speaker 1: What were holidays like at your house?
Speaker 2: They were very nice.  We were poor but we didn't know we were poor.  We, I found out that I was poor after I got to college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] and in a great society where they told you what the poverty level was, and we never were above the poverty level, but my mother [Annie Gee James] could go and get to use the food stamps and get the, I thought all peanut butter came in cans, because the peanut butter that my USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] surplus peanut butter that we have plenty of at our house, and we also have plenty of powdered milk, and my mother would buy one carton of regular milk and she would mix the powdered milk and so forth and she would make a lot of milk and so we had a lot of milk and cereal.  She would get the surplus of flour and stuff, and so she cooked real, she was a very good cook and she cooked a lot of biscuits and so we had a lot of, we were poor but did now know it, and so when holidays would come and my father [Jim James] at Dixie Pine [Dixie Pine Chemicals, Inc., Hattiesburg, Mississippi], would always give the workers a turkey or ham every Christmas, and so we would have that turkey or that ham around, and so that was at the holidays.  It was a very festive time for us and a lot of love and family activities.
Story_ID: 370776
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your time in elementary school [Grace Love Elementary School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and you were a very good student.  At that time, did you have any idea of what you wanted to do when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Most of my life I was so active in the church, I kind of thought I would end up doing something that related to the church, until in high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi]; then, I kind of knew I wanted to be in business, but during the elementary school years, I would think I would have thought that I was going to be something in the church.
Speaker 1: Something like what?
Speaker 2: Like a minister.  Because I was so active in the young peoples' organizations, the YPD [Young People's Division] of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church during those early years, and so I would probably, it would have been logical for me to continue, a lot of the people who were involved with us are people like Floyd Flake [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake], who was a good friend of mine and he stayed in the ministry.  Dr. William Watley [William D. Watley], for example, was a friend of ours, and, so we would have met at youth organizations at national YPD meetings and that kind of thing and so I'm the only one of the three men, young men, in that group who ventured off into business (laughter) because I kind of--Flake is in business too, and so we, but we kind of grew up in the church.  The church was very important to our family life and especially in those elementary school years, if I recall, my brother was very active and my brothers were very active in the church and so is my sister [Elease James Lindsey] and my mother [Annie Gee James] and my father [Jim James], and so the school and church [Zion Chapel A.M.E. Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and all that kind of blended to make the family of institutions that shaped us.
Story_ID: 370777
Speaker 1: What about music in the home?
Speaker 2: Oh, we were, we loved music.  My mother [Annie Gee James] loved music and so did my father [Jim James], in his own quiet way, but he, my mother made it possible for all of us to learn to play a musical instrument.  We were poor.  She could only afford one instrument and, well, originally she could only afford one.  She bought a saxophone and so all of the boys, starting with my oldest brother [Jimmie James, Jr.], who is a musician, who was actually a trained musician, learned how to play saxophone, so one of the highlights of my mother's life was at a church program and four of us, who could play the various saxophones, played 'How Great Thou Art,' on saxophone for my mother, and that was, you know, I learned how to play and my mother bought an alto saxophone.  I understand that my brother has actually got that saxophone and has had it refurbished, my oldest brother, who was at Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], but they, and then when my sister [Elease James Lindsey] came along, she bought a clarinet, so we had two musical instruments that the family owned and my sister learned how to play the clarinet.  Well, if you have five boys and one girl and all of 'em playing saxophone, the only one, my youngest brother, Bobby Ray [Bobby Ray James], probably never learned how to play a musical instrument but, you know, things change when the youngest child comes.  But, we, we've had to learn how to play an instrument that the school would furnish, so after you learned how to play the saxophone, if you wanted to stay involved in the high school band, and stay involved in music, you had to learn how to something that they school would supply, so all of us were kind of large-sized.  My oldest brother became a tuba player and so his major instrument throughout college and throughout all of his music education, is a tuba.  He did his senior recital at Jackson State on the tuba, and so I learned, then Arthur [Arthur James] learned how to play the tuba, of course, and he played the tuba in the high school band.  John [John L. James] went into, started playing high school football, so he never really continued his music, even though he learned how to play the saxophone because my mother insisted all of us learn how to play saxophone and, of course, I learned how to play the saxophone and when I got to high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], I gave up the saxophone because I would have to give it up because my younger brother, Bobby Ray, would have had to take the saxophone, but he never really learned how to play it if I recall, but I played tuba in high school.  I played the French horn, I played baritone, and then when I got to college, of course I played at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] in the marching band.  I played tuba for two years.  So, everybody in the house, just about, knew how to play a musical instrument.
Story_ID: 370778
Speaker 1: Besides music, sports was a big thing in your household also.  Did y'all listen to the radio, listen to the baseball games or different programs?
Speaker 2: We had a radio and you could get the St. Louis Cardinals in Mississippi, and so all of us were, would listen to the St. Louis Cardinals and we had another reason for listening to 'em too, because my mother [Annie Gee James] had one sister who was Aunt Sarah [ph.].  Aunt Sarah lived in East St. Louis [Illinois], and during the summers we would go to East St. Louis if we could go, and Uncle Pete [ph.] would always take us on the Blue--the Cardinal Redbird Express, it was called.  We would get on the bus in East St. Louis and we go to Busch Stadium [St. Louis, Missouri] and watch the Cardinals baseball team, but the, so we, the cardinals would have been the team that we listened to.  Most of us around Jackie Robinson and all would have been Dodger [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] fans, but we listened to the Cardinals baseball game.  Harry Caray was the announcer.  I can remember it as of today, because his son, one of his sons, Skip Caray, became the announcer for the Atlanta Braves, but we were very active in sports.  We loved baseball, my mother loved baseball.  She wanted me to play football.  All of us were athletic in a way, even though we were musicians and we played in the band, we played a lot of football and baseball around the neighborhood [in Hattiesburg, Mississippi], et cetera.
Speaker 1: What else did you listen to on the radio?
Speaker 2: I can't remember listening to much other than sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, I can, you know, we, during the Civil Rights Movement, of course, we would listen to those programs that, something about what Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was doing and that kind of thing, but we primarily listened to--
Speaker 1: To sports.
Speaker 2: When we turned it on, we would turn it on to the Cardinals baseball game.
Story_ID: 370779
Speaker 1: So now, you go to high school.  Tell me the name of your high school.
Speaker 2: I went to Rowan High School [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], it was the high school that I graduated from, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  You had a segregated school system during my years of school, and during the years of most of my family and so the high school would have been, the progression of high schools started at a school called Eureka [Eureka School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and then it changed to Royal Street [Royal Street High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and then it changed to Rowan.  Now, these were the black schools, because on the white side of the community you had Hattiesburg High [Hattiesburg High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] and some other schools, and, but our schools were Eureka, Rowan--Royal Street, and Rowan.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Rowan?
Speaker 2: R-O-W-A-N.  It's L.J. Rowan.  It was a person's name, but this is, that's the school that I would have finished high school.
Speaker 1: High school?  All right, well tell me about your years at high school.
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a wonderful time at high school.  It was, we were, I was a good student.  I played in the high school band for all of my years in high school.  I either, played some instrument that is for, I might have started on the saxophone, but I eventually ended up playing some instrument that the school could supply, and I learned how to play several of them, and so I played my senior year and my junior year I probably played tuba, because we were, I was tall, and the high school band director would say well, you know, "Robert [HistoryMaker Robert James], you can play the tuba."  And so, I would take the tuba home and practice it and then I would learn how to play the tuba and I played the tuba.  During those years, my oldest brother [Jimmie James, Jr.] was also a band director in the Hattiesburg community at the county school and, of course, his instrument was a tuba and so I can remember on occasion actually playing. When his high school band had a big game out of town I would actually go with them and play with his band.  So, I had a very interesting and involved high school.

Speaker 1: I was president of my class, I was president of the student council, I ran for state student council president and won, and I went to the, I represented the State of Mississippi at the National Student Council [National Association of Student Councils] meeting and I think that was at, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the university [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] there and then I also represented the State of Mississippi at the Williamsburg Student Burgesses in Williamsburg, Virginia.  One of the interesting things about my representation of the State of Mississippi at the National Student Council meeting is that our delegation unseated the white delegation.  There was a delegation that represented, we were the Magnolia State Association of Student Councils and the white kids were the Mississippi State Association of Student Councils, and we both showed up at the National Student Council meeting in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I believe, and we were, by vote of the group we contested the seating of the white delegation and we were, we won, and we were seated representing the State of Mississippi so, so during those early years I represented the State of Mississippi at the National Student Council meeting.  We also, I met some lifetime long friends during those years.  One of them is the congressman from the State of Georgia named Sanford Bishop [HistoryMaker Sanford Bishop, Jr.].  Well, Sanford and I met at the, he represented the State of Alabama and we met for the first time at the National Student Council meeting again, at the Williamsburg Student Burgesses, but then we continued our friendship when he came to Atlanta [Georgia] to go to college at the same time that I came to Atlanta to go to college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] and so we saw each other around Atlanta and we still see each other now, so we formed a somewhat of a lifelong friendship and now we have members of a couple of same fraternities, we're both in a Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], so forth, so we see each other and, but all of that started as, during the years when I was the high school student council president in the State of Mississippi.
Story_ID: 370781
Speaker 1: We were involved with the, what we call the Hi-Y then.  It was the high school YMCA-type [Young Men's Christian Association] organization (laughter) and I was involved in that and, of course, during those sane years I was still involved in church activities.  I became the state president of the Young People's Division of the Women's Missionary Society of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and I traveled to the quadrennial convention and I was elected first vice president at a time when Dr. William Watley [William D. Watley], who is now a minister in the New York/New Jersey area, but he was the president.  I was the first vice president, and Floyd Flake [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake], who was our congressman in New York, is a retired congressman now, but he was the treasurer.  So, those were, all of that was during my high school years [at L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] and early college years [at Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] of the church activity, but the, our high school, we had some wonderful teachers.  Our teachers would have been graduates of colleges like Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] and Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], and they were all leaders.  Our high school principal, Mr. Burger [N.R. Burger], was, had a degree from Alcorn, but he also had a master's degree from Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] and he was, he understood what it would take for us to succeed in life and so we had a lot of things going in our high school years that were motivational and we were always working on things.  We took home economics and shop and everything that they had so I had all kinds of possibilities.  I did not play high school football, which was somewhat of a disappointment to my mother [Annie Gee James], I believe, because she wanted us to play football, (laughter) but I did play all of my four years in the band and I played a lot of baseball, and I played baseball until the high school baseball team, for financial reasons or whatever, was discontinued, but we were very active young people; I mean, we were involved in all kinds of activities.
Story_ID: 370782
Speaker 1: Was there one teacher that sticks in your mind as someone who might have encouraged you?
Speaker 2: I had probably several.  There were, there were three, oh, there must be like five that come to mind.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me who they are.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The first one would, of course, be Mrs. Chambers [Marjorie W. Chambers], who was like the government/civics type teacher and she was a tall, stately lady who really was very articulate and she was a good role model for us and she kept an interest in us throughout our lives.  I mean, of course, she was a client of my mother's [Annie Gee James] beauty shop, so she was in my house then from time to time, and she was also a member of a small A.M.E. church [Zion Chapel A.M.E. Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] around the area, so I would see her at church too.  So, she was a motivational force for me as well as for most of the kids who would have come through Rowan High School [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] during those years.  I can remember an administrator named Mr. Black [ph.], whose wife was a teacher.  He was very interested in us.  When we formed the Esquire Organization for Males [ph.], we had a Mr. Heath [W.J. Heath], who was a teacher who became kind of our advisor and he was a very, he would have been a great role model for any young people.  He has a wonderful family that was around there, and so then there was Ms. Hopkins [ph.], who was a speech and drama teacher, who, she was very good.  She was motivating us.  She was teaching us public speaking when we were, when we didn't know we'd ever make a public speech, and then there was the home economics teacher and the typing; we had a cadre of really dedicated teachers at Rowan High School, all of whom who had some impact on us.  I can remember Mrs. Nicholson [Helen Nicholson], who was a foreign language teacher and I was really not a good student in foreign language.  I already took two years of French, but she taught us lessons in French that had to do with life rather than just learning a language that most of us were never gonna use, and I think she understood that.  I think she understood that that was a way to teach us that there were other cultures in the world and there were other languages and so forth and so we had two years of foreign language in high school, Mrs. Nicholson--and then I think her name was Mrs. Brown [ph.] when she married--but she was just a part of our life and so, so there were just a lot of good teachers.  And, of course, our principal, Mr. Burger [N.R. Burger], and his wife--his wife was one of our teachers, but Mr. Burger--I remember Mr. Berger coming in, he wanted me to go to Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], his school, and then he arranged for, I think it was Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] where he had his master's [degree] from, so I could have gone to Purdue if I had wanted to.  I mean, so he--there were people who took a real interest in our well-being.
Story_ID: 370783
Speaker 1: One of the things that I remember most about high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] is the after school things.  My, I had a lot of good friends.  One of them was a young man named George McFarland.  I mentioned earlier--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: His company is McFarland and Company [sic. McFarland and Associates Inc., Washington, D.C.], now, but George and I were sitting on his front porch and his daddy already owned his own business.  His daddy was a concrete finisher and we were sitting on the porch and there was a Nehi Bottling Company across the street from their house, down the block, and we would watch that business and we said, you know, "We should own that business," and so we started talking about owning businesses when we were in tenth grade, I mean, and we were serious.  John Johnson, who was one of my very good friends, he is now the news director of the NBC affiliate [sic. WTOK-TV] in Meridian, Mississippi, and he, he went on and got his master's [degree] in fine arts from Indiana [sic. University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  He was a professor at Rust College [Holly Spring, Mississippi] for a few years and then he went back into the broadcasting and went to Meridian, and now he is the top newsperson in Meridian, Mississippi, and it just goes on and on.  There was Harold Jackson, who was a member of my high school class, who is, at one time, was the high statewide receiver in the National Football League [NFL], and so there was just a lot of us, Walter Early [ph.], who went to California to go to college and, so we had a great, great group of high school friends who we still communicate with today.
Story_ID: 370784
Speaker 1: Did you have a job while you were in high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: I had several (laughter).  In order to have clothes to wear you had to kind of, we had to work.  My mother [Annie Gee James]--we were poor.  We didn't know it.  We picked cotton during the summer.  We would, right before school, in order to get the clothes to wear to school, so that we would have new jeans and new shirts for school.  We would all get on the truck and the white guy would come who had the cotton farm, would come to the neighborhood early in the morning, five o'clock in the morning, and he would pick up his crew for the day and we would all go pick cotton, and so all of us picked cotton to some extent.  I don't remember my sister [Elease James Lindsey] ever going, but she probably might have, but all of us did, all the boys did, and we picked cotton.  I can remember working in a bakery for a little while, but we had odd jobs.  I was the yard man for a lady, a white lady who had this--I used to think it was the biggest house and the biggest yard, but I used to rake her yard and she would pay me and then she would let me sit on the back porch and she would bring me some sandwiches and some juice.  But, I was, a few years ago I went back to Hattiesburg [Mississippi] and drove by that house and it's a small house (laughter).  I thought it was the largest house in the world but we had all kinds of little odd jobs like too, make things go right.
Story_ID: 370785
Speaker 1: So you had quite a few people that could guide you to college.  What made you decide to go to the school that you went to?
Speaker 2: I went to Morris Brown College in Atlanta [Georgia], and I would have left high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] in '64 [1964] and I would have been in college from '64 [1964] to '68 [1968], but in 1964, I competed in a church contest for the Boy of the Year of the Young People's Division of the Women's Missionary Society.  It was called Boy of the Year contest.  They selected a boy of the year and a girl of the year, and I was selected boy of the year.  I had served for almost, I would say, six or seven years as president of the Eighth Episcopal District YPD, young peoples' department, and the eighth Episcopal district in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church includes the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and so when I competed for this national recognition, I was awarded as one of the rewards, a four-year scholarship to Morris Brown by the A.M.E. church.  So, at that convention, Emma Darnell [Emma I. Darnell], who was at that time, a professor at Morris Brown, she made the presentation at the Connectional YPD meeting and so I became a, that's how I ended up going to Morris Brown.  Now, I had been awarded an academic scholarship to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and I always thought that I would end up going to Fisk out of high school, but I went to Atlanta just to get away from home early.  I had gotten a letter from the band director, inviting me to participate in the band and he had, Mr. Cleopas Johnson at Morris Brown was building a band at Morris Brown.  This was during the years when Morris Brown had a really, was beginning to have a good band and he saw that, he would get, he had somebody in the registrar office that would tell him if a student applied to Morris Brown who could play a musical instrument, even if they had expressed no interest in the band, and so he would write you a letter and invite you to come early and try out for the band and so I did, and so I left home early and went to Atlanta to participate in the band rehearsals.  This was like three weeks before the regular students would come, but I had my scholarship papers for Fisk University in my suitcase, so I was going to hang around Atlanta for a couple of weeks and then I was going to go on (laughter) to Fisk, because I had always wanted to go to Fisk because of Richard R. Wright, who was bishop in an A.M.E. church, who graduated from Fisk University, and I grew up in that little one-room church [Zion Chapel A.M.E. Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] and looking at pictures of Richard R. Wright and reading his biography and I did hear that he was from Fisk University, so I was going to Fisk, but then I went to Morris Brown.
Story_ID: 370786
Speaker 1: Before you leave high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], though, the year before you leave high school in '63 [1963], a number of things happened.  One of them was the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] speech or the March on Washington.  Do you remember anything about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember, I remember it very clearly.  I remember, I also remember the assassination, I remember when and where it was, and--
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: During the March on Washington, that would have been '63, [1963], I would have been, and I can remember us being in Mrs. Chambers' [Marjorie W. Chambers] class during most of that when things were going on and then traveling to Washington [D.C.] and I did not go, but I had friends who went and I had some, some of us were very heavily involved, my mother [Annie Gee James] was very heavily involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  She was an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] officer in Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  We actually were, when the Freedom Riders came down to Mississippi during those years to do the voter registration, some of them lived in our house and so we had the threats of cross burnings and all that that place during those years, but we were all kind of moved by that and I think all of those years, those years changed our lives, and then we had Mrs. Chambers, who was our civic teacher, to kind of put everything in perspective to tell us how we fit, what we were doing in civics class fit that, and what we were supposed to do to participate and what we were supposed to do was make good grades in school and go to college and make a difference in the world if we could.
Story_ID: 370787
Speaker 1: And then the death of Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], assassination of Kennedy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was during my high school years too [at L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and we were at school when we got the notice and we were, the whole school was kind of in turmoil.  It is amazing how an incident that far away, that distant from where we were in a small town in Mississippi in a little black high school, 125 kids in my senior class, could be moved by an event that far away, and I think that was, and could be positively motivated by it.  We were distraught, but we were positively motivated and I think all of that is, was a result of the teachers that we had who put everything in perspective.  They had lived thorough lives.  They had gone through segregation and they survived through it.  They had gone through black colleges, black schools and so forth and they had a vision as to what the future was gonna be like and they thought they would prepare us for the future and we, they interpreted things for us so we got good interpretations for life.
Story_ID: 370788
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about, we were in 1963 and you stated that some of the civil rights workers that had come south to help with the voter registration, you know, stayed at your home, let's talk about that a little bit more.
Speaker 2: Well, the year '63, [1963], as best I can recall, was a very tumultuous year in the State of Mississippi.  There were all kinds of activities going on, and my mother [Annie Gee James], and father [Jim James], by being active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and we were kind of in the midst of it.  I attended almost all of the civil rights rallies that were held at the churches in Hattiesburg [Mississippi], and I can even remember a high school classmate [from L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], I think his name was Doug Smith, but he was so caught up in the movement, and a lot of our young men and women who were highly motivated were, became part of the movement.  Doug actually left high school and joined the movement and, I understand later on in life he came back to the State of Mississippi with a state patrolman, but we were heavily involved when the Freedom Riders came into the state.  They were some highly motivated, idealistic young people from, they were mostly white from the New England states.  They lived in our house.  Some of them lived in our house and they just bunked in there with us and it was a wonderful experience, and so our, we would been, we received the threats of bombings and cross burnings and things during those years, but we, my mother and my father tried to keep us focused, and they were heavily participating in the Civil Rights Movement, but they tried to, their way of changing the world was for us to get good educations and to stay in school and so forth so we basically were aggressive participants, but we did not leave school to join the movement and so forth and if I recall it was Council of Federated Organizations--they called it COFO--that Medgar Evers and a bunch of them were coming in, and Medgar Evers' brother [Charles Evers], and so forth and so I attended a lot of those meetings and so I was very aware of what was going on and was involved, and so were the rest of my brothers and sister [Elease James Lindsey].
Story_ID: 370789
Speaker 1: You mentioned cross burnings.  Have you ever seen a cross burning?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I've seen a cross burning.  I've seen a bunch of guys in hoods jump off of a red truck and stick a cross up there and set it on fire and so, we had a lot of tremendous unique experiences.  One of the things in the State of Mississippi, especially if you travelled as a young person on Saturdays to churches, it was a dangerous time because you just didn't know where the threat was and my godmother and I were travelling throughout the State of Mississippi, going to YPD [Young People's Division] meetings, young people department meetings of the Women's Missionary Society A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church throughout the state, and I was YPD president, and I was travelling all over Mississippi, to Port Gibson [Mississippi], and up in the Delta, and also areas in Louisiana, because our district covered Mississippi and Louisiana, and down to Shreveport [Louisiana] and New Orleans [Louisiana] and so forth, and so just driving around in the South during those years was a dangerous thing, and so we would get stopped every now and then by policemen, who would harass us, but we survived all of that, and so, but those were some very, very unique times in our history.
Speaker 1: You said that there was a family that was bombed in your, in Hattiesburg [Mississippi] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we, I lived in Hattiesburg with the Vernon Dahmer family.
Speaker 1: Dahmer?  Spell that for me, please.
Speaker 2: I think it's just D-A-M-E-R [sic.].  But, they were a farm family that, my mother [Annie Gee James] was very close to them, but they were very heavily involved in the Civil Rights Movement, and one of the major bombings that took place in the State of Mississippi was the Dahmer family there.  Mr. Dahmer was killed and my mother was just distraught over that because she was close to that family and then the family that my sister [Elease James Lindsey] married into was very close to that family; in fact, lived in that same area, but it was just a family of people who are heavily involved in the Civil Rights Movement, who, some of the people who wanted to stop us from doing what we were doing, just blew up their house.
Story_ID: 370790
Speaker 1: Okay, so you head off to Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] for the summer, so you think (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, for a few weeks, just to get away from home for the summer (laughter) to practice in the band.
Speaker 1: So, what happens now once you're there and see what's going on at Morris Brown?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had so much fun.  During those few weeks I had decided that I would go and spend it in Atlanta [Georgia].  I enjoyed Atlanta so much I, it was just an exciting place.  I mean, they had all the colleges there.  There was Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Clark [Clark College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morris Brown and Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and seminary, that was a good place for me to be, and so I just totally forgot about the possibility of going to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I had my scholarship papers in my dorm room for the whole four years I was at Morris Brown, but the, so, I got involved in the band and so forth, but I found out when I went to the registrar's office to register, that the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church had no money to give to scholarship, but it didn't deter me at all.  I called my godmother, who called the bishop's wife, who called the bishop's wife in my district, which was in Mississippi and Louisiana, who called the bishop's wife in the State of Georgia, and the bishop's wife told her husband to go over there and find a scholarship for our boy of the year over at Morris Brown, and so even though the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] had written all kinds of wonderful articles, they had covered the convention where I was awarded the scholarship and I had all those papers and things, but when I got over at the school, they had no record.  The president of Morris Brown at the spur of the moment at the meeting, had decided that the youngsters who won those awards ought to be given four-year scholarships to Morris Brown.  I was very fortunate because I did not have to rely on the church scholarship.  We, during 1964, the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] had awarded Morris Brown, I think four scholarships, full academic scholarships, for, and you had to qualify, and so I was one of the four students at Morris Brown who qualified who was picked to compete for those scholarships.  I actually ended up going to school on a Ford Foundation scholarship for the first, for years, and so I ended up with a full scholarship at Morris Brown, but I was going to stay there anyway.  I was enjoying it so much, I was a member of the band and the band was exciting.  I had made some friends and we were, we were going bowling at night and that was the first time I had seen young people who had their own cars and so we were, we were having so much fun and so there was no way for me to leave.
Story_ID: 370791
Speaker 1: Hamilton Holmes and [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault are integrating University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I gave it--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: Right before you went to college, Charlayne-Gault and Hamilton Holmes were integrating colleges.  Had you ever thought about going to a school that wasn't all black?
Speaker 1: Very briefly.  During the, my senior year in high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], my high school principal [N.R. Burger], who had done his master's degree, I believe, and I think it was Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], had arranged for me to be considered for a scholarship at Purdue and so that was, I could have gone to Purdue.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But, it was, I had grown up in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and I had been looking at Bishop R.R. Wright's [Richard R. Wright] picture on a poster.  They had pictures of all the bishops in the A.M.E. church in my Sunday school class wall, and his biographical information was there and he was a graduate of Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and that's how Fisk University got on my radar screen.  My brothers and my sister [Elease James Lindsey], my oldest brother [Jimmie James, Jr.] had gone to Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] and my second oldest brother [Arthur James] had started at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and then transferred to Jackson State and my brother [John L. James] right above me had gone to Utica Junior College [Hinds Community College] in the State of Mississippi and played football and then transferred to Jackson State, and my sister had gone to Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], so there's a trend in there that says historically black college [HBCU] (laughter) in spite of their opening things that were opening things that were happening to integrate schools and, of course, through them I had somewhat experienced their college years of fraternities and involvement in student life, so I think I was headed to a historical black college.
Story_ID: 370792
Speaker 1: Tell me about your times there; I mean, what were you involved in at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Freshman year at Morris Brown, I became very involved in all kinds of student leadership organizations.  There was almost a, when we had our first meeting of the band to organize the band, Mr. Cleopas Johnson, who was the band director, picked me to preside.  I had had all kinds of experience presiding at our meetings and I had been the state YPD [Young People's Division] president, and so, and it was obvious that I could preside over the organizing meeting, so I actually presided at the organizing meeting.  Most of the kids in the band did not know my name.  They called me Mississippi. I was the only person from Mississippi in the band, and so most of the kids were from smaller towns around the State of Georgia and from Atlanta [Georgia], and so they just decided it was convenient to just call me Mississippi, so for most of the freshman year, I was known as Mississippi, and so I did well my freshman year.  I made honor roll and I think I was one of the top honor students during the freshman year, and then people started remembering what my name was.  I was, and then I ran, I think I was president of the sophomore class and the junior class, and I was just involved in a lot of things.  I got involved in fraternity life, I became an Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and, of course, that was following in the footsteps of my oldest brother [Jimmie James, Jr.] and my second oldest brother [Arthur James], who were Omegas, and my sister [Elease James Lindsey] is a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], so it was kind of obvious that I was gonna pledge Omega, and so I pledged Omega Psi Phi, and became the Basileus of Alpha Sigma Chapter in Atlanta, so I became a leader in that organization.  I enjoyed all of that.  I was the guy who, when we had the parties, I was the one who made sure everybody got back okay to campus, (laughter) so we had a great time in college.  Academically, I did quite well.  We were, I was an accounting major.  I first went to college and on my applications forms it would say I'm gonna major in religion and philosophy.  I was gonna be an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] preacher or some kind of leader in the A.M.E. church.  So, my application says that I'm going to major in religion and philosophy, but after, I think it was '65 [1965] or so, I decided that I was going to major in accounting and so I majored in accounting and I have two minors, one in business administration and one in economics, and I participated in all kinds of activities throughout college.  I was a member of all the Who's Who type things--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and fraternity organizations, the foreign language organization, even though I never really was a good foreign language student (laughter) so it was a very interesting type of college and very enjoyable.
Story_ID: 370793
Speaker 1: So you get your degree in accounting.
Speaker 2: In accounting, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and that's is a B.A. degree?
Speaker 2: I have a bachelor's [degree] in accounting with, and a major in accounting, B.A. degree, major in accounting with minors in economics and business administration.
Speaker 1: Business administration, okay.  And you graduated in 1968?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1968, and that was a very interesting year because in 1968, that was in the height of draft of students for Vietnam [Vietnam War] and I, having grown up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and there were a couple of newspaper articles in the local paper about things that I had done in college, various little successes that I had had in college, and I would make the dean's list or get a National Honor Society recognition or something and my mother [Annie Gee James] would send it to the newspaper or locally and they would, so there was a lady, her name was Erlyne Schumaker [ph.], who was a, the registrar at the draft Selective Service agency [Selective Service System] in Hattiesburg, who knew my family.  We were a family of five boys, and so that was a lot of soldiers, and so she was there, so she, the day it was announced that I was going, had finished college, she sent my 1-A classification to my mother's house.  In other words, I was going to the [U.S.] military.  I wasn't going to graduate school and I think I--of course, in that graduation announcement, they had also announced that I received this, had been admitted to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], and so she wanted to make sure that I serve the country first, and so she sent my draft notice and my mother came to my graduation from Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] with my notice to report to, for a physical examination for the military in Mississippi, and that was some very interesting times, because, you know, I fully intended to go to Harvard and I did not intend to go into the military at that time, and so I took, I came home for a few days and then I took the bus from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to Boston [Massachusetts] and I went to Boston, and I had my Harvard admission papers and so forth, and fortunately the Harvard Business School had a summer program that year for those of us who were African--so we were the first real sizable group of African Americans at Harvard Business School they had ever admitted and so they had a summer program, and so I, I went to that summer program and then I ended up through a series of just contesting it, ended up being able to defer that military obligation and actually got a physical deferment from an injury that I had suffered playing intramural basketball at Morris Brown, because I was able to get some good consulting advice from people around Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts] on how to make sure that the military gave me full credit for the injury that I had when they were trying to decide whether I was physically able to go to Vietnam, and so I ended up going to business school instead.

Speaker 1: Did any of your brothers go into the service?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Two of my older brothers went; Arthur James, who was the second oldest, was a military policeman for years and he, after he, he didn't not go to Vietnam, I don't believe, but he was in the [U.S.] military and did a lot of work and then my brother right above me, John [John L. James], who was at Utica Junior College [Hinds Community College] playing football and then he transferred to Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] on a baseball scholarship, he actually volunteered to go to Vietnam.  He actually volunteered to the [U.S.] Marine Corps at the height of the Vietnamese war [Vietnam War] and he ended up going to Vietnam and he survived that.  He was a heavy equipment operator.  He was in the Marine Corps and he went to Vietnam and came back, and went to work at the post office and moved to Omaha, Nebraska, but we were kind of a patriotic-type family for people who had come to the Civil Rights Movement.  I just had a priority.  I had been admitted to go to Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] and that was kind of a one-in-a-lifetime kind of thing and so I thought it was a better use of my time to go to Harvard Business School than to go in the military at that time.
Story_ID: 370795
Speaker 1: You had a friend that went to Vietnam, Paul Bland [Paul C. Bland].
Speaker 2: Well he actually, we had, my Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] class was a very interesting class.  We were, I think there were twenty-six of us that were admitted to that class that were African American out of a class of maybe seven hundred fifty or so of people, but that twenty-six was the largest class that had, of African Americans that had ever been admitted to the Harvard Business School, and I think the largest class before us was a class of six, which was the class of '69 [1969].  We were the class of '70 [1970], and then before that, I understand that there had been only two or three, since World War II [WWII], African Americans that had graduated from Harvard Business School with the M.B.A. degree, and so we left and during those years we were heavily involved in trying to recruit other students to the school, but one of my friends who was in that first class that came in with us in 1968, was Paul Bland.  Paul was, went through the same thing that I did, but his was a little bit later.  It was kind of at the close of his first year of business school, where he was being drafted in Virginia, and so Paul ended up having to be, to go into the [U.S.] military, so he was, his class, his education at Harvard was interrupted by, I think, three years of military service and most of it, I don't think he ended up going to Vietnam.  He did, he was a very talented young man who was very smart.  He was a Howard University [Washington, D.C.] graduate who probably did, I think he told me that he ended up being, doing administrative work for a general.  But, he eventually after his years of military service, came back to the Harvard Business School and finished and then he, and he worked here with me at Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia].  He actually helped me start a newspaper called The Savannah Tribune and do a lot of other things during the summer between his business school graduation and he had applied to Duke University law school [Duke University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina], so he eventually went to Duke and finished his law degree and became a lawyer.
Story_ID: 370796
Speaker 1: Before you graduate, though, you worked as an accounting trainee, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was in college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], I went to Middletown, Ohio, and became an accounting trainee at Armco Steel Corporation [AK Steel Holding Corporation] in Middletown, Ohio, and that would have been like the summer of 1967.  That was a very good year for me--we--and it was a wonderful experience.  I was an accounting trainee at Armco Steel during the years when steel industries, companies in the United States were big things.  I mean, American steel had a real steel industry during those years.  It's before the foreign steel took over and so forth, and so Armco Steel was a company that dominated a town.  Middletown, Ohio, was an Armco town and Armco owned the recreational facilities in the town and so I was an accounting trainee there, and it was a wonderful experience because I got a chance to work with some good accountants at Armco Steel, who kind of furthered my business experience, and made the college education meaningful to me at that time.
Story_ID: 370797
Speaker 1: Back to 1968, you said there were a number of things that happened; the draft happened, but something else happened in 1968.
Speaker 2: I got married then that year (laughter) so--my wife is Shirley Barber James [HistoryMaker Shirley James], from Georgetown, South Carolina.  She came to Atlanta [Georgia].  We met in Atlanta.  She was a freshman at Spelman College in Atlanta during the same time that I was at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], and it's a very unique way that we met.  During those years when I mentioned that I was having so much fun in Atlanta, we were going to parties and just having a ball, I'd gone up to be a part of the band and the freshman students came to Atlanta to go to college, and at Spelman, they had a parking lot party, you know, just inside the fence at a parking lot they had a party and they invited students and my home, one of my home girls from Mississippi, Barbara Bell, and she's named Barbara Bell-Robinson now, she had, knew me from high school, student government association activities, she was from the big school in Jackson [Mississippi] and I had run for president against their candidate and I had won, and so we became friends and so, so when they arrived in Atlanta, we arrived all at the same time; at least they came a little later.  I was up there with the band but she invited me to, she called me on the phone and she said, "Robert [HistoryMaker Robert James], why don't you bring some of those boys from Morris Brown over here to Spelman to this freshman orientation party we're having."  And so I took all of the boys out of the tuba section.  There were about eight or ten of us from Morris Brown.  We went over to Spelman and that's when I met my wife.  In fact, we all took that historic walk.  We kind of paired up at, met each other during the parking lot party and then, if I recall, we, my home girl kind of had us come back over there.  We went one Saturday.  We paired up and walked down to the drugstore on, that's now Hunter Street, but now Martin Luther King [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], but, and that's how I met my wife during that year, during '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964]
Speaker 2: And then we dated for four years and then we became, we got married in '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 370798
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your experience at Harvard and some of the people that you met there.
Speaker 2: Well, I went to, I went to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] from '68 [1968] through '70 [1970], and of course, I just got married during that summer of '68 [1968], so my wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] went to Boston [Massachusetts] with me and, you know, so we met some really wonderful people while we were there.  Some of our friends went on to do some spectacular things; in fact, most recently John Garamendi, who is the lieutenant governor of the State of California, was one of our friends.  He was a classmate of ours at the--in fact, he was very close to me because he was in my section of the business school.  He was in section D, but and he just won the lieutenant governor's race in California and he's been the insurance commissioner of California and done some other things.  He was a majority leader of the state senate for years, but when we got to, when we first got to Boston, it was a tremendous adjustment for me.  You know, I had been one of the top students in my class everywhere I had gone (laughter) and there I was in Harvard Business School with everybody who was a top student (laughter) and they were top students at Carnegie [Carnegie Institute of Technology; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and wherever, and so it became a, you had to design your own strategy as to how you succeed in this.  There were only twenty-six of us that were black, and basically most of the professors that predicted that we were not going to succeed.  There was a movement to not give us degrees.  There was, some of the white professors had put forth a notion that they would give the black students that they admit certificates of attendance, instead of M.B.A. degrees.  It was very interesting time--a certificate of attendance for going to the Harvard Business School. So, we had to overcome all of that and we had to prove that we could do the work and we had to exceed.  We had to be very active in the class discussions, so we were able to, twenty-one of us graduated and some of the ones who did not graduate, did not leave for academic reasons.  There was a draft from the Vietnam War and a whole lot of other things, so those were good years for us at the Harvard Business School.
Story_ID: 370799
Speaker 1: We were talking about the successful people at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] that attended while you were there.  Tell me about Herbert Wilkins [HistoryMaker Herbert P. Wilkins, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Herb Wilkins was one of my classmates and my section mates.  We had like seven sections, it was by alphabet, and I was in section D and Herb was, there were three blacks, three African Americans in section D; me, Herb Wilkins, and another guy named Ed Ward [ph.].  Herb was a guy who finished school, undergraduate, at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], I believe, but Herb was a, he was a very good student.  He had an authoritative demeanor about him when he spoke.  People listened and it was, he subsequently graduated and formed a venture capital business during the '70s [1970s], when the venture capital was where you could really make some money, and he ended up making some very successful strategic investments, you know, like some of the national things like the Essence magazine, and organizations like that, that you might know of.  He ended up investing in radio stations and television stations all over the country.  He, he was probably financially one of the most successful of the African Americans that went to Harvard Business School in my class.  We had people like Leon Fuller [Leonard Fuller], who was out in California, who has been very successful, and I see frequently through Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity we are members of, and it was just a wonderful group of people.  My wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] and I have gone back to the reunions after graduation and continued some of those relationships, but those were some good people who went to school there those years.
Speaker 1: Was Daniel Dennis [Daniel Dennis, Sr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dan Dennis was kind of like the senior guy for us.  He was, Dan was a CPA [certified public accountant] before he came to the Harvard Business School.  He was an African American CPA.  When Dan finished the business school, he, it was no question about the fact that he was gonna own his own business; I mean, he and a couple of other guys joined Lucas, Tucker and Company.  At that time, it was the largest African American CPA firm in the country, but Dan eventually established his company [Daniel Dennis and Company LLP] in Boston [Massachusetts], and he's probably, I think he retired several years ago now, but he was very successful, and so almost all of the people who were in my class were successful.
Story_ID: 370800
Speaker 1: I also noticed another thing about my classmates--the African Americans who were at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] during my years--that we were more community-oriented than the youngsters now.  We had our reunion, our thirtieth year reunion, and so we invited all of the African Americans who were in the Harvard Business School at that time to our banquet, and we kind of mingled with them and sat at the table.  One of the, the challenges that African American people as a race will have is that the youngsters think that they are there because they're smart and brilliant.  They have no sense of the heritage, of the suffering or the fact that we were admitted to the Harvard Business School, but then there was a major movement on campus to give us certificates of attendance that we had to overcome.  They are smart, they are smart people, the youngsters that are going there, and, but they don't have, in my opinion, at that time, of course it might be different now, but they had no real sense of the real struggle that it took for us to be there.  Most of those people that I met needed to go to Mrs. Chambers [Marjorie W. Chambers], to Rowan High School [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] and then talk to Mrs. Chambers or to Mrs. Hopkins [ph.], or some of those people, Mrs. Burger, because they had no sense of Africa American heritage and the struggles that it took to, for them to be able to come to the Harvard Business School, but all of the people who were there with me understood that.  They had gone to schools like Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] in Mississippi.  (Unclear) Anderson went to Tougaloo in Mississippi.  (Unclear) understood civil rights and the struggle.  There were four or five of them who were Howard University [Washington, D.C.] graduates and they understood, so all of us had a heritage, or most of us had a heritage of coming through the Civil Rights Movement and so we understood that we were not there just to represent ourselves and just to go out and make as much money as we could.  We were there to do something to lift the race and to lift the people in the country, and so you'll see more of us in education.  Richard Lowery [Richard Lowery III] is still teaching college, and so those of us who stayed in the education field and so forth, now I doubt you'd see a Harvard Business School graduate with an M.B.A. degree coming out and going teaching anywhere.  Those jobs just don't pay what they expect to make, so you, it's just a different world and a different orientation and I think that's one of the challenges that leaders of the African American community will have as to communicate the struggle so that there is some sense that everybody has to do something to help the whole group.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, we can see that the group that was in your class, agreed to encourage black economic development.
Speaker 1: Well, most of us created our own businesses.  You know, it was clear to me that I was gonna work for a black-owned business eventually (laughter) and most of them pretty much did. Goodrich Stokes actually ended up working along with my high school friend, George McFarland, with the McFarland company [McFarland and Associates Inc., Washington, D.C.].  Goodrich Stokes was in my Harvard Business School class and helped him build that business.  So, so, you have, you had a sense of community that was--and mission and goals that were a little bit different than selfish missions and goals.  But the young people who are getting into the school are brilliant people; I mean, they are, they have done well but the part that we need to make sure is there is the fact that they know that they need to do something for the entire race of people.
Story_ID: 370801
Speaker 1: Well, the following year, Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] admitted, I think sixty-three blacks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: The next year so--
Speaker 2: We actually, we actually went and helped recruit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the things that happened during our year, we--all of us were from, were activists and we agitated for more students, so the twenty that were there, just like the six that were there before us, the six that were there before us, in the class that graduated in '69 [1969], they agitated for more students and so we were there because they had created some agitation.  And so, when we were, it was clearly our goal to make sure that the class size continued to increase, so we actually went to historically black colleges [HBCUs] and recruited and we did all kinds of things and insisted that the class coming in would be a larger class.  In fact, two students from Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] followed me to Harvard Business School.  Actually three students from Morris Brown followed me to Harvard Business School, which was somewhat unheard of; a small school like Morris Brown, that three--four of us have Harvard M.B.A. degrees.  You know, of course, there might be more now, but there were four then, and so that's because we actually, we campaigned among the administrators at Harvard.  We did well ourselves so people could forget about the notion that you, that African Americans coming out of the historically black colleges, if coming from anywhere, would get certificates of attendances; I mean, we killed that notion early, but then we had to, and the real way that we killed it was by doing well.  We were good students.  Then, we agitated for more African American students, and we, and so that next class had over sixty, and you know, and it's really, one of the unsatisfactory results is that the class never really continued to grow (laughter) so it kind of leveled off and so I think the African American Student Union at Harvard Business School now is trying to encourage and to recruit and to get more students interested in Harvard Business School.
Story_ID: 370802
Speaker 1: So, the summer before you graduate, you take a summer job.  Is this the first time that you're in banking?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is a, I became a summer intern at Citizen Southern National Bank of Atlanta [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia], and at the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], it's a two-year program and during those years they required that you take a summer job.  They had a lot of other unique requirements.  I mean, we wore, we dressed like we were going to business.  We had shirts and ties on every day.  We went to class with briefcases, and those were just traditions of the Harvard Business School, but one of the requirements was that you take a summer job in a business, and so we had to get jobs and my job was at C&S Bank in Atlanta [Georgia].  I had been walking the hall, Aldrich Hall [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], Baker Hall [sic. Baker Library, Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] at the business school and that was the C&S recruiters there looking for graduates, and I was, I had just finished, was finishing my first year, and I saw them, I wanted up to 'em and started talking to 'em, and the next thing you knew I had my summer job.  And so, I came to work in Atlanta at C&S Bank on the corner of Broad [Street] and Marietta Street and I worked there for that summer.  At the end of the summer, I was called in to the personnel office and offered a full time job to come back, I mean, and the words from Gene Rackley, who was the executive vice president and assistant personnel, he said, "Well, all you have to do is finish your degree and don't go and get into trouble, and you've got a job back at C&S.  You can come back here if you want to."  And so, I was offered a job after the end of my summer, at C&S, and then I was eventually offered a couple of other jobs.  First Chicago [Illinois] offered me a job and Trust Company Bank of Georgia [Trust Company of Georgia; SunTrust Banks, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] offered me a job, and I was also offered a job by the president of Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan], to come to Michigan State after graduation from the business school to be the finance director of a special program that Dr. Robert Green [HistoryMaker Robert Green] was the head of there, and I actually went there and interviewed with them, but then I decided to come back to Atlanta to work for C&S, because I thought I would truly enjoy banking, and so that's how I got back to Atlanta.  But, I enjoyed my summer with the C&S as an intern.  It was a, I got a chance to come down to Savannah [Georgia].  I had never heard of--well, I had heard of Savannah because in college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] I had some friends from Savannah, but I had never been here and I came down here and I met the people at Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia], which is where I eventually became an employee and so that's how all of that kind of fit together.  I met the people at the bank that I'm at now during the summer of '69 [1969] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Summer of '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: --when I was working for C&S Bank and still a student at Harvard Business School.
Story_ID: 370803
Speaker 1: While you were in Boston [Massachusetts], tell me about, or do you have any stories to share besides the fact that they were trying to give you a certificate of attendance, any other problems that might have arisen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] friend, Timothy Sullivan [ph.], came to Boston to go to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and so here we were two African Americans from a little college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] in Georgia, and one was at the Harvard Law School, we were roommates in college and fraternity brothers, and he was at the law school and I was at the business school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] and he was also my barber.  His daddy was a barber and he cut hair to make his extra money, and so we had a, he was over on the law school campus living in the dorm and so we would visit and then later on when he got married, he moved over into Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], and so I had a person, a friend that lived out in the community, so I had an outlet into the community of Roxbury and Boston.  So, I got a chance to kind of get around Boston and get a feel for it and after that summer in Atlanta [Georgia] we had bought a car and so we were mobile and so I had a real good feel for life in Boston.  I didn't like it (laughter).  I liked Georgia and the South better, (laughter) but I did get a chance to drive around to see the beautiful country in the New England area, so.
Story_ID: 370804
Speaker 1: What was going on when, because you were there in Boston [Massachusetts] when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you were doing there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly where I was.  Most people say they can remember exactly where they were.  I can remember where I was when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed, but I don't remember exactly where I was when King was assassinated.  I remember being in Atlanta [Georgia] for, I think I was in Atlanta, but I would have been in Atlanta for King's funeral.  That was probably after I had come out of school, I guess.  I don't know but my years are getting mixed up.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, well he was assassinated in '68 [1968], so you were still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was still in Atlanta.  Let's see, I was--I remember where I was when the funeral came by the campus [of Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was standing right on the corner and you know, down by the college student union building, but I, I don't recall exactly where I was when Martin Luther King was assassinated (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 370805
Speaker 1: So 1970 you graduate from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] and something else happens that's important.  What happens in '70 [1970]?  Your son (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) I was, when we moved to Atlanta [Georgia], our first son was born and his name is Robert Earl James, II [Robert James, II], and he is, that was an interesting development for us because we had been kind of totally independent.  We had, we had a pregnancy while we were in Boston [Massachusetts], and we lost the baby on Christmas Day, and fortunately my wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] was okay but it was a traumatic experience.  I had to call her mother [Camille Moses Barber] and tell her that we were in a little hospital in Massachusetts, and it was snowy out there and it was a mess and we had, and we were up there by ourselves and we had just lost the baby, so, so we, 1970 was a very exciting time for us, for my wife to go through the pregnancy and to have our son, and she had absolutely no complications and so we had the baby and this would have been while we were back in Atlanta, and I was with C&S [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia].
Speaker 1: C&S, um-hm.
Speaker 2: We, he was born at the little hospital in southwest Atlanta, and as history would have it, he built the house within walking distance of where he was born. So, now he's back in Atlanta practicing law and he finished Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and he's finished Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and so he is a lawyer in Atlanta, and his wife [Angela Payne James] is actually, well he is actually a lawyer business person, because he's in the real estate development and some other consulting, but his wife is a partner of a big law firm in Atlanta, so they're both lawyers and we have a grandchild that lives in Atlanta, so they have a baby [Lauren James] and then we just had another grandchild [Abigail Gregory] that lives in Atlanta by my youngest daughter [Rachelle James Gregory].  So, that was 1970 it started a lot (laughter). We were--
Story_ID: 370806
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] also graduates, is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a, when we went to Boston [Massachusetts] in 1968, I was already admitted to the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], so my wife actually took a job at New England Bell [New England Telephone and Telegraph Company], and she worked for a year and during that time, she also applied.  She was an honor student coming out of Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], and so she applied to, for graduate school at the Harvard School of Education [Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and was admitted and so she went to Harvard School of Education.  Her program was like a twelve month program to get her master's [degree].  She went straight through and while I was in Atlanta [Georgia] working for the bank [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia] that summer, she was still in Boston going to school, and so we graduated on the same day.  We received, both of us received our M.B.A. degrees on the same day at Harvard--our master's degree--she had a master's of education, and that would have been 1970, and it's a, as fate would have it, our oldest daughter [Anne James Gennaio] went to the Harvard School of Education and she received her master's from the Harvard School of Education thirty years from the day that my wife received hers, so we have a lot of Harvard degrees in our house.  I think there are five out of six people.  I have a Harvard master's, my wife has a Harvard master's, my son [Robert James, II] has a Harvard law degree [from Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], his wife has an undergraduate degree and a Harvard law degree, so there are a lot of Harvard degrees (laughter).
Story_ID: 370807
Speaker 1: You come back to Atlanta [Georgia], you're working for C&S [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia], your wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] graduates, so she moves to Atlanta, now, is that right?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, we, I was heavily involved there in Atlanta.  I was one of the first commercial lenders for a major white bank in the State of Georgia, and so I got to know some prominent people in Atlanta, you know, people like Maynard Jackson and just about, in fact, almost all of the people who became the leaders in Atlanta, from [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young and so forth.  All of those people, I probably met during those first years; [HistoryMaker] Herman Russell and Jesse Hill, and people, I met those in my capacity as a loan officer at the bank.  Many of them had relationships with the bank that I was working with, that's C&S Bank, because it was, that was the aggressive bank in the black community of all the big banks.  They had branches and they were moving aggressively to, they had come to the realization that there was a lot of money to be made in the black community in Atlanta (laughter) before some of the other institutions did, and so they put a branch out on Cascade [Road], and I actually went out there to work, and I worked with a guy named Ernest Dixon and Art Burkes [ph.] and so all of us were black managers at C&S Bank during the '70 [1970] to '71 [1971] year and so, so we would have been there when the election, Ivan Allen [Ivan Allen, Jr.], for example, had announced that he was not going to run for mayor again, and Sam Massell was running and I guess the guy by the name of Rodney Cook [Rodney Mims Cook, Sr.], I believe it was, and so I was at a meeting with the president of C&S National Bank.  I was working, in fact this was the summer of '69 [1969].  I was actually working on my graduate thesis on the C&S community development corporation, and so I was waiting on my appointment with Mr., well I was in my appointment with Mr. Mills B. Lane [Mills B. Lane, Jr.], who was the president of the bank, and we were, I was doing some research and I actually was taping my interview with him and on the, at the end of the interview he said, "Well Bob [HistoryMaker Robert James], we gotta stop this conversation.  I've got all of the leaders in Atlanta outside there and we're gonna decide who's gonna be the next mayor of Atlanta," because their mayor, who was Ivan Allen, had just told them that he was not going to run again, so they were having this meeting to decide who they were gonna support for mayor.  They decided that they were gonna support a guy by the name of Rodney Cook.  Rodney Cook was running against a young Jewish guy named Sam Massell.  Sam Massell teamed up with Maynard Jackson and that was when politics just kind of took a total change in Atlanta, because Sam Massell won, and he won because of Maynard's support and some other support and so, of course, the business community being like they were and being as smart as they were, immediately after Sam Massell won, Mr. Mills Lane called him in the office and gave him the money to pay off his campaign debt.  So, there was, they kind of kept the power going, which was a good thing for Atlanta during those years, but, so I was involved in a lot of that.  I was involved in the changing in the ownership of Citizens Trust Bank in Atlanta.  I was a loan officer and we were involved in that.  Herman Russell and some people were taking a larger ownership interest in the Citizen Trust Bank in Atlanta.  So, I was around during some years in '69 [1969] through '71 [1971], around Atlanta when a lot of things that had some profound impact on what happened later on around Atlanta was taking place.

Speaker 1: So, how do you become the president of Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia] in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1969 while I was working for C&S Bank [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia], I came, I was working on my graduate research report for the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].  This was the summer of '69 [1969], and I was gonna go back to finish my final year at Harvard Business School.  I was doing my research report on the C&S community development corporation, which had started here in Savannah [Georgia], and so in order to do that research, I had to travel to Savannah, and so I came to Savannah to talk to the people at the local office of C&S Bank.  During that time, I met a young lady named Betty Ellington [Betty W. Ellington], who was the wife of Coach Russell Ellington, who was a noted basketball coach around here, and also a Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] graduate and so is Betty.  She was an administrative assistant to the head of the community development corporation of C&S Bank.  Well, she told me, she asked me if I had met the people at the black bank in Savannah, and I had not, I don't think I even knew that there was a black-owned bank in Savannah, but she took me to meet the president of this bank, and during the course of that conversation I was so intrigued by the, what looked like an opportunity (laughter) and so I met him and then I, so I talked to him later after that meeting and told him if he would offer me a job when I finished my master's degree from Harvard, I'd take the job, you know, and I wouldn't argue about salary or anything, because those were simpler times when we had no bills (laughter) because the only bill I would have had would have been a student loan or something, so I actually told him I would take a job because I never heard from him.  But, I continued to research, to do research on the bank.  While I was in Boston [Massachusetts], I would pull the legal reports on the bank and look at it and so forth.  So, I kept in touch with people and then when I came back to work, after I finished my master's I came back to work in Atlanta [Georgia] at C&S Bank, I, C&S Bank was what was called the major correspondent bank of Carver State Bank in Savannah, which means that at C&S Bank, we had a file on Carver State Bank, which means I could go to central files and just pull the file and read what was going on and see the legal reports of the bank and so forth, and could understand the relationship between the two banks, and so I actually was aware of this bank and when I found out that their Mr. Perry [Lawrence D. Perry], who was the president, had announced his retirement and that this bank would be looking for a president, I started getting interested in the job.  So, I started, I contacted them immediately, I contacted the people at C&S and so, so I became interested in becoming the president and so they had an interview process.  I think Mr. J.B. Clemmons [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.] would have been the chairman of the committee and he, so I came down and had my interview, and I think there were two other people that they were considering who, neither of them had any real banking experience, but they were local leaders here in the community, and so I was able to get that job and so I came here as president of the bank.  One of the things I asked as a condition of my accepting the job was that immediate upon my acceptance of the job that they announce that I'm the president.  And, that's just my Harvard education, that somebody might change their mind (laughter) after, you know, they have a quiet conversation with me, the president might decide he's not gonna retire.  And so, in June or July of 1971, there was an announcement that I would be president of Carver State Bank, so I came to work at Carver in July.  I actually became president December 1, and so Mr. Perry, who was the president, stayed in the bank for a few months while I was there, and that gave me a chance to assess the staff and to make my decisions as to what I wanted to do when I took over, and so I took over on December 1.  One of the first things I did--
Story_ID: 370809
Speaker 1: Before we go into actually talking about your appointment to be the president of Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia], I know that the fraternities were a big part of what you do, even today, so let's talk about that.
Speaker 2: When I was in college [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], I, in 1965, I placed in Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, and so I had been very active, am a life member of a fraternity, have been very active in all aspects of the fraternity, and it kind of stems from my oldest brother [Jimmie James, Jr.].  He was in Omega at Jackson State University [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] in undergraduate school and he was always active in the fraternity, and so everywhere and, of course, my brother [Arthur James] after him was active, so we have always been active in these historically black fraternal organizations, and so even when, and I was in Atlanta [Georgia], you know, I affiliated with the Omegas there and even when I was in Boston [Massachusetts], and so my coming into, and I've held leadership positions in the fraternity.  I've been the, I was the Basileus of Alpha Sigma Chapter and I've actually held other leadership positions in the fraternity and so when I came to Savannah [Georgia], one of the things that I knew was the easy to do in terms of fitting in to the community was the leverage on the organizations that I was already a part of, and so obviously I had a good relationship with my fraternity brothers, who were members of the Mu Phi Chapter, here in Savannah, and I became a very active member and I have served as a leader of that and still active in it, and then I become a member of other organizations since coming to Savannah.  I'm a member of, I'm actually the Grammateus of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, which is the Boule, which is probably the most prestigious organization of African American men in the world.  It is the oldest Greek letter fraternity, but it's only for graduate level people.  It's not undergraduate people, and there are positions in the Boule that are legendary.  Some of them is that, for example, up until a few years ago, you always wore a tuxedo to meetings.
Story_ID: 370810
Speaker 1: It's actually all of the national African American, most of the national African American leaders that you know of are members of the organization, and so--
Speaker 2: Can you give us some names?
Speaker 1: It's, I mean, everybody from Arthur Ashe to, you know, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I mean it was a private thing that they never talked about, Benjamin E. Mays [Benjamin Mays], most all of the presidents of historically black colleges [HBCUs] are members, you know.  In Savannah [Georgia], John B. Clemmons [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.]  would have been a member of our organizing group here in Savannah, and it's just a legendary list of people, Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], who I see at the national meetings all the time, the mayor of (unclear) and the mayor of New Orleans [Louisiana] was a member and he was--and so it goes on and on and, but--but these are, this is, and so I have been very active in that organization and now I'm the Grammateus of our local group, which is kind of like the secretary, but that's the only real working office (laughter) so I keep the records and I arrange the meetings and so forth, but that's a major part of these socio-civic type organizations.  They are a major part of what makes the infrastructure of the African American community, especially in an old town like Savannah.  We have local organizations that are only affiliated with local, the only affiliation is the local organization; for example, I'm a member of The Frogs Club [The Frogs Club, Inc., Savannah, Georgia].  The Frogs Club is, we consider ourselves the most prestigious of African American male organizations in Savannah, and, of course, some of those people would also be members of other organizations like the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] and so forth and other fraternities, the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], and Alpha Kappa [sic. Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and Sigma and so forth.  But, those organizations, the social fabric of the community kind of follows, and the African American community follows those organizations.  I mean, you know, the best dances are gonna be those organizations meaning the best Christmas parties are things that those organizations are sponsoring.  So, we are very active in that.  You know, my wife [HistoryMaker Shirley James] is very active in The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], et cetera and so, I've been very active in Boule, the Omegas, The Frogs--
Speaker 2: What does the frog stand for?
Speaker 1: It's frog, just--(laughter), it's just a name that the organization's founders almost eighty years ago came up with and it's just, it has no significance other than the fact that they named it after an animal, a frog (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Frogs Incorporated.
Story_ID: 370811
Speaker 1: So now, you're appointed and the press releases are out that you would be the president of Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia].  Can you give us some history about the bank?
Speaker 2: Well, Carver is one of about thirty-five of the African American owned banks in the United States.  There are only thirty-five or thirty-six of 'em that are African American owned.  During the years in 1970, there might have been sixty-three or sixty-four, the, we are a small institution.  When I was elected president, the bank's total assets were a little over $4.5 million.  It had a, it was in one facility over on Montgomery Street, and it was a stable institution.  It was very conservative.  The leaders had been very conservative.  They'd made real estate loans and they'd invested in very secure things and government securities, et cetera.  So, the institution had a very solid little foundation.  It was very small but solid.  It was founded in 1927; February 23, 1927, by Louis B. Toomer.  Mr. Toomer was a legend around here.  He was unbelievable.  He was registrar of the treasury under the Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] administration.  He had an office in Washington [D.C.] at one time.  He would not fly on an airplane, so he took the train and he would come home, leaving Washington on maybe Thursday and ride back, and come back, check on the bank and he did that for about two years.  So, at that time, when Toomer was here, blacks in Savannah [Georgia] were Republicans and then that would have been the case in a lot of the historic towns in Georgia and the South, but Mr. Toomer was leader in the Republican Party and he was, he founded this bank and this bank was founded in 1927, and his widow is still a member of our board.  He remarried after, well his second wife is still a member of our board and she runs her own real estate company and very successful, but the bank, after it was chartered, has only been in, what, three locations.  We moved from the original location on Martin Luther King [Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard], to another location on Montgomery Street, and then we moved to a third location on Montgomery Street, and then when I came we built this building, and we've only had three presidents.  Mr. Toomer stayed here until his death.  I think he died in 1961 or '62 [1962], and then his contemporary, Mr. L.D. Perry [Lawrence D. Perry], took over and ran the bank for about ten years, from '61 [1961] to '71 [1971], when he retired and I became president, and I've been here thirty-five years.  I'm the oldest continuously serving African American bank president in the country.  Alden McDonald [HistoryMaker Alden J. McDonald, Jr.] at Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company] in New Orleans [Louisiana], was, that bank was found in 1972 and I had been president here since December 1st of '71 [1971], and so Alden and I are good friends and we always laugh about the fact that we are the two who have survived all of the Katrina-type [Hurricane Katrina] disasters in our lives (laughter) and have done well in our banks.
Story_ID: 370812
Speaker 1: We are an African American-owned bank.  We have about 350 stockholders, almost all of whom live here in Savannah [Georgia].  We are a reasonably strong institution.  We have this facility, which is a very nice facility for a $30 million bank.  We are building our, a second location on the corner of Eisenhower [Drive] and Skidaway Drive [sic. Skidaway Road] in Savannah, which will be near the Sandfly [Georgia] community, which is well known for being the place where Clarence Thomas grew up, but we'll be moving out in that market.  This is a thriving little bank that serves the local community and we have a pretty good reputation here in Savannah.
Speaker 2: Under L. D. Perry's [Lawrence D. Perry] term as president, he actually helped the bank [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia] to move its assets up from, do you remember the amount of money (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well one of, the most important thing that happened under Mr. Perry's leadership was that in nineteen-, when Mr. Toomer [Louis B. Toomer] founded the bank, it was basically a savings bank, which means that it did not offer checking accounts and, so when Perry took over, Perry, one of the things that he had done, and I think this had already started taking place under Mr. Toomer's administration really, but Mr. Perry completed it so we became full service commercial bank, which means that we started offering demand deposits in checking accounts, and that was significant for the growth of the bank, so that even though we could, the bank could continue to specialize in real estate secured loans and mortgages and that kind of thing, we became a full service commercial bank and so that was important for our growth, and so we, so now we have full service.  We offered basically everything that every other bank would offered.
Speaker 2: He took the bank from $1 million to the $4.6 million--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And you took it from $4.6 million to--
Speaker 1: We're about $30, $32 or $33 million, and we, in the next two or three years, we expect the bank to double in size because we're building a facility that will be similar to this in a totally different community, so we will be moving out into the Sandfly community probably August, when the building is completed and so we expect this bank to double in size, so we expect in the next two hours to be over $65 to $70 million in size, which will put us in a position to expand into other communities and to grow throughout the state, possibly.  But the bank is, we have all of our leaders are young people, they're highly motivated.  We seldom have turnover.  People get a job here, they want to stay.  We pay them well and they seem to be highly motivated.  We have, we specialize in staff development.  We send our people to schools all the time, so our people are always in some kind of training program and so forth, so the young people who get a job here, they can be assured that they will, as long as they stay here, that they will know what's going on in the banking industry because we send them to the schools in Atlanta [Georgia] or around here, and all over.
Story_ID: 370813
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this.  Why do you think it's important to have a black bank in the community?
Speaker 2: Well, historically it was important because of segregation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Most of the African American owned businesses that succeeded, the life insurance companies, the beauty product companies, the things that black people needed and the funeral homes, for example, and the white community was just not interested in supplying them, and so during the early years when the Penny Savings Bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank] was founded in Richmond, Virginia and so forth, that's the oldest of the African American banks, which is now Consolidated Bank [Consolidated Bank and Trust, Richmond, Virginia] is the name it's called, well when those banks were founded, it was to serve the specific needs of the African American community, and it was actually to promote thrift, to talk about entrepreneurship in the community, savings and so forth, and so there was a tremendous need for African American institutions at that time to promote those thing within the community.  As things, as time developed, the need became greater because of the desire of African Americans to own their own businesses, to obtain funding for those businesses and so forth, and so if you look at the community that you think are the most progressive African American communities all across the country, you'll find financial institutions there that black people control.  If you look at Durham, North Carolina, you look at Chicago [Illinois], you look at Atlanta [Georgia], you look at Savannah [Georgia], wherever you look, and you'll see that there's a progressive business class of African American people, you're gonna also find that there are some financial institutions.  There will be life insurance companies, there will be banks that they control, and so we create millionaires, and we create wealth.  We bring, we pool people's money and we lend it to people who are entrepreneurs, who go out and buy real estate and so forth.  Most of the people who have been very closely tied into this bank have been successful people.  So, you'll see that they, that's the need that we create leaders for our community; you know, people who are associated with this bank [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia], or Mr. Perry [Lawrence D. Perry], who was my predecessor, was the first black person to serve on a school board here.  You know, I've served on all kinds of things from the Chamber of Commerce [Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce] to the Savannah Economic Development Authority [Savannah, Georgia] and so forth, and so we actually create a leadership class among African American people and so now, our role has changed somewhat, and, but it all has, it stems from the need to have things that we control.  Our board makes, well really to a greater extent, our staff of lending officers down there, all of whom are African Americans, they make loans.  People, we financed the barbershop the other day.  That young man would never have gotten a loan from one of the other banks.  He didn't look like they want you to look.  He had dreadlocks in his hair, for example.  He was young and he, but he was a good barber.  His references were unbelievable, and so who was gonna trust him to, to own a building and not, if they, because our loan officers are like him.  I mean, they can identify with him.  They can go to his barbershop and they can check his references.  They can go get their hair cut there, and so there's the, the need has grown rather than diminished.  Unfortunately, the number of African American owned institutions, though, has decreased and a lot of that decrease has to do with the same challenges that historically black colleges [HBCUs] are facing, are the same challenges that black banks are facing, black life insurance companies.  Upwardly mobile African Americans have choices and if they are living in a suburban community, there must be five financial institutions that are anxious to get their business, whereas in 1971 when I came here, there were not five anxious to get a young black lawyer coming in to Savannah.  We were the only option.  Well, now the options are tremendous and, not only that, if you're moving from another town you already have a banking relationship at a bank that has offices in the town that you're moving.  So the industry has changed, so a lot of things kind of work against the growth of a small kind of African American-oriented business.  But still, there's a tremendous need for them, because there are still people who want, you know, personalized service and they want to talk to people who understand their particular community and their needs.
Story_ID: 370814
Speaker 1: Well, in the '70s [1970s], because there was this problem of discrimination and the banks needed some help, the federal government stepped in with the Minority banking deposit program [Minority Bank Deposit Program], and the CRA [Community Reinvestment Act of 1977]--did that, did those programs actually help or do you think it made an unfair competition between the non-white banks and the black banks?
Speaker 2: Well, they're a cutting edge sword, they cut on the black community and the black financial institutions for both sides.  It's double-edged.  I mean, for example, the Community Reinvestment Act was created to stimulate economic development in underdeveloped communities.  It was to force financial institutions that had been redlining or avoiding financing businesses and residences, in particular neighborhoods to start doing that kind of lending, to make them get involved in community activities inside those communities.  Well, what actually, the unintended result was that they creamed the market, which means that people who did not need them to do anything special, those are the African Americans that they really went after.  They went after how wealthy our church is, and our doctors, our lawyers, people who really had resources and could go anywhere.  They, in order to fulfill their CRA requirements, they financed those kinds of projects.  Some of the large national institutions, for example, they won't finance projects in small areas.  They want high visible, visibility areas where, you know, whereas they might not do a project in Sylvester, Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, they might do one in Atlanta [Georgia], (laughter) because there's media there and they want deals in New York City [New York, New York] and so forth, so you have people who, they kind of took the best of the black community and said, "We'll do those projects and that'll be our CRA component."  Well, that left a lot of people who still need services, and now there's an effort to respond to that on the part of the government as well as the institution, so, for example, Carver [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia] is a community development financial institution.  Community development financial institutions are institutions that are certified by the United States Treasury that we do community development work, that we provide services in underserved areas, we serve underserved markets, we, and so there is an award program that you compete with for funding, that to help support that community development effort, so that's an effort to keep some financial resources going into these under-privileged areas, where the major institutions might not want to serve.  So, all of the community development act, the CRA act had a devastating impact on some institutions because larger institutions came into the communities and took the best customers.  Well, but on the other side it has created a need now that people recognize and so are, we have been able to do a great deal through participating in the Community Development Financial Institution program [Community Development Financial Institutions Fund].
Story_ID: 370815
Speaker 1: I served two terms as president of the National Bankers Association.  I served one term in the '70s [1970s], during the period when Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president, and then I served another time from 1990 to '91 [1991].  Well, one of the things that the National Bankers Association did, and that organization is the trade organization that represents all the minority owned banks in the country and we serve as an advocacy organization.  Well, that organization is the one that lobbied for the federal Minority Bank Deposit Program.  It's the program that, it's a part of the advocacy group for the community development of financial institutions program, and so what we have done is that we have, we have created a support group for ourselves for our institutions, and so it's a very effective organization.  It has an office in Washington, D.C., and a lot of people who you have known have been leaders in the National Bankers Association.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You also are involved in, what was it, the conference--I'm trying to--
Speaker 1: State Bank Supervisors [Conference of State Bank Supervisors]?
Speaker 2: A conference on small businesses where you were talking about Jimmy Carter in 1980, the Regulatory Flexibility Act [Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980].  Weren't you part of that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I was involved in, during the Carter administration in particular, I was involved in almost everything that took place on a national level that dealt with economic development, small business, and minority owned banks.  I had been a very close friend of Jimmy Carter during his years as governor of the State of Georgia, and so when he became president, I was able to call the Democratic Party office and arrange an appointment for the National Bankers Association to go to the White House [Washington, D.C.] to meet with the president.  One of the things that we were able to talk about to the president and the commerce department [U.S. Department of Commerce] people was, and the treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury] people was to, the need for there to be a specific federal minority bank deposit program.  Now, there had been a program under the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration, but it, but there was lukewarm enthusiasm on the part of agency heads in the federal government for the program, and so, so under the Carter administration, through the National Bankers Association, we were able to really give that program a new breath of life, and so the president, immediately after our meeting, issued an executive order directing the agency through the federal government to utilize the services of minority-owned banks whenever it was practical, and so, so we, now you will have deposits in almost every one of the minority banks from the [U.S.] Department of Energy, and a lot of the cleanup funds for the oil damage that was done.  A lot of that money was in minority banks, and so we have, and we were also able to do something that I thought was very unique and very creative.  We created a corporate advisory board, where we got the treasurers of the some of the Fortune 500 companies to become members of the National Bankers Association and to serve as advisors to our executive board, and they actually created programs that led to some major minority bank deposit program by large national corporations and so, throughout the United States in almost every minority-owned bank in the country, you're gonna find some line of credit that a major corporation is borrowing money, you're gonna find some certificate for deposits that companies like the General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] or the larger corporate entities in the country will have some kind of relationship with the minority banks.  We have, in this institution, we probably have maybe fifteen national corporations that have some relationship with us, either a line of credit, either we are participating in a line of credit to that national corporation, or that national corporation has some kind of deposit relationship with us.  And so, all of that has really been good for our communities because those funds come into our communities.  We lend them to people for their residences and so forth.  And so, it stimulates economic growth within the minority communities on a local level.
Story_ID: 370816
Speaker 1: You and your brother co-wrote a book.  You wanna tell me about that?
Speaker 2: It's three of us co-authored the book.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Arthur James was really the moving force and the driving force behind it.  Arthur is, at the time when he wrote the book, was the executive director of the Yazoo City, Mississippi Community Action Agency [Yazoo City Community Action Agency, Yazoo City, Mississippi], but prior to taking that position, he had worked for the Mississippi Research and Development Center, where he had travelled throughout the State of Mississippi, and so he had gone into towns like Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and some other places where there had been financial institutions.  There had been commercial banks that had been owned by African Americans before the Depression [Great Depression], and there had been thriving banks and it had a major impact on some of the communities and most of them, in fact all of them, had failed during the time of the Depression or right thereafter, but there was no single document that either listed those institutions or told anything about the history and what they meant to the communities and so forth, or how they were founded.  So he, Arthur came up with the idea that he would write a book and do the research himself personally, and write a book on the Mississippi black bankers, and so he, he asked Jimmie [Jimmie James, Jr.], who is my oldest brother, who is the chairman of the music department at Jackson State [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi], and a professor at Jackson State University, to be one of the coauthors, and he asked me to be a coauthor because of my banking background, and so a few years ago, we published 'The Mississippi Bankers and Institutions' ['The Mississippi Black Bankers and Their Institutions,' Arthur James, Jimmie James, Jr., and Robert E. James] and it was an overwhelming success in the State of Mississippi.  We had a three-city book signing tour.  We went to Jackson, Mississippi, and we had a book-signing fair at Jackson State University that was fully covered by the local media and well attended and we went to our hometown of Hattiesburg [Mississippi] and actually the major new public library facility conference room there was overflowing with people and we sold a lot of books and we went to Yazoo City, where we had all of the community leaders, all the bank presidents and things that are in that part of the state, were there and so it was a very, a very successful venture.
Story_ID: 370817
Speaker 1: But it was also very important because the history of black-owned financial institutions in the State of Mississippi was just lost.  A young person, for example, growing up in, a young African American growing up in any town in Mississippi would never have known that we had thirty or so black-owned banks all over the State of Mississippi (laughter) at one time, and they were very successful institutions and the history of 'em, what he tried, what we tried to do in the book was not just list the dates they were founded and the dollar amounts that they grew to be and that kind of thing, and assets and so forth.  We tried to tell something about the people, and you will find some stories about some really wonderful people; I mean, most of them had some affiliation with some Masonic lodge or something, but they were leaders who decided that African Americans, even during, in Mississippi during the time of segregation and discrimination of all kinds, would need to own their own banks and needed to pool their resources and save, the same motivation that would have led our founders to found this bank [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia] in 1927.  Well, they, so we were able to put that in one document and that book is still the only listing of all of the African American-owned financial institutions that existed in the state of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: What is the title again?
Speaker 1: It's 'The Mississippi Black Bankers and Their Institutions' [Arthur James, Jimmie James, Jr., and Robert E. James]; I believe I'm calling it right.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But we were, we probably should be republishing about now, because the book, when Arthur [Arthur James] first came up with the idea, most of us kind of thought he would never finish all that research.  He did all of the research, and but he did.  He travelled throughout the state.  He went to places like some cities in Mound Bayou [Mississippi] were all black towns.  They had all black leaders and have always been that way.  Mound Bayou is the one that's known the most, but he travelled there.  He found the cornerstones of the buildings, for example.  In our hometown, we had a bank in Hattiesburg [Mississippi] that people had been going by the building for years.  It was on Mobile Street, and I remember as a youngster seeing that cornerstone over there, but nobody ever paid any attention.  It had been closed for years but that black building was still over there and the cornerstone was still there.  It was being used for something else, the building was, but he was able to go and retrieve that cornerstone off that building and actually, I think he gave it, eventually to the high school and they put it out on the lawn of the high school, where the name of the bank, the date it was found is there, so it led to a lot of side projects like that.  Of course, other historians are people who really do this kind of research and are totally involved in it and have actually used that book as a resource.  We were very pleased that several of the libraries throughout the State of Mississippi purchased copies, so that they would be a reference document in the libraries, and some of the schools actually ordered copies, so we have, we think that's a major contribution to the history of African Americans in the State of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Well, we hope that you, you'll get a chance to re-publish--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that information.
Story_ID: 370818
Speaker 1: We didn't talk much about your family.
Speaker 2: Well, they have been, have dominated our lives, our children have, and we have three children.  I mentioned my son [Robert James, II], who was born in 1970, I believe, and he was born in Atlanta [Georgia], right before we made the move to Savannah [Georgia].  He grew up in Savannah, went to school here, finished high school at a private school called Savannah Country Day [Savannah Country Day School, Savannah, Georgia], went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], which is very interesting.  He actually had opportunity to go to schools like Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] and some other schools, but he made a conscious decision to go to one of the historically black colleges [HBCUs], and so I can remember during his senior year putting him in my car and we drove around the country and looked at historically black colleges.  We went to Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] and up to Washington [D.C.], to Howard, we went through the schools in Atlanta and he picked Howard University, was awarded an academic scholarship to Howard and graduated Howard and was admitted to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and went to Harvard Law School and finished his law degree and then moved back to Atlanta after going to South Africa to do some missionary work for the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  He helped rebuild, do some legal work for Wilberforce Institute [Wilberforce Community College, Evaton, South Africa], which is an A.M.E. church owned institution in South Africa, which I got a chance to visit this past November, October and November, and so--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what did you say the name of that was?
Speaker 2: Wilberforce Institute.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: W-I-L-B-E-R-F-O-R-C-E Institute.  It's just, it's the same name as Wilberforce College [sic. Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in Ohio.  It's an A.M.E. school, but we have, the A.M.E. church has Wilberforce Institute in South Africa and my son participated in the early development of that institution, right after he came out of law school.  But he's been in Atlanta.  He's married to Angela Payne, P-A-Y-N-E, James [Angela Payne James], and so she is, she finished Harvard Law School.  She went to Harvard undergraduate school [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They met during law school and now we have one granddaughter by them, Lauren Connally James [Lauren James], and her family, the Connally name is a well-known name throughout the State of Georgia.  Some of her relatives were active in Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia]; in fact, I knew Norris Connally [Norris L. Connally], who was the vice president of Atlanta Life well before I knew her.  But, so we have one granddaughter by them.

Speaker 1: So then my second oldest daughter, oldest child Anne Camille James [Anne James Gennaio] is named after my mother and my wife's [HistoryMaker Shirley James] mother.  Her name was Camille [Camille Moses Barber], my mother's name was Anne [Annie Gee James], so Anne Camille James finished, she left and went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] too.  She finished a public school here.  She went to the private school, Savannah Country Day [Savannah Country Day School, Savannah, Georgia], for several years and decided she came home one day and so she wanted to go to a public school.  We didn't know she knew what a public school was (laughter).  But she went to and she finished the public school system here and graduated from Jenkins High School [Herschel V. Jenkins High School, Savannah, Georgia] and went to Howard University on an academic scholarship and then decided that she would change her major to mathematics and to early childhood education and decided she needed to transfer schools and so she ended up at Georgia State University [Atlanta, Georgia], finished Georgia State, taught a couple, three years in Stone Mountain, Georgia, and then decided she would go to graduate school and she was admitted to Harvard School of Education [Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so she finished with a Master's of Education from Harvard in nineteen--well, it was thirty years in 2000, and thirty years after my wife finished.  She has the same degree that my wife has, from the same school.  And, so she, she has been the headmaster of a preschool in Boston [Massachusetts] called Children First after teaching, and she's also now lives in Tokyo, Japan.  She runs her own business.  She went to, she was recruited to Japan to be the headmaster of the Poppins International Pre-School [Poppins Active Learning International School, Tokyo, Japan] there that was under, created by Poppins Corporation in Japan, and she has done that and now she runs her own business.  She does Practical English Solutions [ph.], is the name of her business and she teaches Japanese business people English.  And now, she's creating another business venture that will be an international business where she will be travelling between, she says she's going to have her U.S. base in Atlanta [Georgia], so she'll be travelling between Atlanta and Tokyo, and so that business should be off the ground in the next few months.

Speaker 1: And then my youngest daughter, Rachelle Elizabeth James Gregory [Rachelle James Gregory], she's married to a young man from Savannah [Georgia].  She finished Savannah Country Day [Savannah Country Day School, Savannah, Georgia], and she went to Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], and she went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] to do, well she started going to do a Ph.D. in sociology.  She was presidential scholar at Spelman and she was one of the top two or three graduates in her class, but she had a fellowship to go to UCLA to do a doctorate in sociology, but decided that she didn't want a degree in sociology, so she called the University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California] at USC, and they immediately admitted her to the business program, so she completed a master's degree in marketing communications at USC and she works for Turner [Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.] in Atlanta [Georgia], Turner Broadcasting, and her husband, Frederick Gregory, who finished Savannah High School [Savannah, Georgia] and went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], he finished his Ph.D. at UCLA in neurobiology, so they have moved to Atlanta.  He is doing a post doctorate at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia], and they've just had a baby on December 28, 2006, so we have two granddaughters, Lauren Connally James [Lauren James] and Abigail Rose Gregory [Abigail Gregory], living around the Atlanta area (laughter).  So we've got a nicely growing little young family (laughter) that's expanding rapidly now and we're hopeful that Anne Camille [Anne James Gennaio] will move back to the United States and we could get some more grandchildren from that side (laughter).
Story_ID: 370821
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have some, a couple of honorary degrees also.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].  I know, Morris Brown, as we speak, is having difficulty but it's, we're very hopeful that the school will regain its prominence, but I serve on the board of directors, board of trustees of Morris Brown for several years, and primarily the cause of my active involvement in A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  I was actually, an A.M.E. church, was asked to come on the board as an A.M.E. church representative years ago, and so Morris Brown awarded me an honorary doctorate degree and so then B.F. Lee Theological Seminary at Edward Waters College [Jacksonville, Florida] also awarded me an honorary doctorate degree, and I also have a Savannah State University [Savannah, Georgia], that does not award honorary doctorate degrees, but their presidential award was probably their most prestigious one and when Dr. William Gardner [William E. Gardner, Jr.] was the president of Savannah State, I was actually presented with the presidential award at Savannah State University, so I have three, I'm very proud of the three honors that I've received from these educational institutions and, you know, they are, those are things that someone was looking at some of the activities I was involved in and said that they wanted to make sure that the name of the institution was associated with my name and I think that's a tremendous honor.
Story_ID: 370822
Speaker 1: Tell me, what are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My greatest concern for the African American community is that we have a community that we're losing a whole generation of young men.  If I had to pick the one problem that threatens us as a people, it's the fact that if you go to the jailhouse, every cell is going to be filled with, Chatham County [Georgia] jail, Atlanta [Georgia] jail, wherever you go, it's going to be filled with more young men that look like us; African American, the entire African American community has got to figure out how to respond to this problem.  Everywhere I go, I speak, make public speeches at fraternity events and church events and other community activities, and that's the only thing I think is, we need to be talking about right, that's the thing we need to be talking about most, whether we talk about responding to it by building our own businesses and employing our boys; if you notice at a Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia], there are young men that are working down who are in charge.  You know, of course there are young women who are their bosses (laughter) but there are some young men who, the guy who opened the door this morning, the young man who runs our computer system and so forth, so you have, we've got to respond to that.  In every way that you have resources, whether it's through your church, whether it's through your social organizations, fraternities and sororities, we've got to start trying to figure how to respond to that.  One of the things that I think is going to be necessary is we're going to find some way to reach, to help the people who can be first responders.  Most of the young people who have real difficult problems, I can't talk to them.  They don't understand what I'm talking about and I clearly don't understand what they're talking about.  They don't dress like I dress, they, I, and they don't listen to the same music.  So, it becomes a major problem of communication with the ones who are serious problems.  Now there are other people through organizations like 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.], through the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and so forth that I am working with in mentoring programs, but those programs usually target people who have some motivation already, but they don't target those kids who are out there on the street, already have gotten out of the system.  We've got to find out some, figure out some way to get to some of those so that we don't lose all of them.  Some of them are beyond saving, by the way, and we have to admit that.  Some of them have serious problems that you're gonna, they're gonna have to go through, their criminal system and all that, and so maybe there'll be some rehabilitation there.  Now, in Savannah [Georgia], there are some groups that we support, the bank supports, and I support personally that are trying to deal with people who are coming out of prison.  We have got a lot of young African American men who are coming out of prison who can't find jobs, who have no trades and so forth and so we're trying to work with them, but we've got a first responder program, for example, I see it similar to a peer counseling program, where you find people who are on the streets.  You actually put them through some training classes on how to talk to the young men who are having trouble who are doing the drugs and so forth, and you actually, you have to support them.  Most of the older men will have to support them if you're gonna those youngsters, and I was looking at men who are in the 100 Men of Savannah [100 Black Men of Savannah, Inc.], which is really a marvelous group of diverse African American men with different backgrounds.  We have got, we've got everybody from rappers (laughter) to, you know, the bank presidents, and so I would think that the bank president needs to help the rapper to go into the community, and especially those that are willing to go head to head with the problem.  And so I think that's the big challenge we have.  We've got to try to refocus a whole group of young men, and we've got to get them into something productive, and if it comes to creating job programs and putting our resources into those programs and so forth, using all of our political clout to get public funding into the programs, I think that's what we have to do to save these young men.
Story_ID: 370823
Speaker 1: Since this is going to be part of history and it will touch the lives of future generations, what message would you send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: That there is success to be derived from seeking to do something that does not just help yourself.  One of the things that I have observed over my years of being president of a bank [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia], and being president of a bank gives you access to a lot of things.  I mean, when you have presidents' meetings of industrial development groups in Savannah [Georgia], bank presidents are invited and so I'm there and the people who I think get the most reward out of their lives and who actually have a lot of financial success also are people who really are motivated by a desire to do things for people who, other than themselves.  Once you make making money for yourself the primary motivating factor, I think there's an emptiness even in the struggle to make the money, whereas, if you are doing it because you want to see, you want to finance some houses for some people who nobody else will finance houses for, you want to see some people with second chance checking accounts open checking accounts, reopen checking accounts for people who other banks won't open checking accounts for because we found out that about 35 to 40 percent of them really were kicked out of the banking system for no reason at all.  There were divorce problems or they lost a job and they overdrew their account too much and people close their account and they can't open their account anywhere and so we do things that are motivated by the desire to help somebody else, and we've actually made a very successful business out of that, and so one of the things I'd like to leave is that for young entrepreneurs is that there's a way to be successful without being greedy, and you can, you have to look for that way of being successful, and the other thing is to, that the lessons that are taught in Sunday school and YPD [Young People's Division] and Baptist Training Union and whatever organization that you express your faith through, or that you learn your faith through, and the lessons that your parents would have taught that have to do with spirituality and religion and so forth, that those things, you have to take those into whatever environment you're in, which means that I can stay president of a bank from the age of twenty-five, and have been without going to jail, you know, because people won't talk to me about their crooked schemes, because they just don't think I'll be interested, and I try to set that tone.  One of the things you try to do is you try to get the young people who are around you to set that tone that you're not interested in any crooked scheme.  So, when people have crooked schemes, they don't bring them to me.  You know, I might hear about them in the street, but they're not gonna bring them into me because the tone is that I'm not interested in that.  So, you have, you have to take all of the lessons that you've learned and, of course, I've learned, I had some teachers, I mean, my mother [Annie Gee James] and my father [Jim James] and my brother and all the rest of my sisters still teaching me, that you have to take all of that into whatever environment you're in, especially the business community.
Story_ID: 370824
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good person.  I don't want to be remembered as a successful banker or a rich person or any of that thing.  I own a lot of low income housing and I've got people down there who I bought a brand new air conditioner and heating unit for a lady who's not paying her rent.  But, you actually, I just want to be remembered as a good person.  You know, I think that would be enough.  They could say he was a good, put it on the tombstone, "He was a good person."  I'd like to live a long time.  I've been around some people who've lived long enough to see the fruits of their work.  I mean, I've seen, I've got a friend who's on the board of the bank [Carver State Bank, Savannah, Georgia], J.B. Clemmons [HistoryMaker John B. Clemmons, Sr.], for example, who outlived all of his debt.  I'm talking about, outlived it fifty years (laughter) so he probably hasn't had any serious debt for forty or fifty years. Now, that's what I call--and he's is in good health.  That's a blessing that's far beyond anything he could expect to have, but I don't think I'll be able to outlive my debt, I've got so much, but I have a great deal of admiration to people who can outlive their debts.
Story_ID: 370825
Speaker 1: When you look over your life, is there anything that you would have changed, or do you have any regrets or not?
Speaker 2: I had to make a couple of very key decisions during my life; for example, I had to make a decision as to whether to leave Atlanta [Georgia] and come to Savannah [Georgia] or stay in Atlanta.  That was a tremendous decision, because I was in the forefront of the growth and development of Atlanta.  I was at the big bank that was involved in the African American community at a time when all of their community leaders in Atlanta were coming in to see me and the guys who were playing basketball with the Atlanta Hawks and things, I was the guy who could make them loans, and so I had to give up that to come to be in a small town in a very small financial institution.  The president of C&S Bank [The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Georgia], Mills Lane [Mills B. Lane, Jr.], told me that I could stay in Atlanta and work for C&S and make a lot of bad loans and it wouldn't mean a thing.  They would charge them off and keep going, but if I go down to Carver State Bank [Savannah, Georgia] and make a few, I'd sink the whole bank.  So one of the big decisions I made was to give up that track and I probably would have made a whole lot more money if I had stayed in Atlanta and to take the track to come here.  Another thing, decision that I made was to fight the draft and go to school rather than go to Vietnam and not that I was so much of an anti-war person.  I clearly was not.  But I made a decision to do what I could to stay in business school and not go to Vietnam.  So those were two of the major decisions but the most important one was to marry my wife (laughter) so, I decided to marry Shirley Barber [HistoryMaker Shirley James] from Georgetown, South Carolina, and that was the most important one of all of them in 1968.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: I can't think of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you so much for your time and we really appreciate it at The HistoryMakers because this is an interview for all times that will really make a difference, and we thank you for making a difference.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  You've done a great job.  You got me to talk and I remembered a lot of good stuff (laughter) that I couldn't remember. A lot of things that this does, though, if once I get my copy of that, I'm gonna go through all my boxes, I've got boxes up in the attic and I've got my grades from Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] and my grades from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], probably got high school [L.J. Rowan High School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] stuff, and I'm gonna put all that stuff there and try to put it in some kind of order and maybe I'll get somebody to help me put it together.

Speaker 2: In 1974, when we completed the construction of the Carver State Bank on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Savannah, we held on opening ceremony and the people in the community stood outside and waited until we cut the ribbon and they were excited about coming into the new building.  That scene shows the crowd coming into the bank facility.
