Story_ID: 301110
Speaker 1: Now, let's get into your history.  I'm going to begin by asking you your date of birth and your place of birth.
Speaker 2: February 12th, 1942, Camden, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the--we're, we're going to explore how far back you can go with your family.  First, on your mother's side and then your, your father's [Orange Johnson, Jr.] side.  Let's begin by asking you to give us your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Bertha Ellen Seagers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Bertha, B-E-R-T-H (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, B-E-R-T-H-A, Ellen, E-L-L-E-N, and Seagers, S-E-A-G-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: All right, and her, her date of birth, if you know it?
Speaker 2: August, no, October 14th, I'm going to say, I believe it was 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay, and her place of birth?
Speaker 2: Middle--no, Wilmington, Delaware.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm--how far back can you go on your mother's side, family tree?
Speaker 2: You know, basically I, I can only go back to about my mother's mother, grandmother I heard stories about that side of the family and, and further back, but to really recall, I don't know, but I can try.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead and try.
Speaker 2: My mother's family was born in Delaware and as far back as I can remember, back at the late 1800s, they were, they were, they were--some of them were slaves in Delaware.
Speaker 1: In Delaware?
Speaker 2: In Delaware.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's a revelation.
Speaker 2: But, freed pretty early I would believe probably by the, by the beginning of the 20th century they were all freed-free people, but I remember hearing that my great-great-grandmother was a slave on a plantation in Delaware and I don't know much about them, but I do--that was what I, I understood about her, but, probably by the beginning of the 20th century our families, they were, they were all freed people.  And, and that's as far back as I really--and I--they use to call her something like--they use to call her mommy.  I don't know who--I never met her I think her name was Jane [ph.] and they used to call her mommy.  And everybody use to refer to her as mommy.  And they'd talk about her, but I of course, never met her. And then I, I don't remember much except stories when I grew--I was born right around the time of World War I--I mean World War II [WWII], yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, (unclear), but, and so I remember just hearing stories about the, the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] with my family but I don't know a lot before that.
Speaker 1: Okay, then we will record mommy or perhaps the name Jane (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jane, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and go back to your grandmother--
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: --which would be your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: --my mother's mother and, of course, she must have been born probably either at the end of, of the century or the beginning of the century because my mother was born in 1919 so she may have been born--she was--I can probably figure this out very quickly.  She died in about 1965 and she was about sixty-five, and she was probably born right at the turn, maybe--
Speaker 1: Let's put it down as 1900s.
Speaker 2: --nineteen hundred [1900] I think yeah, probably right around there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Letitia--
Speaker 1: Spell that for us.
Speaker 2: L-E-T-I-T-I-A, Seagers--
Speaker 1: L-E--
Speaker 2: --L-E-T-I-T-I-A.
Speaker 1: --T-I-A.
Speaker 2: Seagers, S-E-A-G-E-R-S.
Story_ID: 301111
Speaker 1: Do you know her [Johnson's maternal grandmother, Letitia Seagers] husband's name, or your [maternal] grandfather's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She married a man named Author, Author, Author, Author--that was her maiden name.  She married a man named Author Brinkley--
Speaker 1: Brinkley.
Speaker 2: --yeah, B-R-I-N-K-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your grandmother's date of birth, we, we're going to put it at about 1900--place of birth?
Speaker 2: She--place of birth was I think Middletown, Delaware--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she was born on Christmas day--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --December 25th.  I always remember because we use to joke that she got cheated because we'd give her a gift and say, "Merry Christmas, happy birthday" (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And happy birthday.
Speaker 2: --so I do remember December 25th, it was probably 1900, maybe --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe even 1899, but we can say 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how much do you remember about your grandfather, Author Brinkley?
Speaker 2: Not a lot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he--I remember he came from a family of, of about ten brothers and sisters--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and where it's interesting enough, my grandmother on my mother's [Bertha Seagers Johnson] side was an only child--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --but we always use to joke because Author, Author had another nine brothers and sisters--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he was like the second oldest in, in the clan, so they went, they went all the way, you know, to, to, they spanned a lot of, a lot of time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he was for many years, he was--both of them actually, my grandmother and my grandfather were domestics--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather worked for a very wealthy family in which he was sort of you know, whatever you called those people; he was a chauffeur, he was the gardener, he was everything, but he spent a lot of time working with them and they, they lived--he didn't live with us all the time because that was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so he would be in Philadelphia during the week working for this family and often get home with us on the weekend--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was in Middletown, Delaware--
Speaker 1: And, right --
Speaker 2: --yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and my grandmother worked for a family--the Gallaghers [ph.], I, I knew, worked for the Gallaghers for years as their, as their housekeeper--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I only know that because when I was small, my, my mother, who was an educator and was a school teacher, would go to school and my father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] was in the [U.S.] military at that time, as you know, he was in World War II [WWII], I would go with my grandmother to the Gallaghers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's where I'd spend my time when I was--from about two until about five, until I went to school.
Story_ID: 301112
Speaker 1: How about the children of your [maternal] grandmother [Letitia Seagers] and grandfather's [Author Brinkley] children--
Speaker 2: One--
Speaker 1: Just--
Speaker 2: --just Bertha [Bertha Seagers Johnson].
Speaker 1: --that's, that's right, one, one child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One child.
Speaker 1: --and, so that one child--tradition--
Speaker 2: Tradition continues with them, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I was an only child, so you could--
Speaker 1: And then you, right, right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, the, the--let's go now to--any, any other outstanding stories that you can remember about your grandmother's grandparents--your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: Mother's parents. Well, they were, they were extraordinary people because I think neither one of them had more than eighth grade education, you know, and, but they gave both my mother--and we lived in an extended family situation. I was born in '42 [1942], so we lived in a household at the time where most of the men--the younger men were overseas--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and my grandfather who was the head of the household was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] during the week.  So I grew up in a household with my mother, her mother and two aunts, who were her cousins, who lived with us--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so, but there was this strong, and you got to say matriarchal society that gave all of us who came around these, these remarkable women, the, the desire that we had to go on and achieve.  And that was my mother, my mother I'll tell you quickly about--my mother grew up in this household and she lived in this--she was born in Wilmington [Delaware], but lived in this town of Middletown [Delaware], which was a small town of about 2500 people.  And there was a white side of town and there was a black side of town--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and by the time you got to the tenth grade, you didn't go to school anymore because there was no higher education for blacks in the town--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --but I had--
Speaker 1: --in the town of Wilmington?
Speaker 2: No, in the town of Middletown.
Speaker 1: Oh, Middletown, okay--
Speaker 2: Middletown, yeah--
Speaker 1: --great.
Speaker 2: --because Wilmington was the big city for us--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so if--you either had to go to Wilmington to go to high school, which is their school in Wilmington called Howard--Howard High School [Howard High School of Technology, Wilmington, Delaware], or Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] had a tenth through I think, eleventh and twelfth grade on the campus. So, Delaware State was about twenty-five miles away from Middletown, Middletown was, is middle, it was in the center between Dover [Delaware], which is the capital and Wilmington, which is the largest city--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so you, you had either, you had to go to either place, so my mother and father [Orange Johnson, Jr.]--because we had relatives in Wilmington--my, my grandmother and grandfather insisted that my mother go to Wilmington and live with our relatives and go to high school there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and my father, who was born in New Jersey and I'll get to their family, ended up going to high school when he finished, at Dover--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to the college at Delaware State.  But they felt we should achieve and so my, my mother was pushed on to get her education and even though both her parents had an eighth or ninth grade education--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they made sure that their daughter not only went on the high school and finished, but then on to college.
Speaker 1: Right, so was that effort to do the--be the very best that they could be?
Speaker 2: The very best, and they gave that, that excellence to, to my mother and to, to most of the--our family that was around them, because I had two aunts who--one, husband had died and one was unmarried, and they had one or two children.  So we were kind of all extended family, but all of us got the excellence.  It was just--in black families I think, there's a lot of that, where they just, they may not have the education, but they knew the importance--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and they made sure that their--their descendants knew the value of education.
Story_ID: 301113
Speaker 1: Now, because of what you had said, I'm imagining that there were separate schools for black kids there in Middletown [Delaware], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah.  There was--when my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] was going, there was only one school, one through nine, for, for blacks--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but the, the white high school was one through twelve--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they, we lived in different parts of town, and interestingly enough, there was, there was a west side of town and an east side of town. We lived--this is interesting how (unclear) goes, we lived on the east side of town, but on the border--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so we lived on Lake Street in Middletown and Lake Street was, there was East Lake and West Lake.  We lived right at the corner of East Lake and at West Lake, on the other corner, began the white section--
Speaker 1: Wow (laughter).
Speaker 2: --so when I was growing up, I would, my, my, my, a lot of my playmates were the kids right there in the neighborhood, were the white kids--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --but we were still on the east side of town.  But I grew up in a very segregated community, as did my mother.
Speaker 1: Now, and I, I want to visit that with you later, a couple of questions I'm going to have, but right now, I want to stick with your mom--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --growing up for her, what were--has she related what it was like growing up in this northern town, north of the Mason Dixon Line, but still in segregation?  What, what it was like--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in the community and, and/or the school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did relate it to me, but it--there wasn't a lot of talk about how difficult it was. The--it seemed to me that as, as they grew up they, they lived their lives in the community.  There wasn't animosity.  There wasn't a lot of--it wasn't a southern town where there were lynch mobs and where there was a lot of antagonistic racism, it just existed that you live separate lives--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so there was a movie house [Everett Theatre, Middletown, Delaware] in the town, but you know, you could go to the movie house, but you were in the balcony and the whites were in the whatever.  And you, you didn't go to churches together, but there wasn't, it, there wasn't any real kind of feeling that, you know, it was a racist society, you just lived separate lives--and, but it was the, the, the--you co-existed. So I never got any feeling that there was, there was a lot of feeling that, you know, this was a very horrible existence, not at all. But I, but my experience in talking to them is that you, you lived a self-contained life and that was your life--and you went uptown, which was on the west side, where you did your shopping because all the commercial stuff was on the west side of town and you were able to go, you were able to shop in their stores--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you were able to do all the things that you do, but you, and you even had white doctors--in our town.  My mother went, went to, went to white doctors.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any black doctors?
Speaker 2: The closest black doctor was in Wilmington [Delaware].
Speaker 1: In Wilmington, okay, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I know there were--I use to hear stories about black people who would go all the way to Wilmington--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to find--go, go to the black doctors.  But our family had Doctor Lee [ph.], I remember, for years my mother and my mother's mother [Letitia Seagers] went to Doctor Lee, and his father was a doctor and that was our doctor.  And we only knew white doctors when we were growing up.
Story_ID: 301114
Speaker 1: Now during that educational upbringing for your mom [Bertha Seagers Johnson], we're talking about the '20s [1920s]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and, so things--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even though, again I keep harping back to this northern town--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it sounds more like a Mississippi or, or (unclear)--except there was not the suggested violence--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did not suggest that, but it was probably in, in terms of the way you lived your life, it was probably very similar--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, and this was a northern town that was fifty miles from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (laughter).  But, yeah--
Speaker 1: The, okay, now--we're--we're in the '20s [1920s], your mother is a, is a striver--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --getting a decent education.  She was a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very, very good--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I think when she went to, when she went to Howard High School [Howard High School of Technology] in Wilmington [Delaware], after she had to go there for tenth or eleventh to twelfth grade, I think, or eleventh to twelfth grade, she ended up being the valedictorian of her class--
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: --so she was really a striver--
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The, the, I wanted to also ask about the teachers there in the black school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were they black teachers or were they white teachers?
Speaker 2: They were all black.
Speaker 1: All black?
Speaker 2: All black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When she went to school and later when I went to school, my mother and father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] went to school, all our instructors and all of our teachers, principal, everybody was black.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: We had no white instructors, yeah.
Speaker 1: --they had to work hard (laughter) to achieve--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to achieve that.
Speaker 2: Okay, there came a time when your mother was--well, let's, let's see, when, when and where and how did your mother meet your father?
Speaker 1: Interesting, my father was born in New Jersey.  And like in typical families, like black families, his father was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and was in the A.M.E. circuit.  And when my father was probably about fifteen, his father got assigned to the A.M.E. in Middletown [Delaware]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and that's how they actually met as, as, as teenagers, because he came to Middletown with his three sisters--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and his father [Orange Johnson, Sr.] and mother [Virginia Smith Johnson], and the father was a pastor, and literally they met in like probably, I'd say ninth or tenth grade when he came to town.
Speaker 2: Okay, because, okay with his father--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Let's now explore that--
Speaker 1: And my grandmother [Letitia Seagers] at that time, my mother's mother, was on the deaconess board--so she was involved in the church, and so being involved in the church and the minister knew minister--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, the kids got together.
Story_ID: 301115
Speaker 1: Your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Okay, his, my father has a very odd name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Orange (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like the fruit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like the fruit--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --and his middle name--the family name, what was it, a family name, Maull, M-A-U-L-L, and then Johnson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Orange Maull Johnson.
Speaker 1: We're going to explore that middle name (laughter), a little bit.
Speaker 2: It was a family name.
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I'm (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Thank God I didn't get it.  He was a junior, Orange Maull Johnson, Jr., yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, and so he was the son of Reverend--
Speaker 2: Reverend Orange Maull Johnson, Sr.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact my father--I'll just tell you this.  My father had the name Juice before O.J. (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And they use to call him Juice.
Speaker 2: Juice, Juice Johnson (laughter).
Speaker 1: The place of birth for your father was?
Speaker 2: Camden, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Camden, New Jersey, and the date of birth, if you know it?
Speaker 2: My father was born in 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: March 27th, 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  The--how far back can we go with your father's, on your father's side?
Speaker 2: You know, again, its, I don't know a lot about my family, but I, but, my father's family had relatives also in Delaware and they were in the South of Delaware and they were Indian [Native American], part, part Indian--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I don't know a lot about them, except when I would meet them.  They were--I could tell they were all, that side of the family was, they were all very Indian.  And I'll tell a quick story--and I went to a funeral when I was a kid with my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] and father and there were these people in the funeral who were very Indian looking and then there were a couple who looked very, like the other side--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I said to my mother and father, "Why are those white people at the funeral?"  And they said, "They're no white people, they're your cousins," (laughter).  So, I, I, I don't know a lot about my, my, my father's family.  My grandmother, I should kind of mention her just a minute.  I remember a lot, they, they were the Smiths, her name was Virginia Smith [Virginia Smith Johnson] and she was from Pennsylvania--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Virginia Smith and she was from a family of about five people, I remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I believe, two brothers and three sisters. There were six of them, but they were--she had five siblings.  And they were all in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, around the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area.  And my grandfather was somehow--ended up in New Jersey, where he was born, before my father--I think he was born, my, my grandfather, Orange, Sr. was born in South Orange, New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --but I don't know how he got there, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  We may now know a little about his first name (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I hadn't made that connection, but you're right, but that, but he was, South Orange, New Jersey.  So that may have been the connection, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Orange of South Orange.
Speaker 2: Orange of South Orange, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 301116
Speaker 1: How about the name Maull?  Do you have any information?
Speaker 2: Maull was the family that I, I wanted, that--not a lot, but that was--the Maull family was the family down in the south of Delaware, around Rehoboth [Delaware] and Lewes, Delaware. And there is, there was a whole colony of Indians [Native Americans] there and the Maulls were intermarried between them, themselves and the Indians--and that's where they, that's where the [paternal] family name came so, and I knew of--I met a lot of them.  I didn't know them well, but I met a lot of the Maulls.  Because when I was little I would go to the--go down through Rehoboth and Lewes, Delaware, we were down in that area, and that's where that's, that side of the family was.  I didn't know a lot about them--but, but I met a lot of the people who were the Maulls.
Speaker 1: But the heritage there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was, yeah--
Speaker 1: --Indian?
Speaker 2: Indian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And you don't know what tribe?
Speaker 2: You know I, I would like to, I want to do a little Alex Haley bit and go back and find out who they were and what they, yeah, but, that's a genealogy I need to find myself because, you know, we know so little sometimes about, about our backgrounds--and I never had a chance to go and search it.  But I've always been interested in what tribe they were and whatever.  I'm not going to even venture to say who they were--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, let's, and then, then we come down to the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your, your father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] moved to Middletown [Delaware]--
Speaker 2: Middletown, with his father [Orange Johnson, Sr.] and his sisters and mother.
Speaker 1: Right.  And your family on your mother's [Bertha Seagers Johnson] side was very instrumental in the, in the church [African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.)]?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: In the church, very much so.  And my, my father had, had his sisters, the three sisters, but he, he was the second oldest.  There was a sister who was oldest, then my father, and then there were two younger sisters.  And I was trying to remember something I wanted to tell you about the connection.  Oh, my grandmother on my father's side was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Virginia Smith [Virginia Smith Johnson] was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I believe she taught school for a while in Middletown when they first got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they, they also had a strong educational push there because he was a minister and she was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: So they were at the top of the black community--
Speaker 2: Black community, yeah, at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: But I believe she only had probably a, like a when they had--the normal education was like two years of college.  I don't think she had actually finished, but she was teaching elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they only had one elementary school for blacks--
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: --and one junior--
Speaker 2: They had one school in Middletown.
Speaker 1: Oh, one school.
Speaker 2: It went from one to nine, I think, or one to ten, I'm not too sure--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --yeah that was it.
Speaker 1: --and, and you had said that before?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and so the high school teacher, if you put it that way--the ninth grade teacher taught at the same school as the first grade--
Speaker 2: As the first grade teach.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, good enough.
Speaker 2: Years later that school--it's a long story and we'll get to that, but years later that school became the Louis L. Redding School [Louis L. Redding Middle School, Middletown, Delaware].  You know Louis L. Redding was the black lawyer from, from Delaware who was involved in the Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] case.
Speaker 1: Exactly, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they named that school--
Speaker 2: They named that school after him many years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I was going to ask you what the name of the school was before?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time when I went there it was simply called the, the Middletown High School [Middletown, Delaware].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all it was called, Middletown High School.  It didn't get the name until Louis L. Redding, in the late, in the '50s [1950s], right after Brown versus Board of Education passed, but I'll, I'll get to that. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 301117
Speaker 1: Now we have your, your mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] and your father [Orange Johnson, Jr.], they're at the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and they knew one another.  Was--did any of them recognize the spark between them during that period?
Speaker 2: I don't know much.  They married pretty young.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They ended up going to Delaware State College [Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She--he was already on campus having gone there for two years for the eleventh and twelfth grade while she was in school [Howard High School; Howard High School of Technology] in Wilmington [Delaware].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But then they ended up in the freshmen class together--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at--
Speaker 1: Delaware State (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Delaware State.  And so they were, they were in school together there.  And they, they got married pretty much, I think, within a couple of years of graduation--
Speaker 1: Okay, from, from--
Speaker 2: --from Delaware State, yeah.
Speaker 1: What--what did your father pursue?
Speaker 2: He was in agriculture at the time.  She was in education and he was in agriculture.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And any incidents or stories that either one of them told you about--
Speaker 2: No, not a lot.
Speaker 1: --those years there at Delaware State?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, I mean, they would joke about, I think they, they got together and a couple times she sort of decided she wanted to be with someone else a couple of times.  They had their thing, but eventually they were pretty, pretty, pretty close to each other much of the time.
Speaker 1: One other question I'd like to ask, and this, for your father or, or your mother, in those secondary school days and/or college days, are there any memorable classmates and names that we should know about or maybe that stands out?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think so.  I don't think it--that for, for them, you know Delaware was such a small state.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember when we used to beat them all the time.
Speaker 2: All the time, yeah, oh yeah. But it was such a small state and I don't know that many people who were out of their class--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --went on to achieve anything that would be that notable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the, one of the, one of their, one of the classmates was a man named Alfred G. Waters, who later became one of the heads of the Department of Education for the State of Delaware and he was one of their classmates, but for the most part I don't think so.
Story_ID: 301118
Speaker 1: There came a time when your mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] and father [Orange Johnson, Jr.]--they graduated at the same time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and what, what, what year was that they married if you know?  What did they?
Speaker 2: I think they graduated about 19--I'm going to say 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It might have been '39 [1939], but I think it was '40 [1940].  And they were married by '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had to be because I came along in 1942.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, but he went overseas almost immediately after.
Speaker 1: That's right because now World War II [WWII]--
Speaker 2: II--
Speaker 1: --had started.
Speaker 2: --had started and he went overseas.
Speaker 1: In the [U.S.] Army, or--
Speaker 2: --He was in the Army.  And he was in the [U.S.] Cavalry in North Africa.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And I do--an interesting story I'll, I'll relate to you later how he met the Tuskegee Airmen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when he was in North Africa and how that impacted my life early on.
Speaker 1: And, and did, and did--you said the Cavalry, but it wasn't the Buffalo Soldiers?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't the Buffalo Soldiers.  He was in--I, in fact, I have heard the name (unclear), but he had those high boots and that Mountie hat--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that whole--the breeches, yeah.  And, and they were, they were on horses.  I've got pictures of them.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know more and more we're finding out all these other things that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --blacks did in the, in the Army--
Speaker 2: In the Army--
Speaker 1: --that no one writes about or talks about, yeah.
Speaker 2: Talks about, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But he went over sometime in '41 [1941]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they had been married only about a year.
Speaker 1: Okay was he an enlisted man or an officer?
Speaker 2: No, he was drafted--
Speaker 1: Drafted --
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was drafted.
Speaker 1: So he wasn't (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --but he was enlisted.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He ended up a sergeant when he came out.  He wasn't--yeah, he was a sergeant.  I don't know, I don't remember his exact rank.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about what his principal duties were there?
Speaker 2: No, I don't because I was, I was born just after he had gone in and I didn't know much about him and he didn't talk much about it.  But I just had those pictures when he came home.  And he was in the entire four years.  He didn't come home until like '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was in like four years.  And, and, and was, and I'm sure in other places besides Africa, but Africa was I think, was the last, one of the last places he was in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The, the--
Speaker 2: Or maybe--
Speaker 1: --your mother--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) the first.
Speaker 1: Oh
Speaker 2: Because you--because he do, he did know about the--he ran into the airmen and they were only there, well they were, I take that back, they arrived there in '43 [1943], so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --could have worked out, yeah.
Story_ID: 301119
Speaker 1: Your mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] as an educator during this period, well did she teach school?
Speaker 2: She immediately became a schoolteacher.  She had a job right out of Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and became a schoolteacher in Wilmington [Delaware] first--
Speaker 1: Oh, in Wilmington.
Speaker 2: --in Wilmington.  And she was--Wilmington, and then later in a town where the University of Delaware is now, called Newark, Delaware.
Speaker 1: Right, Newark (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she taught--she started off teaching eighth grade and about 1945, '46 [1946] or so, she switched to a school in Middletown [Delaware].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then started teaching second grade.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay; to the school in Middletown (laughter).
Speaker 2: To the school in Middletown, the only school in Middletown (laughter).
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Okay, and you were born in 1942--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --during that period?
Speaker 2: During that period--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your dad [Orange Johnson, Jr.] now.  Who was in Africa, running into the--
Speaker 2: The Tuskegee Airmen--
Speaker 1: --the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting thing about that--and I--and this will bring, bring up-to-date, but we can go right back to where we were, but the interesting thing about that is that when he came home around 1949, '50 [1950], when I was about seven or eight, he told me stories about these black men who were flyers in World War II [WWII].  Now, and then I remember he literally got involved in wanting to fly Beechcrafts and that was the exact impression that these airmen had made on him.  So my father would go out to a place called Shell Cross Airfield [ph.], outside Middletown and learned to fly Beechcrafts. And once he learned to fly we would then go up on Sunday, I would, go up on Sunday with him, sometimes with an instructor and himself--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Beechcrafts.  But it was in direct result of having met these fliers.
Speaker 1: They had made such an impression--
Speaker 2: Such and impression on him--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that he wanted to learn to fly.  And he actually learned to fly these, these planes.  He didn't keep up with it after a few years.  But I remember it was right around '49 [1949], '50 [1950] and I remember taking--going up on Sundays with my dad.  And so, that, that--they, they made such an impression on him.  But for me, I forgot those stories--and it wasn't until 1973, '74 [1974], somebody gave me a book on the Tuskegee Airmen and I read it and I went, oh my God, these are the men my father told me about. So it had gone out of my head because I had gone all through school and had never heard about them. And I'd forgotten the stories because it was like when I was seven and then literally I have a book and I'm reading about them.  And I'm getting angry as I read it because I go, why didn't I know about this in school?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So we'll cut to later and then the connection that that makes for me years later.
Story_ID: 301120
Speaker 1: And now you've raised a question for me, even though all of the teachers in school were black, did they ever get into black history?
Speaker 2: Well, that's something that we did have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my mother's [Bertha Seagers Johnson] classmate, who then was the principal of the school, Dr. Waters, Dr. Alfred G. Waters--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was really firm about having, at that time, Black History Week [Black History Month]--and we had Black History Week and we learned about--that we spent that time learning about our black history.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, I didn't know anything about the [Tuskegee] Airmen--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but we learned of course, the Carvers [George Washington Carver], and the Washingtons [Booker T. Washington] and the Bethunes [Mary McLeod Bethune] and on and on, and on.  And I prided myself in learning about black history because that was just amazing and you know, that's why I learned it.  And most of my classmates--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --we did it every February at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Well, the--I guess the black--the Tuskegee Airmen were really making history at that point--
Speaker 2: At that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they had not become a--
Speaker 2: They had not become that--
Speaker 1: --part of history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I imagine later on when I was in college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and I'm not learning about them.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And, and I also been remiss in not really establishing the flavor of what the community was like [in Middletown, Delaware].  Your family obviously, were--would be considered maybe middle class.
Speaker 2: Middle class, I think.
Speaker 1: --in, in there.  But, were there people who were economically challenged (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  We, again we had, we had the teachers and we had the ministers.  That was pretty much the, the middle class--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --of the town.  And then we had a lot of people who were working class people, some who were lower middle class and then there were others who were very poor.  And the further you went on the east side of town, as is always the case--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the, the, the lower economic level you came to.  But it was a small community.  So I would say there couldn't have been more than eight or nine hundred of us who were black--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that 2500 person town.  So it was a very small community.  Although, we had three churches, we had the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, which my [paternal] grandfather [Orange Johnson, Sr.] was minister of, and then we had the Methodist church and then we had the Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so black people belonged to three different churches and, and, but we would go back and forth and, to each other's church, and that kind of thing, but we did have three separate churches, and but one school.
Story_ID: 301121
Speaker 1: You were born in 1942?  In '47 [1947] at the end of the war [World War II, WWII] you are--what are your earliest memories?  I don't want to--
Speaker 2: Earliest memories--well, you know it's funny because I, I actually remember a little bit of the war years.  I actually remember air raids. And I couldn't have been very old, but I remember air raids and black outs.  And I remember being on the porch on Lake Street [Middletown, Delaware] and there were sirens would happen and we'd have to go and take cover and all the lights would go out.  I remember things about how butter was rationed, or milk was left and on--by the truck--the horse and buggy, and they would come around and deliver milk and ice.  I remember those things. They are very salient in my, my mind.  And I had family in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which I would later, when I was about seven or eight, would go and visit in Philadelphia and still even then in the late '40s [1940s], you know, they had ice trucks and the carriage, horse carriages would come around and all, I remember that kind of thing.  And I don't remember ever feeling even though I was living in a segregated society, any oppression about that, because I was living right at the edge where my playmates were often white, but I mean I knew there was a difference; we didn't go to school with them; we didn't go to church with them; and my [maternal] grandmother [Letitia Seagers] worked for them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I remember that.  But it didn't--it wasn't in a society where I ever felt threatened by it.
Speaker 1: Did it ever impact you in a way wondering why, you know, that you--at playtime they were your friends--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you were having fun
Speaker 2: And then why we didn't go to school together?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, I think when you're a kid it's there and you're aware of it, but, you don't, you don't process it in a way that, any more than that's the way the system is.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You didn't, you didn't really kind of go, "Why is that happening," or whatever.  I think later when I got older, when we felt like we were not getting the same kind of education and by the time I went to high school there, they--the high school went all the way to the twelfth grade.  So I wasn't one of those who then had to go away to go to school, although I did, that's another story.  But, yeah, I don't think we processed it until later when we felt maybe the education wasn't as, as, as good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we sort of said, "Well, why is that?" kind of thing.
Story_ID: 301122
Speaker 1: I remember, because my family was middle class and my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] was well known and my father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] at this time, had come out and 'cause agriculture wasn't something he really wanted to do, so he had to find something to do, so he started out getting a job in civil service when he got out in the late, late '46 [1946], '47 [1947].  He went to work for the [U.S.] Air Force and became what they called a real property officer, which he then dealt--he worked for at, at the Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware; later worked at another air base [New Castle Air National Guard Base] in New Castle [Delaware] for years.  And he would deal with all the real property on the air bases in Delaware and eventually started to do that all over the country.  And that's how--and he got into that.  But I remember that my family had a certain level of, of achievement in the town [Middletown, Delaware].  So I could sometimes be treated differently than some of my more economically challenged classmates.  And I remember once going into a store, it was Kecks [ph.] drugstore and it was a white drugstore where you could go in and order, but you couldn't sit.  And I remember a couple of times where they would--I could go and sit at the counter and they would let me sit and wouldn't make me get up.  And I remember a classmate of mine came in one day and sat at the counter next to me and then they said we both had to get up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then I really knew the difference, and I never ever wanted to go in there again, and I never wanted to ever try to sit again because if my other classmates couldn't sit.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was, that really brought it home to me at that point because I had felt very privileged and I would go in and I'd just sit and they wouldn't kick me out.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I also remember going to the segregated movie, which was called the Everett Theatre, years later they shot 'Dead Poets Society' at that theater.  But, when I was going there we did have to sit on--in the balcony on one side and the whites sat on the other.  But the whites really sat on the--sat upstairs.  The kids maybe on Friday night would sit upstairs, but most of the time they used the orchestra pit below.  But I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the, the white kids could use the balcony or the--
Speaker 1: Or the orchestra--
Speaker 2: --right, okay.
Speaker 1: But, but we--there was a gold bar down the center.  But I would always sometimes go and decide that I was going to sit one or two seats over on the white side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And most of the time there was very--there was almost nobody up there and they didn't challenge you.   And then I'd get a couple of my classmates to go over and usually nothing happened.  They, they usually never made us, made us move because there weren't very many of them up there.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: So, you, you were only going a little bit over the line.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But it was that--it was my protest, my sit-in at that point in time.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 301123
Speaker 1: Any classmates growing up that you can remember who still leave a lasting impression on you?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my classmates was Dr. Waters [Alfred G. Waters], who was the principal of the school.  He and I are friends to this day--Hugh Waters.  And he ended up going to Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and--when I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], he went to Morgan State and then wanted to go to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and couldn't get in and ended up having to go to medical school in Egypt--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and got his degree in Egypt and then came back and became a doctor that way.  He ended up working as a doctor in public health.  But we've been friends and he--from that time he and I have been friends since we were in the first grade together.  And we're still friends to this day.  And his father was also an educator of course, the principal.  And we would spend time at each other's homes and whatever and we're still friends, because I, I value that because you know, that's about a fifty year or more friendship.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It is more than fifty years, a friendship, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Those were--I'm just trying to get some of the interesting stories as you were, were growing up.  How about teachers?  Are there any other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --teachers that may--
Speaker 2: My second grade teacher was Bertha [Seagers] Johnson.  Who was--by that time she had left Wilmington [Delaware], Newark [Delaware] and come to, come to Middletown [Delaware] and became the second grade teacher. So by the time I got to school, she was my second grade teacher and was the teacher--
Speaker 1: So did you say teacher, or did you say mom (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I said, "Mrs. Johnson."  And she was tougher on me than she was on everybody else--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I was in her classroom and, but she was an incredible teacher and an incredible woman, and so I--I really valued the--what my mother gave to me and to many students.  But she was in that school the entire time because we only had one school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So when I went on to, you know, schools, she was--she later became the, the--she later became a principal and then she became an administrator for the district.  But at that time she was at one time as the second grade teacher, became the president of the entire faculty. Because she was, she was very, you know, very strong achieving kind of person.  But she was my second grade teacher.  I remember her greatly.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Probably, probably, probably a lot of my teachers I--I found them to be--they really wanted all of us to achieve.  And they were tough teachers.  It was, it was, it was a time when we all sort of buckled down and learned.  But my mother is probably the most salient memory I have of my teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 301124
Speaker 1: When did you start getting a sense of what you might want to be as a career?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Where you might want to go to school, college, and so forth?
Speaker 2: Well, it was hard.  I was never good in math or science, but I always used to like to talk.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So my [maternal] grandfather, Author Brinkley, would always say, "You know, you got to be a lawyer.  We want you to be a lawyer."  Because I didn't know if I wanted to be a lawyer, but he did and the family did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there were so few politicians from Delaware, it was such a small state.  They were--at that time they--Louis [L.] Redding later became a judge, but we didn't have many people above being teachers or principals or, you know, the usual that black people could do.  And so I think my family viewed me as becoming a lawyer and then running for office in the State of Delaware.
Speaker 1: Now approximately the time is about 1950--
Speaker 2: I'd say this is 1955--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --around that time.
Speaker 1: --good enough.
Speaker 2: And I don't know if I wanted to do that, but I got it into my head that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that was something I could do.  I could be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I think I was never sure I wanted to do that, but I knew my family wanted me to do it and I didn't have any other goal per se.  I was on--I use to win declamation contests and I'd be the student who was chosen to go to the [Delaware] State Senate, for you know, when I was in eighth through ninth grade.  And so I had all those things that involved in government (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You really were a speechifier [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 2: I, in some ways, in some ways--
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: --I, you know, and I would, I would do church plays and I played the piano in church and those kinds of things.  I played for the Sunday school and for a while I played for the church choir on Sunday mornings.  But, so you know, by the time I had gotten to the tenth grade my parents [Bertha Seagers Johnson and Orange Johnson, Jr.] even thought that the education there was not, was not that strong.  And they started looking for schools for me to go to that were boarding schools.  They just felt I was not going to get a good education.  My mother felt even worse about it because she felt that the older teachers knew her, and she, at one time, was, for a number of years was president of the faculty and she felt that I was going to get grades, and I didn't have to work that hard.  So my mother and father--one of the ministers at the Methodist church, Edwin Ellis [ph.], who was my piano teacher, had gone to Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] in Pennsylvania.  And I had taken that test--I don't know if you know about that test where when you're in the tenth grade you can literally take a test and if, if you pass it you can go, you can skip your last two years in high school and go to college.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: That--there was a test of that and I got accepted to Lincoln and to Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but my parents felt I was too young, so they, they, they looked for boarding schools and Reverend Ellis knew when he was at Lincoln, one of the professors there that he knew, had a son who was at school called The Stony Brook College Preparatory [The Stony Brook School] in Stony Brook, Long Island [New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And as a result of that--and he, he--at that time Larry Brown [ph.] was the only African American at that school and the very first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Now, Larry Brown, there are so many--
Speaker 2: --Larry--well he--his father was the professor at Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know the father, I just knew Reverend Ellis who had gone to school and was still in contact with Larry's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Larry was already at Stony Brook--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Stony Brook, Long Island and was their first African American student.
Story_ID: 301125
Speaker 1: There was a school in Delaware called the St. Andrew's School, just outside of Middletown [Delaware], which was a very good school, and it was between St. Andrew's and Stony Brook [The Stony Brook School, Stony Brook, New York].  But my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] and father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] felt like it was too close to home.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And in fact that's why, that's why the 'Dead Poets Society' was done at the Everett [Everett Theatre, Middletown, Delaware] because they shot at St. Andrew's School in Delaware.
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: So I went to both schools to interview and Stony Brook was more of a, a sort of a religious school, but non-denominational.  And I went there and got accepted and this was 1950--'56 [1956].  I went, I went to, went there in '55 [1955] to interview and ended up in '56 [1956] going to school there starting with my--I went to the eleventh grade there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I became the second African American student there.  That was 1956.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The--now you did go, go to Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  Can you, well what--
Speaker 1: Well, only just to do--I went to interview (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --for that program, but we, we didn't do it because my--I, I was, I was about fifteen or so then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my parents thought I was much too young to try and send me off to, to a college at that point in the game.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they opted to send me to the, to, to Stony Brook around the same time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you went to Stony Brook --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and coming--any memorable experiences at Stony Brook?
Speaker 1: Well it was an extraordinary time for me because it--I was away from home.  I was in--out at Long Island [New York] and being the only African American--second African American there, Larry [Brown (ph.)] was still there.  Larry was a senior when I--he went there during the eleventh grade as well, when I was a junior.  But we were not particularly close.  And I became one of the students who was one of the most active students in the school.  I was in the glee club.  I was on the student activity center.  I was an editor of the yearbook.  I was on the newspaper.  I, I just, I would excel.  And when Dr. Gaebelein [Frank E. Gaebelein], who was the headmaster at that time, said to my mother and father when I graduated with--"Charles [HistoryMaker Charles F. Johnson] has learned a lot here, but we've learned a lot from Charles."  And I was--we had about fifty-six people in our graduating class and I was the only African American in the, in my class that year and subsequently Stony Brook has a number of African Americans now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's right across the school from the state university [Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York] which came, was being built when I was there, but it wasn't yet operational (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not done, okay--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 301126
Speaker 1: From Stony Brook [The Stony Brook School, Stony Brook, New York], now, you end up at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, when I left Stony Brook, I got accepted at Howard and Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] and the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  And it was just a question of where you wanted to go.  Now I think I felt like I had had two years of white schools and so many people I'd heard about had gone to Howard.  And I just felt like that's where I wanted to be.  I wanted to be where--so many people I'd read about had gone there, one of my teachers at, in Middletown [Delaware] had been, Henrie Mae Spearman, who taught my third grade, was a Howard graduate, the only Howard graduate in our community. And so, it was just--and it was Washington, D.C.  It just seemed like the place I wanted to be and my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] and father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] actually wanted me to go to Brown.  But they didn't, they didn't, they didn't object.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think they were very proud--
Speaker 1: Nobody had opted for Columbia?
Speaker 2: No, they did not opt for Columbia or University--or University of Pennsylvania.  I almost went to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because it was so close to home.  It was fifty miles away and I had a lot of family that area, you know, Camden [New Jersey], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Wilmington [Delaware]. But, in the end Howard won out because of its legacy for African Americans and for black people.  So, I was very happy to go there.  And I thought there was an excitement about being in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] as well.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 301127
Speaker 1: What were your first impressions when you got to that Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] campus?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in love with Howard from the time I arrived.  I, I--
Speaker 1: Okay, now this was a full scholarship to Howard?
Speaker 2: No, I had a partial scholarship--
Speaker 1: Partial, partial scholarship, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a partial scholarship; I didn't have a full scholarship.  I later got a full scholarship when I went to law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I had a partial scholarship in undergrad.  But, I just loved that campus from the very beginning.  It, it always seemed to me that the best and the brightest, and that's probably because I'm a Howardite, but it always seemed to me it was, it was an (unclear) place, always a forward thinking place.  I liked the District [District of Columbia; Washington, D.C.].  I liked the freedom of being in college and being able to hang out in the city and all.  And I liked the black fraternities and black sororities.  I immediately in my second year became a, a Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], I pledged--and was a Lampados, and then became a Que.  And I, I was actually in my class, I was the--my senior class, I was the vice president of the class.  And one of my classmates was of course [HistoryMaker] Dennis Hightower, and who--
Speaker 1: Who later came out to head up Disney [The Walt Disney Company].
Speaker 2: --came to head up Disney.  But we were, we were, we were in class together.  In fact, Dennis and I, Dennis got me, when we were freshman, to go to Atwater, Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --because he had gone to Atwater when he was a child, he and Alma Brown [HistoryMaker Alma Arrington Brown], they were both at Atwater together and I had never gone.  I had gone to a camp in Downingtown in Pennsylvania when I was younger and Dennis got me to go to Atwater and become camp counselor and we became fast friends at that time on.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: And, and Togo West [HistoryMaker Togo D. West, Jr.] was there of course, at Howard when I was there.  Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] was in my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, Stokely was a year ahead, maybe a year ahead of me--no, a year behind me.  Stokely was just, Stokely was a, a freshman when I was a sophomore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember very vividly when he went across campus going Black Power.  I remember that.  Yeah, and I remember one summer in around '61 [1961] or '62 [1962], we were in New York a lot together because I worked in New York for a couple of summers and he was in New York and so I got to spend time seeing him.  We weren't close friends--but we were around together a lot.
Speaker 1: Now, you started Howard, what, '58 [1958], '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958]
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], okay.
Speaker 2: Graduated in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when you went--
Speaker 2: And I was only seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were still a young, a young--
Speaker 2: Still pretty young, yeah.
Story_ID: 301128
Speaker 1: You went to New York to work summers?
Speaker 2: Summers--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to work, what--
Speaker 2: Well, I went to New York to work summers and I actually taught in a summer, like a summer school program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a woman in New York who ran a school called the East River Summer School [ph.].  It was a little school where people brought their kids after work.  And I went to work--Elonia Gaston [ph.] was somebody I had met when I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and she ran the school and I wanted to go to New York to work and she offered me a job.  So I spent time working sort of as a schoolteacher to two and three year olds, I mean, second, third and fourth graders during the summer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and then I did that for like a couple of summers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but I, I, it was a great excuse just to be in New York because I wanted to hang out in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, this is a period when we--four years past, the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  There's a civil rights awakening across the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Across the country.
Speaker 1: --and people are becoming more aware.  People like Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] and, and many students at Howard's campus--
Speaker 2: At Howard, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --are beginning to question things.  What was Charles Floyd Johnson's [HistoryMaker Charles F. Johnson] fight?
Speaker 2: Well, I never went south to be in marches, but I was very active in terms of being involved in protests when we did them in Washington [D.C.] and going and marching downtown and what have you.  But I was involved in '61 [1961] and '62 [1962] with political science because that was my major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I got involved with the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] campaign--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when he ran for president and Oliver Hill [HistoryMaker Oliver W. Hill], who was from, from Virginia--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and I worked with he and Patricia Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris] at that time--were all--got me involved in working for the campaign and I worked for about a year and a half with the Kennedy campaign, working with Oliver and Spottswood Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III].  All of those people that I met and some of them, some of them were at Howard as well.  But I--I did a lot more in the terms of the political arena.  I did a lot of volunteer work, and in fact, when Kennedy was inaugurated because of all I'd done, I got invited to the inauguration--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in, what was that--
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) sixty [1960], yeah.  So from probably my sophomore year on I was very much involved politically and, and, and I didn't go south, when a lot of my friends did during the summers, but I did--was involved in the Civil Rights Movement because it was there for us.  It was what we were doing at that time.
Speaker 1: Now--right, so you were very, very active--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I hope your parents [Bertha Seagers Johnson and Orange Johnson, Jr.] weren't worried about you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I think they, they were--my mother and father were--although they were politically a little different from me, my, my mother was in the late '50s [1950s], was the secretary treasurer of the Delaware Federation of Republican Women--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --so, which was kind of odd in a very small state where you know, most of the people were, were white.  But, so politically we were--my mother was very active--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so she didn't mind my politics.  I think she'd have been more worried if I had gone in the South and spent a long time.  But she sort of championed it although she didn't agree with my, my beliefs.  She was very much an Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] supporter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And later a Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] supporter, although she regretted it (laughter) a few years after that.  But, she, they, they, they liked the fact that I was politically involved even though they didn't agree with my politics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 300444
Speaker 1: You worked in the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] campaign and you're very politically active--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you're coming up to graduation [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --are you maintaining your studies?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a point or two when Washington [D.C.] became more important than my studies for about a semester or two, but my parents [Bertha Seagers Johnson and Orange Johnson, Jr.] were very enlightened about that.  They knew, they felt like, because I had let my scholarship go down and they felt like I was so mortified that I had done it that I'd learned my lesson and they were right. And there was one, one semester when I liked playing poker and, and, and as we did, bid whiz, a lot more than I liked studying, but only that, and I brought my scholarship back up and I graduated with, with honors when I finished, but I--but Washington was seductive and there were always lots of things to be able to do and you know, whatever, but by the time I was a junior I went to work--I didn't mention this to you, I went to work at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] because I wanted a part-time job because you always want more money to spend--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and again, my mother's connections paid off because she was, she knew the senator at that time from the state--was a man named J. Caleb Boggs, and they were trying to get blacks at that time to work on the main desk at the Library of Congress because we, we were beginning to work in the stacks--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but we were--there were no blacks at the time and so they were trying to get me on the desk at the Library of Congress.  It didn't work out, but they got me a job and I worked in the stacks for two years there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did my, my, my--I did four hours a day--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --my junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I gathered--that's when I first started spending time on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] working and of course I'd been around in the environment working on the political campaigns.  But a lot of times we worked over on 16th Street when the Kennedy campaign was going on and not right on the Hill itself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 300445
Speaker 1: But you still have this burning interest in political science?
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my--I, I minored, I--majored in political science and minored in history and education [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] always said, "You probably should have a fall back," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: As we, as we were taught.
Speaker 1: Good advice, good advice.
Speaker 2: But again, I think because of the old days when [maternal] grandfather [Author Brinkley] talked about being a lawyer, I felt that political science was the thing to do to lead you to the law school.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And, and that was the thing to be, so that's why.  So, even though I hadn't--when you asked me long ago about thinking, I was always working toward it even unconsciously or subconsciously, because even though I didn't know, the family knew.  But, I actually had a burning interest in communications, even then.  And I became a member of the Howard Players [Howard University Players] in '58 [1958] when Owen Dodson was then the chairman of the department and--and Cooke [Anne Margaret Cooke]--I can't remember her--(unclear) name, who ran, also was second head of the department, and in fact Langston Hughes came by a few times because he and Owen were friends and that was about '58 [1958].  We did, we did 'Simply Heavenly' [Langston Hughes] in '58 [1958] and I knew--I wasn't in that, that particular production, but I remember Langston, I first met him then.  But the--I--there was something about--I'll go back, I didn't tell you this, you were talking about being--when growing up in a small town [Middletown, Delaware], the one thing that use to be our relief was going to the movies.  There wasn't much to do in a small town, (unclear) from the people.  And so I went to a lot of movies and by the 1950s I was seeing 'Carmen Jones' and 'Blackboard Jungle.' So I was seeing Poitier [Sidney Poitier] and I was seeing Dorothy Dandridge and all those people, and, and that made a big impression on me before I went away to Stony Brook [The Stony Brook School, Stony Brook, New York].  And it was almost like, I want to do that, didn't know how, didn't have any connections in New York or California in terms of the acting world, but I started doing theater with--when I was in, at the Howard Players.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I did that as a sideline while I was still working and, and, and went away from it when I went to law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], but later I went back to it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which I'll tell you about.
Story_ID: 300446
Speaker 1: Now, in 1962 you got accepted to the Howard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got accepted to the Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I, I really didn't apply to anyplace else.  I wasn't sure I wanted to go.  In fact, in 1962 I wanted to go off to the Neighborhood Playhouse [Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to become an actor in New York.  But my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] said, "Sidney Poitier you're not," (laughter) and, you know, I, I thought--they said, "Look, just apply to law school and if you go, take it as a winter resort."  But my parents knew me better than I think that I did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because they knew that I was a child who would always, as they had, when presented with challenges, you met those challenges.  So I applied to law school, only Howard, got accepted, went to law school, got a full scholarship.
Speaker 1: Right.  The dean at that time was?
Speaker 2: The dean at that time, oh my goodness, you know, there was a changeover then, and I believe--Spottswoods Robinson [Spottswood William Robinson III] was my second year, but it wasn't Nabors [William B. Nabors], because he I think, had gone on to be the, the president of the university at that time.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And I remember Spottswood and, and Clarence Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.], but I can't remember that first year.  There was another dean there the first year and Patricia Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris] came in, but a little after that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But she was my law professor.  She was my constitutional law professor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of my, if not my favorite people, at the law school.  But, I was just going to quickly tell you that I got there and got--ended up on the Law Journal [Howard Law Journal] and published while I was at law school, so my parents knew me well, I exceeded very well there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and, and Pat Harris taught me both torts and constitutional law, and was my advisor on the Law Journal and, and Herb Reid [Herbert O. Reid, Sr.]
Speaker 1: And Herb Reid.
Speaker 2: Do you remember Herbert Reid?
Speaker 1: Oh, I worked with him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You worked with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well he was actually probably my mentor--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --he and Pat Harris, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 300447
Speaker 1: Any outstanding memories there [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], of, of law school, actually recall any (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I went to law school the first year, as most kids, most young people, I was twenty-one.  I, I wasn't happy that first year because it was so hard.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And they--it, it's a Socratic Method they teach you, and most people would probably know it from 'The Paper Chase,' the movie and the television series, but they really do try very hard to make you, weed you out.  And so the first semester I thought, well, this is not for me, but I stayed.
Speaker 1: You met the challenge.
Speaker 2: I met the challenge and I remember once having to do moot court in my second year and one of the judges, I can't remember his name, from downtown [Washington, D.C.] came in and we were before the moot court, and I thought I was really cooking with my presentation and at one point he said to me, he said, "Counselor, what is the procedural posture of this case?" and I didn't know what the hell he meant.  And he got very annoyed that I didn't understand what that was.  And he started to upbraid me in front of everybody, you know, "You should know what it is."  And finally when he had made me--humiliated me enough, he then told me the procedural posture was simply the point in which the case had broken down on the trial level.  And so procedurally where was it that it had broken down on the trial level and you--to bring you to this appellate level. I thought, "Why in the hell didn't you say that." But that was sort of what law school was all about. [HistoryMaker] Wayman Smith--
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: --who later went to Budweiser [Anheuser-Busch; Anheuser-Busch InBev] and I were classmates.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And Cornell [ph.]--I can't remember--John [T.] Baker who later became head of the law school for briefly, was there.  And a number of other of my classmates went on to be--Gabrielle, Gabrielle Kirk [HistoryMaker Gabrielle Kirk McDonald]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Texas became a federal judge.  There were a number of things.  It was, it was a good time, it was a tough time, but it was a good time.
Speaker 1: You anticipated that of course (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was--yeah.  And Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], I think was killed my first year.  And I think it may have been--was I a freshman, '62 [1962], no it was--
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963]?
Speaker 2: --I was, I was a sophomore.  It was the beginning of my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: And he--I remember that.
Speaker 1: November.
Speaker 2: That was where I was when that happened, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were in class.  And they came in and said the president was killed, and I thought it was Nabors [William B. Nabors].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Nabors because that's the first thing you think about.  I didn't think it was the president of the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting people remember where they were--
Speaker 2: --where they were.
Speaker 1: --and so forth.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 300448
Speaker 1: You graduated from, from the Howard University law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Law school--
Speaker 1: And now you were ready for life?
Speaker 2: I thought so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought so, but the Vietnam War was raging, and I took the bar in Delaware, which is where I was from, and by the time I got the results of the bar I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: In 1965--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And ended up going to Fort--in South Carolina.  I went to one--Fort Jackson [Columbia, South Carolina].  And then they sent me to--because I didn't have my--I wasn't a member of the bar yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't want to be--and I had gone to ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], but I wasn't an officer and I didn't want to be an officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because that meant four years and I was ready to do two and out.  They sent me to Fort--Augusta, in Augusta, Georgia, Fort [Fort Gordon, Augusta, Georgia]--whatever that is there, and I did basic training.  And then I was going to become a clerk and go to Cam Ranh Bay [Vietnam], but again, mothers who know politicians somehow interceded, and my orders were changed and I didn't go to Vietnam.  They sent me to be a clerk at Fort Dix, New Jersey, in a courts and boards division, because I had a law degree. And I was, I was an administrative clerk in courts and boards and while I was there, there were so many AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave] in that--in the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York corridor, that the stockades were over, over-filled and you could be a defense counsel in the [U.S.] military as long as you were requested, you just couldn't prosecute. So I left being an administrative clerk and became a defense counsel--
Speaker 1: Getting lots of practice--
Speaker 2: --lots of practice, for a year and a half. And that's what I did during my time in, in the [U.S.] Army and defended probably about 400 cases, about 300 of them were AWOLs.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: Yeah, and got an Army commendation medal for that, but that, that was what happened in the '60s [1960s], from '65 [1965] 'til '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: How successful were you in defending those cases?
Speaker 2: Very, because I wouldn't have had that many cases had I not had success in them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, you had to be requested.
Speaker 2: --because I had to be requested.  But I was very good about--now, I got--a lot of kids unfortunately I got off, but also, if they would volunteer to go to Vietnam.  A lot of times they had been incarcerated for eight or nine months because the backup was so great, that I would argue, argue time served, and if they were willing to now go and serve overseas, they were out and ready to go and they were willing to do that.  I hated--sometimes I feel guilty now about having sent some kids over there, but that's what happened.  I, I was known as getting them out of the stockade and getting them out and some I got without having to go to Vietnam.  But I would go to the stockade with the lieutenants and the captains who were officers, and I would sometimes have more clients than they would.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm sure they did not appreciate that.
Speaker 2: No, they did not appreciate it, but they were all my friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were all the same age, or a couple of them--some of them were a little older than I was.  But we were all around the same age, and it was very interesting because I was a Spec 5 --
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they were, they were lieutenants and captains, but we were all friends.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 300449
Speaker 1: At the end of your [U.S.] Army career, unless we're missing some--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --important event--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --during that period, at the end of your Army career, what happened, no, what did you decide to do, or--
Speaker 2: I left a very salient point out, because when I thought I was going to go to Vietnam, I was dating a young lady and we thought we were--I was going to Vietnam and we got married.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, you did leave that out.
Speaker 2: I did leave that out.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], I got married in June of '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I married a young woman from Washington, D.C. by the name of Sandra Brashears.
Speaker 1: Oh, of the Brashears family?
Speaker 2: Of the Brashears family, and she was a, she was a junior.  She was one year behind me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'd known each other through school and she became an art teacher right after she finished Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and, and I was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] of course, when she was a senior.  I was a freshman.  And then she went out and become an art teacher and then we got married because I thought I was going to Vietnam and she did, too.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And we were--I was married to Sandra for about seven years.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  She was a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and I was a Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow!  Okay, but now you, you, so you're, you're coming out of the Army, you're married--
Speaker 2: And I'm married.  Sandra's living in Washington and teaching and I--so I decided to go to [Washington] D.C. and work in D.C. because she was there.  And I had to get a job and I actually got a job at the--what was that place--the U.S. Copyright Office, as an attorney, as an attorney, which I did for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And interestingly enough though, I didn't particularly like copyright law.  And I still had this burning desire to be in communications.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did--and, but the Copyright Office afforded me the chance to work from nine to five.  So I spent a lot of time working in little theater in D.C.  And I started studying acting and started studying, taking communication courses at night; doing plays in D.C.  I worked all over D.C.  I studied at Arena Stage, Washington Theater Club.  I did plays at places like Theatre Lobby [Washington, D.C.].  I worked in Virginia and Maryland, just; I was always working in theater in those years.
Speaker 1: Wow!  And doing your nine to five?
Speaker 2: Doing my nine to five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And working mostly theater.  I could go to rehearsals at night and most of the theater was on Thursday through, through Sunday, you did your plays.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I did a little working in television there and got to meet some people.
Speaker 1: What station is this?
Speaker 2: Channel Nine [WUSA-TV].
Speaker 1: Channel Nine.
Speaker 2: I did a show a little bit, it was a show called 'Harambee' at that time.
Speaker 1: I remember 'Harambee'
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I would, I would do, I would do, kind of come in and do a little co-hosting at times and I would--whatever.  And I did work for a short while for Howard University Radio Station [WHUR-FM, Washington, D.C.].  Because remember that was just getting started.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I did a little work for them.  So I had that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --aside there that was happening.
Story_ID: 300450
Speaker 1: And so I did all that and kept my nine to five for three years.  Now, I'll quickly bring you up to date.  When, my last year at the [U.S.] Copyright Office, I got assigned--I became what they call an attorney advisor, where I did briefs and worked on cases that were involved with copyright for the [U.S.] Department of Justice.  But the last year I got a chance to go to the state department [U.S. Department of State] and work with justices or actually copyright experts from all over the United States, and they were at the state department.  And one of the people I worked with was a man named Torwald Hesser, who was one of the justices of the Supreme Court of Sweden.  And I spent about a week or two with him and at the end of that week he said, "Have you ever been to Stockholm [Sweden]?"  And I said, "No."  And he said, "Would you like to come?"  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "I know where there is grant money and if the Copyright Office will let you find a subject that the grant--the center," it was called the (unclear) center, "would approve of in copyright, you can come over and do a kind of an internship and work over there in a work study program."
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: So I literally--he went back to Stockholm, he followed his word through.  I found a subject matter; the Copyright Office let me go and I went off for about four months to go to Stockholm to work in Stockholm on the Copyright Office's dime and getting paid also, whatever.  It was, it was an extraordinary experience.
Speaker 2: Absolutely that.
Speaker 1: I, I will cut to what happened though.  At the end of my time in Stockholm, the Copyright Office called me and said there is a conference at UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] in Paris [France] for two weeks and it's cheaper for us to send you over there before you come home than it is for us to send somebody over.  So I went down to UNESCO, did the copyright conference, while I was there a job opened up at UNESCO, thirty-six months in copyright, which now I had a chance to live in France--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and learn French.  But I still had that desire and I was probably twenty-nine, almost thirty then, and I still had that desire of being in communications.  So I decided at that point--I took--I actually applied for the job and got it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --came back to Washington, D.C., but while I was back in Washington, D.C. I decided I would rather come to California and start over again and not do France.  So that's when I made my decision in 1970.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970]?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970], I, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I--because I had been doing all the local stuff in, in D.C.--and was doing plays and whatever you know, and getting enough attention.  I wanted to be--I'd rather, I said, I'd rather be a small fish in a big sea than, than learn to be a big fish in a small pond.  So I made a career decision and about that time Sandra [Sandra Brashears] and I were separating, and we didn't divorce for a couple of years later, but we separated, and so I really felt like I could go and start over again by myself.
Story_ID: 300451
Speaker 1: So I literally just turned down the job at UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] after I'd gotten it--the person who got it has been forever grateful.  And I came to California in 1970 and started all over again.  Actually I got to California in February of '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's exciting.  I, I would never knew all of--
Speaker 1: My parents [Bertha Seagers Johnson and Orange Johnson, Jr.] weren't very happy about that.
Speaker 2: Right, right, because now you're pursuing--
Speaker 1: Now I am pursuing--well they didn't know what I was pursuing and they thought I wanted to be an actor, which they were very nervous about.  And they just didn't feel it, after, "Why did you get all this education? And why did we do all this and then you go off and be an actor?"  And how do you know I'll have any success?  My mother literally was off to an education conference the day I left, and shook my hand and said, "I wish you luck," and that was it (laughter).  She was not a happy camper.
Speaker 2: Okay, now you get out to Los Angeles [California] and what do you do?
Speaker 1: Well, I had, luckily, the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I decided the best thing to do was I wanted to go try some acting schools.  And so I found a school in Hollywood that I had read about when I was in the [U.S.] Copyright Office because I use to get the trades, which was the report of (unclear)--and I would see these schools listed.  And so I actually applied to one before I even got here and got in, it's called Professional Theater Workshop, was on El Centro [Street] and Santa Monica [Boulevard] in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and, and I had the G.I. Bill.  So I went there for about nine months--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --learning--I--we would, we would, act, acting classes and all the other things you do for about four days a week and then our fifth day was where we would learn to do resumes and go out and do interviews.  But, I wasn't--I didn't have a lot of money and so whenever I was in trouble I would call mother and father and they would say, "You know if you're not going to be acting and you're not doing well, maybe you should come home and be a lawyer."  And I didn't want to do that because I also realized by that time that emotional independence was also financial independence; one was, one fed the other, and so, you know, I was very close to my family and I was an only child.  So I wanted--I was doing a play and I was talking about needing to go to work and one of the persons, one of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you were actually acting?
Speaker 1: I was actually acting, but in little theater.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I wasn't being paid.  But I was, I had done theater all over--I had done maybe six plays in about nine months in little theater.  And was going to school in the daytime.
Story_ID: 300452
Speaker 1: We were in a production and my friend said--I said, "I need a job."  And she said, "You know you've got a law degree, you ought to," she said, "My husband is out at Universal [Universal Studios; Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, California] and he's in business affairs as a production coordinator.  You ought to go talk to him."  So I literally called her husband up a couple days later, he introduced me to some people and there was an African American man who was in, in the, in the department of personnel who liked me, thought I had qualifications, but couldn't find anything for me and--but he kept looking and about six months after I had applied, he said, he called me up and he said, "The only thing I can find for you, if you're willing to do it, is the mailroom. Are you willing to do that?"  And I said, "Why not."
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And it was what, four hundred dollars a week, but I didn't care.
Speaker 2: But it beat starving.
Speaker 1: But it beat starving.  And so I took a job with the mailroom.  Now I have
Speaker 2: At Universal?
Speaker 1: At Universal.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have an extraordinary good fortune.  This is where timing meets opportunity meets preparation.  Because my friend who had been in the mailroom, who had moved to business affairs had introduced me to his boss before I went there.  Two days after I was in the mailroom, a job opened up in the business affairs department as a production coordinator where we coordinated a lot of the productions.  And Universal, you know, at that time was doing tons of shows.  They had--they were like sixteen or seventeen shows, they were doing all the movies of the week.  And they--the guy remembered me, and because African Americans were not that much behind the scenes at that time, that worked to my advantage.  I had a law degree and I got the job without even knowing it.  I went to the commissary my third day there and somebody said, "Congratulations."  And I said, "What?"  They said, "We hear you're moving up."  And I was so nervous; I didn't even ask the guy.  I said, "Okay."  I got back to the mailroom and found out that I had the job; three days at Universal.  I didn't even say anything to the other mail people because I didn't think I would be (laughter) very--they'd be very happy about it.  And so I, I ended up as a production coordinator in 1971, late '71 [1971].  At--because I got out in February, and this was probably by November I was in, in the mailroom at Universal.
Story_ID: 300453
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us what a production coordinator (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that was an incredible time at that point.  It, it was really a training position to become a writer, producer, director, you learned to coordinate shows.  At that time I, I worked--my very first show was a show called 'Toma,' which was--
Speaker 1: T-O-M-A, right?
Speaker 2: T-O-M-A.  And, and then I worked for a company--I was assigned to Roy Huggins, who was a producer in television at that time.  He had created 'Maverick' and many other things.  And he had shows like, 'Toma,' 'Cool Million,' 'The Bold Ones: The Lawyers' at the time, and I was assigned to all of his shows.  We would clear, we would clear, we would get the scripts, we'd read them, we'd send in all the clearances and clear the scripts then we'd go to dailies every day to see that nothing was changed in the clearances once they were done.  I was able to go to story conferences sometimes and I would go when the pictures were cut together and then I'd take them to the network and explain what we were doing.  So there was--and then we'd make deals for all the writers and directors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We would get--we, our job was to make the deals, we didn't actually choose them.  We'd find out who was available out there when a job came up.  We would then literally give them a list.  They'd come back, we'd choose a list, then we'd go to the agencies and make the deal.  So I learned an enormous amount.  And on one of the shows I was put on, shortly after I was there was called 'Night Gallery.'  And 'Night Gallery' use to use short stories as the fodder for their, for their teleplays.  And of course, you had to get rights for them.  Well, I had done copyright law, so it was a perfect match for me to do that and so I, I--whatever.  And I was one of actually, there were about four of us who were African Americans in that department.
Speaker 1: Four?
Speaker 2: Four of us were African American in that department at the time.  One of them as you know, was my friend, Yvonne Emery [ph.].
Speaker 1: Oh, no I did not know.
Speaker 2: Yvonne started as a secretary there and then moved to production coordination. And, and she was one of them, and then there were two others.  I was probably the only one who ended up becoming a producer for the length of time I did and the others only--Yvonne did for a short while, as you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But, that was how I got started.  And, and eventually besides Roy I worked for the producer.  So you got this incredible education--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --of the whole process for what television production was like.  And you got it from different levels and different producers that you ended up working with.  I ended up working with, for a short while, with some of Jack Webb's stuff when he was doing 'Adam-12,' the second 'Adam-12'--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I got to work--and he did a show called, 'Hec Ramsey.'  So I got such an experience--
Story_ID: 300454
Speaker 1: --And I worked with a man named Harve Bennett, who was doing 'Six Million Dollar Man,' that I later was one of--in fact, he offered me my first job as--to move out of that department as an associate producer on '[The] Six Million Dollar Man.'
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: But I had worked for Stephen [J.] Cannell, who was--his first major job as a producer was 'Toma,' and I was the production coordinator.  So by 1974, when Harve offered me a chance, Stephen Cannell also offered me a chance to be an associate producer on 'The Rockford Files.'
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: And because I had an association with Stephen for--since '71 [1971] in 'Toma,' I decided to go with Stephen, Anita Rosenberg and James Garner.  And that's how I got started on 'The Rockford Files' as an associate producer.  And, and I remember I was still thinking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that your first associate producing--
Speaker 1: Yes, and I was, actually, I'd been at Universal [Universal Studios; Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, California], believe it or not, I had actually done, because of my experience since having studied acting, I had done about four or five guest shots with probably four or five line per--on a show; on, on 'Toma' because I was on that show, 'Six Million Dollar Man'; 'The Rookies' and 'Kojak.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so I was thinking of maybe leaving and becoming an actor because now I'd made contact and all.  But I think sanity kicked in and I don't--I think the, the, the unstableness of acting sort of--so when they offered me the job I thought about it for all of a day.  I said, "I can probably always become an actor, I can't always become an associate producer."
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And that's how I ended up doing that and of course--
Speaker 2: 'Rockford Files' was the first--
Speaker 1: --was the first.
Speaker 2: --as an associate producer?
Speaker 1: And I became a producer in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Within two years I was a producer on that show.  And in '78 [1978] I won my first Emmy [Award]--because we won the Emmy as best dramatic series in '78 [1978] and I was then, by then I was a producer, along with David Chase--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who later became the, you know, the creator of 'The Sopranos'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Steve Cannell and Anita Rosenberg.  And we were the four of us who were--produced the show.
Speaker 2: Now, I notice that you do a lot of the shows that James Garner--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --stars in.  Was that because of a personal relationship?
Speaker 1: Well, yes, I'd been friends with him for, since I was an associate producer on 'The Rockford Files.'  And he, he's just an incredible man.  He's very supportive of his crew and very supportive of his writers and producers.  And my association with him started then and then went on when in 1979 when the series ended, he started to do 'Maverick.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I actually stayed at Universal and produced 'Simon and Simon,' the pilot, another series with Telly Savalas after 'Kojak,' Colchas' [ph.] wife produced.  And I did a number of movies a week for them.  And then when Garner started to do 'Bret Maverick,' he and Anita Rosenberg, they called me up and said, "You want to come to Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Entertainment]?"  And I'd done the pilot of 'Simon and Simon' and Universal had lost a lot of hours and I wasn't sure they were going to pick me up--my contract up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was very easy for me to know--not knowing that I wasn't going to be there necessarily, to go over there.  Also, when you--when I'd been at Universal from '71 [1971], now this is '79 [1979] and when you're working in in-system, your pay is one thing because you've been growing up in that system.  And suddenly Warner Brothers offered me a, a substantial increase--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --because I wasn't--and I had an agent who got me a salary.  So I--but then my association with Garner continued.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We only did that for a year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, then I went back to work with him in '94 [1994] when we did eight, I think we did eight 'Rockford Files' movies, it took us two years, we did the movies.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then again in 2000 [sic. 2002], we did a series called 'First Monday.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which I was then with Belisarius Productions.  But he became the chief justice and that.  So we've had a long association.  And Anne [Anne Burford Johnson] and I are very close to he and his family.
Story_ID: 300455
Speaker 1: There was a series with Tom Selleck (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well, that was interesting.  When I finished, when I finished 'Bret Maverick' in '81 [1981], Don Bellisario [Donald P. Bellisario], who I'd now worked with off and on for almost twenty-some years, had been--I had, I forgot to tell you that I was the associate producer on series called 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' which Cannell [Stephen J. Cannell] created.  And I did that in my off time when we were in hiatus, we did the pilot.  But I didn't do the series because that was the year that they offered me a chance to be a producer on 'Rockford' ['The Rockford Files'], and I didn't--and I'm the associate producer.  But it was that time Cannell--Bellisario started in the business.  He had been an ad agency exec; came in the business and did the series of 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' with Cannell doing both 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' and 'Rockford.' So that's why we--Bellisario and I met.  In '82 [1982] when I was free, I'd been, I'd been out of work for about six months, the only time I'd ever been out of work was that period between 'Bret Maverick' and--and they needed somebody to work with Bellisario because he was a new producer, he'd created 'Magnum' ['Magnum, P.I.'] and he remembered me.  And Selleck had done two episodes of 'The Rockford Files' and remembered me.  So, and I was the only person on 'The Rockford Files' team that was available.  David Chase was off doing something else, my friend Juanita Bartlett, Cannell was doing his own thing then, he was doing the '[The] A-Team,' or whatever.  And Anita [Rosenberg] was not available.  So, Bellisario said, "Come to work for me."  And I came to work for him.  Quickly, I'll just tell you this, went to work--I was going to work in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]  They sent me to Hawaii three weeks after I was on the show ['Magnum, P.I.'].  The producer in Hawaii quit while I was there in 1982 and they said, "Would you stay until we get somebody," and of course the rest is history.
Speaker 1: The rest is history.
Speaker 2: I was there for the remainder of the show.
Story_ID: 300456
Speaker 1: Things are looking up for you; you're at the right place, at the right time.  Let's--we, we were talking about 'Magnum, P.I.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they asked you to stay on until somebody else could come on?
Speaker 2: Right, and, and, and nobody else showed up on the horizon, but in the meantime, I was able to go into that situation and, and one of the things that's always been said about me in terms of the industry is, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles F. Johnson] is a great diplomat."  And there were some (unclear) kind of things going on, warfare going on in the show.  And I sort of came in and helped to, to cool the waters.  And I think that's why they asked me to stay.  But I was petrified because I had been a producer for a few years, but mostly on the Universal [Universal Studios; Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, California] lot.  In a situation where I was in town--with a cot- with a coterie, or congeries of producers who were all around me--and suddenly I was put into Hawaii, where you were the only producer who was running the show, dealing with all the actors, dealing with the local crews, and having to produce on-location shows.  I had never done it.  I had no experience doing it.  It wasn't like I got there and had training before.  It was like you're there.
Speaker 1: But your instincts were good.
Speaker 2: But my instincts were good.  My instincts were good and, and I, I, I think I always knew you had to just, when you're thrown in those situations, you know, you just had to go do it.  And, and I was able, and I was always good at dealing with people. And I--of course we had Tom Selleck and Roger [E.] Mosley and Larry Manetti and John Hillerman and I, so I had to work with them.  And I had to work with the local crew.  But I think, you know, a lot of the Hawaiians liked me also because I was an African American. They thought they could relate to me.  And I went to the local, local, the local customs, customs and did the local things with the local people because you had to forge that with the community because the show was a very big draw in Honolulu [Hawaii]--because it was, you know, it was, the show was big at the time.  Tom was almost the biggest television star for a couple of years in the '80s [1980s].  And you've--that red Ferrari driving around Honolulu.  So you had to also do a lot of community, community relations and, and, I did all of those things, both with the show and then ran the show and very successfully, I must say, we were nominated three times for the Emmy [Award]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --didn't win for that show.  We were nominated three times as best drama.  And I learned as much as I was, I think good for the show.  I also learned an enormous amount because suddenly I was learning to produce something on my own.  We shot in London [England], and did a two hour show in London, which I had to go to London and casting and find your crew and put it together and shoot the show. And then the next year I went to Hong Kong to scout the show and we were going to shoot in Hong Kong and at the last minute cost didn't do it.  But I, I learned a lot about how to put location shows together and how to go and put, organize that and, and so that was all enormously of value to me.  In the meantime also turning out 162 episodes of it, of a series that was--it ran for eight years.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So it was a great learning experience for me as well--
Story_ID: 300457
Speaker 1: And people don't think of this, they think an executive producer, all he has to do is show up on the lot and do his executive business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Business--
Speaker 1: --but you, you are putting another face to it and that is, the work you had to do in the community--
Speaker 2: In the community--
Speaker 1: --and most of the crew were native--
Speaker 2: were native Hawaiians--
Speaker 1: --Hawaiians, yeah--
Speaker 2: --they, they were natives.  We brought over some of the key people from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], your DP [director of photography], sometimes your head wardrobe person, but the majority of your crew was local.  And, so you had to deal with that in terms of dealing with the community as well and becoming a part of the community. And because the show ['Magnum, P.I.'] was so popular, you know, if I were going places with Selleck [Tom Selleck], I got to be known as much as he did in many ways. But there's also, people--I don't like to tell people what I do because most people don't know what producers do and you go to some social event and, "What do you do," well, it can take forever.  I'd rather say I work at Lockheed (laughter), you know, but there is the--and I learned to be a line producer first, in which you have to learn to do, to deal with budgets--and putting--getting your budgets and then learning to cast and do your wardrobe, your props, heading all your departments and you don't know as much as your production designer and your wardrobe head, but you know enough about what they do and you have to have a certain amount of taste, and a perception of what the overall picture is to get a cohesive whole, whole and in television we started--when I started out, we would do an episode very six days.  Now we do one every eight or nine days because television has gotten a lot more complicated to do--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but you do the process that you do on a feature, you do the same process every six, or eight, or nine days.  You, you know, you get a budget, you find locations, you cast it, you get, you get your script in order, you know, you make a board and you got to shoot it.  And then you're also doing in television, you're doing, if your doing--and I sometimes, I was doing two shows at a time, but sometimes you're doing, you have two in post, one that's shooting and one or, in development in terms of prepping and then all the other stuff that you're, because you've got to go, you're doing twenty-two, twenty-four a year.
Speaker 1: So if there's any weak link in that chain of crew, crew members--
Speaker 2: You're only as good as your crew.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You're only as good as your crew.  I mean, I mean, I think that's true in most things we do in life.  You're only as good as the team that supports you.  And, whether it's politics (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: --or whether it's producing, or whether it's whatever you're doing and so, you have to learn to pick people who--and I've done that a lot.  As I go along I've found people who that are--have the same work ethic--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and the same style I do and you try to bring them along--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then later on work with you so that you know, the, the product gets better because you've got them.  But if there's any weak link sometimes you have to let that weak link go.  That's always hard to do--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --but you learn that's in the process that you know, if you have a weak link in a certain department you may, as much as you may like that employee--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you have to make a change or your product isn't as good in that area.
Story_ID: 300458
Speaker 1: --I want to go down to something that I know you're going to be a little bit embarrassed about this, but I'm going to go there anyway and that is you perhaps, have been more supportive of getting African Americans into the business.  You wanted the best out there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so you included in that pool of people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --African Americans.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't know how you can be an African American in any business and not try to bring that--people along who are talented who have not had a chance and especially in the entertainment industry where it's hard to crack, get in for anybody. Now you, you add the burden of color, so it was always important to me to be able to, even if I couldn't do any more than meet with young people, and talk to them, and make an open door policy, call me, and I'll, I'll give you my advice.  And I've had many a young person that I thought I had no impact on who would--I was just recently, did a seminar for the Black Hollywood Education And Resource Center [BHERC, Los Angeles, California], and two hundred and some people showed up and I thought they'd have ten.  And people started getting up and saying, you know, Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker Charles F. Johnson] did so and so and he, he let me call him and I talked and I went on--things that I had forgotten.  But, I also had people like Brock Peters, who was one of my dearest, dearest friends and Brock Peters and Dee Dee Peters [Dolores Daniels Peters], their first thought was always help and bring along.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Their house as you know, was a house where it was, if there was anything like the old salons in the old days--early days of the black Harlem Renaissance, it was their house out here.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So they, they, they--my wife Anne [Anne Burford Johnson] and I were friends of theirs and brought us along.  And so, Brock would have things like Communications Bridge [Communications Bridge Institute]. We started the Media Forum.  And it was always our desire to be able to always give back.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that's been a hallmark of what I've done.  And, and I to this day still try to do it when I can bring in--and I've only done--not only do it behind the camera, but when I can, in front of the camera. And it's been a tougher job for me in front of the camera because oftentimes I'm working on cop shows or, you know, detective shows, with white leads.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, yeah it isn't always as easy to, to, in that format to bring in--and it wasn't like I was doing 'Girlfriends' or, you know, 'Martin' or something.  But even so, and of course with 'JAG,' I was able to do a lot of that because the [U.S.] military has a lot of us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you know, I, but I, it, I just felt that it was a duty and I felt it was the only thing you could do.  And somebody helped me along the way.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And so many people forget that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you have not.  I want to just--
Speaker 2: I've not forgotten that, no.
Speaker 1: --to say that.
Story_ID: 300459
Speaker 1: The other thing is the relationship you've developed with Tom Selleck--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that was a direct result I guess of--
Speaker 2: Well, that was a direct result of 'Magnum' ['Magnum, P.I.'] and I think because I remained friends with Garner [James Garner] all those years, Selleck was the same way.  We started working together and we did six years on 'Magnum' and then he wanted me to come and form a company with him.  So in 1988 when 'Magnum' ended, we formed a company called TWS Productions--which is actually his initials--with another partner of mine, Chris Abbott, a woman who was a writer and the three of us formed a company in '88 [1988] and stayed together.  We stayed together until '92 [1992] and Tom and I have remained friends all our--since 1980, '82 [1982].  Well, I knew Tom in '78 [1978], but we really became solidified in '82 [1982], which is twenty-three years ago.  And we spent a lot of time together in Hawaii, when we'd go to Europe and when he would do things, when we had our company he would be, he was starring in movies then, and wherever he'd be shooting, sometimes we'd have to go and talk about the company, so I'd go to Australia, I'd go to London [England], and whatever, and then we'd socialize together.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, we, we produced three or four movies a week for Universal [Universal Studios; Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, California].  We did two pilots that didn't go to, go to series and we did a mini-series for them and then we did a series with Burt Reynolds, that company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1988 we did a series called 'B.L. Stryker'--and was done with a series of about sixteen movies that we did over two years with Burt Reynolds and [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Rita Moreno and Tom was the executive producer and Burt Reynolds, Chris Abbott and I were the co-execs.  And we did that in Florida. And that was the company--it was one of the things the company did.  And then in '92 [1992] I was asked to go and do a series back with Bellisario [Donald P. Bellisario]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --called 'Quantum Leap' and they were in their last year and they needed somebody to come in who knew how to work with Bellisario.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was doing some other things and they needed some help, and I went on that for, for its last year and that's how I started back with Don.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: And Selleck and I still remain friends although we haven't worked together.  He's actually asked me a couple of times, but fortunately I've been busy (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 2: That's good.
Speaker 1: And that's very, very good.
Story_ID: 300460
Speaker 1: We have to mention that 'JAG' has run for how many years?
Speaker 2: Ten.
Speaker 1: Ten years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ten years--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you, you were very much involved with Bellisario [Donald P. Bellisario].
Speaker 2: Very much, and that was actually after I left [Tom] Selleck and, and we did the 'B.L. Stryker' thing with Burt [Reynolds] and [HistoryMaker] Ossie [Davis] and I did 'Quantum' ['Quantum Leap'] with Bellisario, I did, then went to do those 'Rockford' ['The Rockford Files'] movies.  We did those 'Rockford' movies.  It took us two years to do them because Garner [James Garner] did some other things, but I was on payroll the whole time, it was, that was for Universal [Universal Studios; Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, California] still.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And when 'JAG' started as a pilot they called me because Bellisario and I had worked six years on 'Magnum' ['Magnum, P.I.'] and one year on 'Quantum Leap.'  Although I didn't work closely with Bellisario in--on 'Magnum' directly because he was out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I was in Hawaii, but we were in the same thing.  So when they asked me to do the pilot of 'JAG' and I was doing movies and I couldn't leave Garner--because he had, he had asked me first and in '96 [1996] when the series had gotten cancelled, 'JAG' had done one year on NBC and gotten cancelled--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and Leslie Moonves picked it up in his first year at CBS, and they then asked me to come over and do the second year of the series.  I was still finishing up two of the 'Rockford' movies so, there was a time when I was starting the, the 'JAG' series in 1995, I think it was, and finishing up the, the 'Rockford' movies and about that year I did both of them.  I finished the movies up and then went on to the series.  And then of course, stayed with the series from 1995 until 2005.
Speaker 1: Wow!  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you are perhaps working on a project that has been dear to your heart for most of your career and let's talk a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I've been working on the Tuskegee Airmen and I've been working on it for almost seventeen years, not steadily, but it's been a seventeen year period since the first phone call came to work on that project and I'll just briefly go back when we talked about the fact that my father [Orange Johnson, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --met the Tuskegee Airmen and knew of them in World War II [WWII] and sort of got inspired to fly with them as you, as you've heard, or fly, fly because, because of them, I'd forgotten about them until someone gave me a book and I realized they weren't in our history books--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I thought this is a story that needs to be told because pilots in general were the elitist group and now you have black pilots in 1940, black pilots who they didn't want to be black pilots; nobody wanted them to fly.  There was a 1925 [U.S.] Army report that said blacks didn't have the brainpower.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then in '41 [1941] there's still the [U.S.] military thought, was in the [U.S.] Army Air Corps, was that they didn't have the ability to be pilots.  And so this is a story--talk about achieving over, over obstacles--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --against all odds, so I was excited.  And so in '88 [1988] the phone call came, I was finishing up 'Magnum, P.I.' and I was in, in Washington, D.C. where we did the last 'Magnum' and the phone call came that George Lucas was on the phone and wanted to talk to me about a project.  I went, "Surely not I, I don't--why is he calling me."  And then I said, "Well, can you tell me what the project is that Mr. Lucas wants to talk about?"  And they said, "No, but he doesn't want to talk on the phone, but you can come to the ranch--."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: "--and when you get to the ranch he'll tell you."  So I went to the ranch about three months after we talked because I was still finishing up 'Magnum.'  And when he told me what the project was, I was just dumbfounded, because you talk about life bringing you full circle.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Story_ID: 300461
Speaker 1: These are the men [Tuskegee Airmen] my father [Orange Johnson, Jr.] told me about, and someone wants to do a movie, but not just someone, George Lucas wants to do a movie about them.  So you know that there was going to be an ability for someone to have the clout to get it done and the ability also to find--to do it with enough money and resources to make a good movie.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I started on an odyssey in '88 [1988] with Thomas Carter, who was going to be the director at that time and then Kevin Rodney Sullivan who'd just did 'Guess Who' and 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back,' who wrote the first script--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the three of us were going to be the three-production team with George on the project.  We got about four different drafts of the script but never could find a draft that we liked--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I was still working in television as was Thomas and Kevin.  And we would go to the ranch every six months when a new draft would come out and talk about it then the writer would go back and that's how we did it until 1995 when Bob Cooper, who is with HBO, had talked to Frank Price --
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Frank Price had the Ivan Dixon script that would, that would--that Bob Williams wrote and had been floating around for years, and many people, as you know, you know that Ivan wanted to do it but, [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks wanted to do it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so many people wanted to do this story.  And I, I think there was even a time when they started a story, a movie about it with Billy Dee Williams, I think, I understood, they started and they ran out of money so it never got done.  So it was, it was in--it was always cooking in the background.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, little short one, when, when they said that HBO said, "Do you want to do it with us?" they asked George and he said, "No, you know, I really want to do a big screen feature.  Do the HBO movie and I'll come back to it later."  And then of course, 'Star Wars' happened--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the prequels, and he started that in '94 [1994] and that took him until 2005, until the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one that just came out this year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But I got a call in last May when 'Star Wars' was, was going into theaters and he said, "Guess what I want to do when I grow up?" and I said, "What's that, George?  You're already grown up."  He said, "No, I want to do 'Red Tails.'"  So I couldn't believe that it was sixteen or so years later; he was coming back to it, but projects can have, you know, take that long to gestate.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Seventeen years and twenty years is a long time, but some--there have been some that have gone that long. And so the project is restarted and I just recently met again with George and some of the pilots and some of the crews from the, the, the Tuskegee Airmen and it looks like it's back on the books.  And I, I can't--because I always wanted to do a movie.  I've done television for thirty-four years and, and been very successful at it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but to do a movie--if you asked me if I wanted 'Friday The 13th, Part Nine,' I would say, "No, I'm not interested." But a movie that is a movie about our history and doing it with an organization like the Lucas organization [Lucasfilm Ltd.]--
Speaker 2: Which you know is going to be quality (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) quality, is a dream come true, so I'm so excited and so I--but mostly I'm happy because the airmen story will get a wider knowledge to more people, to our young people.  And these were incredible and are incredible men who I'm in awe of.
Speaker 2: And it's a history that, black and white, they all need to know.
Speaker 1: They all need to know.  It's, it's, it's our history, it's, it's not just black history, it's our history.  They were, in fact they had a--the history of our country is interwoven with their struggle to be pilots and their time in, in North Africa and Italy.  And they protected the bomber pilots who were white--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and never lost it and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And never lost a plane.
Speaker 1: --never lost a plane.  And their stories, I'm--their stories in terms of how they were accepted by the white bomber pilots are amazing; some didn't accept them; but some felt that they saved their lives.  And they've had men come up to them at airshows and said, you know, "If it were not for you, the Red Tails, I wouldn't be here today."
Speaker 2: That's a very special story and I'm--I should add in here for the record, that you came back from that meeting with George Lucas to be with us--
Speaker 1: To be with you today--
Speaker 2: --for this HistoryMaker [The HistoryMakers] interview.
Story_ID: 300462
Speaker 1: I want to ask whether you feel we've left out anything that we need to cover?
Speaker 2: Only one thing, and that is that I was very fortunate in 1978 to meet a wonderful woman--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --who is--been my partner in life for twenty, let me get this right now, twenty--twenty-five years. And we met in 1978 and she was working for the [National] Urban League, and I went to speak at an Urban League convention.  And I happened to see her across the room and I said to a young lady I was with, "Who's that woman across the room?"  And she said, "It's Anne Carter [Anne Burford Johnson]."  And I met Anne in '78 [1978] and we became friends, fast friends, almost immediately. I, I took her to lunch to a restaurant, the Universal Coliseum [ph.], but Anne was never impressed very, very much with that; and we started talking in '78 [1978] and she had a daughter, our lovely, my stepdaughter, Kristen Carter [ph.], who's now married and a lawyer--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in, in Santa Cruz [California], and Anne was one of those people I could just get on the phone and talk to for hours and I'm not a person who likes to talk on the phone that much.  I later found out that my wife is so good she can talk to anybody for hours (laughter).  I thought I was special. But she's been my partner for, since we met.  We got married in '83 [1983].  So we've been married twenty-two years. And we've been together, well, I'd say twenty-five or twenty-seven years and she has been so supportive.  She was working initially in the industry, as you know, and doing things, and then she's done a lot of community stuff since then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She's been so good at my side.  She, she's my greatest champion. And she's an amazing woman because she is well-liked the community in general, both the black community and the white community--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and she just recently, with Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and Rita [Hurricane Rita] happening, went to Washington, D.C. and worked coordinating voluntary, voluntary relief for the, the states that were affected and, and works with the [American] Red Cross, but she works with a lot of organizations, as you well know and so, I'm very proud of her and my stepdaughter, and very happy to have made a life with her and very fortunate to have had that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I agree with everything that you've said that she is a wonderful, wonderful (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know her well.
Story_ID: 300463
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be if you could write your own legacy?
Speaker 2: Do you know I've been reading Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], about people who are now writing their own obits [obituaries], they have them.  I'm not interested in that (laughter) at all.  You know, I, I've never thought about that.  I'll tell you a quick story though.  When I was an actor, trying to be an actor, I did a play in Washington, D.C. and then repeated it out here.  A play by Lorraine Hansberry--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it's called 'The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window'--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and Lorraine wrote it after 'A Raisin in the Sun' and it was a very wonderful play.  It wasn't a black play. It was really about her radical years in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] and all the characters she met. But there's a character in the play, played (unclear) on Broadway by Rita Moreno and she is, was, was married to kind of a radical and she wanted to be an actress and she--he said, "You know, you're a has been and now you're going to be a never was," and he said, "Why do you want to be an actress?" And she said, "Sidney, when I die," I always remembered this line, "I want more than ten or a hundred people to know I lived."  And I think that's what drove me--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --from growing up as a child in a small town [Middletown, Delaware], in a small state--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and going to those movie screens where the, those people, black people are on the screens and it drove me to go, I, I, I don't want a life here.  I wanted something bigger than that.  And of course, it may have been in a way, the Hollywood dream, but it was a desire to, to have an impact and a greater life than living in a small town environment, not that there was anything wrong with that, millions of Americans do that.  But then there are those of us who feel like we want to connect more --
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and have a larger impact.  So I think for me it was a desire to have some desire of maybe fame--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but some desire to also have a larger connection to connecting with a larger community that we have.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so I think that my legacy would be most of all--and but, my motto has been never to change in terms of no matter how much you achieve, or what you do, my motto has always remain the same and to be a friend to man.  And to, to not be a respecter [ph.] of people just because of their money or their class.  So I'm as nice to, and the same person I am to the craft service--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in, in my productions as I am to the exec producer who's the creator of the show.  I treat no, no, none of them any differently, know you sometimes have to act differently to them--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --perhaps, you know, indifference to certain people, but I, I, I think that if you talk to people who know me, they will always tell you that Charles Johnson [HistoryMaker Charles F. Johnson] is a person who seems to always remember where he came from and to treat people equally.  And, so I think my legacy would be that I, I, I want to be a friend to man and I always want to be known as someone who was--never forgot from where he, from whence he came.
Speaker 1: And I assure you your legacy will, will be well, well protected and it's already there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you.
Story_ID: 300464
Speaker 1: After thirty-four years in the entertainment business, both, mostly television, and being concerned about images, African American images in television, and I got the chance of course, in my age range, to meet a lot of the actors and producers and writers who came along, so in 1978, [HistoryMaker] Denise Nicholas and [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, Brock Peters, Ivan Dixon, Terry Carter, Lonne Elder and Anne Johnson [Anne Burford Johnson], Anne, who was Anne Carter then, we all formed this group called the Media Forum, and we brought people in to be--to do seminars and to speak to people and to always protect the images.  We'd go and, when there was 'Beulah Land' controversy, we'd work with (unclear), with Saundra Sharp [HistoryMaker S. Pearl Sharp] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so that was always my thing and, so--and then working in television and, and reading actors and hiring actors and hiring producers and hiring crew and being--realizing always how hard it is to get in the system, I decided I had to do a book that was on the African American image.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And of course being this child who was interested in communications, I wanted to look at it decade by decade and how we started in the '40s [1940s] with television and we didn't know anything about being behind the TV screens, but we were employed to run the camera, but not always in the way we wanted it to be.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there was--there, so I look, I tried looking at television in terms of how 'Beulah' and 'Amos and Andy' ['Amos 'n' Andy'] and on and on and then into the '60s [1960s] with Cosby [Bill Cosby] and Diahann [HistoryMaker Diahann Carroll] and then into the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] and so I was looking at decades.  So I started to put the book together.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's called--my working title is called 'Color Correction.'
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is an industry term, but it also has a double meaning--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --because of all the ideas of all the years about diversity.  And so its very hard because I don't get a lot of time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but I've started to write the book and I've started actually in those early days in Middletown [Delaware] when my mother [Bertha Seagers Johnson] and father [Orange Johnson, Jr.], and all the else they did, had a soda shop--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the on--in 1949 the only television--you were asking about memories that came back to me.  The only television on our street was the television in the soda shop.  And when Joe Louis would fight--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the soda shop would be full with people because they had watched it in my family's soda shop.  And I remember that and I remember--I, I have a book that called, that's called 'Turn on Your Television, There's a Black Person on Channel Four' [ph.] because in the, in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] when Pearlie Mae [Pearl Bailey] was on 'Toast of the Town,' the, it's party lines would ring, or the, or the tenement windows would up and say, "Pearl Bailey--Pearlie Mae's on 'Ed Sullivan' ['The Ed Sullivan Show']."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I used all of that in bringing us up-to-date in terms of--and to how we weren't behind the cameras, and then we eventually started to learn, up until maybe in the '80s [1980s] when BET [Black Entertainment Television] started with Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] when the ownership started to come in and all of that.  And I take it all the way--I want to take it all the way up until the current day from my perspective.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I don't want to make it a book just on academia because that, then I, I'm like--[HistoryMaker] Donald Bogle has written a wonderful book called 'Primetime Blues[: African Americans on Network Television].'  But I don't think most people know it's there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and academics maybe know it, but its--but I want a, I want a book that's relatable from a person who has lived it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that will, that will be in schools, but also people will want to read and look at to learn that history.
Speaker 2: Well, I wish you success.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Sorely needed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and reserve my copy because--
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 2: --I'll start saving up for it now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: The--I, I was trying to think of if there's anything I have left out.  I don't think I've left out anything--
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: --and, so I want to thank you very, very much for granting us this time.
Speaker 1: And I thank you for offering me the opportunity.  A lot of things came out for me in this and I didn't know how it was going to go--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but I thought it was amazing for me, it's been.
Speaker 2: And, and it was amazing for me--
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: --this journey, this morning.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
