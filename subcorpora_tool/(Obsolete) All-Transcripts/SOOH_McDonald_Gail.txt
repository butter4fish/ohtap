 Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Today is Thursday, April 14, 2011. I am in Oklahoma City interviewing  Gail McDonald. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh from the Oklahoma State  University Library. We are here speaking as part of the Spotlighting  Oklahoma oral history series, specifically related to Angie Debo. As  we   ve already discussed, I have a couple of questions that I wanted to  ask you. If you could, tell me a little bit about your background up until  the time you came to Oklahoma and how you came to be a member of  the Oklahoma Civil Liberties Union.  Well, I went to college in Mississippi and then in Texas. My parents  were both from Fort Worth, Texas, and so I was in Mississippi in college  in    62 through    64, when the Civil Rights workers were killed. I was just  very upset by the whole thing and wanted to leave. I spent a junior year  abroad, and then I transferred to Texas Christian University (TCU) in  Fort Worth, where my grandmother lived and where I had gotten a few  hours in summer school, giving my parents some hope that I might  indeed graduate sometime. (Laughs)  I graduated from TCU, and then I spent the next year getting my  master   s in history, in American history, there, then sort of moved up I-  35 to teach at Cooke County Junior College. I was there two years while  my husband finished his PhD, and then he took his first job at Oklahoma  State University. I taught for a year at Langston University, and then  when I had my daughter, I stopped teaching for a semester or two. Then  I taught at Oklahoma State part-time in the Humanities Department for  several years.  What kind of classes did you teach in the Humanities Department?  Humanities in those days was just a general world history, intellectual  history course, and everyone had to take it. It was an eight-hour course,  so I would have them Monday, Wednesday, Friday for the history part,  5  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  and then on Tuesday and Thursday they   d do art and music. It was a  wonderful interdisciplinary course. It was a delight to teach. I always  loved it because in history I had gotten into so much minutiae in    my  period.    (Laughs) So I really enjoyed teaching humanities and just kind  of going back and learning and reading through things thoroughly that  you would study in a liberal arts program like I had been in.  Sure, and sort of setting a broad picture for these students.  Yes. I had wonderful students, and we loved Stillwater. I joined the  ACLU, largely at the invitation of Gloria Valencia-Weber, who was  very active, and that   s how I met Angie. She was on the board, and the  three of us would drive together to Oklahoma City to board meetings. I  must   ve been twenty-six. I had a new baby, and I think I made my own  clothes. We didn   t have much money. I remember thinking that having  lunch in Oklahoma City, of course, was a big outing. That probably only  occurred every two or three months. It wasn   t very often. But, anyway,  we would go, and we would have the most delightful time talking with  Angie and hearing about her work. She was so well-read. She really  challenged you to think about things and to be invested intellectually in  issues. She was just a delight. I, of course, was very amazed by her. As I  say, I was very young, and I just didn   t understand why she wasn   t rich.  (Laughs) I can remember thinking that if you published a book and had  done all this wonderful work, why weren   t you better set up? But that  was nothing that ever seemed to pass her thought process. She was  always just satisfied and delightful and invested.  Many years later, I had done a project with the League of Women  Voters on prison reform and visited all the prisons in Oklahoma. I was  writing with another woman about the prisons, but the League of  Women Voters felt that we were sort of taking too strong a position, so  they weren   t going to publish the article. We   d done a lot of research, so  ACLU wanted to publish it, trends in prison reform and what would be  more enlightened treatment of prisoners, particularly women. The article  just became kind of a mess. It was just too much research and too much  of this and that. We asked Angie if she would look at it and give us some  sense of where we ought to go next because we needed to cut it back and  do a number of things, and she did. I mean, I think it was just amazing.  For a long time, I remember her letter because she talked about   she  was so positive. We were just   I don   t know what we were. We were  not the most remarkable writers, I think, (Laughs) but she was so  encouraging that we stuck with it, and ACLU did publish it.  Well, I   ve heard that frequently about her, that she was incredibly  generous with her time, especially on editorial types of tasks, that she  never gave anything a half-hearted reading, that she was very focused,  6  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  and that her comments were usually right on target.  Well, that   s right. It was just amazing to me that she would spend that  time on it because, as I say, it was two of us. It was a collaboration, and  we had fallen in love with the subject and, indeed, both written too  much.  Right, and it   s such a complicated issue, too.  Yes, it was complicated.  And it still is. (Laughter) We still need help in that area.  We do. We do. (Laughter) But the article, as I say, did emerge, and I  really attribute that to her.  Well, good. So did you all go out to Marshall and pick Angie up and  then head to Oklahoma City?  Gloria must   ve done that because I don   t remember ever going to  Marshall. I remember meeting up with them somewhere, and then we   d  all go together. I think there were probably more of us. I   m wondering if  Earl  Mitchell  was on the board then, if he went with us. I don   t  remember. I remember more the women who were involved. Then,  Steven Jones was our general counsel in those early years. We always  had a lot going on. It was very exciting, in terms of the issues that we   d  discuss.  Now, I know that Angie left the Oklahoma chapter of the ACLU. Had she  left while you were still involved with that?  No, I moved away, and in 1974 I went to work for David Boren in  Oklahoma City when he became governor, and so I could no longer  participate. She must   ve left after that. I don   t know the details of why  she left or any of that part, really.  Okay. What were your impressions of her contributions to your  discussion at these ACLU meetings?  Just that she took the material so seriously, and she really read things  thoroughly. She would always come at it different ways, trying to  promote a really thorough discussion. That was very impressive to me  that she, again, gave it so much time. I think she loved the breadth of it,  being involved in the breadth of it. I really do. I don   t think she  considered it sort of drudgery or asking too much or whatever. I think  she was just so able that she really loved the challenge of new material  7  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  and varied issues.  Well, I heard that she went out and made a lot of presentations on behalf  of the   not necessarily on behalf of the ACLU, but that when there  would be debates, especially on the Vietnam War, that she frequently  volunteered to go and to represent the ACLU. Were you involved with  them at the time that that was going on, that you would   ve heard about  how her presentations were received?  I was not.  Okay.  I   m sure we asked her to go a lot because she was our real ace,  intellectually, and an author and all of that. ACLU was kind of a pariah  organization. Not just anybody would   ve belonged. There was a lot of  conservative resentment about it and a lot of whispering about  communism and things, so it took a lot of guts for her to do that. I   m  sure we were just thrilled that she would go out and represent ACLU and  give it that wonderful, knowledgeable treatment in a debate, but I was  not there. I really was not there in those heavy Vietnam years. I was  teaching. I was still teaching in Gainesville, Texas.  Yes, the stories about her are somewhat legendary, this seemingly frail  woman that would show up when they were sort of expecting a long-haired  hippie that didn   t know what they were talking about, and she  was so well-informed and usually would just leave the debate, clearly  having gotten the best of anyone. (Laughter)  Oh, I   m sure. I   m sure they were just baffled beyond words. (Laughter)  Yes, I just would love to have seen that.  Well, and I would have, too. (Laughs)  Yes, I think it   s too bad that we didn   t have the technology then to be  able to easily capture something like that because it would   ve been  remarkable.  Right, exactly.  So you went to work for David Boren. You said that was in 1974?  Right, right.  Okay. The documentary project really didn   t get geared up until about  8  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  1983.  Right.  How did you learn about the project, and what was your involvement  with it?  Well, I left David, and he went to the Senate, and I stayed in Oklahoma  and worked for Norma Eagleton in Oklahoma City. I had been divorced,  and so I remarried, and my husband and I went to Washington in    82  because he took an appointment at the Federal Election Commission. I  had always stayed in touch with Gloria and Bob Weber and Bernice and  Earl  Mitchell , so I kind of kept up with it that way. When I worked for  David, I had been on the Oklahoma Humanities Council, and we had  given money early on, and then it just never quite got finished. So I  knew a lot of the players. When I was in Washington, I got to know  Barbara Abrash, who had come into it and who, in my view, in the end,  saved it because she persuaded a director at  WGBH  in Boston to make  the final cut and pull something together that we could use for the  American Experience. So I just kind of fell into it.  But because I was in Washington, we thought we had sort of run out of  sources of funding in Oklahoma. It had cost a lot more than any of us  had ever thought it would, and it wasn   t finished. Then, as I say, Barbara  had this vision of forty thousand more and we could do something.  (Laughs) I was working for the oil and gas industry in those days, and  we had some members who were active in Oklahoma. I just went around  and sort of peddled the goods and showed a clip until I found someone  who was willing to make the donation. That was Ray Ivy   s company. I  have got to get the name of that company because in the interim years,  they   ve gone out of business, so it   s not on my tongue the way it was  years ago. But they generously sponsored the closing, the last of it, and I  think they gave, in the end, about forty-two thousand dollars to finish it.  That   s terrific. That was like a miracle, I think.  We thought it was. We really did  (Laughs) We kept holding our breath.  Then we had a wonderful opening for it in Washington.  Well, tell me about that.  Oh, it was wonderful. Well, Gloria and Bob came up, of course, from  Stillwater. Angie had died earlier in the year, but she knew we were  finishing it, and that was so encouraging. She had written me a  wonderful little note, like she would, about finishing it and how pleased  she was. So they came up. It was Consolidated Natural Gas. This was  9  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  basically Consolidated Natural Gas    evening. They put it on at the  Women   s History Museum. We previewed it, and we showed it to  people from the Oklahoma State Society, of course, and others who  might be interested. It was just a lovely evening. It was really just  wonderful. David and Molly Boren were so impressed with it and  thrilled. Everybody was. I mean, it was just a high point, and I think  Gloria and I had thought it just might never come. We weren   t quite able  to grasp it. We just kept moving along. (Laughs)  It must   ve been like this huge sigh of relief.  Well, it was, but it was funny. There was all kinds of intrigue because so  many people had contributed to the film that nothing is ever done quite  right. One of the directors was not happy with how she was treated, that  she was not given enough credit for the work, and that kind of thing. By  that time, it had just become a committee project, and so by the time  you   ve, again, finished reading, everybody was involved. It was a long  thing, (Laughs) so anybody who felt they were the superstar of it was  sort of feeling regretful. We did the best we could, is all I can say, and it  was just a lovely evening. People loved the film and really talked about  it for years afterwards. I always felt like it was my claim to fame in  Washington because I worked for this not-for-profit oil and gas group.  We didn   t take any positions, and we didn   t do anything  political , and  all this. (Laughs) I thought raising the money on intrinsic value was a  hard go, but it was perfect. It worked out. Because it was about Angie   s  life, it was so rich and such a wonderful project in the end. The oil and  gas company was pleased, and, of course, all the other donors were  thrilled, too.  Good. So did you watch it when it debuted on public television?  Oh, absolutely, yes, yes. We all were mad for that, of course. We should  have gone up and sent that  WGBH  woman more than we did. I   m sure  we didn   t do enough for her, speaking of people who didn   t get enough  credit.  It was Judy Crichton that was the woman.  Yes, yes.  Was she at the event in Washington?  She did not come to the event in Washington.  Okay. I just never knew whether she was there or not.  10  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  She was not there. Barbara Abrash was there.  Was Martha Sandlin there?  Martha Sandlin was there. Martha, of course, knew a lot of the people,  so that was nice. I don   t know how Barbara worked it out, but she did.  She was a miracle worker, and I hope you   ll interview her.  I actually have.  Oh, good  Good.  Yes, she came out for the statue dedication in November.  Oh, wonderful  Oh, of course she would.  Right, and in 2004, the OSU Library was designated as a National  Literary Landmark because of the Angie Debo papers. Barbara had  come out then, and I had spent quite a bit of time with her then.  Oh, how wonderful.  She   s great. She was fun to get to know. (Laughs)  She really is. Is she still in New York?  She is.  Oh, good. Good.  Yes, she keeps asking me when my next trip to New York is so that we  can get together, and I fully intend to take her up on that. (Laughs)  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.  Yes, she   s still busy doing interesting projects. Because you   ve had such  an interesting career, I wanted to interview you, obviously, about how  you became involved with the Angie Debo documentary, but I was also  really interested in how your own career took off after you left  Oklahoma, if you could just tell me a little bit about that.  Well, as I say, my husband had a presidential appointment, and we went  to DC in    82. I worked for the Gas Research Institute, basically, and  literally got to see the country by resorts, going to commissioners     professional meetings because I was liaison to the state commissioners.  It was the intrinsic value issue, too. It was R and D  Research and  11  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Development  for the public good and for the future, a surcharge we  were trying to get into various rate cases, and then I worked the rate  cases. I did that for about ten years. Then, as I say, I was just very  fortunate in that Oklahomans like Henry Bellmon and Rick Shelby  really worked and pushed me to take a position in George Bush Sr.   s  administration on one of the regulatory commissions that needed  Democrats. They really supported me, and I was just very fortunate to  succeed in that.  I was appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission  ICC  in 1990  and served there for five years. It was kind of a sad time at the ICC  because both parties were committed to shutting the agency down. It  was an old agency, and there were lots of old laws that it administered. It  was kind of a cleanup time. When Bill Clinton became president, he  could name the chair without Senate confirmation, so he then named me  as chairman, and I served for two years in that capacity. The decisions  were sort of grim and grimmer because you were shutting it down, and  yet at the same time you were trying to handle the legislation  responsibly. Then we had a big document of transferring the powers to  other agencies so the regulatory functions that were still law would not  be lost.  That must   ve been an incredibly interesting and challenging time. I  mean, it   s easy to   or I shouldn   t say it   s easy. It seems like it would be  easier to manage an entity that has a clear, positive path forward than  to manage one that    (Laughs)  Oh, it was, yes. Right, right.  One  that   s going down the tubes. And you  had all these very strange days when you   d be called up by somebody  from the historical preservation area who would say,    Well, it   s time to  paint the building, and you need to be picking the colors and doing this  and doing that.    I was going crazy. Then you would have these fights  with them about,    Well, we   re using the colors from George  Washington   s time, and this that and the other.    It was a huge building  with very high ceilings, and those colors just really wouldn   t do. I was  sabotaging the process by saying,    Add more white. We   ve got to be  able to see. It   s dangerous to be in these halls with these stark colors.     All of that was just odd make-work that only in the federal government  would you be called on to do, but you still had to do it. I mean, you still  felt obligated to do your best, so it was a very strange time.  It was the time of deregulation and all this talk about how the market  could just take over, and then we   d have these huge rate cases and these  mergers of the major railroads that were coming together. Clearly, the  market was taking a pass there, so there was a lot of really hard work to  do. It was interesting. I loved it. It was challenging, but I was sorry. I felt  12  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  like we had   the agency when I started had about 800 people left, and  we did mainly rail and trucking work. We cut it down to about 350  people, and I felt at that point it was really a good, trim agency that  could   ve contributed. Still, as I say, the political will just wasn   t there.  They had decided to get rid of it, so it was gone. I left a year before they  closed the doors, and I was really kind of grateful for that. (Laughs)  What did you do after you left the ICC?  I was the administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development  Corporation, which was a delightful economic development job up in the  Rust Belt. The Saint Lawrence Seaway is what we call the Fourth  Seacoast. It   s a cut through the Saint Lawrence River, and it was like a  TVA  Tennessee Valley Authority  project. I mean, it was a big natural  resource change. The idea was, of course, to open up a gateway for all of  those ports to get out to the Atlantic Ocean. It never worked, really, as  they had planned because it was a nightmare. I mean, the rock that they  had to blast through in the Saint Lawrence River was just so resistant,  and the political tides were against them from the beginning. The  railroads lobbied to have it built just the size of the Welland Canal, an  existing cut through.  By the time it was finished in 1959   and it was a joint Canadian/US  project. By the time is was finished, the channel was too narrow for the  ships that were being built. So it became a channel of shipping that  helped, particularly, places like Duluth, where you could bring in steel,  or junk steel, even, scrap metal, and then you could take a back haul  of  grain  out because it was such an expensive set of locks that the fees  were high. You couldn   t just make it with what you brought in and sold.  You had to have a crop going out or some other cargo that you could  sell, but for Duluth, it provided about a fourth of their traffic, which was  very important and still is. There were thirteen other ports along the  way, and they were all in Rust Belt cities that needed help. We worked  at publicizing them and marketing the seaway. It was a nice group of  people. It was located at Massena, New York. People might say  Massena was the end of the world. It was very close. It was way up   I  mean, you literally would fly into Montreal and drive down because it  was just so far up there.  Okay. So is that where you were based out of for this particular     Well, no. I was actually a modal administrator in the Department of  Transportation, so I had a Washington office, but I spent about every  other week in Massena. It needed a lot of hand-holding. There were a lot  of local events and things that were just delightful. The people were  nice, and these were poor counties of, like, twelve thousand people.  13  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  They were dairy farmers along the Saint Lawrence River. It was in New  York State where they had these wonderful universities and things. It  was always interesting to meet the people, and the communities were  nice, but they were very small and fairly poor.  So were you the commissioner for three years?  No, I was the administrator, which was wonderful. After having been on  a contentious commission for five years where five of us followed each  other all the time and you had all these different ideas, suddenly to be in  charge was wonderful. I was there three years.  Three years, okay.  Yes, and I took trade missions abroad, which was wonderful work. I  liked it a lot.  I   m sure it was fascinating.  It was delightful with the port directors. We had good relationships with  the delegations in each state. It was just getting to know that part of the  country and then to work with Canada on, particularly, environmental  issues. Water levels, particularly, were big, the invasive species and the  other problems we faced in the Great Lakes. That was wonderful. I got  to go to Canada a lot and work on that.  This entire time, your husband was still with the Federal Election  Commission?  Yes, right.  Then, after you left that, what did you do?  I did some consulting work and found that I was not very good at it. I  was not. I think after you   re in Washington for a while, you think you  can consult. I   m not a good person to be looking to the next project. I  sort of get involved in whatever I   m involved in, and that takes all my  energy. I did that for about eighteen months, and then I went back to  work for the Federal Railroad Administration through a year or two of  the Clinton administration. Then the Clinton administration named me  National Ombudsman at the Small Business Administration. That was a  good job in that you represented small business. I went around the  country holding hearings on what business people really needed.  One of the things, for example, I thought they needed is they needed  timely advice. They didn   t always have the money to get a law firm or  14  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  an accounting firm to help them, so we tried to set up a phone bank  where they could get advice. We were so strapped in the federal  government, we never staffed it very well, which was just mortifying to  me because mainly what small-business people want is what   s specific  to them and what   s blocking their way. They   re not really interested in  policy issues and so forth, so that was kind of a failure. The  Administration ended in a year, so that was sort of the end of my  Washington work. Then Parris Glendening appointed me to the  Maryland Public Service Commission, and for the next three and a half  years I was a state utilities regulator.  Did you travel all over the state in that capacity?  Yes, I did. Yes, we had hearings and spent a lot of time in western  Maryland, which was, to me, a beautiful area.  Yes, it is.  Yes, I really enjoyed that. I loved it. It was interesting to go to Annapolis  and to work with the state general assembly again. It was really nice. I  think we were just all stunned suddenly, when the Democrats were  tossed out. We had a Republican governor. It had been forty years in  Maryland since they had had a Republican in the state house, so that was  kind of a shock to all of us. (Laughter)  It was a shock to all of us Maryland Democrats living outside of  Maryland. (Laughs)  Oh, I bet. (Laughter)  You don   t pay super close attention, and then all of a sudden you think,     Oh, my gosh  How did that happen?     Sure, yes. And you always think,    Oh, we should   ve worked harder,  spent more money, worked harder.    (Laughter)  Since you left that position, have you been retired since then, or have  you done other things?  No, we came to North Carolina not long after that, and I worked for the  State Ports Authority. I did their federal relations work for a while in  North Carolina. I went back and forth to Washington and did their  federal relations. They were trying to get dredging money to do a new  channel to Wilmington to improve their shipping.  Okay, I was going to ask you if that was the area.  15  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  Yes, it was shipping, and I did that for about fourteen months. Didn   t  like it as well as I had thought I would. In the meantime, Danny retired,  and Governor  Mike  Easley appointed him to the Industrial  Commission in North Carolina, which is the worker   s comp  administrative law body. Then I got a job at the Department of  Commerce. Because I had been National Ombudsman, they wanted a  state ombudsman for small business, so they made me State  Ombudsman. Suddenly, the world was great because they already had a  fabulous call center that was  staffed fully .  Oh, so you didn   t have to start from scratch.  Yes, I didn   t start from scratch. I wasn   t even in charge of the call  center, which was heavenly. I just sort of worked alongside it. That   s  where you could send most of your people because they wanted to know  the specifics about filing and doing things like that and wanted to know  about permits and various technical things that had to do with their  individual business. I really enjoyed the ombudsman work in North  Carolina, and I did that for five years until I retired last month.  Oh, last month? Okay. (Laughter)  Yes, I kept it for a long time because, in the first place, I didn   t know the  state so well, so I was pretty busy.  And did you, again, travel all over the state of North Carolina     Yes, oh, yes.     which is a gorgeous state.  It is a beautiful state and very different from place to place, a lot like  Oklahoma really in the sense that agriculture is the major economic  engine of the state. Then there   s just a lot of rural poverty, and there  have been big changes. They lost tobacco, and they lost the furniture  industry, two international markets. It   s been a retooling, so a lot of  these small cities really do need to promote entrepreneurship and to  make things helpful for small business. But that was great. Working with  those civic leaders and things was a lot of fun.  I hadn   t planned to ask you this, but I think one of the things that strikes  me about you is not   I mean, to have had this variety of jobs, you   re  obviously a very intelligent person, but what do you think are the skill  sets that you either had or developed that made you successful in what  you did?  16  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  I think it was the interest in people. I think every place I went, I realized  I didn   t know enough about it. I wasn   t a lawyer, and yet I was at the  ICC. I always found people to work with and always benefitted greatly  from their experience and learned to catch up. As I say, I think I just  enjoyed it so much when I was   you always think,    What do you miss  when you   re out of a job or out of a certain title?    What I missed was  just the variety of the work and the interest in the fact that it mattered. It  was pretty hard for me in the last five years to be in kind of a midlevel  job and push myself up because once you   re not the head of an agency,  nobody cares so much about briefing you and having you up to speed.  (Laughs) Suddenly, I was on my own with the computer.  Doing your own briefings, huh? (Laughter)  Doing my own briefings, exactly, and driving around and making my  own observations, (Laughs) but I enjoyed that, too. That was a lot of  variety. I think people laugh and say,    Well, aren   t you ever going to  retire?    and I ask them,    Well, it took me a long time to learn how to do  this job. I don   t think I   m going to leave right away.    (Laughs)  Right.  I did enjoy it. I always thought that was something Angie gave us, the  kind of young women who were in that ACLU group, is she gave us a  sense that you could do it, and nobody else was doing that. You were  going to meetings where women wouldn   t even be called on to speak. I  mean, people would get up and just talk endlessly about some school  board issue or something, and nobody else would be even called upon.  The League of Women Voters wouldn   t consider that important even  though we were doing our studies and working hard to be well informed.  A lot of time we were just kind of dissed in meetings and community  things that we worked on. Angie never took any of that to heart. She just  plugged ahead, and I think that really impressed us and made a strong  impression on all of us. We thought maybe we could have careers, too, if  we just really buckle under and try to fulfill our responsibilities.  Right. Well, I wondered, thinking about what you had done, and starting  out by telling me you rode to these meetings with her, and you were  twenty-six years old, and thinking how talking to somebody like Angie  Debo and seeing the way that she went about doing things. To me, that  seems like that would sort of be a pivotal type of experience to give you  the confidence that you could be somebody like that that made a  difference.  Yes. Oh, sure it did. Yes, it really did. Absolutely, and she thought we  17  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  were interesting and worth talking to. As I say, women weren   t being  sought out a lot in those days, (Laughs) so it was wonderful. To see what  she did over the long run and how she had this vision of herself, it was  just remarkable.  Is there anything that you wish that I had asked you about her or about  yourself that we didn   t cover?  Well, I was sort of interested in what you thought about   I always felt  that Angie was overlooked and didn   t get to do international affairs and  didn   t get to have a faculty position. What always struck me is she  wasn   t bitter about that.  Yes, I think that   s really amazing that she was able to just sort of brush  that aside and had that laser focus on.    This is what I want to do, and  I   m not going to let these other things get in the way.    I mean, I think  that   s one of the things that   s remarkable about the story on the  documentary is that it tells those two parallel stories, not only about  trying-to-right-a-wrong story, but also the fact that in her own life there  was this wrong that was going on. Yet I think she also made decisions  that when she had an opportunity to take, like, for example, at Oklahoma  State, when it was A M, I think that there were sort of two options  presented to her, and the option of working in the library and having the  time to do the research in the end appealed to her so much more  because she knew that   I mean, that   s what she was really passionate  about was the research. She still was able to engage with students.  Yes, that   s a good point.  Yes, but it is difficult to imagine now, somebody with that kind of mind  just having to struggle so hard.  And those credentials. It   s just wonderful output, the accomplishments.  Right. I mean, she operated as this independent scholar without all of  the advantages of having a community around you that provided you  feedback and that kind of thing. She was able to operate at this  incredibly high level. It does make you wonder. Could she have done  even more, had she had that opportunity? Would there be more  historians that were doing the same kind of really great work that she set  the standard for, had she had an opportunity to mentor more people?  We   ll never know that.  No, we won   t, but, as I say, she was never bitter.  Right.  18  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  McDonald  Paustenbaugh  I think I would   ve been. (Laughter) Don   t you?  Yes.  I think if I   d had to live out in the country and drive in to work     Just sort of eke out this existence, yes.  It   s hard. Yes, I just see her life as being very hard, but maybe it  sharpened her focus. I guess we have to assume that   s true.  Well, she never seemed to hold any grudges, either, which also seems to  be the other part of human nature that she defied.  And then the documentary, the emphasis on how she just held firm. She  was one of the few people they couldn   t take something from.  (Laughter) That   s an irony, I think, of history, really, that it fell to her to  tell the story and then to stick by it.  Right. And even to realize,    This isn   t the story I wanted to tell. This is  the story that   s there, so I have to tell it.     Sure.  It is really remarkable. Well, I   m so glad that you were there to make the  documentary possible, to bring it home at the end.  Oh, such an exciting thing. It was exciting for me, but, as I say, not  always. It was sort of an up-and-down thing. I wasn   t sure we were  going to do it, but Gloria Valencia-Weber can inspire you. (Laughs)  Yes, she certainly can.  She has a laser focus and a vision, too.  Yes, she   s very much like Angie in that way.  She is. She was very highly influenced by Angie, certainly. (Laughs)  Yes, definitely. Okay, well, thank you so much. I really appreciate you  taking the time to meet with me.  Oh, I   m delighted.  It was a delight to meet you in person.  19  McDonald Oh, it   s such fun to talk about this and to remember all those good  things.  -------  -------
