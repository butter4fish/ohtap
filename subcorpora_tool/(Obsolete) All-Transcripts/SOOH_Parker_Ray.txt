 Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Today is October 4, 2010. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, and I   m with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library, and  with me today is Ray Parker, referred to often as Mr. 4-H. Mr. Parker  began working in Cooperative Extension in 1951 as an assistant county  agent, and in 1957 was promoted to State 4-H Specialist. He retired in  1982, and in 2006 he was inducted in the National 4-H Hall of Fame.  Thank you for joining me today and having me in your home, Mr.  Parker. I   d like to get started by having you tell me a little bit about  where you grew up and your early life.  Okay. I grew up mainly in southeast Oklahoma. We were farmers, and  we moved around in various places. In my early age, we lived up in  McClain County. I was a 4-H member in French School, and that was  back in 1928-29. Then from there we moved down to the Stratford  community, and we lived there until I graduated from high school. Then  I wandered up here to Oklahoma A M in 1938 to start my college  work. So, that   s about the brief history of how I got to where I am now.  When you were at Oklahoma A M, what did you study?  I was in Agronomy. They changed the name to Natural Resources and  Conservation or something now. It was Crops and Fields, or Field Crops  and Soils back in those days.  What motivated you to come to Oklahoma A M?  Well, I was pretty active in vocational agriculture when I was in high  school, and FFA, and I was impressed with my teacher, and he had gone  to school here. He encouraged me to come up, and thanks to one of  those early Roosevelt programs, the National Youth Administration, we  called NYA, that got me started, paid me fifteen dollars a month. We  lived in some old abandoned CCC barracks. For fifteen dollars we got  5  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  room and board, so things were pretty tight in those days. I think I had  two shirts and one pair of pants.  Did you have a job on campus?  Yes. The assignment to work in the Documents department of the OSU  Library. That was Oklahoma A M Library in those days. So, at least I  was working inside, and I did quite a bit of extra work around the  campus, watering the flowers and keeping flowerbeds, just to make  some extra money so I   d have a little bit to spend.  Before you went to college, had you ever come to Oklahoma A M for 4-  H Roundup?  I came to Oklahoma A M in 1936 as an FFA member, and that was my  first exposure to Oklahoma A M. I was impressed with it.  Okay. So, you never went to Roundup as a youth?  No. I went to the county fair and gave demonstrations, but wasn   t good  enough to come to Roundup. My sister did.  When you would go around to the county fairs and do demonstrations,  what would you demonstrate?  Well, my friend and I did a demonstration   my main project was  chickens, and we did a demonstration on mixing feeds, proper feeds, for  the chickens so they   d lay more eggs. And then we did one  demonstration on making rope from binder twine, and that was quite an  experience. (Laughter)  Why is that?  Well, you kind of take what you get, and we had twine all over the  place. We had some kind of machine that we worked to wind it around  it. We finally wound up   I don   t know whether the rope held or not.  (Laughter)  What got you interested in chickens?  Well, back in those years, that was one of our main sources of food and  profit. We   d raise chickens and sell eggs. Then, of course every Sunday,  we   d have fried chicken if the preacher was there. So, that was a large  part of our living in those days.  Do you have a good trick when it comes to slaughtering the chicken?  6  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Everybody seems to do it differently. How did you do it?  I didn   t know any tricks. I just fed them and hoped they   d grow.  After you graduated from Oklahoma A M what happened? What did  you do?  Well, of course, I should   ve graduated in 1942, but World War II came  along. The draft board called me up, but I had a hernia and they rejected  me. They said,    We need somebody that can go right now.    That was in  February 1942, and I finished that semester. Then, I had an uncle and a  cousin who were working in the shipyard out in California, and I  decided,    Well, I can make some effort for the war.    So, I went out to  Oakland, California, and worked in one of Henry Kaiser   s shipyards for  four years, from    42 to    46. Then, I came back and reenrolled and  finished my degree in 1947. And after that, I got a job up at Billings,  Oklahoma, teaching veteran farmers. We called that the Veterans  Agricultural Training Program. I was there from 1947 to    51, and then I  moved over to Enid as assistant county agent.  What were some of the things you were teaching the veteran farmers?  Well, of course the main benefit, I needed a job and they needed the  money, so I think they were getting around  100 a month, and I think I  had thirty-five young veterans in my class. Just the whole gamut of how  to, perhaps, use better varieties of wheat, use a little fertilizer, upgrade  their livestock by using a certified registered bull, and just various things  to improve their farming techniques. It was kind of interesting that while  in Billings, I became reacquainted with Henry Bellmon who had been a  classmate back prior to World War II. That was his home community  and he was trying to get started in farming at the time. So, we became  reacquainted. I was quite surprised when he got into politics and did  quite well in politics as governor and senator.  He always said he was just a simple farmer.  (Laughs) That   s right. He was. A smart one.  Oh, yes.  Yes, he was at the head of the class. I was toward the foot. (Laughter)  So you went to Enid, and what were some of your job duties in Enid?  Well, the primary job was taking care of the 4-H Club program. Of  course, there was a county agent, and we had what we called a home  7  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  demonstration agent, and an assistant. So, there were four of us in the  county office. The assistant home demonstration agent and I spent a lot  of time making club meetings. Back in those days we were pretty well  involved in the schools, so every month we would go to a school, to a  club at a school, and give some kind of a demonstration, whatever was  current. Like, in the spring, we   d give a demonstration on gardening, do  something with livestock and that sort of thing. So, that was my major  responsibility, was working in the 4-H Club. I was fortunate in that they  already had a real strong 4-H Club program going, so I kind of worked  into it, and that   s where I learned 4-H. Even though I   d been a member  for a short time, I didn   t really know the inner workings of it until I got  to Garfield County and they taught me all I knew.  What was that experience like for you, working in the schools and  throughout Garfield County?  It seems that I   ve always been attracted to young people, and then the  school clubs, there was usually a teacher that was assigned as a leader in  that club, and we would work through them. We would go out and do  our thing and give some a lesson. So, we did that pretty well throughout  the year until summertime, and then we got involved in 4-H camps and  did quite a bit of project work in those days while the kids were out of  school.  Was it hard to keep up with the trends in agriculture? 4-H has totally  expanded. Was it hard to keep up?  It really hadn   t started expanding at that time. It was really up into the     60s when it really started expanding and getting into the communities,  doing more community things, which was a very good thing.  After Enid, where did you go?  In 1956, I was appointed county agent in Ellis County. Arnett   s the  county seat out right on the Texas line. And, of course, I had the total  responsibility of agriculture and 4-H, along with the home economist.  There was just two of us in that office.  A lot of work.  A lot of work. A lot of getting acquainted with a lot of people. Then,  doing adult work, which I hadn   t done in, well, I hadn   t done a lot of  adult work since my days of teaching veterans over at Billings. So, I had  to get reacquainted. At that time, there were thirty-five Grade-A dairies  in Ellis County, so I had to learn about dairy in a hurry because that was  the major enterprise. Then, of course, wheat farming, livestock farming  8  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  and that sort of thing.  So, when you had to hurry up and learn something, what did you do?  Well, I studied quite a bit and observed quite a bit. I think I learned more  from my people than they learned from me, but they were very generous  and very helpful. They just helped. I could go out and observe and ask  questions, and they tolerated me until I learned a few things.  You talked about how your role shifted from working a lot with the kids  to working more with adults. At that point, what did you prefer doing  more?  I guess I was still oriented to the young folks because it kind of carried  over from Garfield County to Ellis County and got involved, and we  made a few improvements there. At least, we got a few more kids  involved, and so they were very cooperative and very appreciative of the  help. I guess I   ve always kind of had a weakness for young folks.  Tell me what happened after that. Where did you go from there?  Well, I was there just about twenty months, not quite two years. That  was in 1956 and 1957, and then I was appointed, I think they called it  assistant state 4-H leader or something, in the state 4-H department. And  I   m sure it was because of my experience in Garfield County, and they  thought I might have had something to do with the good program there,  but at least I was exposed to it. Anyhow, Ira Holler was the state 4-H  leader at that time, and he came out to Ellis County to visit   I thought  he was coming out to visit. He was really checking me out. (Laughs)  Shortly after that, I got a call, and I was appointed to a state 4-H  department, so I moved to Stillwater in July of 1957.  What were some of your new roles going to be now, working with the  state 4-H office?  Well, I kind of jumped into the fire because shortly after I arrived in  July, they went to 4-H camp over at Osage Hills State Park. For a week,  they had the junior members, and that was really an opportunity to get  acquainted with lots of kids. And then when the younger ones went  home, the older ones came. There was one lady who was state 4-H  secretary, and a few had been state winners. So, I got acquainted with  the older ones that way. That was really a godsend, I think, because I  was able to get acquainted with a lot of people in a hurry. And then after  that, I kind of got into the routine, shortly after that. The Sooner State  Dairy Show was in Enid at that time. That was in August. So, I got  acquainted with a lot of the dairy people around the state.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  And then, of course, along came the state fairs, and we had some  responsibilities. There were just four of us in the state 4-H department at  that time. First we went to Oklahoma City, and went through the State  Fair there. At that time we had what we called fair schools. Counties  would bring, I believe it consisted of five boys and five girls, and they   d  go through various judging events and various activities and leadership  seminars and so on. And then in between, at that time, there was a  Muskogee State Fair. They called it the Free State Fair. The lady  assistant 4-H leader and I went to Muskogee and kind of handled that,  and after that came the Tulsa State Fair. So, after that was Thanksgiving  and Christmas, so (laughs) I got my baptism by fire in all those things.  Business picked up in a hurry.  What did you like most about your new job?  I guess the association with the people. I worked with some of the  greatest people in the world, the parents and the leaders and the young  folks, and just seeing it develop and grow. Back in that time, we had in  our speech program what we called Timely Topics, and the young folks  would come up and do their first speech before a crowd, and they   d  stammer around. It was real gratifying to see them as they   d grow up  and advance and improve and become real contributors. So that, I think,  was the most satisfying thing.  As time went on, you were deeply involved with Roundup. Could you talk  a little bit about that?  Roundup, of course, that was the big thing. The planning and making  arrangements for all the space, and it was my job to get the keys to the  various rooms so people could get in. But, of course, the Roundup then,  I don   t know exactly what all is involved now, but it was mainly  demonstrations and speeches. Kids would be in various subject matter  areas. They would be carrying all kinds of equipment around, and that  was a major part. Then, in the evening, we had a fellow from Michigan  State University that was a 4-H recreations fellow. His name was Arden  Peterson, and he would come down to conduct song leading, and he  would do the song leading at our various assemblies and so on. So, it  was a matter of kind of putting all the pieces together, getting it  organized, being sure that everything ran smoothly. It was a physical  hassle. I was completely worn out when it was all over. (Laughter)  I bet. It seems like a big undertaking today. I can   t imagine how much  work goes into it.  They at least have a little more help than we had then because they have  several people in the state 4-H department. And, of course, I guess we  10  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  learn from the previous generation. They   ve kind of taken what we did  and improved on it quite a bit. It   s vastly improved and expanding and, I  would say, much better now because they reach more people with more  meaningful programs. So they   re doing a very good job.  I   ll tell you, I speak to a lot of alumni and they say one of the reasons  they went to Oklahoma A M or Oklahoma State was because of  Roundup. It was their first exposure to the school, to the university, and  that was a big impact on their lives.  Yes. It was a real recruiting tool, so many of them wound up here and  that   s true. Of course, for many years the state FFA convention was held  here on campus. So, that exposed more young people to Oklahoma  A M, which is now Oklahoma State. So, both were real good recruiting  tools. I remember Dr. Willham was president during most of that time,  and he would say,    This is the best recruiting tool that we have.    So, it   s  worked out well for everybody.  Throughout your years in the state office and even before that, do you  have some key highlights of your time working in the field?  Yes. Well, I think the association with the young folks, and of course  working at the state level, you kind of get the top level because they   ve  already come through the county ranks and the district ranks and so on.  So, these are pretty outstanding young folks when they get here. It   s  been real gratifying to see them develop and grow. And then, of course,  when they get on out into professional life, many of them have been  quite successful, some in politics, some in business, some in farming.  But, hopefully their 4-H experience will have helped them to get to  where they are in their life experiences today.  What characteristics do you think were needed to help get people  moving? We hear a lot of    Ray Parker     he was always getting people  moving.     I remember a remark that one leader out of Okeene, Oklahoma made.  We were having a leader training meeting out there one winter day, and  this lady   they were asking,    How do you get people interested?    She  said,    You   ve got to love the kids.    And I guess that was a kind of a key  ingredient. You   ve got to enjoy them and love them and appreciate them  and try to set a pattern of some kind. Help them to set a goal to work  toward. I think that was one of the most gratifying things is to see them  come on and develop into contributing citizens.  When you were a county agent, did you have a tool of the trade? Did  you carry anything with you that you considered important tools?  11  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  I don   t recall any particular tools. Just being interested in helping them  achieve their goals was about the only tool, I think, and just be there and  hopefully be an example.  Probably the same in the state office.  Yes, right.  Talk to me a little bit about the importance of leading the 4-H youth  recreational activities.  Of course, young folks enjoy activity. One time I heard about a  recreation training meeting down in Texas. They called it the Longhorn  Recreational Laboratory. I went down there, and they were teaching the  broad spectrum of leisure education. Singing and, of course, in the  evening, doing the recreation kinds of things, but crafts, and informal  dramatics and that sort of thing. I thought that might be a good thing for  Oklahoma, so Dr. Pete Williams, a state leader at that time, I came back  and talked to him about doing something like that in Oklahoma. So, we  organized what we called leisure education labs, leisure labs, and we  would go from one district to the other. For instance, one  year  we   d be  out northwest, next year we   d be southeast, next we would be southwest,  northeast. So we, I think, earned the reputation of being a playboy at the  time, (laughter) but we tried to introduce them to the broad scope of  leisure education.  And, of course, in the evenings we   d do, I called them circle mixers. It  was a good way to get a lot of kids involved. I think they called it square  dancing, but it wasn   t square dancing. It was just circle mixer kinds of  things, and a lot of them remember that because the things that you  enjoy, you remember. I still get calls,    How do you do this? How do you  do that?    Even at the Green Tie Gala that they had back in November, I  guess, they had me doing one of those little things. (Laughs) They were  nice to me. Let me show my stuff. (Laughter) Anyhow, it was a lot of  fun, and I think it attracted them because once you get their attention,  you can kind of shoot some other things through them, get them  involved in other things. So, this has happened in many cases.  Were there any songs associated with these events?  Well, of course, we changed the lyrics from    I   m looking over a four-leaf  clover.    We said,    I   m looking over a 4-H clover.    One for head,  one for health, one for hands, that sort of thing. So, we kind of  paraphrased that, but otherwise, you   re getting them, get the adrenaline  flowing, get them perked up a little bit.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Are you quite the dancer?  Not really. (Laughter) I was only over at the microphone, telling the  other ones how to do it.  How would you do it? If you were on the microphone, what would you  tell them to do?  I had to demonstrate quite a bit, like    Put your little foot out.    I had to  demonstrate. It usually wound up with couples, and they   d go around  and around, in certain activities, variations that they   d go through from  time to time.  So, you   re like the caller.  Like the caller, yes.  Would you do a little calling for me?  (Laughs) Well, for instance, we did this to the tune of    Oh, Johnny.     Like,    Oh, Johnny, oh, Johnny.    But the call was,    You all join hands  and circle the ring. / You stop where you are, give your honey a swing. /  Swing that little girl behind you. / Now, swing her on, if she held on   and leave her alone, go back and swing your own  / It   s allemande left  with your corner girl, and do-si-do your own. / Now you all promenade  with that sweet corner maid, / singing    Oh, Johnny, oh, Johnny, oh.        Then you do it all over again. That   s one of the most popular. And kind  of an interesting thing was a young fellow, he was a 4-H member down  at Perkins, and he became a county agent down at Texas. Then he retired  and came back home, and in the meantime, he learned to play the guitar.  So, he was with a group that entertains old folks around. One time, I was  in a group and they were playing, and he said,    Hey, there   s one thing  that I want to do.    And he got this other one. So, he went through this  whole    Oh, Johnny    thing. So, he had learned it way back there, and of  course he used it in Texas, and he came back and still knew it. Kind of  interesting.  Oh, yes.  What goes around comes around.  Definitely. Was it hard to get the kids interested in this type of  programming, different types of programming?  No, it seemed like they kind of bought into it, and once they did, they   d  go back home and tell their friends about it. We did this for, I guess, four  13  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  or five years. I don   t remember how long, but they like activities. And,  you know, with the young folks, anything with a beat to it, anything  musical, they   ll buy into it real easy. That   s not quite all I did back  before we got so heavily involved in that recreation thing. There were  only four of us in the state department. No district 4-H agents, so we  traveled the state quite a bit. We had what we called a personality  improvement program. The 4-H member will fill out a workbook, and  they   d be evaluated. Then we   d have district meetings, and they   d do  their speeches and so on. Southwestern Bell sponsored that in those  days, and that was one pretty popular thing. And various things,  whatever came up, we did it.  There were only four of you in the office? That   s a lot of work to do.  A lot of work to do. We put lots of miles on those old cars. (Laughs)  Wow. So, you   ve been from one end of the state to the other.  Very much so. (Laughter) Back in the summertime, I went to a lot of  county 4-H camps, and one time, I think I was out at Guymon in the  northwest district. Now, that   s the day before air conditioning in cars.  And two days later I had to be in Idabel, well, at Broken Bow, down  there. That   s a long way from Guymon to Idabel, but I remember that as  a long, long, hot, dry   I think I was able to stop at home and get a new  set of clothes and go on in the next day. So, that was about the worst I  was ever in, I think.  Why was it important to travel around the state?  Well, I think mainly contact and to let people know that the people in the  state office were interested in what they were doing, and we wanted to  encourage them all we could. So, exposure was pretty good. Now, the  district 4-H agents have more opportunity or more responsibility in that  area, I think. So, Charles Cox and his group kind of supervise the whole  thing, but as I mentioned, they   re doing a very good job, getting more  people involved.  During your time at the state 4-H office, did you have one activity that  you always looked forward to the most?  Well, I guess Roundup was the big thing because you get lots of kids  involved and they   d all come to campus. At least we didn   t have to go  out; they   d come here. And I guess that   s about the major thing.  Was your wife involved with extension at any     14  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Actually, very little. She was a teacher. She was a converted home ec  teacher. In middle school, they needed a science teacher, and she had  more science on her transcript than anybody else, so they assigned her as  a science  teacher . So, she developed a program in earth science, and  she spent most of her time in school. You know, our kids were more  involved in Scouts and that sort of thing. They were in 4-H but not  heavily into it. Somehow we kind of had the idea that, well, if they  accomplish anything, that   s because their dad was in 4-H, and we kind  of shied away from that. We got them involved in other things, but  they   ve kind of got over that stigma. I see here in Payne County, Dea  Rash   s kids are heavily involved in 4-H and around the state. Many of  the 4-H kids are involved in 4-H, and that   s a good thing. If it   s good for  somebody else   s kids, it   s good for yours.  Why is 4-H still very important today, especially in Oklahoma?  I think it goes back to the roots, way back when it started down in  Tishomingo in 1909, I guess. Of course, it involved the farm people  mainly because that was the way most people made their living. So, it   s  kind of evolved, and they   ve kind of transferred those methods to others  into various other areas like rocketry and all that sort of thing. So, the  principle is about the same. It   s a teaching thing, and you kind of work  on kids    interests and try to devise things that will attract their interest so  that they would get involved in them. I think that   s the main thing.  In 2006, you were inducted into the National 4-H Hall of Fame. How did  that come about?  Well, that was a big surprise. I think that, well, maybe when David  Sorrell was in the state 4-H office, he was director of the 4-H  Foundation for a while, and he kind of broached the subject. Then Jim  Rutledge came along and pursued it. I guess they got enough  information together that somebody was impressed. I don   t know. It was  a big surprise to me because I thought I was just doing my job. Wasn   t  seeking any honor. I guess recognition   s always nice, but like I told  someone, you can   t put it on a piece of bread and eat it, it   s just nice to  have. (Laughter) So, I   m in pretty good company with Pete Williams  and Mary Sue Sanders and Wallace Smith, and I guess those are the  major ones from here. They   ve all done well.  You have too. Speaking of the kids, can you talk a little bit about your  involvement in developing scholarships?  Well, back when I first started, we had several national sponsors that  sponsored the national scholarships, and then of course we had some in  Oklahoma, too, like Southwestern Bell in Oklahoma was a good  15  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  sponsor, C. R. Anthony, that   s not in business anymore, Shawnee Mills,  in Shawnee, they   ve been sponsors for a long time, and Evergreen Mills  down in Ada was sponsors for a while. I guess we   ve been able to  impress some people that we   re doing some good, and they kind of join  in and help us do it. So now, of course with Cathy Shuffield in it, it   s  really kind of expanded tremendously, and she   s spending full time and  a lot of time developing new sponsors and so on. Since we don   t have  that whole bunch of national sponsors anymore, she   s been able to pick  up the slack here in Oklahoma and in other places with other businesses  and has done a good job.  Do you ever hear from any of the 4-Hers that you   ve touched through  the years?  Oh, yes. There was, I guess here a while back, Cathy put together a letter  concerning 4-H, and asked me if I   d sign it, which I did. As a result of  that, I had a letter from a lady that lived down in Texas. She was a 4-H  member down in Bryan County, and she remembers her 4-H experience.  And then a young lady up at Jett, Oklahoma, wrote and said she  remembers those leisure labs. Said,    I still have the books, and I still use  them.    She   s a 4-H leader up there; still uses some of those things. And,  of course, Larry Brooks was a 4-H member down at Oklahoma County.  He   s the associate district judge in this district. He   s down at Guthrie  now. And then there   s a young lady that lives here who was a 4-H  member down at Edmond. They just pop up everywhere. (Laughs)  One of the most gratifying things, I think, is a young fellow from  Sallisaw. He was a member of a club down there. He came to Roundup  and was involved, and he never did win a national scholarship or  anything, but he was always here and involved. He came to Oklahoma  A M, well I guess Oklahoma State, and got a degree in journalism, and  he was also in the Army and stayed in the Army Reserve. He has a  printing business here in Stillwater now. But he was also a major general  in the Army, so he   s kind of come along. I have to salute him. (Laughs) I  told him,    You may be pretty important to Uncle Sam, but you   re still  just a little old kid from Sallisaw to me.    That   s kind of a gratifying  thing to see them come along and do things.  It must be very rewarding.  Yes, it is. It really is. Many of them have been quite successful. In fact,  several years ago, Mike Synar from Muskogee was a representative in  the national congress, and unfortunately he passed away too early. But  there   s one. Then we have people who are bankers and various other  things, so it   s been very gratifying to see them develop and make a  contribution.  16  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  I read somewhere that you would see off the train when the kids would  go off to national?  (Laughs) Oh, yes.  Tell me about that.  Oh, yes. Well, I was either on it or seeing it off. (Laughs) Of course,  national congress was the big thing. We still had lots of national  sponsors in those days. We   d go down to Oklahoma City and board the  Santa Fe; they called it the Texas Chief. We   d have about fifty 4-H  members in that. And, of course, we had the two Pullman cars, and that  was an experience. Ira Holler developed that. The state 4-H conference  preceded Thanksgiving, and that wasn   t a very good thing for parents  because that was family time. Anyhow, he thought they should be able  to get acquainted before they got on the train, which they did. They got  on the train and overnight, and the Texas bunch was already on the train.  And we would go up into Kansas and pick up the Kansas bunch, so there  were three delegations of 4-H members in national congress on that  train, and they   d do a little interaction. That was their first experience on  a Pullman train. That was my first experience on a Pullman train, too.  So, we would alternate. Two of us would go one year, two the next year.  So, I guess I went about eight or ten times. That was quite an experience  for an old farm boy from Oklahoma, going to Chicago.  What would take place at national?  Well, mainly it was just recognition for the people that were designated  as national winners. General Motors would put on a big banquet.  Firestone would put on a big banquet. Santa Fe had their group, and  various others. I don   t recall who sponsored the speech program, but the  national sponsors would always have banquet dinners for these kids.  They didn   t have a lot of competition going on. It was mainly just  recognition for what they had done. And one of the real, real nice things  was that the Oklahoma Publishing Company would provide a hospitality  room, and Russell Pierson was the WKY farm reporter in those days.  Well, he and his wife would go up and play host. They all had gone  ahead and had the hospitality room all ready when the delegation got  there. So, they got in. They always had refreshments and a place for  them to go relax and just hang out.  Then a little later, Wayne Lyles, who had been a former county agent,  was the farm reporter for Channel 9, and he came up and established a  hospitality room. So, there was a little competition between the two. We  had to kind of walk a thin line there. (Laughter) It was mainly  recognition for the kids who had done great things back in their own  17  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  states, and they thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was probably quite an experience for them because that was probably  the first time they were out of the state.  Yes, right, right, and certainly the first time they   d been on a train. And  one kind of interesting thing is that I think in 1993, about that time,  Lucia Miller from up in Buffalo in Harper County was Miss Oklahoma.  She was our state 4-H song leader, and she became Miss Oklahoma, and  of course Miss America was always a guest at national congress. I   ve  forgotten who sponsored her, but she was always a guest. Wayne Lyles  had invited Lucia to go along with him to be the hostess in the Channel 9  hospitality room. So, when Miss America was finished with her  appearance and coming out, I   d arranged for Lucia to be right where she  was, and here when Miss America came out, well they recognized each  other. There was kind of a love affair between those two, Miss  Oklahoma and Miss America. That was kind of interesting.  Wow. You probably have all kinds of great stories.  Oh, yes. (Laughs) Lots of things happened.  What are some of your favorite stories, throughout your entire career?  Oh, golly. (Laughs)  I know you have a few in there.  Favorite stories. Oh, it   s hard to select just one. I guess being at national  congress for all these super achievers, that might   ve been the crowning  thing of everything because it was very enjoyable for all of us. Of  course, I got lots of free meals out of that deal. It   s kind of interesting at  national congress one time, Glenn Selk, who has been on the animal  science staff here, he was a 4-H delegate from Indiana, I believe. I think  a national entomology winner. And for some reason, he and I were at the  table at one of the functions and got acquainted, and then I saw him  several more times. Then, of course, he came down here, kind of  reestablished and married an Oklahoma girl. So, that was kind of an  interesting thing. Just things like that that just happened, just happened,  were always very memorable.  What   s special about Oklahoma for you?  Well, this is home. I grew up down in southeast Oklahoma, and it   s  home. And of course, all the people, my friends, people I know are  pretty well Oklahoma. It   s just kind of been home, the kind of place to  18  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  come home to. Those four years I spent out in California in the shipyard,  I always looked forward to coming back. I wanted to finish my degree,  and then working in Oklahoma, it   s just been special. And I think it   s a  special kind of people. We   re kind of in the middle; we don   t have too  much extreme. Just solid, down to earth people, and the kind I like, and  the kind that   s made the state what it is. So, I guess it   s home, and that   s  what I like about it.  What do you see for the future of 4-H?  I see good things because I think they   re keeping track with the trends,  you know. Things come and go, and things become popular and become  more important. Back when I was working, we had secretaries that took  shorthand, and then we had a mimeograph department. They ran all this,  all things    Well now, everything   s computer. You punch a button and  it happens. So, that   s one thing, and they   ve kept track with those things.  Of course, with the advancement and things, they   ve tried to keep pace,  and I think they   re doing a very good job of keeping pace. And keeping  the benefit of the boys and girls uppermost at all times, but trying to  keep them in touch with what   s going on and trying to teach them some  values that will stand them in good stead as they go on through life. So, I  see good things for it with the leadership they have and with Charles as  the director, then with Dean Whitson. Now, he   s a friend of 4-H, and  that   s real good. So, we have all the support we need, and all the  resources of Oklahoma State University behind them, so that   s real  good. So, I see good things for it on down the line.  You retired in the    80s.  Nineteen eighty-two.  What have you been doing since retirement?  Well, we had planned to do some traveling. We bought a little travel  trailer, and we were going to spend time traveling, so our first trip was  down to south Texas in January. I was getting ready to play golf with a  friend down there one morning. We had another couple with us, and this  lady noticed that my speech was a little bit slurred and said something  was wrong. I thought,    Well, things will get better. I   ll go and       but it  didn   t get any better. So, I finally went to the doctor, and he said,    Man,  you   re having a stroke,    and I spent about a week in the hospital down  there until I got in shape to come back. So, that kind of cut our travel  plans short. We were afraid to get too far from home. We made some  short trips around, but we were afraid to get too far from home. I seem to  have recovered from that pretty well, and of course we were pretty  heavily involved in church and that kept us busy.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  And then, of course, I drink coffee with my buddies down at  McDonald   s. Matter of fact, I was down there this morning. (Laughter)  Got to check it all   they tell the same old lies over and over. But we   ve  been pretty active in the community. I was a member of Lions Club for  about forty-five years, and that kept me involved. Then after retiring, we  had about 100 to 125 members when I first got in it, but it kind of  dwindled down and down and down, and they were meeting at night,  and I got to where I was kind of afraid to drive at night, so I dropped out.  Now we have an old man   s Kiwanis Club. We call it the Golden K.  Now, these are all, the average is in their eighties. There   s about thirty-five  of us. We meet down at Cimarron Motel every Tuesday morning at  9:30 and have donuts. Usually have a good program, and we have lots of  good program possibilities around here from the campus and so on. So,  we have a program and visit for a while, then we come home. Then we  have what we call the Project Heart that serves a hot meal five days a  week at lunchtime, and I go down there for lunch every day except  Saturday and Sunday, and that   s a good way to get a meal, and I don   t  have to cook and wash dishes for that. But, otherwise, I   ve got to the  point to where physically I can   t do much outside work. I have a good  neighbor that mows my lawn and takes care of that, and I have a lady  that comes and cleans my house once a month, so I get along in pretty  good shape. Then I read the paper and take a nap (laughs) and watch the  news. But I get along pretty well with all the help, anyhow.  You   ve been retired for a while. Do you ever get pulled back into a 4-H  activity?  I did for a while, but they kind of stopped doing that because I got to the  point to where I had trouble getting there. At Christmas, they have a  Christmas dinner and invite me back up there. That keeps me in contact  with them, so I give them a call occasionally and stop by. And going  through stuff, I usually find some 4-H memorabilia. That won   t mean a  thing to my kids, so take it down to the county office to see if they can  use it, so I kind of keep my toe in, but I don   t do any work. I just take all  the freebies I can get. (Laughter) They   re real nice to me.  Well, Mr. Parker, is there anything else you   d like to tell me about your  time working in 4-H that I haven   t touched upon? I mean, your career  spanned so many years.  Well, I think it   s kind of been my life, and as I mentioned before, I   ve  always enjoyed working with kids. I was director of a high school  department in church for about twenty years, and that kept me involved  there. Of course, with all the thirty-one years I was in extension, I had  young folks around all the time. I served as usher at church, and I  usually had a pocket full of candy I   d give to the kids as they came in.  20  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Parker  Nykolaiszyn  Some of them are still around, and they have kids of their own, but they  still call me the candy man. (Laughter) So, in addition to 4-H and  church, I   ve been around kids all my life, and I   ve enjoyed them, and  hopefully I   ve made some kind of a contribution to their development.  I would say so.  I would hope so.  Well, we appreciate you taking some time out and talking with us this  morning.  Well, thank you very much.  Thank you again.  -------  -------
