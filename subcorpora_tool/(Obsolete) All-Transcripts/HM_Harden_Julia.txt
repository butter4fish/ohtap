Speaker 1: So, Mrs. Harden [HistoryMaker Julia Harden], we're gonna get started with a few questions just to help break the ice and make you feel a little comfortable.  These are People magazine-ish type questions.  And the first one is, what's your favorite food?  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite?
Speaker 1: Food.
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite food, perhaps chicken salad.  I have always liked chicken salad, and of course, coming from Baltimore, I relish seafood quite a bit, crabs, oysters, and that type of seafood.
Speaker 1: And what about your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Probably the spring.  Washington [D.C.], since I've been here living, Washington is beautiful in the spring.  And I do love the spring here.
Speaker 1: And what's your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: My favorite spot probably is Massachusetts.  We spent many years on the Cape [Cape Cod] and really, I would say that it's my very favorite place.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or favorite saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite game?
Speaker 1: A favorite phrase or saying.
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  I, right now, I really can't remember any particular phrase that I use all the time.
Story_ID: 193033
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about your mother.  What was her name, where was she from, and what do you know about her background?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Mary Katharine Locks, L-O-C-K-S.  She was a third generation Baltimorean [Baltimore, Maryland].  And her great-grandfather was named John W. Locks, and he was a businessman around 18--the 18th [sic, 19th] century, around the 18th century and happened to be a very good friend of Frederick Douglass.  My family, as I said, is third generation Baltimorean.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about Frederick Douglass that your mother may have shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have a story, but at one point, Frederick Douglass wrote a letter to my great-great-grandfather.  And the letter was given to my oldest aunt, who passed it on to the youngest aunt, and in some way or other that letter got lost.  It was given to a student by my aunt, who had been a history teacher at [Frederick] Douglass High School in Baltimore [Maryland], and she had known this young man.  And he came to her to talk about Frederick Douglass, and she happened to give him the letter because he claimed that he was writing a dissertation.  And the letter disappeared, so the family is very disturbed about that.
Speaker 1: Do you know what the letter said or what the letter was about?
Speaker 2: I have no idea what the letter might have been about, but the two of them were businessmen together, my great-great-grandfather and Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?  And tell me a little bit about her growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was one of ten children.  There were five sons and five daughters.  Their mother died very early, and the father was left with the care of these ten children.  She probably had a, not a very interesting childhood because the mother died so young, and the older women in the family had to take care of the young ones.  And--but my mother was a very quiet person and very much concerned about the surroundings in Baltimore.  She was a committeewoman.  She worked with the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association, Y].  For many years, the YWCA actually in Baltimore was about the only interracial group there, because Baltimore, as many people know, was quite prejudiced.  But my mother belonged to the Y committee for many years and also to what they termed the Women's Civic League there.  And she was quite interested.  After I left home and went to college, my father [John Wesley Woodhouse] really got her interested in the community, and she enjoyed that very much until, of course, she retired.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories with you about growing up?
Speaker 2: The only thing that I remember, my mother said to me one time that as a young girl, she helped a woman physician at Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland].  And she would go and help her from time to time to just have a few pennies in her pocket.  And she became very friendly with this person.  And the woman taught her a great deal about food preparation, what foods to eat, and foods that would preserve her health.  And today, when I look at these booklets that come out telling you what to eat and what not to eat, I remember that my mother followed very closely in preparation of food at home.
Story_ID: 193034
Speaker 1: What about your father?  Can you tell me your father's name and a little bit about his background?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father was John Wesley Woodhouse.  He grew in Sparks, Maryland, one of eight children.  And his father was a minister there, African Methodist American [sic, African Methodist Episcopal], A.M.E. minister.  And he was one, as I say, of a large family.  And when he finished elementary school, the place was where he was born was very rural and the education facilities very sparse, so he decided to come to Baltimore [Maryland] to go to high school.  And that's where he met my mother [Mary Locks Woodhouse], and they graduated together.  He eventually went into the educational system there in Baltimore, and after many years he became a principal of an elementary school and in fact several elementary schools.  And he was in the Baltimore school system for probably forty years, one of the first African American principals.  There, at that time, I think there were about six African Americans who were the first principals in Baltimore city.
Speaker 1: What about his growing up?  Did he ever share any stories with you about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little.  He talked very little about his growing up.  He was just so glad to leave Sparks, Maryland, that I think he decided that was it.  And he just did not talk too much about it, he was just so glad to leave to get an education.
Story_ID: 193035
Speaker 1: What about your ancestors?  How far back can you trace your ancestors, and what can you tell me about your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, my great-great-grandfather, as I told you, was a businessman.  And he ended up coming to Baltimore [Maryland] and having--setting up a company that handled bodies, of course, and very much like some of the old companies here.  I know very little about him, except for the fact that he was a friend of Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 1: What about your grandparents on your mother's [Mary Locks Woodhouse] side?  Can you tell me a little bit about them?
Speaker 2: My grandparents on my mother's side, I--as I said, my grandmother died very early.  And my grandfather used to visit us.  He lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and from time to time he would visit us.  But I really have very little recollection of him.
Speaker 1: What about your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side, I never knew them at all.  I know some of his sisters and brothers, but I never knew his parents at all.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories about them that may have been told or passed down?
Speaker 2: Not about them at all, not particularly, and nothing very significant about them at all.
Story_ID: 193036
Speaker 1: Tell me, what was your earliest memory of growing up [in Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory was of that, going to a photographer at about five years old and enjoying it very much, and that's the picture that I would very much like to find.  But I had a very interesting childhood.  I had a lot of friends.  A lot of my neighbors had children, and as I grew up, we grew very friendly.
Story_ID: 193037
Speaker 1: Let's see, what do we have here?  I see you there.
Speaker 2: Now this the Du Bois Circle, which was named for W. Burghardt Du Bois [William Edward Burghardt Du Bois], and it will be a hundred years old in 2006.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: And this was taken several years ago, because I have retired from that.  I don't go to the meetings anymore.
Speaker 1: Do you remember about when?  Let me see on the back.  Oh, this was taken in 2000, in the year--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Two thousand, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, anyway.  Now this, these are my next door neighbors that grew up with me, and there--
Speaker 1: In Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Oh, wonderful.
Speaker 2: --on Presstman Street.  Their names are Woodland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there I am at this same affair.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: That's (laughter)--and--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see them too.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Or do I?
Speaker 2: There I am in the middle.
Speaker 1: Yes, I see you in the middle.  I thought I saw one of the other ladies, but they just have on a similar outfit I think.
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have a similar--that's one that I am very proud of.  It came from South Korea.  I happened to go there with a friend of mine who had been there.  She and her husband had been with AID [United States Agency for International Development], and she belonged to a Korean American women's association--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and they were taking a trip there.  And she asked me--she used to take me to the meetings, and I just happened to go with her.  And they were planning this trip to South Korea, and I was here alone.  And I just decided to go, and I had a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?  How long ago it was?
Speaker 2: Both, both, my friend and her husband are dead.  I would say in the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --probably in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: My memory for dates is not very good, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: That's okay, that's all right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: But I'm very proud of that-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I'm very proud of that, my mother, my aunt, my cousin, and I was the last member of that group.  But my mother was not a founding member, but she went into that group.  And it was founded by the wife of a friend of Dr. Du Bois--
Speaker 2: Oh, wonderful.
Speaker 1: --and a schoolmate from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: And was it a civic group?  What kind of group was it?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Just a, a pleasure group.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And they would get together.  They started out getting together in the homes, and then eventually, as, as the years matured, they began going to, to very nice eating places around Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure, okay.
Speaker 2: But it's one of the oldest of the African American women's groups in the country, insofar as I have heard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 193038
Speaker 1: So, this is a photo of the Du Bois Circle that [HistoryMaker] Julia Harden mentioned.  And she is seated in the middle.  She's sitting down, and has on a tan outfit, and is seated in the middle.  And this organiz--and this photo was taken in the year 2000.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  That's her, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE)
Speaker 1: And this photo, Mrs. Harden is in the middle of this photo and her two childhood friends from Baltimore [Maryland] that she referenced earlier, who are also members of the Du Bois Circle.  Mrs. Harden, what were your friends' names again, the two sisters?
Speaker 2: The two sisters were named Woodlands.  One is Sarah Woodland, one--the other one on the right is Edith Woodland Marshall, and she is married to a cousin of Thurgood Marshall's.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  And this photo was taken in 2002.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: We're just shooting some of the photos now while they're doing a little bit of work there.  That was a little noisy.  So that way we can do that now, okay?
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Ms. Harden, can you tell me about the other, the photo that was taken on Mother's Day?
Speaker 1: Yes, Mother's Day, my daughter [Katharine Harden] had just gotten married I think at that particular year.  And she decided just to come with us on Mother's Day, and it was taken at a restaurant near Hotel Washington, downtown.  And at the present time, I can't remember the name of that hotel.  But it was an enjoyable luncheon for us.
Speaker 2: And this was taken in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think it was in around the fifties [1950].
Speaker 2: And in this photo is Mrs. Harden, who is to the far right.  And in the center is her husband.  What's your husband's first name, Ms. Harden?
Speaker 1: K. Albert Harden.
Speaker 2: K. Albert Harden and their daughter, Katharine, with a K.
Speaker 1: Katharine with a K-A-T-H-A-R-I-N-E.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you, Ms. Harden.  That's a different way of spelling it.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Can you tell me who is in the Atlantic City [New Jersey] photo?
Speaker 1: Who took that?
Speaker 2: No, no, who's, who's in that photo?
Speaker 1: On that photo, my mother [Mary Locks Woodhouse] is there on the left; I'm in the center; and my aunt Mabel Locks Frisbie [ph.] is on the right.
Speaker 2: How old were you in that photo?  About how old were you?
Speaker 1: I imagine I was around twelve years old.  That probably is around 1921 then, 'cause I was born in 1909--
Story_ID: 193039
Speaker 1: Ms. [HistoryMaker Julia] Harden, what other memories can you share with me about growing up in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, I really had a lot of friends, and really I enjoyed my schooling and the little birthday parties that we had.  Some of the people that I was in school with, we started out in the second grade and went through the elementary school and high school.  And I had some very close friends.  And I enjoyed my school days there, and I enjoyed getting around, little birthday parties we had, and I enjoyed going to the Y [Young Women's Christian Association, YWCA].  At that particular time, the Girl Reserves [of the YWCA], like the Girl Scouts, and I enjoyed that.  I mean every Saturday we got ourselves together and went to the Girl Reserves; then we had a dancing class that was taught by one of the high school teachers.  And several of my good friends and I enjoyed going to that.  Now, that's about all that we did at, at that particular time.  Now as, for instance, today, there are many things that the youngsters enjoy, but that--at that time, we enjoyed going to the Y, and we enjoyed going to dancing class.
Speaker 1: What about special memories of holidays and that kind of thing?  Do you have any special memories of holidays?
Speaker 2: Well, my family always got together.  We got together with my cousins, and we'd always have Christmas dinner there.  And we kept that up until many years.  And finally, my father [John Wesley Woodhouse], mother [Mary Locks Woodhouse], and aunt and her husband used to come and have Christmas dinner particularly with us.  And we had quite nice festivities at holiday time.
Speaker 1: What about your siblings?  Can you tell me the names of your siblings, and give me their birth order, including yours?
Speaker 2: I was an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me a little bit about the street that you lived on growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that's a very interesting thing because my granddaughter says now that I used to talk about the streets.  You know, the streets in Baltimore are joined together.  And most of the-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --most of the steps are marble.  That's one thing that's very interesting about Baltimore.  They had these white marble steps that have to be cleaned and scrubbed every day to see how white your steps can be, then they're covered with wood in the winter.  And that's the thing that I used to enjoy a great deal, because at that particular time on Presstman Street, there were a lot of families who had children.  And we would all get out probably on the weekends and clean these white marble steps.  And we'd get together and have a lot of fun.  And that's the one thing that my granddaughter has enjoyed my telling.  And in fact, she has said to me that she would like me to write about my childhood there in Baltimore because she enjoyed a great deal hearing about living there on Presstman Street, and my neighbors, and how we used to get out and clean these white marble steps.
Story_ID: 193040
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I don't have too much recollection of smells, except maybe down by the waterfront there in Baltimore [Maryland].  And of course we lived quite a distance from the waterfront (laughter).  But that's about it, you know.
Speaker 1: Any sounds that remind you of growing up in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Probably not.  I can't recollect any sounds particularly in Baltimore except the pealing of the bells on Sunday morning.  We lived right across from an Epis--old Episcopal church there, a stone, beautiful stone church, and the bell would ring every Sunday morning you see.  Now that's about what I remember of the sounds.  And we used to wait for that sound on Sunday morning.
Speaker 1: What about anything that, any sights?  Like when you see something, does it really remind--oh, it takes back when you see something in particular?
Speaker 2: That particular church, when I have a chance to get to Baltimore and to get up into that section, that particular church reminds me of my childhood.  So many of my friends were Episcopalians, and people in that neighborhood.  And that is about the recollection that I have of the churches there.
Speaker 1: And what's the name of that church?
Speaker 2: At this particular time I don't remember [sic, Saint Katherine of Alexandria Church, Baltimore, Maryland].  I would have to refresh my memory--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --about that church.  And it was pastored by mostly Irish pastors.  And it wasn't until a later date--
Story_ID: 193041
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your elementary school years.  What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Our school was named Division Street School [later, Public School 103, Baltimore, Maryland], and I had many, many happy days there.  It was on Division Street, and it was about eight or nine blocks from me, so all the surrounding area children went to this Division Street School.  It was supposed to be very, well--the faculty was very well prepared, and we certainly enjoyed our years there.  The school became so crowded that we had to skip grades, and that's why so many of us finished high school at a young age.  But the children in northwest Baltimore, surrounding that area, all went to Division Street School, and it has many happy memories for those of us who are left.
Speaker 1: Share some of your memories with us.  What are some of the things you remember?
Speaker 2: About that school?  Well, first place, we had an excellent corps of teachers, and we really progressed very well, many of us.  I think because of that corps of teachers, they seemed to be very interested in the children.  The parents were interested.  They had a wonderful parent-teacher association [PTA].  We had many happy days then, many very excellent memories.
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your classmates who have gone on to become very famous.
Speaker 2: Well, some of my classmates, among them Thurgood Marshall, from the second grade all the way until high school.  I had one very good friend, Edna Brown, who eventually went to the University of Vermont and came back to Baltimore to teach.  I had one very good friend, one of the Murphys, who eventually became the wife of the minister to Haiti or ambassador [sic, U.S. Ambassador to Haiti], or whatever Clinton Knox was, and many other friends, some who attained some notoriety and some who didn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was Thurgood Marshall like in grade school and high school?
Speaker 2: I have given my talk about Thurgood to [HistoryMaker] Juan Williams, but Thurgood was a very interesting youngster, full of fun.  And they lived, the Marshalls lived just about two or three blocks from us.  And he had a brother who was older, but he had very lovely parents.  The mother was, became assistant principal of one of the elementary schools.  And Thurgood, and Jimmy Carr, and some of the other youngsters in our class were quite mischievous, but we all had a lot of good fun.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any mischievous things that he did or that you all did growing up?
Speaker 2: That?
Speaker 1: Any--do you remember any of those mischievous things that you all did?
Speaker 2: Well, not particularly in elementary school, but high school, the same group of us, they kept us all together.  And we did not have any people joining us until high school.  Now the high school era was altogether different.  We had lots of fun there, and the happy days really were spent at [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] with the same group of youngsters.
Speaker 1: And what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Mediocre (laughter).  I worked hard and had the help of my father [John Wesley Woodhouse] behind me.  He was an educator, and he decided that his daughter really had to mind her Ps and Qs (laughter).  But otherwise, I didn't make any great strides.  I was always a hard worker, and it paid off.
Story_ID: 193042
Speaker 1: And what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Probably very obedient.  I had parents [Mary Locks Woodhouse and John Wesley Woodhouse] who were very strict.  And it never occurred to me to do anything that would, that they would disapprove of.  And it followed me all through life really, through my years when I left home.  I found that that strict upbringing held me in good stead.
Speaker 1: And at this time in your life as a young girl in elementary school [at Division Street School, later Public School 103, Baltimore, Maryland], did you have any dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Not particularly then.  My aspirations really came in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  Elementary school was just run-of-the-mill and getting through and having fun and seeing your classmates every fall.  Otherwise, nothing significant happened there actually.
Story_ID: 193043
Speaker 1: What about church?  Did you and your family attend church?  Did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, my people were African, A.M.E. is African Methodist Episcopals.  And my father was on the board of the A.M.E. church and worked very faithfully.  He was a superintendent of Sunday school, and which I had to attend every Sunday, and a very faithful church worker.  My mother never was very interested in doing church work as such, but we attended church regularly.
Speaker 1: Do you have any particular memories about church and Sunday school and what that was like?
Speaker 2: Sunday school and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are some of your memories?
Speaker 2: I have no very--memories of Sunday school, just I went every Sunday regardless of the weather or anything else, but not particularly interested in Sunday school.
Speaker 1: What about junior high school?  Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: We had no junior high school.  We finished the seventh grade and then went to the eighth grade from--to the end of, to the 12th grade.  But at that particular time, Baltimore [Maryland] had no junior high schools.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: They didn't come until later.
Story_ID: 193044
Speaker 1: So as a young teenager, thirteen or fourteen years old, who was influencing you, and who were the people that you looked up to at this age?
Speaker 2: Well, probably the, my teachers.  Many of them are--were very friendly to my group.  The one teacher that I particularly remember and my friends remember were [HistoryMaker] Juan Williams's wife's grandmother.  She had just finished her master's degree and came to [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] to teach English, and she was our particular favorite, as I remember.  And she kept up with many of us all through our college days and forth until she died.  But Iradell Williams really, I think, was the primary person that my classmates really adored.
Speaker 1: And were you thinking at this time that perhaps you'd like to be a teacher, or what were you thinking--
Speaker 2: No, I never wanted to teach.  The dinner table at our house, between my father [John Wesley Woodhouse] and my aunt, was taken up about the Baltimore school system and all of the superintendents and assistant superintendents, and I heard that for years.  And that's the one thing that I had said: I'll never teach school.  And really it influenced my life, because when I went away to school my father kept insisting that I take education courses, and that was the thing that I resisted.  And it didn't happen until many years later that I regretted not taking those (laughter) education courses.  But no, when I was younger I had never had any desire to teach.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, at the particular time that I was in high school, I wasn't sure.  But when I got to college, I decided that I would like to be a librarian.  That's what I did.
Story_ID: 193045
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about when you were in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  How did you spend your time?
Speaker 2: Oh, most of us did a lot of studying, trying to get through those courses.  But we also had very nice ideas of having fun.  We had one teacher in our high school who had really never taught.  He was a retired [U.S.] Army person.  And he had finished Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], as I remember, and he came to teach history.  And he decided that one of the things that he would like to do would be--he did two things.  He organized a debating group, and several youngsters in, in my class became debaters.  And they used to go into the various high schools and have these debates.  Now the other thing that Garth McDaniel [ph.] did, he decided every year to have a spring festival.  And that's how some of the people who later became stage people got their start.  One of them was [Cabell] "Cab" Calloway, who was in the class behind me.  The other was [HistoryMaker] Anne Brown, who was famous for 'Porgy and Bess,' and Avon Long, who was a classmate of hers, and who also was in 'Porgy and Bess.'  So he developed those people and of course they became pretty famous.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what the spring festivals were like and watching them perform.
Speaker 2: Oh, they were quite elaborate.  McDaniel had costumes and beautiful music, and he discovered these people, really, who could sing and dance and actually be entertainers.  And so it was always a big affair at Douglass.  And as I say, he developed quite a few of those people, both in his debating societies and in his art, the dance, and entertaining people, as "Cab" Calloway did.  But of course we all were extremely interested in these festivals every year (laughter).  I never took part in anything like that.  We--some of my classmates just enjoyed going to them, you know, and have the parents come, because they always had a parents' night.
Speaker 1: When you watched young "Cab" Calloway and some of the others, did you think, wow, they've really got something; they're gonna grow up to be famous?
Speaker 2: Well, we never thought Cab Calloway (laughter) would ever finish school, because he was quite a truant.  And they finally, they gave him his diploma I think after ten years, because he had not been attending school as he should.  But some of the others, Anne Brown had a beautiful voice, and Avon Long.  And they were people that really went to town (laughter).  They became famous (laughter).  And I can't leave out Thurgood [Marshall], because of course, he was one of the best debaters that ever came through Douglass High School (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was it like listening to him debate?
Speaker 2: Well, he always was very talkative and very argumentative.  And I imagine that's where he got (laughter) where he did (laughter).  But anyway, Baltimore [Maryland] is quite proud of him anyway (laughter).
Story_ID: 193046
Speaker 1: So while you were in high school [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], what kinds of things were influencing you, or what kinds of people were, who were you most influenced by while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: What kind of people, you said, did I associate with, is that what you mean?
Speaker 1: Who were your friends and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I had quite a few friends, some of them lasted through the years.  I had one very good friend, the one I told you went to Vermont, and then the other stayed in Baltimore [Maryland] and became the wife of a physician and had three lovely children.  And I kept friendship with them.  They've both gone to heaven, but some of the others also I have kept friends with over the years.
Speaker 1: What were their names, the two other ladies you mentioned?
Speaker 2: Yes, one was Charlotte Watson Shervington, who was my very good friend; and Edna Hall Brown is the one who left Baltimore, went to school in Vermont and college, and came back to Baltimore to teach science.  She never married.  But Charlotte Watson married a physician, Dr. Walter Shervington.  And they were really my closest friends, but I had other ones that I also saw when I went to Baltimore.

Speaker 1: So at this time while you were in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], were you thinking about going to college?  Were you thinking you were going to go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, college was always on my mind.  It was on my father's [John Wesley Woodhouse] mind definitely (laughter), so all of my doings were getting grades that would get me into college.  And that was the one thing, thing about it is that when I left high school, my father seemed to think I really wasn't ready for college.  So I went to New York [New York] to a private high school, graduated, and then went on to college.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like in New York?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What was that experience in New York like?
Speaker 2: Very different from Baltimore [Maryland].  As I can say, I'm glad I lived through it.  But the high school had one other African American student, a male, whom you could not tell whether he was African American or not.  There were no girls, no African American girls in that high school.  It was a very different experience for me, and I don't know how I came through it.  But (laughter) I succeeded in getting out of there and went on to college.
Speaker 1: How was that experience different?  Can you give us--
Speaker 2: It was very--
Speaker 1: --some examples?
Speaker 2: --different for me because I had been schooled with people that I had known all my life, and to be put in a situation where there were no friends to talk to, no associates of my color, and I weathered it; it was quite a different experience for me.  And I finally made, I would say, one good friend out of that group who was very different from me.  She was the daughter of very well-to-do merchants there in New York.  In fact, the school was the type, it was 90 percent Jewish, and most of the students were very well-to-do.  Now they did take some scholarship students.  I went there on a, a grant.  And that's where most of the black, or the African Americans, were given scholarships.  But it was quite a different experience for me, but I lived through it and went on to college, to my father's great relief (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: I guess I should tell it.  It was the Ethical Culture [Fieldston] School [New York, New York] at 63rd [Street] and Central Park West.  I hope they won't collapse when they find out (laughter).
Story_ID: 193048
Speaker 1: And your friend's name there [at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York, New York]?  Your good friend that you made there, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Well, the poor girl, she's dead I'm sure.  Elsie Stern [ph.] was a classmate, and I happen to meet her on a train.  I had gone to the Olympics [Games of the X Olympiad, Los Angeles, California] with my parent, my mother [Mary Locks Woodhouse] and aunt, to California in '32 [1932], and my relatives stayed in California.  I had to come back because I was working.  And it was my first job at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and I had two weeks' vacation, so I had to get back.  And coming back, I--you traveled by train at the time.  And I happened to go back to the parlor car, the car, you know, that you go to to sit and observe.  And who should come and sit next to me on that parlor car but Elsie Stern, who I had not seen since I left New York.  And I looked up and I said to her: I know you will not remember me, but aren't you Elsie Stern?  Well, she was floored and so was I.  And we talked, and she asked me what I was doing, and I told her I was at Howard, librarian.  And she said, well you know, I would like to come to Howard University to see it.  She came to visit me, and I think she went back to the school and told them of this happening, just on the parlor car coming back from California.  So that was quite an incident for me.  She came and visited me, and I never saw her again or never heard from her, but she was a delightful person.  And that was about the only friendship I guess that I made from that school--
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: --but it's very--it was a very different situation for me, but I lived through it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you encounter any racism at that school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I probably shouldn't talk (laughter) about it.  I decided as my sports--they asked what you wanted to do, and I decided to take swimming.  And they sent me over to the Heckscher Foundation [New York, New York].  I guess I won't be talking about, by saying this.  The Heckscher Foundation was just around the corner.  It was a wonderful setup, and I went around there with about five girls.  And the next day, the principal called me into the office, and he said, "I hate to really talk to you about this, but the Heckscher Foundation, for some crazy notion, has said that they will not take your one African American, so you can't--" So the principal told me, he said, "It's very foolish, but we're sorry.  So, you'll have to decide to take something else."  But probably I'm not very sensitive really.  And it didn't dawn on me that much, and I went ahead and took something else.  The school decided then to take all the activities away from the Heckscher Foundation and build their own school with a swimming pool.
Story_ID: 193049
Speaker 1: So, Mrs. [HistoryMaker Julia] Harden, you said you were glad you had that experience [at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School] in New York [New York].  Why?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, actually, it made me a better person.  And to meet different people, different types of people I think helped me a great deal when I came back to segregated Washington [D.C.].  I can really say I enjoyed those years in New York.  And at one time, I think, when I was in my sophomore year, I was working so hard, and I had friends who were here in other schools who were having the time of their life, you know.  And I said to my father one time, I think at the end of my sophomore year: you know, I think I'd like to come back and go to one of the schools there.  He said oh no, you started there, and you'll finish.  So I got that out of my mind.
Story_ID: 193050
Speaker 1: So, let's talk a little bit about college.  How did you decide where you were going to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I really believe it was decided for me (laughter).  I had an uncle who taught in a New York school system.  And, and my parent [Harden's father, John Wesley Woodhouse] was definitely interested in my getting away from Baltimore [Maryland], and he talked a great deal with my uncle.  And that's how I happened to go to high school there and just stayed on to go to college.  I don't think really that I actually had any idea of coming back to Washington [D.C.] or Baltimore at that time.  I think I was determined to on to stay in New York [New York], 'cause I missed my friends, but I made other friends.  And to tell you the truth, I enjoyed those years in New York.  They took a lot out of me.  I lost a lot of weight.  I weighed eighty-eight pounds by the time I finished college.  But I think it was worth it in the long run.  And I went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and it was pretty difficult, and--but I made friends there too, lifelong friends.  And I came out at the regular time.  I graduated the regular time, and then I decided I wanted to go to library school, so I stayed right there and went to Columbia [University, New York, New York].  And so at that time I had these two degrees.  And my years there, I lived with a family.  At first I lived with my uncle and his wife, who both taught, and really, it was a little much to have somebody else in the house (laughter).  So my parents [John Wesley Woodhouse and Mary Locks Woodhouse] decided perhaps I--they should look around.  We were lucky enough to find a family who had a daughter and who was several years younger than I, and she was--she finally went to Hunter [College, New York, New York].  And I lived with them for the whole time until I finished, and it was really a delight, what a lovely family.  And I enjoyed staying with the Carters the whole time that I was in New York.  And to help out, of course, they had someone who was several years younger than I.  She was in college, so it made it very comfortable for me, and I really hated to leave New York (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were your experiences at NYU like?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) the experiences were quite interesting.  I worked my tongue out getting through there, and there's a lot of--at NYU you have a lot of very bright people.  And there's quite a bit of doings to try to even get through there actually.  So when you finish those four years you thank God (laughter) that you've been able to.
Speaker 1: Did you join any Greek organizations, or were you part of any organizations on campus?
Speaker 2: No, not on campus, but I did join a sorority.  After my sophomore year I became a Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority], and I enjoyed my association with them.  Most of the Delta members were from Hunter[College].  NYU had no chapters, so most of the girls were from Hunter, one from NYU.  And I had many pleasurable experiences with the sorority until I left, but none on campus.  I mean there was none of that at that, at that time.
Story_ID: 193051
Speaker 1: So after you left Columbia [University, New York, New York], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went--as I said, I went to library school and got that degree.  And to tell you the truth, I waited until my marks, the first semester, the half-semester grades came to apply to Howard [University, Washington D.C.].  And I had always wanted to work in a college.  I don't like public library work and not particularly school library work, so I really decided to apply to Howard.  And fortunately, Howard was looking for people with library degrees because the rating people were on Howard's neck in all departments at that time.  And the library, the Carnegie Library there at Howard, was really understaffed, and not only understaffed but poor surroundings, and they were in the mood to have people with library degrees.  And one of my members of the class also applied to Howard at the same time.  They took us both.  So I finished in June and went to work at Howard in September of that year.  And that was 1930, yeah.  I finished school, college in 1930 and library school in 1931 and went to work immediately at Howard.  And I stayed there five years.  In the meantime, my husband, I met my husband, and I resigned, which I should not have done.  He was practicing in Maryland, and I gave up the job and went (laughter), much to my family's upset (laughter).  But I enjoyed those years at Howard, and eventually I went back.
Story_ID: 193052
Speaker 1: How did you meet your husband [K. Albert Harden]?
Speaker 2: I had met him in Detroit, Michigan, where I used to go each summer.  I had relatives, and I used to go there each summer.  And I made a very special friend who went to Michigan.  And my husband at the time was in--in fact he finished undergraduate school and medical school there.  And the year that I finished college, my family and I went.  And this friend of mine decided to give a party, just a few of her friends and several fellows.  And among the people, my husband was one of the people that I met there.  And at that time, he was finishing his sophomore year, and I never saw him again--I think I went on a boat ride or something, and he was on this boat ride and we talked and never thinking I would ever see him again.  And very interestingly, (laughter) the very first night that I was on duty at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--we used to work at that time from six to ten--and this was my first night to work six to ten, and who should walk into the library but my future husband whom I had not seen since I had finished college.  And he finally came up to the desk I think.  And I said here--I made the first move I guess.  I said hey, didn't I meet you years ago in Ann Arbor [Michigan] at--in Detroit at Evelyn Douglas [ph.].  And he looked at me and he said yes, and so he said well, how do you go home at night?  (Laughter) He said I'd like to take you home tonight.  I said thank heavens, 'cause I was wondering how in the world at 10:00--I go through that campus and I, at that particularly time I lived about four or five blocks from the school.  And since that was my first night, I hadn't had the experience of walking up there.  So that's when the romance started.  And he did it, he was doing his internship, and he went on back to Detroit.  And finally, we got married (laughter).
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--I stopped to think the other night, 1933; let's hope that's right, 1933, and he died in '74 [1974]--yeah, forty-one years; we'd been married forty-one years.  And he, he came to Howard at a very meager salary.  He had been in Maryland at a place called Henryton [State Hospital, Marriottsville, Maryland] for people with chest diseases.  And they were starting a building at Howard for people with chest diseases, and he happened to know some people who were head of that, and they came to Henryton and got him, and we came here.  Well, he came as an instructor in the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] at a very meager salary.  And he finally, after a year I think, he went to the dean and told him that the salary was much less than he was getting in the--at Henryton.  And he said he would really like to get an increase.  And he was told that he couldn't get an increase until he got his board [exams] (laughter).  And if he took his board, they could probably increase.  But they said now, you'll have to take the board, but I can get you a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship if you wanna take that.  So that's how we got the Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and went to New York for a year with Andrea Cornon [ph.], who had been a specialist in chest diseases.
Story_ID: 193053
Speaker 1: So we stayed there [New York, New York] a year, came back to Washington [D.C.].  By that time, Katharine [Harden] was born, my daughter, and so we took her with us.  And fortunately, that same school [Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York, New York] took her and gave her the same thing that I had, and she stayed there a year and in the private school.
Speaker 2: How old was she?
Speaker 1: Six.  And her teacher here at Mott [Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] had said that she was such a good student.  She was able to read, you know.  And of course, what they did was test her, and she couldn't read a thing.  She had committed that book that they--there at Mott evidently and knew how to get along with that, couldn't read a thing.  By February they had her reading.  She had a nice year there.  But she had been exposed to, I mean other kids here, other races, so it really wasn't--she didn't feel out of place like I did, you see.  But I was just glad she had that experience.  The only thing was that they had their own method of teaching.  And they were teaching reading until the third grade, and they didn't start math until the third grade.  So when I brought her here and put her in a demonstration school, the teacher said she reads well, but she can't add two and two.  And, and that followed her really through--that was only thing that was dismaying about that trip to New York and that fellowship.  But the fellowship with him was a very good one, and we were very pleased at that.  But it did hold her back.  She was never very good in math until she got a very good teacher in the junior high school, and she did a lot with her there.  But that was the one thing that I really objected going to New York, because I knew taking her out of this environment and putting her into a new one, I didn't know how she would adjust to it, but I mean I had to go (laughter).  But anyway, things worked out, and she went on to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.].  The year before or the year that integration came--she finished in '55 [1955]--and my daughter died though in '70s [1970s], and she's been dead some time.  She died right after her father [K. Albert Harden], a couple of years after her father died.  And she left this very delightful granddaughter I have (laughter).  So I decided, you know, that I would just stay here in this house.  I didn't wanna move, so now my granddaughter and her family are gonna move with me.  So I'm very glad of that, but we've gotta tear this house apart (laughter) to make it look like something again.
Story_ID: 193054
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit to when you first started working at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  What was Washington, D.C., like back then--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in the--
Speaker 2: --to tell you the truth--
Speaker 1: --the '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I liked the atmosphere of the students and everything but that library was for the birds.  It was evidently badly built, and they had marble floors, and the students would come--Howard at that time had no visitation to the dormitories, so it was a gathering place, students came to see their dates, came all dressed, some of the girls in very lovely mink coats and so forth.  This was something that I wasn't used to (laughter).  And the young men would come all dressed up and not to study.  There were a few people who would come and study, but that was very unlikely--
Story_ID: 193055
Speaker 1: You were telling me about the students in the library [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: It was a gathering place for dates, you know, and I didn't, I couldn't get used to that.  They had, they had a marble floor that young men would put on these heavy boots and come in and cause distraction going over the floor.  I don't know how in the world that at that particular time the students did any serious studying.  But they had people at Howard who have done very well.  And despite the fact that the library was substandard, they have done extremely well, some of them, you know.  I can now just think of some people from there who were Ph.D.s, some lawyers, and they have done extremely well despite the library (laughter).  But from that, though, they built a new, brand new library, beautiful and very adequate.  So, something came of that rating, you know.  And when I look back, that school became--I mean that library became a school of religion.  And the school of religion later built themselves a beautiful edifice.  But my first impression when I came, I shook my head.  But I had some very pleasant times there, made some very good friends over that desk (laughter), and enjoyed those years, despite the fact that it was inadequate.
Story_ID: 193056
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy Washington, D.C.?  How was Washington, D.C., different from New York [New York] and Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my heavens, well, different from New York; the pace is entirely different, you know.  In New York you're going helter-skelter.  And you know, you're racing here, there, and everywhere.  You're getting on a subway, and getting off, and pushing yourself into the subway doors.  Washington, the pace is slow.  And at first I had a little trouble getting used to it.  But eventually--and, and incidentally, I had been offered a job in the public library, the public library there [in New York, New York] at 135th [Street] and Lenox [Avenue].  The librarian was interested in having someone appointed on the children's library, and she offered me a job.  But I told her that my mind was not set on a public library job.  And I told her that I was really interested in college library.  And incidentally, there at Columbia [University, New York, New York] there were several librarians working on their degrees, and that's how I met, for instance, Dorothy [Burnett] Porter, who became a librarian in the Moorland Foundation [later, the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center] at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], was working on both her master's--on her bachelor's and master's at the same time, and another person who was working on her bachelor's degree and finished in June [1931] as I did.  She just died the other day at 105.  She and I are the two lingering librarians.  And she stayed at Howard for forty years.  Of course, I went back after my husband came to Howard in--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: --the medical school.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: John Maurice Thomas, and her picture was in the paper last Wednesday, and her wake was Thursday, and her graveside services were Friday, to which I couldn't get to either one, because her birthday was one week later than mine, July 13th.  And there was another librarian who was also born on the 13th, so the three of us used to celebrate.  So now, I am the only one left.  I can hardly believe it, out of about--how many--I guess of about six or seven or us, you know, so it's real scary.
Story_ID: 193057
Speaker 1: When did you go back to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: When my husband [K. Albert Harden] came to Howard, he came here--I'm trying to think now, must have been 19--in the 1940s.  I came back--of course I came with him.  And they would only let me take the place of somebody on leave.  They wouldn't give me a permanent appointment anymore.  So I did that a couple of times, and that's when I came back.
Speaker 1: What was it like going back?  Was, were things different, or were they still the same?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, some of the people were still there, and the, one of the people who had finished library school with me had become head of circulation.  So, I mean it was just like coming back home, and I stayed very friends with those people over the years.
Speaker 1: Was the atmosphere still the same?
Speaker 2: Oh no, the atmosphere was quite different.  I mean the atmosphere was altogether different because the, the library itself, you see, was altogether different, beautiful building with all the trimmings and all the necessities of the--that a library needs.  And the staff, oh, had increased.  I mean there were people who had come and gone.  And--but the older people, some of them were still there.  As I say, the person who just died the other day [John Maurice Thomas] was there, she stayed at Howard forty years.
Story_ID: 193058
Speaker 1: So, Mrs. [HistoryMaker Julia] Harden, let's talk a little bit about around the 1950s.  What were you doing then?
Speaker 2: Was--that, the time when the students were revolting, it was at, it was just before the '60s [1960s] though.  You mean before the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.  Or we had left, we had just finished talking about how the library had change when you went back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What other changes were taking place in the library, and in Washington, D.C., and around Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] campus?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just before the blow off for students.  Things were rather peaceful just before the '60s [1960s].  My recollection of the '50s [1950s], that the library was doing very well, and things were pretty peaceful on the campus.  My recollection of the '50s [1950s] is my daughter [Katharine Harden], of course, I guess was in high school at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].  And as I say, she finished in '55 [1955], so she probably was going through junior high school and high school, yes.  And teenagers were giving us difficulties at that time, yes.  I can remember the '50s [1950s] very well, because she was in the class with some very rambunctious youngsters, and parents were having difficulties with the children.  And it was not a very peaceful time for many parents.  But that sort of worked itself out.  And I hope I'm correct.  Yes, during those high school years, Dunbar was in a state of flux.  The youngsters were undecided about what to do and what not to do.  Yeah, they were turbulent years, as I remember.  But they had graduated in '55 [1955], and they went their different ways, but they were still friendly, many of them.  And my daughter went to, she had two years at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] like her father [K. Albert Harden].  Her father was very interested in her going back to Michigan, in getting her to go back there.  But things were a little turbulent at that time with her.  So what we did was transfer her to a girls' school, Elmira College [Elmira, New York], which was a girls' school, and had been trying for years to get a Dunbar graduate, and had not been successful, so she had two years there and finished.  And the people were very, the people at Elmira were very pleased about that.  So she got a chance to--she was coming down the steps I think one day in her dormitory, and she happened to see a placard in front of her saying that the National Student Association [NSA] was sponsoring a trip abroad for six weeks at a rather reasonable price.  So she and a friend of hers, a girl that she had met there, decided that would be the thing for them.  So they got together and decided to ask probably a couple of girls from here whose parents would let them go.  And they got a group of four together, and they took this trip.  They were gone for six weeks.  They went all over Europe, and they had a grand time.  But sure, that's what I remember about the '50s [1950s], that high school business, and then going to college after '55 [1955].  So they were quite troublesome times that I would say for us (laughter).
Story_ID: 193059
Speaker 1: What was the Civil Rights Movement like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, the Civil Rights Movement, of course, I had always been interested.  Coming from Baltimore [Maryland], there was nothing else to do but be interested in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and civil rights.  Juanita Jackson [Mitchell], Clarence Mitchell's [Clarence M. Mitchell Jr.] wife, and her mother [Lillie May Carroll Jackson] were in the churches talking about civil rights during those years.  And all of us were listening.  And of course, when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] came that day [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 1963] to go down there, all of Washington [D.C.] turned out, most of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I know my husband [K. Albert Harden] went to give his medical services.  And it was just a grand--then I had relatives from New York.  I had two relatives who were judges there in New York.  They came down.  And of course it was a grand weekend for us.  But as for me, I don't think that I--my husband and I did belong to the ADA, Americans for Democratic Action.  Now that was one group that we took quite an interest in.  And otherwise, I don't remember anything more impressive than that group that day down there with Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about that day.  Where were you standing, and what were your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well, I was here, but my husband had gotten up early in the morning to go down there to donate his services.  And my cousins, two of them were coming from New York, and they hurried down there.  And what I did was stay home, and I suppose I was watching it on television.  I must have been.  And they came in around five o'clock, and we had a big dinner and sent my relatives off to New York (laughter).  But of course Washington was all agog, you know.  But I wasn't down there in any of the confusion (laughter).  But otherwise, I mean, it was quite a time--
Story_ID: 193060
Speaker 1: Were you noticing a change in the students on campus [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at this time?  Were the students starting to change?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sure they were.  At that particular time, I don't remember, to tell you the truth, what the Howard students were involved--I did go one time to Howard when this business began of the protests.  And I went to Howard because there was an assembly there, and--I was just reading about him the other day.  Was it [Stokely] Carmichael [later Kwame Ture]?  I went to Howard when the students were taking part in the protests, and Stokely Carmichael--am I right?  Yes, I went up there that particular day, and that was quite a scene.  I had--
Speaker 1: Describe it.
Speaker 2: --never heard anybody go on like Stokely Carmichael did.  Of course he changed his name I know.  But he ranted and raved, and the chapel was all agog; now that I do remember.  And I suppose that I went up there because it was all over.  Well, they were telling you to go up there because the students were protesting.  And that's how I happened to go and hear him.  But--and I was just reading about him the other day.  But I did go up there because I was quite concerned myself about, you know, what was going on.  You couldn't live around here and not (laughter).  And the chapel was ringing with cheers and jumpin' and so forth and so on.  So I left there with the idea, I said "We're really gonna have troubles," and from then on there were troubles (laughter).  But I'm glad that I remembered his name though.
Speaker 1: Troubles like what?  What kinds of troubles?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, Howard began having protests in the '60s [1960s], and it was quite alarming, the way that things went on.  They were threatening everybody, these students.  And of course, my husband [K. Albert Harden] got involved because they went into the medical building and closed down the anatomy lab.  And they were, at that point, they were contending that the head of anatomy was not doing his job, which probably wasn't true, but they wanted to start trouble, which is what they did.  At that particular time the students threatened everybody.  The president [James Nabrit, Jr.] had to have guards in front of his house because of the protests, and a couple of the deans had been threatened.  It was quite an ominous time, and we lived through it, but it was an awful time.  They had to, for instance, they had to take President Nabrit from his office through a secret entrance.  The students had surrounded the building.  And as I say, some of the faculty members whom they did not particularly care for had to have guards around their home.

Speaker 1: How many different presidents have you worked under at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I started working under Mordecai Johnson.  And who was the next one?
Speaker 1: Was that [James] Nabrit [Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Nabrit, of course, yes, I worked under him, definitely, but he was--I don't--he probably succeeded President Johnson, I guess.  But I did not work under [HistoryMaker James] Cheek at all.  My husband [K. Albert Harden] did and for a very short time.
Speaker 1: What were some of the differences in the presidents?
Speaker 2: Some of the differences in the protests?
Speaker 1: The presidents.
Speaker 2: Oh, in the presidents.  Well, President Johnson ruled with an iron hand.  He was not interested either in hearing anybody else's criticisms.  Nabrit came at a very fortunate time.  He brought some different--for instance, President Johnson had been unconcerned about retirements and so forth.  And Nabrit came and got everybody, the people who worked at Howard who did the laboring jobs or whatever, he got them under a system of retirement for everybody.  Everybody had to take out teachers' insurance.  Under President Johnson, there was no plan for retirement for anybody except the executives.  Now Nabrit brought a different seeing altogether, and everybody was required to take out this teacher's insurance policy and retirement.  So things changed in that regard, and people were much happier.
Speaker 1: Earlier you had mentioned when you first went to Howard and you left to go with your husband out to the suburbs you regretted that decision.  Why did you regret that decision?
Speaker 2: Really I should--in fact, I tried to get a leave of absence, and the head of the library refused.  He said he didn't feel that my getting a leave would be of any benefit to them.  I guess he thought I wasn't ever coming back there.  And so I went ahead and resigned.  Now from the way that I have lived (laughter) later years, I should never have resigned that job.  I should have kept it because, for instance, I would have had a very nice retirement myself, you see.  And in this day and age, I mean two people need to (laughter) be working.  And the retirement now would be very nice for me.  I could do many things for my grand and great-grands (laughter) that I might like to do.  But I feel that it's no point in looking back, but I really feel that I never should have given up the job, not in this day and age (laughter); you don't give up jobs.

Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't already done yet?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a pretty tough question.  I feel that I've done about all I could do in this world.  I don't know anything that I regret that I didn't do.  I don't have any regrets so far (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how do you feel about the way that you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I feel very blessed.  I had a very good marriage, and from that standpoint, I really feel that I made a good choice (laughter).  And I had many experiences in my life.  I've traveled a lot, and I've enjoyed it.  So I really feel that I have done about the very--all, quite all of the things that I would like to have done.  I--really, when we went--we had a trip to India, my husband went to the Third World Congress on Medical Education, and we went to New Delhi [India].  Well, that was quite a trip.
Speaker 1: What year was that or about?
Speaker 2: It must have been in the '60s [1960s], '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s].  It's probably in the '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s], whichever.  And I did get to do a lot of traveling at the time.  I--my one idea at that particular time was to get to Hong Kong [China].  That is something that I really wanted to do, but my husband said that he had to be back at a certain time, and he did not have time to travel.  The Pan Am [Pan American World Airways] man told us, well, you've come through London [England], you've come through Germany, you've come through that way; now go back the other way.  And my husband said no, I have to be back at a certain time.  And he was suggesting Hong Kong, you know.  So that's the one thing that I missed.  But otherwise, I mean--I got a trip to South Korea, and that was really quite an event.  So, otherwise, I mean, I don't have any regrets (laughter).

Speaker 1: What are some of your concerns about, for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, to tell you the truth, at this particular time, I'm not too happy about some of our young people and the ideas that they are expressing about various things that are going on today.  I read about them quite a bit.  I get some of the black magazines.  And I really am not too impressed about the fact that they don't seem to be too interested in what's going on in the world.  And for instance, they don't seem to be too interested in the presidency and this business of the election.  I don't think--when I look at the television and see the audiences, I see very few young people, and they don't seem to be interested in that sort of thing.  Now that's the only thing that I can say.  And since I don't think, for instance, that my granddaughter is as interested as she should be in what's going on in the world.  Because when I talk with her, she's so interested in her job and bringing up the children, she doesn't seem to have time, you know, to think about what's going on in the presidency, for instance (laughter).
Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important and why?
Speaker 2: Values?  Well, I think to be honest is one of the things that I would appreciate and also to have some values in life that--I haven't spent much time thinking about things like that.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want your legacy to be?  How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I really want to be remembered as a person who was really interested in my family.  And I want my granddaughter and the grandchildren to remember me as a kind and loving parent and grandparent (laughter).  That's about it.
Story_ID: 193065
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?  Why do you think it's important for us to share our history, and why is it important?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's very important to share the history of any family.  Because I have said to my granddaughter that I really feel that she ought to take her children up to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] to--that she ought to get them to know some of the background there at Howard and to know that both the grandfather [K. Albert Harden] and I were both attached to Howard for many year.  And for instance, my husband's picture is in the hallway when you go in the medical school.  He became dean, you know.  And I think that, really, she should get these children to go and see what their forebears (laughter) have done and become acquainted with some of the background of her, of the relatives.  That's about it (laughter).

Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know about what year?
Speaker 2: (Laughter), oh dear--
Speaker 1: What do you think?
Speaker 2: I would say '70s [1970s], in the '70s [1970s], 'cause Hubert Humphrey's been dead a long time (laughter).

Speaker 2: It was when he was in college.
Speaker 1: And this is your husband right here, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, standing up there in the back, that's he.
Speaker 1: And what college?
Speaker 2: University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And it's the Omega Psi Phi fraternity picture?
Speaker 2: Omega Psi Phi.  He was--
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What year do you think?

Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That was taken when she was about probably a year old and was taken in Catonsville [Maryland].  The Afro took it, the Afro photographer.
