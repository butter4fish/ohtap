Kurt Piehler: This begins an interview with Ada Glasser Bloom on November 18, 1996 in
Edison, New Jersey with Kurt Piehler and …
Lara Fletcher: Lara Fletcher.
KP: We would like to begin by asking you some questions about your parents. Both
immigrated, I believe, from …
Ada Bloom: From Latvia, which was then under the control of Czarist Russia. The town where
my mother was born was Aahov. My father was born in Marienburg, about thirty-five miles
from Aahov.
KP: And do you know why they came to the United States?
AB: Well, I think my father came, probably, to avoid being drafted. During his generation,
during his lifetime, most of the young men who immigrated to this country from Russia and
Poland, came for that reason. And I never really asked him about it, but I know that other
members of the family came for that reason and I imagine he did, too. He was at the age where
he'd either have been drafted or had to escape. He came to the United States seven years before
my mother emigrated to the U.S. He was twenty-eight years old at the time. My mother arrived
at the age of fifteen.
KP: So your parents met in the United States?
AB: Well, not really. My parents were second cousins, so their families knew one another. And
when my father came to this country, he saw a picture of my mother. My mother was very
beautiful and he fell in love with her. And he sent her this beautiful picture postcard which has
lilies of the valley on it, no, violets. My sister, my one sister has that card. And he practically
proposed to her in that, on that postcard. And, of course, at that time, among the orthodox,
Jewish orthodox families, marriages were arranged. And I imagine her parents arranged her
marriage for her, too. And when she came to this country, she had no say in the matter, I guess.
And my father was considerably older than my mother. So, he wanted to make her look more
Americanized, and he took her to New York to buy clothes. This was even before they were
married. But the parents, apparently, my mother's parents consented to it. And my mother was
all of eighteen when they were married.
KP: And your father was in his thirties?
AB: My father was thirteen years older, yes. He was thirty-one.
KP: Which for your mother, this must have all been very shocking.
AB: The whole, the whole experience was. In fact, I have a younger sister who passed away just
about a year ago. And for a couple of years before she passed away, she worked on the family
genealogy. I've worked on it at times, too, but she did a more thorough job and completed it.

2

And, she has described a lot of the experiences that she was able to, you know, learn from my
mother before she passed away. And these are just some of the experiences that I've read in my
sister’s record.
KP: How did your mother adapt to America?
AB: I never heard that she didn't adapt well. I think they both adapted well. The interesting part
about my mother’s trip to America was that her father came here first. And he came here to see
if he really wanted to settle [here] and bring his family. And he was so ill from the voyage, when
he came, when he arrived, that he wasn't able to go back for his family to, you know, bring his
family with him. So he wrote to his wife, my grandmother, and told her to liquidate the family
business and whatever property they had, and just pack up and come. And that's what she did.
There were nine children at the time. And my grandmother handled everything. And my mother
had spoken, any number of times, about how they traveled. She said they sailed out of Liverpool,
but they traveled by ox cart, practically all the way from Russia to Liverpool. And then they took
the boat in Liverpool, and my mother had a very frightening experience on the boat. There were
so many children that, I guess, they had several state rooms. But my mother was with her
grandmother, my great grandmother, and my great grandmother had been ill during the trip. She
was well when they landed, but she had been ill during the trip. So when the boat arrived, they
quarantined my mother. And my mother, who was all of about fifteen at the time, I guess, fifteen
or sixteen, and very unsophisticated, was a very frightened child because there, she was left.
They landed in Philadelphia, which was quarantined for I don't know how many days, until they
released her and saw that she was not the carrier of any illness. And they lived in Philadelphia
for, I don't know how long, not too many years, I don't think. Then they moved to New
Brunswick. And actually, the house that they moved to in New Brunswick, I can recall very well,
because that's where my grandparents lived when I was growing up.
KP: So your grandparents also settled in New Brunswick?
AB: Oh, yes. My father's whole family and my mother's whole family all settled in New
Brunswick. Now, what originally brought them to New Brunswick, I don't know. My father
originally came to New Brunswick, though, whereas my mother went to Philadelphia. My
father's original home, when he arrived, was in New Brunswick.
KP: And you never knew the original reason why they settled in New Brunswick?
AB: No, I don't know whether somebody was here, a very distant relative might have been here
first and attracted them. I really don't know, because I don't know the sequence of their arrivals.
They were all, all I know is that my father did arrive before my mother's family.
KP: And what did your two families do to make a living?
AB: You mean in this country?
KP: Yeah.

3

AB: My father, when he arrived, went into the feed business. You know, that was the horse and
buggy days. And from what I could tell he, it was successful. And he had a feed store on Burnet
Street. Oh, and I’m remembering something else now. My mother worked for him for a while
before they were married. She was his bookkeeper, I think. And then my grandfather was
always, my grandfather was a sheet metal expert.
Lewis Bloom[husband]: Coppersmith.
AB: Coppersmith, yes. A lot of his work in Europe was for the very elite. You know, they all
had copper roofs and, didn't he work even for the, didn't he do some work for the czar?
LB: He …
AB: Lew sometimes knows more about my family.
LB: He was brought from Riga, by a brother of Count Zeppelin. Many of the German
aristocracy had dual titles in imperial Russia and in Germany. They had estates, because the
Teutonic knights had come through there and established themselves. So Graf von Zeppelin, the
duke, he was in Germany, and the baron took over the family estates in the area and he needed a
coppersmith in the village of Pothole which is near, it's further north, Estonia. And her
grandfather moved there. And I know this, because I used to discuss this with her grandfather.
AB: When he came to this country, he continued doing something in the sheet metal trade.
KP: And your father, what had he done?
AB: I don't know what he had done in [Russia], I really don't. I don't know that anyone in my
family ever knew.
KP: But he did very well in the feed business?
AB: He did very well in the feed business and then, I guess, when automobiles started to appear,
it wasn't very profitable anymore, and then my father had a movie theater. First in Perth Amboy.
The first one I remember, anyway. And then in Newark, and then the Depression came along
and our family was very hard hit. And then my father opened a retail store in New Brunswick
and that's what he was doing [at] the time that he passed away. My father, he was very young
when he passed away. He was forty-nine. And my mother was all of thirty-six with six children.
We were six kids.
KP: And six children in the midst of the Depression was quite a load.
AB: Oh, yeah, it was, we were really very hard hit. The family lost our house. I don't know how
they managed, really.

4

KP: Was your mother working before the Depression?
AB: My mother never really worked until the Depression came along. When my father opened
the store. And then, when my father passed away, my mother continued running the store for a
while. But during the war, it became very difficult to get merchandise. So that's when she closed
out the shop and worked in several stores in New Brunswick that don't exist anymore.
KP: So your mother kept the store going during the Depression?
AB: Yeah. She kept it, well, she and my father. My father died in 1934. That was probably still
the midst of the Depression.
KP: So it was only in the ‘40s that she ended up having to close the store.
AB: That's right. She shut the store, I'd say about, 1942 or ‘43, about that time.
KP: But it must have been very difficult to have a store in the Depression.
AB: Oh, it was. It was very, very difficult. They probably, they just eeked out a living, really.
My one brother was already in college, and that made it even tougher. He was at Rutgers. And
then, when my father passed away, I guess, maybe they were just about beginning to get back on
their feet. My brother was at Princeton, doing graduate work. He's the oldest.
KP: So he went to Rutgers and then Princeton?
AB: Princeton, yeah.
KP: You mentioned that you parents’ marriage was, in some ways, arranged in the orthodox
tradition. How observant was your family?
AB: They were quite observant. I wouldn't say that they were as observant as many of the
orthodox people we now know, but they had kosher homes. That was really strictly observed.
And I know they were very observant of the holidays, of all the holidays, not just the New Year.
I don't think that they went to services every evening and every morning, the way a lot of the
orthodox Jews, that I now know, do. I think that they went on Saturday, when it was convenient,
you know.
KP: Was the store open on …
AB: No, no, they conducted their business on the weekend.
KP: Did they …
AB: Yeah, they did. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

5

KP: They kept the store open on Saturday, except for the highest of holy days.
AB: That's right. That's right. And my father, when he had his movie [theater], I know, kept
that opened on Saturdays. And what happened, I guess, on the high holy days, somebody else
just ran it for him, because I know he wouldn't have, you know, conducted that business at that
time.
KP: The movie theater sounds so intriguing, because it was really the first generation that had
movies.
AB: Yeah, it was. I have a lot of good recollections, I would say. The first movie [theater] was
in Perth Amboy. And, at that time, there was no music, there was no soundtrack at all, so there
was a pianist right at the base of the stage. And it was a big treat for me. I would often, he
would let me sit with him. And also, they had a little booth at the front where they sold the
tickets and there was a cashier, but sometimes, my father would have to fill in. And I would feel
so important if I was allowed to sit there with him and just tear off the tickets, you know.
KP: How big was the theater?
AB: It certainly wasn't the size of the big theaters now. But it was bigger than the really small
theaters. I really don't know.
KP: It sounds like it fit a few hundred people.
AB: Probably, maybe two hundred. And also, the projectionist, there were no automatic,
projectors. The projectionist he actually turned it, turned the wheel, the crank. And, actually it
was rather hazardous, because they didn't have a heat control or anything, to help the film cool
off. And it was very, I can remember a couple of times when there were almost fires in the
projection booth.
KP: Oh, especially if the film stops ...
AB: That's right. Sure, sure. There just weren’t the precautions that they have now for it.
KP: What films did your father show? Do you remember any great classic of the silent screen?
AB: Well, I was so young at the time. I’m trying to, of course, there were, I couldn't remember
titles. But I remember there was, you know, Mary Pickford, Rudolf Valentino, and all the oldies.
I vividly recall "The Ten Commandments," and "Uncle John's Cabin," although I can't recall the
names of any of the stars. And of course, these were plenty of Cowboy and Italian movies,
"westerns."
KP: Why did your father leave the movie theater business?
AB: Well, the one in Perth Amboy was very, very profitable. That was probably the most

6

profitable time in my father’s business life. And he had a lease, and because it was so profitable,
the owner of the building wanted to turn it over to a family member. So my father lost the lease
and there was nothing he could do. And he spent about six months looking around for other
theaters. It was what he wanted to do, he was very successful at it. And he found this theater in
Newark called “the Lyceum,” on Springfield Avenue, which he watched for a number of weeks.
It was always crowded, and it looked as if it was the place to buy, so he bought it. And it was a
failure, because a lot of the people who were in there had been attracted, they didn't pay. The
owner of the theater had just filled up the theater [in] whatever way he could. I don't know how
long my father had it. A couple years, I guess, but he nearly lost everything there. And the
Depression didn't help, either. And then for, I think, for a year or so, he just did nothing, until he
found this other business to go into.
KP: Did he go into the retail store business alone?
AB: Yeah, just alone. I don't know how he had the experience, but he did the buying and
everything.
KP: Where was the store located?
AB: 305 George Street, where one of the big office buildings is now.
LB: The big red building.
AB: Yeah, the big red building. There were a number of stores. In fact, that whole block …
KP: Yeah, I remember.
AB: That whole block was a lot of small stores.
KP: Yeah.
AB: Are you from town?
KP: No, but I've been at Rutgers for a long time.
AB: Oh.
KP: I started in the early ‘80s, so I remember what was there, the small stores that were there in
the early ‘80s.
AB: Yeah.
KP: You grew up in Highland Park and New Brunswick.
AB: Right.

7

KP: Back then, the two towns were probably even closer together.
AB: They were.
KP: Do you remember when Highland Park was surrounded by fields?
AB: Oh, definitely. We lived on North Sixth Avenue, and I went to Hamilton School. And one
side on the lower part of North Fifth Avenue did not exist. It was all woods. We used to walk to
school through the woods. There was a path, and, in good weather, that's how we got to school.
It wouldn't be safe for kids to do that now, I know, but we did it. It was much shorter that way.
And this area where we're living was the dumps. Wasn't it?
LB: What?
AB: This area where we lived?
LB: The dumps ended, a little bit beyond Eighth Avenue, … but here was woods, because I used
to hunt here.
AB: Woods and dump.
LB: Heavy woods.
KP: I get the sense that, particularly in Highland Park, that you didn't even have enough students
to have a high school.
AB: They had a junior high school. I'm not sure how old Highland Park High is. It was there
for me. Oh, yes, my brother went there, too. I guess the high school was built in the early
thirties, probably. It was called Franklin Junior High School, and it went only to the ninth grade.
And then the students went to New Brunswick High School. And I know my brother, my oldest
brother, graduated from Franklin High. So I know it was there during his school days.
KP: But then you all went to New Brunswick for high school?
AB: Yes. But my family moved to New Brunswick when I was in the ninth grade, the middle of
the ninth grade. So that, I did not really graduate Franklin Park High. I [left] in the middle of the
year.
KP: But you should have graduated.
AB: I should have, but I spent one semester at Roosevelt High, which is now a middle school, I
think, in New Brunswick. And I always consider myself more of a Highland Park school, high
school graduate, than Roosevelt. I was very unhappy with that move.

8

KP: Why did your parents move from Highland Park to New Brunswick?
AB: Well, when we lost our house on North Sixth Avenue, we moved to North Tenth. And
then, there was an apartment over our building. The building where my parents had the store,
which became available and it made the living, made living expenses much lower. So they did it
for economy reasons. We moved above the store.
KP: And how was that move, to go from having a yard and living in a house to …
AB: Well, I know that I was, I was very unhappy. I was very depressed. Plus, I was leaving all
my friends that I had gone all through school with. And I knew that we'd be reunited in the tenth
grade, because they would all be coming over in the tenth grade. But just to leave them even for
that one term, you know, was pretty rough for me. I don't know how my other siblings handled
it, but I know, I recall that I was very unhappy about it.
KP: How good was the education you received in Highland Park and in New Brunswick High
School?
AB: I'd say it was excellent. For one thing, it was much more personal, [being that] the teachers
knew your family. The teachers knew everybody’s family. Our classes were larger, yet they
seemed to have a close relationship with their students and their families. I guess, one reason for
it was there weren't as many outside activities for anybody. So a lot of your activities centered
around the school.
KP: So what activities did you take part in while growing up?
AB: Well, I was, Girl Scouts was very important to me. I was a Girl Scout. And we had lots of
friends, of course. Coming from a family with six kids, we were never alone. We also, families
were very close. I had a lot of first cousins who lived within three to four blocks, and we were
constantly with one another. You know, we were the same ages. And some of their homes were
our second and third homes. And ours was that to them, too. So, it was very different. We
didn't have a lot of toys. My sister and I, my older sister and I, always shared everything. And
my two older brothers shared. And each of the younger ones had their own. But there seemed to
be a lot to do.
KP: What would you and your friends do for fun, especially in junior high and high school?
AB: Junior high and high school, junior high, I don't think I did too much, because I think my
family was already, already had the pinch, you know, the financial pinch. I belonged to a, in high
school, senior high, I belonged to a sorority. So that, thank goodness, those don't exist anymore
in high school.. That was a large part of my life. In the lower grades, I guess, even junior high,
at that time, the girls and boys played together more, I think, than they do now. And we played,
you know, during our younger years, hide and seek, and I was a tomboy, I guess. I played
baseball with them. We used to go to the, into the woods and have bonfires and toast
marshmallows and even baked potatoes. I don't think kids would be allowed to do that now. We

9

had a lot more freedom to do those sort of things, than kids have now, I think. In the spring we
would wonder in the woods picking wild flowers. We would also hike and picnic a lot.
KP: You mentioned that a high school sorority wasn’t a good idea.
AB: Well, I enjoyed it, but now when I look back at those days, I think it was horrible. Because
we actually used to blackball people. There were a couple of sororities, and we always
considered, the one that I belonged to, as the most elite. It was awful. It was really a snobbish,
very snobbish attitude and I know that girls were blackballed. Some people with whom I'm
friendly with now were blackballed from that sorority.
KP: Why would you reject people?
AB: I don't know, I guess, maybe, we didn't like where they lived or something. I don't know.
KP: You don't remember?
AB: No, I don't remember. I know, in my family, it was almost a tradition to belong. I have
older aunts who were members. You know, maybe three generations were members in the same
sorority, so you'd never be blackballed if you came from one of those families.
Lara Fletcher: Was your older sister in it?
AB: Yes, and my younger sister.
KP: And this was a high school sorority?
AB: High school, right. It was a national sorority. Phi Delt, they had frequent meetings in
Manhattan. And they used to have, we would have our own dance once a year. A formal. And
there would always be a national dance in some city. It wasn't in the same place as that. Wasn’t
that awful? There were fraternities, also. Lew belonged to a fraternity. But I don't think that the
fraternities were as snobbish. They might have been, I really don't know. But the fraternities did
horrible, physical things. They actually paddled the boys during initiation. We never did
anything like that.
KP: Was the sorority religiously segregated?
AB: It was Jewish.
KP: So you were all Jewish?
AB: Yes, we were all Jewish. Yeah, yeah. I don't know of any Christian sororities at the time. I
don't know. In fact, I guess I can talk about [it] because I certainly don't hold it against these
people now. When my family moved to North Sixth Avenue, I was about four years old, I guess,
and Highland Park was very anti-Semitic.

10

KP: That’s interesting, because now Highland Park is the quintessential Jewish community.
AB: Oh, well, it’s unbelievable. We had a family living next door to us whose children were not
allowed to play with us. And they would actually pass our house and spit and say terrible names.
And the mother, it must have been the mother’s influence, because she passed away during a
scarlet fever epidemic, and a maiden aunt came to live with them. And one of the children was
my contemporary, we were in school together and everything, and the aunt became very friendly
with my mother, this anti-Semitic feeling just died. It was, it just didn't exist anymore. And
some of my best friends at school were Christians and we were very friendly at school, but I was
never invited to their parties. And I was never invited to their house after school, which was, I
don't know if kids still do that, but at that time, that was the customary thing to do. And I really
used to feel bad about it, but I never knew the reasons and, just about ten or fifteen years ago, I
was chairing one of our college reunions, and most of the people on the committee are people
who live in the area. And [there were] about half a dozen girls I went through school with from
kindergarten through college. And the ones that are in the area, still function on these committee,
and I had a luncheon here for the first meeting, and one of the people that I was very friendly
with at school was here. And I mean, we don't have any ill feelings for one another at this time,
at all. And a few days after the meeting, I got this beautiful letter from her, which I have upstairs,
thanking me for, you know, for chairing and the lovely lunch and everything. And she said,
“Now, I’d like to tell you something that you never knew. You were always one of my favorite
people.” And what she was telling me was that, you know, that if it were up to her we would
have been much closer as children. I should mention that our family never encountered any anti
semitism among the teachers in either school, elementary or Franklin High.
KP: So it sounds like it was due to her parents.
AB: Oh, it definitely it was. I mean, how could a young child know about these things unless
they heard it at home? But it was that, that attitude existed amongst all those girls that I went to
school with. And I know it doesn't exist anymore. But if I met any of them at our reunions, they
were overly gracious, really, and so nice. So I know it was a parental thing.
KP: When did you think that broke down? Because you lived in the area and you raised kids in
the area.
AB: Yeah. Well, I left the area, I was in the ninth grade, so I kind of left everything behind in
Highland Park. In New Brunswick, I didn't run into that.
KP: You didn't sense that at all?
AB: Didn't sense that at all, no.
KP: So you would be invited to stay at your friend’s houses in New Brunswick?
AB: I don't think I had as many …

11

KP: Christian friends?
AB: Christian friends. I really didn't. In fact, I kind of, I probably was a loner that first six
months or so that I went to this other school, and then all my friends from Highland Park came to
New Brunswick and I had a nucleus of Jewish friends that I was close with. At that point, I didn't
miss the attention that I might have wanted from my Christian friends earlier, you know, in the
earlier grades. And then, I left New Brunswick. I didn't encounter any of that at Douglass, at all,
and these same girls were there. Because our relationships were different, you know, we didn't
invite one another to houses the way kids did at that time. And then, we were away from this
area until 1958. When we came back, I don't think my children encountered any of it.
KP: So by the late ‘50s …
AB: Yeah, by the late, I'm sure it didn't exist even before then. I think a lot of these feelings
started to fade after the war, probably. I know I ran into it even when I, my first job, which was
with Pathe News. I had no experience in the film library where I worked. The women were just
wonderful. But I was walking to the station to work one day with one of the other, a male
employee, I don't remember what he did, something on the technical end, and he said something,
made some derogatory remark about Jews. And I said to him, “You know, I'm insulted. You've
offended me. I'm Jewish.” He said, “Oh, well, I don't mean you.” You know, in a typical
remark. “Some of my best friends are Jews.” But that was the only time I ran into it during my
career days, I guess.
KP: When you were going to school, what were your career goals? Did you have career goals?
AB: I'm not sure that I did. I really am not sure that I did. I know that when I, even when I
applied to college and started going to Douglass. I don't think that, the first year or so, I had, I
knew I wanted to major in economics but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. But then, I guess, by
the time I was in my junior year, I knew there was a great need for librarians. And that's when I
decided, you know, to major in library science. And then, when I started library school, I didn't
feel that I made a mistake, but I knew that I never wanted to be just a regular librarian. I wanted
to specialize. I decided I wanted to be a business librarian. Something in one of these
corporations or banks or what have you. And I really stuck to my goals there and I wouldn't
accept any interviews for school libraries or public libraries. However, I did end up in a school
library many years later, but I was ready for it then. But initially, I didn't want to have anything
to do with that. I accepted interviews only towards these very specialized positions.
LF: Was education stressed in your home?
AB: Oh, yes. Very much so. Very, very, very much so.
LF: And you and your sisters all went to college at one point?
AB: Well, my older sister went to work when she got out of high school. She didn't want to go

12

to college. She went to work, and after she was married, she regretted that she hadn't gone to
college, so she did start college, I’m trying to remember what year it would be. Probably in the
‘50s, when they, when Douglass first started accepting married women. They had a special
program. And then she had to take a couple of years off. She was raising a family and then she
went back and she did graduate, probably in about, I think I left her graduation date open. I
meant to ask her about it. She lives in Florida now. I meant to ask her and I forgot. But in the,
probably ’59 or early ‘60, when she finally graduated. My younger sister, I can't understand why
she gave up college, because she was, she and I are much more alike. She had a scholarship and
everything. And she went one year and just decided that she didn't want to go back. She was
more interested in earning some money, too, I guess. So she went for one year. And my two
other brothers did not go to college. The younger one didn't because the war came along.
KP: You had one brother who went on to Rutgers and Princeton, right?
AB: Yeah, well, my parents encouraged education to the Nth degree. I think, I can't think of any
of our friends who had the World Book and Encyclopedia Britannica and Harvard Classic. We
had all those things and we used to go to the library a lot. So it was certainly encouraging.
KP: I'm curious about your brother who went to both Rutgers College and Princeton. Princeton
was well-known for its anti-Semitism.
AB: Well, he had a scholarship. And, well, my brother was a very unusual person. This is very
interesting, speaking of anti-Semitism. Abe graduated high school at fifteen. He was a genius,
he really was. And he applied to Rutgers as a pre-med and he was rejected. And the town was
up in arms, because here, he had been either valedictorian or salutatorian of his class. The whole
school system was up in arms. They said that they would not accept any more NJC or Rutgers
students as practice teachers if they didn't accept him.
KP: The town was up in arms.
AB: Oh, yeah, they were up in arms. And my father, finally, went to speak to, I don't know, the
dean or the president of Rutgers, I don't know who he went to see. And they said the reason they
hadn't accepted him was because he was too young for pre-med. My father said then that he will
apply as pre-law. And they accepted him. I mean, that was their way out. And after that, we
found out, we had one Christian neighbor on our block who was not anti-Semitic. She was very
close to us and there was, I don't want to mention names, but there was somebody in the
neighborhood who had a high position at Rutgers, and she knew, through him, he had actually
told her that he was the one who kept my brother from being accepted.
KP: So they were trying to keep your brother out?
AB: Oh, yeah, because he was Jewish. Absolutely. I don't think they'd admit to it, but it
absolutely was anti-Semitic.
KP: What year did your brother graduate?

13

AB: He made Rutgers in three years, Phi Beta Kappa. See, my father died in 1934, he graduated
Rutgers in 1932 or ‘33.
KP: Your brother was Rutgers Class of ’30?
AB: ’32 or ’33.
KP: So he applied to Rutgers in the late 20’s?
AB: Oh, yeah, yes, yes. And, as I said, he had a scholarship at Princeton. My father wouldn't
have been able to afford to send him, I'm sure. And, I guess, he was about the youngest grad
student there.
KP: What did he study at Princeton?
AB: Political Science. He never finished his Ph.D. because my father died, and he felt that he
should help support the family. While Abe was at Princeton, he was offered a position in
Washington in the Attorney General’s office, and he was just selected. I guess they had
contacted Princeton and asked them to recommend people and Abe felt that he could help out the
family, financially, if he took the job. He was all of about nineteen, maybe, certainly no more
than twenty, and he went to work in Washington and never did finish, never did get his Ph.D.
But after working for a number of years, he was told that he could go just so far because he
didn't, you know, have any further degree. And they suggested, and they suggested to him that he
get his law degree. So he applied to the evening classes at either Georgetown or George
Washington University, I can't remember which one. And after going a few evenings, he felt that
he knew more than the professors knew. So he dropped out and he was allowed to take the Bar
[exam]. He boned up on it and he passed the Bar. And he, during the war, the war broke out a
number of years after that, he really helped establish the Office of Price Information for the
government. That was the agency, during the war, that controlled prices, and he, a lot of his
activity was in the Supreme Court. He really, he wanted to go on. Do you want me to go on
about him?
KP: Oh, yes.
AB: He had a very interesting professional life. When the war was over and the Office of Price
Information was dropped, there was no need for it, he went into private practice in New York
with two other legal friends of his. I guess, they were struggling for a couple of years there. So,
to supplement his income, he became a law professor at the Rutgers Law School in Newark.
And a student delved into his background, he said something in class once, which one of the
students didn't like and felt that he was a communist. So they delved into his background and
they came across some information which kind of pointed at part of his background that was
questionable. So Rutgers, I want to make sure that I get the sequence of events correctly. He had
been called before the, not the House Un-American Activities Committee, but whatever the other
committee it was.

14

KP: Was it a state committee, State Committee on Un-American Activities?
AB: I think that's what it could have been. I think it was someone at Rutgers [who] really started
the ball rolling in that direction. Anyway, he was promised that there would be no publicity
there, that the newsreel wouldn't be there, the radio, newspaper reporters wouldn't be there, in
Washington. He came there, and he was surrounded by cameras. So he took the Fifth
Amendment, although he promised Rutgers that he would tell everything that had to be told but,
of course, he didn't, because they had broken their promise to him. And as a result, Rutgers fired
him. And he went through some very difficult years there. He really, you know, not only
financially but emotionally and professionally. He was just heart-broken because no body would
touch him with a ten-foot pole. And then the air kind’ve cleared, and he was offered a lot of
legal jobs in Jersey City and other areas. And he was really a lawyer’s lawyer. He was very, very
successful. Very successful. But he went through a period of about five or six years there, where
he was just a broken man. And to this day, we've tried any number of times, to get Rutgers to
reverse their decision, and refuse.
KP: When was the last time you tried to have a …
AB: Just about three or four years ago. Dr. Bloustien was still alive. How many years ago did
he pass away, because it …
KP: He passed away in 1989.
AB: Oh, so it’s more, longer than I thought. He was no longer alive the last time we tried. And
my brother’s widow lived up in Massachusetts. She has two children, and we were working
through someone that we knew at Rutgers and we knew that (Jeannie?), my sister-in-law, had a
letter from Dr. Bloustien telling her that, he knows that it was the wrong decision. And in his
mind, Abe is cleared, but there was nothing he could do with the Board of Trustees or anyone
else at Rutgers that had that power. And we were asked for a copy of that letter. So I called my
sister-in-law, and she never got back to me, never had the letter, but we did it on our own. You
know, we continued to pursue on our own. And we were just told that, we were told that Rutgers
felt that they had done what they had to do and that was it. And we've kind of given up at this
time . For his letter, Dr. Bloustien did say that if the two children ever wanted to come to
Rutgers, he would see to it that they were given scholarships. And that he felt that might ease the
wounds somewhat.
LB: He wrote a letter.
AB: Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying. In that letter he said that. And we've just kind of given
up for the time being.
KP: It sounds like your older brother was fairly influential on you.
AB: I think he was. I really think he was. Of all the siblings, I think Lew and I were about the

15

closest to him, and we knew more about what was going on in his life than the others. Abe was a
very independent person. Very unconventional, too. But we accepted it and, you know, we
respected him, and I think he felt comfortable with us, and, you know, we felt comfortable with
him. He was a very good person. I know that he made a lot of sacrifices for the family and I
could overlook any of his other shortcomings.
KP: Because all siblings have shortcomings.
AB: Yeah, don't we all?
KP: How important was getting married to you when you were in junior high or high school?
AB: I don't think it was at all.
KP: You didn't have this notion that you had to get married?
AB: No, no, no. In fact, I was very unsophisticated. I wasn't allowed to use makeup until I was
about sixteen, I guess, if that. And then, we used, it was called Tangee, which was a very pale
lipstick, you know.
LF: I know that one.
AB: You had that restriction, too?
LF: Yes, I did.
AB: I didn't know it existed anymore.
LF: It did in my family.
KP: Why did you major in economics?
AB: I don't know. I just, I wasn't interested in education, you know, teaching. I had no artistic
skills and, I don't know, maybe because my older brother majored in economics in Rutgers. He
may have influenced me. But I did enjoy the courses, and I did quite well.
KP: This continues our interview with Ada Bloom, joined by Barbara Tomlin. And I just want
to ask you about your chosen major. In some ways, economics was not the traditional major for
women.
AB: I don't know. When I think of all the girls that were in my economics class, I think there
were quite a few that were majoring in it. Maybe they were splitting their major with something
else. And of course, I was splitting mine with library sciences, you know. By my junior year, I
knew I would be splitting it.

16

KP: Did you follow the news when you were growing up? How much did you know about what
was going on in the world?
AB: I guess we knew what was going on in our area. I don't know how much of it [went]
beyond that. I can remember the Lindburg kidnapping case, you know, the sensation that that
caused. And I can remember the wreck of the Graf Zeppelin and …
KP: You probably remember the Hall/Mills murder.
AB: I can remember the, you know, the talk of it in the house. And I remember the, at that time,
there would be extra editions of the newspaper and there would be people out in the street,
shouting, “Extra! Extra!” You know, “Read all about it.” But I don't think, until maybe I was in
high school, that I was really cognizant of ...
----------------------------------------END OF TAPE ONE, SIDE ONE---------------------------------KP: It was cut off. You did work in your mother's store?
AB: Oh, yeah, I used to help out, and Saturdays, I worked elsewhere as a salesgirl in local shops,
because I had to earn some money, I also baby sat. And when I was in college, I had what they
called a NYA job, it was National Youth Administration. You could make about three and a half
dollars a week working twelve hours a week or something like that. Well, there was no
minimum pay then.
KP: What did you do for the NYA?
AB: The only real time that I remember, senior year, when I was in library school, I actually
worked after classes with the professors. I corrected catalog cards and did research for them and
that sort of thing. I don't recall what sorts of jobs I had before that, but I did have NYA jobs all
along.
LF: I’m currently a Douglass student. Did you have a scholarship?
AB: I had a scholarship. It was a hundred dollars a year. Can you believe that?
LF: Oh, my.
AB: You'd be surprised how far that went. It really did. I think it paid all of my tuition, because
my mother wouldn't have had any money. Oh, I had a loan. How could I forget them? When I
got out of , when I graduated, I had about a three or four hundred dollar loan that I had to pay off.

LF: Did a lot of your high school friends also go to NJC? Did they go through in a similar way?
AB: One or two of my close friends. Most of my close friends were pretty much in the same

17

predicament as I. I think I only had one friend who went there with me whose family could
afford almost anything. But the rest of us were all pretty much in the same boat.
LF: It seems kind of unusual to me that you knew so many women who went to college. I know
my grandmother never finished high school. It just seems like there was a high number of
women that did go on past high school.
AB: I'd say that a very large percentage of my class that I graduated with went on to college. I
think we were, it was just becoming much more acceptible, much more expected of us, I guess.
Not as much so as now, but it wasn't as unusual then. I had a lot of friends that didn't go, who
went on to business school. And it wasn't that they couldn't afford to. It was just that they
weren't interested. They probably didn't want to give the time to it.
LF: What type of activities were you involved in when you were at Douglass?
AB: Not too many, because I didn't live at school. I commuted. My, I lived just about a half a
mile away, so I would even go home for lunch, most of the time, to save money. But I didn't
have too much time, and a lot of the activities were at night. And I couldn't see going back and
forth. I guess I wasn't that interested. I probably could have done it, if I was more stimulated. I
think I could have enjoyed college more if I did live there. This was like almost a continuation of
high school for me. And, although, I enjoyed my classes, I don't think I had as an exciting
extracurricular life as I had in high school. I know that with Junior Show, I was in charge of
selling tickets for that, in charge of the ticket committee for that. But other than that, and the
Bees, the Bees was the commuting group. Located at the bottom of, the lower level of what was
the recitation building, I think. I don't know what it is now. It's one of those brick buildings that
faces Bishop Place.
LF: Is it near College Hall?
AB: Yeah, it’s near College Hall, yes. There are two brick buildings and the basement of one of
those was sort of a lounge. It wasn't, it didn't look like a basement. And that's where the Bees
would park themselves in-between classes or, they even had some cots that, and I think, if you
had a reservation, you could stay overnight if you had to. So we used to kind of gather there. I
think I'm more active in college activities now than I was then.
LF: So you weren't involved with sororities, even though you were in one in high school.
AB: No, I don't, Douglass didn't, NJC didn't have sororities, I'm pretty sure.
KP: Even illicitly?
AB: No, they had honorary sororities, that sort of thing, but not social, no. Do they have them
now?
LF: Not exactly on campus, no. They have sororities where they accept Douglass women but

18

they're not a Douglass sorority. I mean, they have honor sororities.
AB: Yeah, yeah that's all they had when I went there.
KP: Because we know that Rutgers College was very oriented towards the fraternities.
AB: Oh, yes, definitely. Yeah.
KP: And there was no movement to start a similar sorority tradition at NJC?
AB: I don't think so. Not that I could, there might have been [one] among the resident students
that I didn't know about, but I'd never heard anything.
LF: Was campus safety an issue when you were at school? I know that today, it is a very big
concern, especially on the Douglass campus.
AB: No, I don't think so at all. There was no issue of security in that whole area, wouldn't you
say?
LB: The only security, that I remember, that existed wasn’t predicated on the security situation
today. If you wanted to date a girl, you'd go in, you'd have to leave the house after a certain time.
AB: There were a lot of restrictions.
LB: They were very strict.
AB: That wasn't security. That was just social restrictions. There were no males allowed in, I
think, beyond their living rooms, if that's what they call it. It was very rigid. In fact , just a few
weeks before graduation, one of the freshman squealed on a senior, whom I knew very well,
saying that she had a male friend in the room. That girl, she graduated but she was not allowed
to come to graduation. Yeah, they didn't suspend her, but she was not allowed to attend
graduation.
KP: One of the things I’m struck by was how the Douglass newspaper was more serious than the
Rutgers paper. My students often commented that it was a much more thoughtful paper and was
much more concerned about world events and other things. Do you recall anything about that?
AB: I don't even remember. No, you know why? It was probably, it involved the girls living on
campus probably much more than me. We spent so much time going back and forth.
KP: That is something that current Douglass and Rutgers students would fully understand,
because they spend a great time on …
LF: On the buses.

19

AB: On the buses, yeah.
Barbara Tomlin: Did you take the bus or did you drive here?
AB: No, we didn't. All of our classes were right on the Douglass campus.
BT: And when you went from home to school?
AB: No, I walked.
BT: You walked?
AB: I lived between New Street and Paterson, not Paterson, Schureman. I lived between, yeah
close to Livingston Avenue And it was about, what, half a mile, if that? So I would walk to get
there in the morning, and if I didn't stay for lunch, I'd walk home for lunch and walk back. So we
spent a lot of time doing that. On reason why I walked was to save money, probably. But the
walking, as I look back, if I did as much of it now as I did then, I would be a lot better off,
probably. Now we live in cars.
BT: It must have been a little nippy in the winter time, though.
AB: There were only one or two girls who if they lived in Bayonne or Jersey City or Trenton,
those areas, traveled by train or bus. But there were a couple of girls, who every once-in-a-while,
had their family car, you know, their parents car.
BT: Most young people didn’t have cars during this time.
AB: Oh, unheard of.
BT: Unheard of, yeah.
LB: Automobiles were restricted.
BT: Oh, were they?
LB: At Rutgers.
AB: Well, I don't know that they had restrictions at Douglass, but nobody had them, anyway.
Nobody actually had a car that they kept there. It was the commuting students who every oncein-a-while, you know, would drive.
KP: Did you attend chapel when you were there?
AB: Yes, it was required, twice a week. It was required every Tuesday and every Friday.

20

KP: Because we’ve read in some of the Douglass papers that the NJC authorities admonished
the women several times for not taking chapel seriously enough. Do you remember your
attitudes towards chapel?
AB: I don't remember. We were pretty serious about it, I guess. But I wasn't a knitter then. But
I can visualize that sort of thing probably going on.
KP: One of the complaints about chapel was that it wasn’t interesting enough. Did you hear any
prominent people speak at the chapels you attended?
AB: I don't think, during their weekly services, if they had anyone prominent. ...
KP: You wouldn’t have any authors or politicians or …
AB: I have, no. No, I could be wrong. I just, nobody stands out in my memory, really.
KP: Because it is very memorable for a lot of Rutgers people. Apparently Norman Thomas was
a regular and …
AB: Oh, no, I don't think we ever had, no, no.
KP: No one like that?
AB: No, I don't think so.
KP: What were the services like?
AB: I don't remember it being very Christian. I really don't. But I don't know how attentive I
was. I don't think I did anything rude, but I don't think I was, maybe we just kind of rested when
we went there. I really don't think I was, if I had been more attentive, I probably could remember
more of the details than I do.
BT: So, obviously, it wasn't offensive or …
AB: No, I don't think so. I never felt that unwilling or that uncomfortable about going.
KP: You went to Douglass when NJC was still very concerned with tradition.
AB: Right, very traditional.
KP: Beginning from first year.
AB: Right, yeah, yeah, it was very traditional. If we attended any sort of luncheon or tea, a lot of
them were given at Woodlawn, we always wore white gloves, a hat, and I don't know whether
this practice still exists, but during your senior year, Dean Corwin was the dean when I was there,

21

each Friday after chapel, a group of seniors were invited to lunch at her house. It that still done?
LF: We still have dean teas and socials.
AB: But this was an actual lunch.
LF: I'm not aware of those.
AB: We were dressed in our finest.
LF: I mean, we're not required to go to chapel.
AB: It was very formal. It was a very formal lunch.
LF: I don't know about that one.
AB: That was a very important part of my senior year, I think.
KP: So you would go to lunch with the dean?
AB: Yeah, one lunch with the dean. And there were about, maybe, six or eight girls invited to
each lunch, each time. There were only about three hundred, well, fewer than three hundred, in
my class. We started out with more, but I think it was under three hundred by the time we
graduated. So everybody knew everybody else. We really did.
KP: You also mentioned you had initiation rights, in terms of …
AB: Yeah, yeah. Well, we had, it was just the costume that we had to wear. It was a green
apron and it was a Scotty hat and beanie, I mean, and we had to carry a shopping bag. That's
strange. Each year, it was …
BT: What was going with the shopping bags?
AB: Well, we had to carry our books and everything in the shopping bag. Bag ladies.
KP: And you also mentioned that each class had its own dress.
AB: Yeah, yeah. Each class, each year had its colors. Our year was, our senior year was
maroon, gray and maroon. And I remember one class was yellow and blue. I don't remember the
other colors. I don't know when they did away with that.
BT: When did you wear the special colors?
AB: You could wear them at any time. We could wear the dresses any time. But you didn't get
them ‘till about the middle of your junior year. They were sure you were there to stay, I guess.

22

In fact, when you, if you do interview Frieda Feller, she still has her’s. Frieda's a saver. She'll
have a lot of interesting things for you.
BT: When did you actually where them?
AB: Well, special, we didn't wear them for graduation. We wore cap and gown. But if there
was any special ceremony, you wore them. But you were free to wear them anytime. I mean, it
was just another school outfit. Yeah.
BT: Was there anything special that you did at graduation?
AB: I don't think, I don't …
BT: The same thing always happened. The juniors carried, well, they ...
AB: I know it was raining and we were lined up in the drizzling rain outside. I don't remember
anything that eventful, you know. Only thankful that, just graduating.
KP: But you had the Sacred Path.
AB: We had the Sacred Path, we had the Yule Log. Do they still have the Sophomore hop and
Junior Prom and Christmas Dance? Oh, they were beautiful formals.
LF: No, no. I read about them in the Caellian, actually. And it just seemed to dominate the
paper. They would talk about it every week.
AB: Well, that was the top of the social, the most important part of your social life there, I guess.
Do they have any formals?
LF: No.
AB: No?
LF: No.
AB: You don't know what you’re missing.
KP: The students have made comments that they are very jealous of the social world that
Douglass and Rutgers had.
LF: You guys did everything.
AB: The rooms used to be beautifully decorated. The girls would do that. Christmas was just
beautiful. I think our Christmas Dance was in the old music building, and it was beautiful. It
was beautiful, and I don't observe Christmas, but I appreciated the decorations and everything so

23

much. It was just lovely. Does Rutgers have the prom? Because Rutgers always the ...
KP: Yeah, but not anymore.
LF: It’s more the sororities and fraternities that have formals. But other than that, it doesn't
happen.
AB: You’re missing a lot, wouldn’t you say?
KP: My students have been very envious of that part of Rutgers.
LF: There were so many plays. Did you see a lot of plays?
AB: No, I didn't. I guess for the same reason that I just didn't participate in a lot of the nighttime activities. It was just like a continuation of high school for me. That's why I say, I think I
would have been much happier and I would have had much more to talk about had I lived there.
You know, been on campus.
KP: I was wondering if you remember an effort by Douglass to get the dean’s office to create a
dating bureau for the Rutgers men? Do you have any memory of that?
AB: No, I didn't ...
KP: The proposal created such an uproar that they ended up shelving the idea. They would
basically have the women of Douglass fill out cards, and then the men …
AB: Was that while Dean Corwin was [in charge?]
KP: Yeah.
AB: Now, but that may have applied more to the girls on campus than to me.
KP: Yeah, we were very intrigued by the whole incident.
AB: Yeah, I'm not aware of that at all. Kind of amuses me.
KP: Do you remember the big debate going on at Rutgers and NJC over America’s involvement
in the war?
AB: I don't remember any.
KP: Any aid to the allies, fund drives …
AB: I don't remember that at all.

24

KP: Do you remember anything about the coming of the war, in general, during the ‘30s and the
early ‘40s?
AB: Well, I can remember my family talking about it a lot, you know, and being very upset over
what they would read about, the anti-Semitism, and I can also recall that there were times when
they wondered if it was really true. ‘Cause when it first started happening, it was difficult to
really believe that those things were happening. But other than that, I can't remember too much
going on, about, you know, peoples’ feelings, while I was still at Douglass, ‘cause Pearl Harbor
came along the December after I graduated, and that's when most of my, when I, when most of
my thoughts, you know, come to mind. From that point on, Pearl Harbor day on …
KP: But at Douglass, you don't remember any of the debates over aid to the allies or …
AB: No, no, I don't. No, I don't at all.
KP: We should have asked this earlier, but you mentioned that your favorite professor was
Frances Hopkin?.
AB: Yeah, yeah, he was.
KP: What do you remember about him?
AB: Well, I just, he was very interesting. He was very relaxed and you felt very relaxed in his
classes. He was very fair. He was kind and he was just a very likable person. There was another
one that, really, if I had been asked for a second choice, was Ms. Higgins in the library school.
There were three professors in the library school. And of the three, the one that I really got along
best with was Ms. Higgins. And I just, there was a closeness that I could develop with her that I
just couldn't develop with the other two professors. And I've always kind of admired her.
KP: You mentioned earlier that professors were not only concerned with academics, but they
were often almost as concerned with formalities and customs.
AB: Absolutely, and the behavior, mostly in Library School, during my senior year.
KP: Yeah, as to what you learned in the classroom. And you mentioned that it was also
significant in terms of getting a job, that they taught you how to interview and how to dress and
so on.
AB: That was very important. But I guess I was a rebel.
KP: In fact, there was even a dress code for NJC, wasn’t there?
AB: I don't remember a dress code.
KP: You weren’t allowed to wear pants, as I recall.

25

AB: No, I wore pants.
KP: Really?
AB: Sure I did, yeah. I'm pretty sure. Certainly, senior year, I can, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, I think
so.
LF: I think it was for the dining hall.
AB: I was just gonna say, for certain social occasions and possibly the dining hall, which I
wouldn't know because, you know, I …
KP: There was a real emphasis on dressing the right way for certain events?
AB: Oh, definitely, yeah, yeah. And of course, I don't know how it was in other fields, but
certainly in, you know, the library science department, where they really made sure that you were
dressed properly for an interview.
KP: You graduated in June of 1941. When did you get your first job?
AB: Well, I worked summers, every summer, as a camp counselor. So I wasn't interested,
actually, I wasn't interested or that anxious to have a job during the summer. I started working in
September of ’41, when I got home from camp. I had a few interviews before, you know, for
jobs in the fall. And as I said earlier, I didn't get them and I felt like a failure. And then the job
that I really wanted was the one with Pathe News. And that's the one I did get and I started in
September of ‘41.
KP: Going back to the summer camp. Which camp was it?
AB: The first one was the Carlisle Olympus, which was up in near Poughkeepsie, in that area.
And I think I was there for one or two years. Then the next two years, I was at Scatico, which
was owned by Nat Holman, the basketball hero from City College?
LB: Basketball.
AB: Basketball, I mean. He was the basketball coach at City College, during his day. It was his
camp. They were both very well-run camps, and I was just a general counselor, initially, and
then I became a group leader, I guess that's what it was. With about eight counselors under me,
all for about, all for a hundred dollars for the summer. Hundred dollars plus tips. And if you
weren't a group leader, you were paid fifty dollars for the summer. And you worked hard.
KP: Had you gone to camp growing up?
AB: Girl scout camp for weekend, short periods. Weekends, or just a week or two at a time.

26

But never for a whole season.
KP: And I'm, I should have asked you this in order, but who sponsored your group?
AB: There was a Mrs. Waller. Her husband, I think, was a professor at Rutgers at one time.
And there was a Mrs. Nicholas, who was related with our group. But I remember Mrs. Waller
the best, because we would meet in Hamilton School, where I attended classes, and then the
practical part of scouting, where you learned to set a table and make a bed and do things properly,
we would go right to her house. And that's where she would teach us. I don't think that's part of
the Girl Scout program now at all, is it?
KP: You mentioned that you felt very provincial, even after graduating from college.
AB: Oh, I did. I really did. Highland Park was just a village, really, when I was growing up, and
New Brunswick was just a small town. I was just a small-town girl.
LF: How was it working in New York then?
AB: It was very exciting to me. I had no fears. I had a cousin who instructed me on how to get
around in New York. He told me that Fifth Avenue was sort of the divider. And one side of
Fifth Avenue was east and the other side is west and that's how I learned to get around New
York. And it was, I just loved it. I didn't mind the commuting and I just found it very exciting.
Of course, working at Pathe News was very exciting to begin with. That was the Pathe Newsreel
Company, which, I don't know if you’re even familiar with it.
BT: With newsreels
KP They have some of the newsreels on the American Movie Classics Channel.
AB: And my first job was, they had offices in this horrible old building on West 45th Street.
Then they moved to these beautiful offices, very glamorous offices at 625 Madison Avenue.
And, I guess, in today's world, I'd be considered a yuppie. I was just another librarian at that
time.
KP: How many librarians were there?
AB: There were, there was one head librarian and then I was the only other professional
librarian. Then there were two other sort of clerks.
KP: What would you do on a typical day?
AB: I had to be trained. It required a lot of training because, it wasn't the traditional library
work. Their whole function was to catalog all the newsreels. So I was trained, in a projection
room, to watch the newsreel each week. And then, in longhand, write a full description of what I
saw. So I had to learn how to identify people, identify planes, identify anything I looked at. I

27

had to learn to understand football and baseball, which I don't understand to this day. And then,
from my notes, it would be typed up on large cards, and then from those cards, I would catalog
by subject. In other words, there were, if there was footage on, say, Rutgers University, you
would have to make out your catalog card. And they used very small catalog cards. And you
didn't put too much description on that card, but you indicated in what newsreel it would be
found, and very briefly describe what the card was for. And the people [who] used the library,
were not only the producers and directors of the newsreels, but we had people from the outside,
you know, Hollywood directors. And they, and they were [looking for] stock shots. They would
come to Pathe News for stock shots. In fact, when I see a movie now, I can very often tell that
what I'm seeing is a stock shot. It might not be from Pathe News, but you can tell that it’s a stock
shot. Yeah, yeah.
KP: So you were paid to watch a lot of newsreels?
AB: There was one newsreel each week, but it would take a long time to watch it, and then it
took at least a week to get all that prepared for the catalog.
BT: Was there a library where you went or someone you could talk to help you identify some of
the things on the newsreels?
AB: No, I could find out. Sometimes there were the photographer’s notes or the head librarian,
who had been there longer than I, naturally, and she would help out. Initially, she would go over
everything I did, anyway. But it was amazing, I guess, when you're younger, you pick up things
more quickly, anyway. And then, of course, when the war came along, it was a very exciting
place to work. And then I really had to learn my identifications, which I did. I don't think I could
do it now.
KP: So you were following the news very closely at this time?
AB: Oh, yes, yes. I was very well-informed at the time.
BT: Did you use the newspapers to help you identify anything on the newsreels?
AB: Well, as I recall, we did not depend on the newspapers.
BT: How interesting.
AB: We, I guess, [figured it out] among ourselves, and the photographer’s notes would help us
out.
LF: Did you notice any major contradictions between what the newsreels were saying and what
the newspapers were saying about the war or a certain issue?
AB: I think not. Very, very often, you would have read it in the paper before they saw it on the
newsreel. The newsreel came out just once a week. Much later, what really killed the newsreel,

28

was television.
KP: Did the newsreels perceive Life Magazine to be their competitors? Did you get that sense at
all?
AB: No, I don't think so. I think, I don't know if they viewed anybody as their competitors.
Actually, Pathe News was the only one that had the library, so they had that advantage. And I
don't think, I don't know, maybe, the technical people felt … What newsreel viewers saw on the
screen had a much greater touch of reality. Seeing the facts in motions is much more striking than
looking at a still photo.
KP: Yeah, but you didn't get that sense through the organization?
AB: No, I didn't get that sense at all. No, it was so successful that I didn't get that feeling at all.
LB: They distributed to movie houses.
AB: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BT: Because I was going to say that I can remember the newsreel came on before the ...
AB: But there was also Movietown, there was also Movietown News. But, I don't know, there
was probably enough room for both. As I say, Pathe News ...
BT: And everybody listened to radio. But if you wanted to see anything, you …
AB: You went to the movies.
BT: Basically, except for the shots in the newspaper.
AB: Sure, sure.
BT: Because I've been looking back to the 1940’s, you know, ’41 through ‘45. And I'm amazed
at some of the pictures from those landings in the Mediterranean.
AB: Well, some of those pictures came right from these newsreel companies.
KP: Before Pearl Harbor, did you get a sense from watching the newsreels of how close the war
was? Were you as surprised by Pearl Harbor as everyone else?
AB: I think, definitely, everybody [was surprised.] In fact, when I came to work that Monday
morning, we were bombarded with calls and people wanting to use our library to get information,
‘cause we did have files on pre-war Pearl Harbor. Very few knew about Pearl Harbor.
Everybody was just taken by surprise.

29

KP: So you had stock footage of Pearl Harbor?
AB: Yes, yes, they had stock footage of Pearl Harbor, before the attack.
KP: So that was one of the first requests?
AB: Yeah, yeah.
KP: What about Japan? Did people want stock footage on Japan?
AB: I don't remember that.
KP: But they did of Pearl Harbor?
AB: Pearl Harbor is such a vivid memory. It was just, it was just wild that morning, when I
came to work.
KP: What were some of the unusual request for stock footage? Do you remember any?
AB: Actually, I wasn't too involved with requests. The requests were channeled through another
department, another office. They didn't come [through me.]
KP: So you don't know of any?
AB: They didn't come to us first. You know what I mean?
KP: Yeah.
AB: And we didn't have to go get it for them, either. There was somebody who, there were film
vaults. And there was somebody who actually got the requests and went to the film vault. It was
our job to make the subject matter available to them through the catalog.
KP: So you didn’t know how the images were used?
AB: That's right.
KP: You just knew …
AB: That they did come to us for them. And when the war broke out, the Army had some sort of
a production studio in Astoria, Long Island, and they would come to us for a lot of footage. We
would help them sometimes. Find it in the catalog, but we didn't have too much time to do that,
either, because we were so busy getting the subject matter ready for the catalog, that we didn't
work as much one-to-one with the people who came in for the material.
BT: I'm curious about the Pearl Harbor footage, because there is some existing film from people

30

who either took snapshots or had a movie camera during the attack or the aftermath of the attack.
And I got the impression that, at the time, that we were trying to cover up the extent of the
damage or we didn't even know it immediately. So, I'm wondering, was there ...
AB: No, they didn't take the footage of that. They had footage [during] peacetime.
BT: When do you remember getting footage of the attack?
AB: I don't remember when, I don't remember when, but we did get it eventually, yeah. But I
don't remember how soon.
BT: It seems to me that there was quite a delay, in terms of what Washington knew about the
attack, and that always fascinated me.
AB: And even the footage that we got from the newsreel probably was not taken by our own
photographers. It probably came through the State Department or, you know, one of the
government agencies.
KP: Would you catalog any of the out-takes?
AB: No, we just …
KP: You strictly …
AB: We just, the only thing we saw was the completed newsreel that went to the theaters.
KP: So if they cataloged the stock image, the other images or whatever went into the waste
basket?
AB: No, apparently it was, I guess, I don't know, I guess it was just tossed out.
KP: Yeah.
AB: Yeah.
BT: Can you imagine what was tossed out?
AB: Yes, it could have been repeats of what we kept, and we probably, they probably kept the
best part of the footage.
KP: How did the creation of Camp Kilmer influence New Brunswick and Highland Park?
AB: Well, I was living in New Brunswick at the time, and I’ll tell you, it was a great stimulus to
business. A lot of Army-Navy stores opened up. And, of course, the bars started doing recordbreaking business, I guess. And also, a lot of social centers were set up. I used to go to USO

31

dances, you know that?
KP: When did you go to USO dances?
AB: Probably in 1942.
KP: So, soon after the war started.
AB: Oh, yes, yes. They were, they had very active groups in New Brunswick that, it wasn't only
USO centers, but there were churches and synagogues and other organizations that provided, you
know, activities for these soldiers.
KP: Did your synagogue have ...
AB: I don't think so. I wasn't that active in it, but I don't recall them doing anything much with
it.
KP: How did the presence of all those men affect this community, since this was the last place
they would be before they shipped out?
AB: Yeah, this was a port of embarkation.
KP: Yeah, were there any problems with soldiers?
AB: I wasn't aware of any. No, [I] felt perfectly safe, because, in fact, there were many nights
when I worked very late in New York. And I would have no fear of traveling alone in
Manhattan, and I had no fear of, we lived on Livingston Avenue then. I'd get off the train, and if
there was a bus still running, I would get on the bus. If not, I would have to take a cab. But there
was no fear at all.
KP: So you didn’t feel threatened at all with all these men being around?
AB: No, you didn't feel peril, and I don't remember anyone, any incidents or anything.
LB: There was a little city that grew up right at the edge of camp. But, it was very, not spoken
of.
AB: Not that much. You know, are you talking about Plainfield Avenue? I don't, maybe, you
knew more about it. I was just very unsophisticated, very innocent. If it was, I wasn't at all
aware of it.
LB: A lot of MPs in the city, so ...
AB: Oh, yeah, well, that's what I was saying. [In] New Brunswick, I had no fear at all.

32

KP: So the war really didn’t change New Brunswick that much, even though there were a lot of
transients around?
AB: No, I think it changed the business climate a lot, but, as far as losing our security or
anything like that, I don't think anybody felt threatened.
KP: You wrote on your survey that you also volunteered for the American Red Cross. You were
still working full-time, so you must not have had a lot of free time.
AB: I know. I was living in New York, though, at the time. Once a week, my roommate and I, I
shared an apartment with a friend whose husband was overseas. We would go to one of their
headquarters, somewhere in downtown New York. I don't remember where it was. And we
would just do filing and clerical work for them. Just once a week.
KP: So when did you move to New York?
AB: I lived with, my mother who was widowed in 1934, as I said before. And she remarried in
1944 and moved to Atlanta. And I moved to New York in 1944, I guess it was, a year after I was
married.
KP: Which must have been even more exciting than working there.
AB: Yeah, it was. It was easier, because we lived at One University Place, so all I did was, you
know, walk to Fifth Avenue and get the bus up to work. It was, my day wasn't quite as long. And
there, too, though, I wouldn't think of doing the things now that I did then. There were many
evenings when I worked very late and I'd come home very late and I didn't feel at all threatened.
KP: When and how did you and Lew meet?
AB: Oh, Lew and I knew each other for a long time. Lew was a friend of my next to the oldest
brother, and he was coming around for, how many years before you noticed me? About two
years before he noticed me. All of a sudden, I became apparent.
BT: And that was about when?
AB: I was, was I in high school?
LB: ‘35.
AB: ‘35, oh, he remembered. ...
LB: ’34.
AB: ‘34, when I was …

33

LB: ‘34, your father passed away.
AB: Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, but we weren't dating then. He just kind of realized that there was a
sister in the family. But we started dating in college, I think, didn't we? Did we date in high
school?
LB: Yes.
AB: You were out of high school then.
LB: You went to my high school fraternity dances.
AB: Were you in high school then? Oh, dear, I can't believe it was so many years ago. So we
started dating probably in 1936.
LB: ’35.
AB: ‘35. My mother let me date then?
BT: Probably only carefully supervised.
LB: One of the reasons that we dated was because there was such good food in the house.
AB: I don't think I really dated. I think I was allowed to go to the dances and things, because I
was only sixteen. My mother wouldn't have let me.
BT: I was thinking about what we would consider dates.
AB: Parties.
LF: Maybe the movies. Maybe.
KP: And when did you get engaged?
AB: It was right before you went to O.C.S., wasn't it? So that would have been ’43. The spring
of ’43, and we were married in July, but we knew one another, you know, for a long time.
KP: When did you become more serious? Was it before or after the war?
AB: Oh, no, this was, well, we were married during the war.
KP: Yeah, yeah, but before the war started or during?
AB: No, we weren't, it wasn't serious before the war started, but it became more serious, I guess,
in ‘42? Yeah. But you were already in the service.

34

KP: How often would you see each other during the war? Did you correspond a lot?
AB: Well, we were married in July of ’43, and you were stationed up in Massachusetts then,
right? So Lew used to get home every weekend. Never during the week, then he went to Army
Intelligence School at Fort Richie, when you had every eighth day off, was it? It was very
peculiar. It was a different day each week. And it was just one day, and then, where did you go?
From where …
LB: Overseas.
AB: Yeah, you went overseas from Massachusetts.
LB: Well, we went up to Boston, but I was [on alert], where I couldn't see anybody.
AB: Well, we didn't see one another too much.
KP: But you got married before …
AB: Oh, we were married, yeah, before he, right after O.C.S., we were married.
LB: You came down to Richie.
AB: Yeah, I went down to Richie once, for about a week.
KP: Had you thought of waiting until after the war before you got married?
AB: I guess because we knew one another for such a long time, we didn't feel that we had to
wait.
BT: There were a lot of very hasty marriages during the war.
AB: Yes, I was just gonna say.
BT: Many of which have lasted beautifully.
AB: Oh, sure, sure.
BT: The stereotype was that you didn’t really know the person you married and two weeks after
the war was over, the marriage was over. But a lot of those marriages have lasted a long time,
but you were not in that category.
AB: Oh, no we weren't, we knew one another. The families knew one another.
BT: And the families were all pleased by this, I'm sure?

35

AB: Oh, yeah.
KP: But you got married at the chapel at Camp Kilmer, even though you were from the area.
AB: Well , there wasn't, shall I say, we didn't want to take the time for a big wedding. ‘Cause
Lew just had a week off. Also, my mother couldn't afford to have a big wedding. Should I tell
them why we were married at Kilmer? We were not supposed to be married at Kilmer. We were
supposed to be married by our rabbi, and then my mother was going to have, you know, the
families [over] for dinner. But Lew's mother was kind of disappointed in us ‘cause we didn't
want to have a big wedding, and I think that she had not told Lew's father what our plans were,
and he went off to work that day. And Lew's sister, who was his only sibling, was visiting
relatives. And there was no one to attend us, and, so we decided we would get married at
Kilmer. And my mother said that she didn't think she should go with us, because, then it will
always be in the minds of Lew's parents that my mother was at our wedding but they weren't.
And I had an aunt who wanted to come and she agreed with my mother, so we went off by
ourselves.
KP: Even though you had made …
AB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think my mother was right, though.
BT: That's a hard decision.
KP: Did your families know each other?
AB: Oh, yeah, yeah, they knew each other.
BT: The funny thing about it is [that] everybody knew everybody, you know.
KP: Lew said that your witness was the guy cleaning the floor.
AB: Yeah, we were late, and when we got there, the rabbi thought that we were getting married
against our parents wishes. And he asked us several questions, and I looked very Christian at the
time, and he said to me, “Is it because, are your parents opposing the marriage because you’re not
Jewish?” I said, “But I am Jewish,” and he said, “Where did you get the bible?” And I said,
“Well, it was my mother’s.” And he said, “Well, I'll certainly be happy to perform the
ceremony,” and there were no witnesses, except these two soldiers who were sweeping up,
getting ready for Friday night chapel, ‘cause this was late Friday.
BT: So what did you wear?
AB: Oh, I wore a lovely light blue dress and matching hat. I had a very pretty dress. I don't
know what happened to it. I'm not a saver, unfortunately. Well, we moved …

36

BT: You didn't take any pictures? Do you have any pictures of this?
AB: Not a one.
-----------------------------------------END OF TAPE ONE, SIDE TWO-------------------------------KP: This continues an interview with Ada Glasser Bloom on November 18,1996 at Edison, New
Jersey with Kurt Piehler
LF: … Lara Fletcher …
BT: … Barbara Tomblin.
KP: I should turn it over to Barbara, who mentioned that she had some questions about rationing
and the war in general.
BT: Yeah, I'm always fascinated, because my parents also went through the war.
AB: Oh, sure.
BT: On the home front. I'm really fascinated by the home front. And this is a different home
front than where I grew up in Cincinnati. But they had a blackout in Cincinnati, Ohio, which was
so far inland, and it’s always fascinated me that they thought the Germans were actually gonna
fly that far. But there must have been a greater sense of war in this area.
AB: I don't think we had blackout. We had rationing, certainly. But I don’t think we had
blackouts, no, I don't think so. Did we?
BT: That's interesting, being so near the coast.
LB: The blackouts weren't so much related to fear of German invasion as they were for the
saving of energy.
AB: We didn't have to cover or windows or anything. We were just, we were very ...
LB: We had dim-outs.
BT: Now, I think what they had in Cincinnati were dim-outs. Especially in terms of street lights,
because there was a lot of industry.
LB: Same here.
AB: We didn't have to have light-proof window shades or curtains or anything.
LB: The coast did have some blackouts at times, because they discovered that German

37

submarines were just along the coast.
AB: Oh, sure along the coast, yeah. But we were far enough away from that.
BT: But you did have rationing?
AB: Oh, we had rationing, very, the whole country did. And I guess the thing that hurt people
most was the gas rationing for the car. I know [that] my mother’s car was up on blocks for about
two years. It was in a garage and she just gave it up. Yeah, we didn't have to, you know, we all
got around on with buses and walking.
KP: You mentioned your mother decided to go out of the dry goods business because of how
hard it was to get things.
AB: It was hard to get merchandise, yeah. And she went to work, for what was Roselle's
department store, at the time, on Church Street.
KP: And she got remarried during the war.
AB: She did yeah, yeah. Her parents encouraged her for a long time to remarry. My father, had
died, had passed away ten years before she remarried. And actually, she met this person through
her parents. He was a very religious man, and I don't know what brought him to New Brunswick,
for some reason. And he went to service in the local orthodox synagogue, and my grandfather
met him and invited him over for dinner, ‘cause he was from out of town. People did that in
those days.
LB: Well, you grandfather was the president of the synagogue.
AB: I don't know if he was president then, but he was active. And they found out, you know,
[what] his background [was]. He had been widowed for a number of years. And, I don't know
whether they asked him if he wanted to meet somebody, but they really encouraged my mother,
who was their daughter.
KP: So your parents fixed your mother up again.
AB: Yeah, well, this wasn't a real arrangement, because my mother could have rejected it if she
wanted to.
KP: Yeah, but still they had a real parental influence.
AB: Yeah, they really did. A real parental influence there.
KP: Do you think there was a parental influence with your own marriage?
AB: Oh, no, not at all. Our parents knew one another, but there wasn't that kind of a …

38

KP: That kind of influence.
AB: No, and that practice didn't exist anymore among our families, I guess. Did it?
LB: It wouldn't work. Once the older orthodox Jews had ...
KP: But that's a real generational difference. It seems like the two of you were first generation
Americans who …
AB: Yeah, the first generation American. And my parents and your parents were very well
assimilated, anyway.
LB: They didn't come from deep Eastern Russia. They came from the Baltic area, so they were
very Western oriented.
KP: And how did you mother’s second marriage go?
AB: Oh, very well. She was, I think she was very happy there. She had a whole new family
there. She married a man whose children were all grown and married and [had] lots of
grandchildren.
KP: And she moved to Atlanta.
AB: Atlanta, yeah. But I think she was happy there. She made a lot of friends, and his family
liked her. And there aren't too many survivors, but the few that there are, kind of keep in touch.
They're interested, we don't keep in constant touch with them, but if I can digress a bit, there was
quite a coincidence. Our daughter-in-law has two twin brothers and they're both physicians. And
the one was specializing in cosmetic surgery, and when he finished his residency, he was looking
for the next step. Not to go into practice, but to work along with a plastic surgeon. And his first
choice was with this very well established and very prominent plastic surgeon in Atlanta. And
one day, we were having dinner, and my daughter-in-law said to me, “You know, I forgot to tell
you [that] Jeff got his first choice. He's going to be working with this plastic surgeon in Atlanta.”
So I said, “Well, you know, my mother's second husband has a grandson who is a very
prominent plastic surgeon in Atlanta, and I'm sure Jeff will bump into him somewhere or other,
at meetings or possibly in the hospital, he will meet him because he is very prominent.” So Gari,
my daughter-in-law says, “So what's his name.” And I say, “His name is Billy Silver.” And she
says, “He's the one.” Small world.
LB: He was an Irish Jew. He was a ...
AB: We call that Jewish geography.
KP: You worked for the Office of War Information. How did you go from Pathe News to …

39

AB: Well, they were, people in my field were really sought after, at that time, because there were
very few of us who were professional librarians who also trained as film librarians. There were a
lot of clerks, but there were very few professionals. And one of the divisions of the Office of
War Information was their overseas motion picture division. It was not stationed overseas, but
they handled the overseas distribution and production of films for overseas. And they were
looking for someone to establish their film library. And I don't know how I heard about it.
Possibly somebody who came into the library mentioned it. And I was looking for a more
responsible position, ‘cause I had gone as far as I could. My supervisor, my boss had left and her
job was open, but I looked very young. I looked like a baby and I was rather offended, because
they gave that position to someone else who I didn't feel was as well qualified. And I wasn't just
gonna leave. But I felt that if there was a good opening, I would leave for it. And sure enough, I
heard about this position and I applied. And they were very anxious to have me, and it took a
long time, because the agency wasn't even totally established yet, and then, of course, I had to be
cleared and everything. Not that the work was that confidential, but during the war, I guess,
anybody who worked for the government had to have a good, clean record.
KP: Did the FBI investigate you?
AB: No, no, that they … Not that I'm aware of.
KP: You didn't have that kind of clearance?
AB: No, I didn't have that kind of clearance. Because it wasn't, I wasn't doing anything that was
that confidential. And, I guess, I left Pathe News in the spring of 1943. When I took the job, I
said, “You know, I'm gonna have to have time off this summer, because I'm getting married.”
And they said, “Well, don't worry about it. Do whatever you have to do.” And I worked there
until 1946, until Lew returned. And I set up their library for them and managed it and it was a
very busy job, because they used to receive a lot of the foreign overseas footage of the war
activity. And also a lot of the captured film. And that's what we would catalog. And we would
service the same type of people that we served at Pathe News. In fact, our library, you wouldn't
call it competition, but actually, we were doing a lot of the services that Pathe News had done
before. Pathe News would come to us, actually, for a lot of footage.
KP: Which must have made you feel good.
AB: It did. It made me feel good, because a lot of the people I worked with, came to me now,
and I had to help them.
BT: Yeah, and there's such a direct ...
AB: Well, there were very few people, really, who were qualified to do it.
KP: How many people did you supervise? It sounds like you had a lot.
AB: No, at OWI really not. I had, I worked with a lot of people. But I had only one person

40

under me who did a lot of my clerical work for me.
KP: So you were responsible for watching most of these films.
AB: I had, I watched them and wrote up the descriptions and cataloged them. And then, one
person [who] was directly responsible to me was sort of my, I guess, secretary. But then, there
were other people who did the actual storage of the film for me. But I didn't have any direct
supervision over them. They were supervised. It was, if you know anything about government
agencies, there's a lot of supervisors, I should say. But I had no problems. You know, we were
all very cooperative. We all knew we were working for the war effort.
KP: In your previous job, you would watch one film a week of the newsreel and you would
catalog them.
AB: That was it, yeah.
KP: Whereas here, it seemed like you got a lot more.
AB: Oh, we were always behind here, because there was a lot more coming in than we could
possibly handle. We didn't have a bigger staff because there just wasn't the money for it.
KP: So how many films could you catalog in one week?
AB: You mean how many feet?
KP: Yeah.
AB: Probably, whatever the same amount of footage a newsreel would have, so we were often
behind, and what would happen is, many times, other directors and producers who were working
there, and film editors, would see a lot of the material that came in that wasn't cataloged yet and
they would say, “Well, they'd like to get their hands on something that they knew they had seen.”
And I would try and dig it out. You know, I would, by knowing what period the film covered or
what area it covered, I was often able to pick out for them what they were looking for.
KP: But you were also watching these films in different languages.
AB: Yes, true. Yeah.
KP: How did you catalog those?
AB: Well, I just had to do it by describing what I saw, not so much [by] what I heard. Actually,
you’re more interested in the image, because a lot of the foreign film that was captured, was
propaganda film.
KP: It’s curious that you were looking at all these different films.

41

AB: Well, I tried to identify things as best I could I guess. If I couldn't identify them, you know,
I just describe what I saw. Three motored plane.
KP: What did you think of all these propaganda films you were watching?
AB: By following the war reports in our own media, I recognized the enemy's attempts to make
it appear that we were losing the war. Well, actually most of what I saw, I saw some propaganda
film, but not that much. Most of what we got in, was the war footage, that war film footage that
was taken by Army photographers. I don't think the OWI had their own photographers, but other
government agencies did.
BT: Where were you located?
AB: We were in the old Pathe News building, which I had been so glad to get away from. We
were at 35 West 45th Street. And that's where my first office was, with Pathe News, before they
moved to Madison Avenue. Well, they moved there because all the facilities were there for
them. The film vaults were already there, the projection room was there. All their editorial,
editor rooms were there.
BT: What did the Office of War Information actually do?
AB: The office I was with produced propaganda films and documentaries for overseas and, of
course, very often they would use some of the stock shots that we had cataloged. There was also
the Domestic Bureau of the OWI, which was located on West 57th Street in New York City. I
believe that that office handled much of the printed materials that were distributed to other areas
of communication.
BT: And it went to overseas for the civilian population?
AB: Both. They did some training films which were for our troops, and they did propaganda
films for, I guess, for theaters. Newsreel types and also films, propaganda films.
BT: Oh, I'd love to see some of those.
AB: Yeah, I just very recently, I said to Lew [that] I wonder where all their footage is.
BT: I'm thinking that they ...
AB: Probably the Library of Congress. I'd love to know. One of these days, I'm gonna take the
time to research.
KP: Or even your notes of what you saw. All the newsreels.
AB: Yeah, of all the catalog. Well, they may have sold it. They could have sold it to Hollywood

42

for their stock library.
BT: It's a really good question, because when you go to the National Archives and you look for
still shots or whatever. I was just appalled at the scarcity of Army Nurse Corps pictures.
AB: Oh, really.
BT: And I thought, “This can't be. Where is it all?”
AB: There must be something, sure, or it just doesn't exist.
BT: Or it doesn't exist.
AB: You know what, I wonder, if I wrote to the Congressman and asked him to investigate and
find out where all that footage is.
LB: I would do it two ways. I would write to Palone and also …
AB: Library of Congress, too, I think.
LB: One of you can get into the …
AB: I'd love to know.
LB: The Library of Congress net.
AB: Also, what happened to all the Pathe News film, because there was very, I mean, what
important historical material they would have.
BT: And all these recent discoveries fascinate me, especially the color footage of the war.
AB: Oh, yeah.
BT: Because I always, when I grew up, I was absolutely convinced that everything happened in
black and white.
AB: Was in black and white. Yeah, yes.
BT: I was just astonished when I realized that I still intellectually cannot grasp the fact that it
wasn't in black and white, that there was actually realism. It was so ingrained in my childhood.
There's another new book of color footage. And I have some color footage on video from the
Iwo Jima landing that just made it all look to me so totally different. For me, the war was those
newsreels.
AB: Oh, sure, black and white, sure.

43

KP: Did you just watch black and white images?
AB: Oh, well, there was no color then.
KP: You didn't have any color?
AB: No, we didn't have any color then. It was all black and white.
KP: Yours was all black and white?
AB: All black and white.
KP: And you only used motion pictures. You never dealt with still imagery?
AB: No, no it was all motion pictures.
LF: Did you get most of them right, since you got a lot of footage?
AB: Oh, definitely, yeah.
LF: Did that worry you, since you did have a husband over there?
AB: Oh, it certainly did. I rushed home everyday to see if the mail was there. Oh, yeah.
LF: Because you got a better grasp of what was going on, since you got to see it.
AB: Oh, sure, sure. And I saw a lot more than what went out to the public.
KP: Did any of the images disturb you, particularly from the foreign films?
AB: Well, I think the most devastating films that I watched were, when the war was over and the
prisoners were liberated. And you saw all this horrible footage from the death camps. That was,
I don't think that image will ever leave me at all.
KP: Because you didn't get the sanitized version.
AB: Oh, no, not at all. In fact, one of the last requests I had, somebody had seen a picture of
someone that they thought was their son in Life Magazine, and Life had gotten that footage from
the OWI. And this person called to see if there was any more footage of that particular shot,
because they wanted to see more of it. And, of course, whatever there was that was, that one
shot, you know. That one, I guess, the camera just focused in at that one spot at that one time
and that's what they saw.
KP: Was it of someone who died during the war?

44

AB: Yeah, yeah. They thought it was somebody that, someone in their family.
KP: One of the things that scholars have looked at is what was and wasn’t shown to the public at
the time. Did you ever look at this image and realize that it wasn't going to be shown to the
public?
AB: Well, I don't know whether it was always much worse or just that there was much more. I
mean, they didn't hide anything, really. I don't think they did, but it's just that there was much
more than they saw. You know, it was on a much bigger scale. I mean, you might see thirty
seconds of people in the death camps. When this footage went on and on and on for, maybe,
thousands of feet. You couldn't show it all, but one part was no worse than the other.
KP: What about combat footage?
AB: I don't know how much. There was a lot of combat footage, but, isn't that strange that I
don't have, I don't recall that as much as I do [the stuff] I just described to you.
BT: One of the most controversial footage I’ve heard about, and I don't know the whole story,
but after the Tarawa landings, somebody took some pictures of the bodies floating around the
beaches. And there was a lot of controversy at the time, because it was the first Pacific landing,
that there was a really high death toll in a short period of a couple of days. And someone took
the footage to the White House and showed it to FDR, and he was appalled, and I think it was the
first time that Americans realized that this was gonna be a very costly war. But I don't know if
the newsreel picked any of that up. I was wondering if you, maybe, remembered that at all.
AB: Well, not everything that the newsreel got was from the OWI a lot of the footage they got
was from the Army Signal Corps, which had their own …
KP: In terms of images, there are a lot of images that weren't widely circulated, but you’re
getting all this stuff coming in, and you’re watching it as fast as you can.
AB: That's right, and not everything that came in was cataloged, either, I imagine. I was, I
cataloged whatever was given to me by the directors of this agency. Not everything came
directly to me.
KP: So who did you report to?
AB: I reported to a person by the name of (Irving Lerner?), who really hired me. Now, of
course, he had people over him that he reported to, who, I think, were probably stationed in
Washington. Our unit in West 45th Street was strictly the overseas motion picture division. But
we answered to somebody in Washington.
KP: Now did your unit make …

45

AB: Yes, they produced newsreels, and, I think, some training films, not too many, and, of
course, films for propaganda.
KP: Were you aware of what was going on or were you just simply so busy with your cataloging
that you really didn't know how the rest of your division was working?
AB: I didn't know too much. I, how should I put it? There were no secrets or anything, but it's
true [that] I was very busy. I knew what each editor was working on at the time. And I didn't
always know who else was working on it with them, who was doing the commentating and the
commentaries and who was doing the final, making the final decisions on what remains in the
film and what ends up on the cutting room floor. So I didn't get too involved, really, I guess,
because I was so absorbed in what I was doing.
KP: Did you ever watch some of the products that they produced?
AB: Yes.
KP: Would you catalog those, too?
AB: No, those wouldn't be cataloged. No, no. It would be impossible to get all that done.
Sometimes, I would see the finished product, but not always. I mean, I could, anytime I wanted
to, I didn't have to wait for an invitation. But most of the time, I just didn't have time.
KP: It sounds like you had a lot of work on your hands.
AB: We had very little time, and that's why I worked nights for, very often, I would work at
night to do the viewing. Because if somebody else was using the projection room during the day,
I couldn't get into it, so I would have to do it at night. And I didn't mind.
BT: And you worked a full day.
AB: Oh, yeah, and it was six days a week, too.
BT: Oh, very interesting.
AB: It was Monday through Saturday, And holidays, we never had a holiday off.
KP: Did your pay go up?
AB: At Pathe News, we used to get our dinner paid for. We never got overtime, we got our
dinner paid for. I think they would give us three and a half dollars for dinner. And at OWI, I
didn't know until many years later, that I could have put in for overtime and I never did. My
bosses never told me. Yes, yeah.
KP: And you didn't get dinner?

46

AB: No, no, it was on my own.
KP: But you also knew that this was helping with the war.
AB: Oh, yeah, I was very dedicated to what I was doing. I wouldn't have wanted to do anything
else.
KP: You mentioned that you had a roommate in New York. Where did she work?
AB: She worked for one of the magazines that, in the apparel trade. I can't remember the name
of it, but she was a writer. And we got along beautifully because her husband was also overseas.
And we didn't know one another before.
BT: How did you meet her?
AB: We had a mutual friend. My mutual friend Madeline had gone to Michigan with Rhoda.
And Madeline was supposed to move in with Rhoda, but I needed an apartment, I didn't have any
place to go. So, Madeline said, “Well, look, you need it more than I do,” because Madeline was
still living at home with her parents, I grew up with Madeline. She said, “Why don't you move in
with Rhoda, and then when you find an apartment, you know, I'll take over.” Well, Rhoda and I
got along so well. Madeline wasn't married, and Rhoda decided that she and I had a lot more in
common and it was a very friendly decision. Madeline took it very, very graciously. She agreed,
she thought it was a good idea. And we are very close friends to this day.
KP: And you really did have a lot in common, because you were both married
AB: That's right. Both married, and our husbands were both overseas. We had no children. She
had a very responsible job. We were both very, very involved professionally and it worked out
beautifully.
KP: What did you do for fun?
AB: Rhoda and I would go to the theater, occasionally. We'd eat out a couple times a week,
probably. We had a lot of friends. We had a lot of friends in the building who were career
women. They weren't married, but they were all friends of Rhoda, so, of course, they adopted
me, too. And we really had a very nice, pleasant life together. I would go home weekends. I
would come to New Brunswick because my sister was here and I had an aunt and uncle, and
Lew's parents were there. And Rhoda would most often stay right in New York, but her family
was in Rochester. But maybe once a month, she'd go home to Rochester, for the month, I mean,
for the weekend.
BT: Did she take the train?
AB: She took the train, yeah.

47

BT: Because I always got the impression that it was hard to go anywhere during the war.
AB: It was, but, ‘course, it was much easier for me. Rhoda, sometimes, would come to New
Brunswick with me for the weekend. But the time went more quickly than it might have,
because we were so busy in our jobs. That was the saving grace for both of us. But I would rush
home after work every day, when I lived in Manhattan, to check the mail. To see if I had any
mail from Lew.
KP: How regular was the mail?
AB: It wasn't. There were times when, it wasn't regular at all. There was one period where, for
weeks, I didn't hear from him and I really was beside myself.
KP: Since you were staying up-to-date with the news, was there any point, in particular, where
you were very worried about Lew, given what you knew?
AB: Yeah, during the Battle of Bastogne, I guess it was. That was when I didn't hear from you
for a long time.
LB: It was the Bulge, a little later.
AB: The Bulge, yeah, I guess that was it. The Bulge, yeah.
BT: I was thinking that there was a lot on the news then. They really did know.
AB: And when the war was over we, Rhoda and I really had a ball. We used to keep track of all
the troop ships that were coming in. We had all the charts in our kitchen, our little kitchen. And
word got around that we always knew what troop ships were coming in and where and when.
And we started getting calls from people. We had no idea where they were calling from, how
they found out about us, but word got around that we knew the movement of the troop ships.
This wasn't confidential, because they would be posted in the newspapers, and we would save
them because we knew when our husbands were slated to come home or we hoped were slated to
come home. Lew and I kid about that.
KP: So you kept …
AB: We kept this detailed record of what ships were coming in when and what troops were on it.
But the war was over then. We weren't doing anything illegal.
BT: Yeah, and a lot of troops were overseas for a long time.
AB: Oh, yeah, well, Lew didn't get home ‘till …
BT: A lot of people don't realize that.

48

AB: Well, you had to have points. Lew needed one more point.
BT: How many points did you need?
AB: And he was supposed to be going to Japan
BT: How many points did you need?
LB: I don't remember.
BT: But, yeah, and if you were, some people were one short.
AB: Yeah, Lew was one short, for about six months, I think.
BT: Can you believe that?
AB: But then, he was supposed to be coming home for just a short time, prior to going, or were
you, you weren't going to go directly to Japan? You were going to come home first.
LB: Well, that was before the war was over. I volunteered to stay on with my division. I had
been asked to stay and we were going to be one of the landing divisions in Japan.
AB: But when they bombed Iwo Jima, that was, they didn't need it anymore.
KP: Did you catalog the footage of the atomic bomb on Japan?
AB: Yes, we probably did. I'm sure I did. I'm sure I did … I have a hazey recollection of that
coverage.
BT: Did they show that right away?
AB: I don't think so.
KP: Did you see any footage of the destruction caused by the bomb?
AB: I might have. I don't remember when it came out in the newsreels.
BT: Yeah, I'm wondering if it was in the newsreels ever at all?
AB: Oh, I think so. I think so.
BT: I don't work in the Pacific end of the war.
AB: Were you a nurse?

49

BT: No, I do military history. I do mostly Europe and Mediterranean. So I'm trying to think if
they actually had footage soon after the bomb.
AB: I don't think I went to the movies much then, because, you know, I was so involved in
movies all day. So I can't tell you whether or not I saw them in the newsreel then.
KP: No, I can imagine that that's the last thing you'd want to do on a Sunday during the war.
AB: Yeah, no, we never did. Almost never did.
BT: Was there theater during the war?
AB: Oh, sure, sure.
BT: I think there was.
AB: Oh, sure.
BT: I would think you would be right there, a great spot to be at.
AB: I saw Oklahoma during the war. And let's see, what else I saw during the war? Our Town.
BT: Our Town.
AB: Yeah, we used to go every couple of months, I guess. It was expensive. And we both, we
were both saving like mad.
KP: You were saving to buy a home?
AB: Well, yeah, to have the things we needed when the boys came home.
KP: In the ‘30s, money had been pretty tight?
AB: That's right.
KP: It seemed like you were doing much better during the war?
AB: Oh, yeah, I did very well financially, myself. Although my first job, you'll never believe the
high salary I had. Twenty-five dollars a week, with Pathe News, and I was about the highest paid
graduate in my class. Everybody else started at about eighteen a week. A lot of the people I
knew, went into the executive training squads at Bamburgers and Macy's, and they were getting
eighteen dollars a week. Some of the people I commuted with.
KP: So you were the high earner.

50

AB: I was the high earner, yeah. And then, when I went to OWI, I think I was earning about
ninety dollars a week.
KP: Oh, that was …
AB: Well, I had gotten a raise at Pathe News, so maybe I was making maybe thirty-five when I
left.
KP: But the ninety dollars a week is a lot.
AB: Sure, sure, and when the war was over, my position would have continued, but I didn't want
to stay. There were reasons why I didn't want to stay on. I'd become a little disillusioned, and one
of the people I worked with at OWI was assigned to the Navy, but he had come out of the March
of Time. And he had a great deal of respect for me, because he felt that I was doing my job the
way I should and everything. So I went to him and I confided to him that I was thinking of
leaving and asked him [if] he [thought] that there'd be a position for me at March of Time.
Anybody hear of March of Time? I felt that I needed to be certain of another position before I
left the one I had.
BT: It's not ringing any bells.
AB: That was the newsreel that was produced and distributed by Time-Life Magazine. And sure
enough, a position opened up and I got the job there. And it was really not as professional a job
as I should have had. I was actually distributing their films for them. But they told me hang on
until something else would open up. And of course, I was a graduate librarian and a very good
position opened up at Time-Life Magazine. So this same person recommended me for that
position, and I was given that position. And that was really my last job until I retired to raise a
family.
BT: Historians have noted that there was a lot of concern that there would be another Depression
when the war ended.
KP: Is that why you thought you really needed to save your job?
AB: Well, I didn't know how successful Lew would be, you know, in finding a job. And he had
a lot of trouble because there still was a lot of anti-Semitism. He was over-skilled. I mean, he
was, I guess, because of his education and his Army responsibilities, he was kind of over-skilled
for some of the jobs that would have been open to him. And also, he had some experiences
where anti-Semitism really came to the forefront, you know. And I was interested in working,
anyway.
KP: You sound like you enjoyed it.
AB: I enjoyed working and I did. And I've been very lucky because I've had such interesting

51

jobs, ‘cause when I went to Time-Life, I had a marvelous opportunity. Yeah.
KP: What did you do for them?
AB: They had a book service department which ordered all the books and all the publications for
the company, and, in addition to that, our department did all the searching for books for Claire
Booth Luce and all, any editor or any person on top who needed books for research that were
hard to find, we would track down. We would track them down through the used bookstores and
even overseas contacts. And they had a very nice service for employees. The company that we
ordered our books from, of course, had a very big account. So they were willing to sell books to
anyone in the company at a third discount. So we serviced everybody in the company and it was
like a bookstore. And it was a very, very busy department, especially around Christmas time.
BT: Oh, I'll bet.
KP: Because even today, Time-Life is rated one of the best companies to work with.
AB: It was a very good company. One thing I remember, I had never gotten a bonus or
Christmas present where I had worked before. And up until the year I had come to Time-Life,
apparently, the bonuses were very high. I came to work in September, and, of course, that
following Christmas, I got a fifty dollar bonus. And I thought I had been handed the world, you
know. Well, everybody else had gotten small bonuses, and the complaints, and it was as if this
was coming to them. And I could not conceive of anybody having that kind of an attitude, you
know. You worked for a company and they're good to you and that's all you expect. But I was
happy with my fifty dollars.
BT: Jobs, in those days, did not come with the enormous perks and …
AB: No, no. I don't think …
BT: ... and insurance and etcetera and so forth.
AB: I think I had, I had health coverage. I'm pretty sure I had that. Yeah, I think I had that. And
I didn't get overtime because I was considered an executive. But I think if I, if I had to stay for, I
think meals were covered, if you worked overtime. But it was just a very pleasant place and
everybody was very nice.
KP: You worked at Rockefeller Center?
AB: Yeah, Rockefeller Center.
KP: You mentioned that you ordered books for Claire Booth Luce and others. You had a sense
of what projects were being worked on.
AB: Well, not always her’s, because a lot of her books were personal. You know, for personal

52

reasons.
KP: So you did a lot of ordering of personal books for her and everything?
AB: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's definitely. In fact, one Christmas, my assistant and I, I have it
upstairs, each got this clay sculpted angel, a cherub, and with it was a card from Claire Booth
Luce, “To my angels.” I really treasure that. And when our older son was born, he got a
beautiful gift. It was a sterling Tiffany's porringer, and on it was engraved, “To George Sanford
Bloom, from all his mother's friends at Time-Life, The Luces.” He has that, I gave him that. I
have my angel and he has that.
KP: Which is a very nice gesture.
AB: Yes, it is. And I don't know whether they did it for everyone. I really don't, but I know they
did it for their executives. I'm sure that they must have acknowledged, you know, births and
things like that, among all their employees. ‘Cause the morale was very good there. I don't
remember ever knowing of anyone who was unhappy.
KP: You mentioned you retired from the job to start a family. Did you just assume you'd have to
do that or would you have liked to have gone back?
AB: Well, I always say, I did go back. I had a four month leave. We moved and I gave birth to
our son and then stayed home a while. I wanted to go back because I loved my job, and,
financially, it was a big help. And I hired this wonderful West Indian nurse to take care of our
son. She was sort of the combination housekeeper/nurse. But most of her time was to be spent
taking care of our son, and she was a registered nurse in Jamaica, but could not get her license
here. So she was willing to do this sort of thing. And she was a saint. She was absolutely
marvelous. In fact, both of our sons have turned out to be wonderful. But we always felt that her
influence really rubbed off on our older son. And she spent one winter with us and she was
unhappy with the weather. She did not like the cold weather. And I had promised Lew and also
myself that I would not continue working if I had to keep changing people to take care of our
child, so I resigned.
KP: But if the nurse had stayed?
AB: I probably would have continued. Today, I'd probably be a career woman, you know,
because it’s being done so much more. I see what happens in this neighborhood. They all have
nannies.
KP: It sounds like Time-Life was also very flexible about that.
AB: Oh, they were. I could have, in fact, I think they extended my leave for a month. I'm pretty
sure that they did that. Because I hadn't made arrangements yet at home. They were very, the
only place where they were pretty rigid was, you were not supposed to, if you became pregnant, I
think, you were supposed to leave after your fifth or sixth month or something like that. Well, I

53

didn't. I was quite small, so they didn't know. I stayed until about my seventh month, I guess.
Yeah, ‘cause Sandy was born just a short time after we moved, and I left when we moved. We
had been living in Long Island and we bought this house in Matawan and we moved to Matawan.
KP: Yeah, but a lot of companies even had rules saying that married women are not allowed.
AB: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. No, nothing like that, yeah.
KP: And you would lose you job if you went on maternity leave.
AB: Oh, no, Time-Life was, I don't think they were ever strict in that area.
BT: What was the attitude concerning working mothers back then?
AB: Well, my mother was in Atlanta. I think she would have accepted it because she knew how
important it was for her to work when she worked. I don't know how your parents felt about it?
LB: About what?
AB: My going back to work after Sandy was born. They never said anything. I think if they had
any feelings about it, we would have heard.
LB: Old fashioned attitude about it.
AB: You think so? They never expressed anything to me. They were afraid of me, probably.
LB: I think one of the reason why they were so liberal at Time-Life was that Claire Booth Luce
was the one who stressed family values. She was a Roman Catholic and very, very …
AB: Well, she converted to Catholicism, that's right. He son or daughter, I think the version I
heard, was that after her child passed away, she received a lot of comfort from the Catholic
church, and that's what swayed her in that direction.
KP: How did it feel to go back to work after having children, and then stop working and stay at
home?
AB: I had mixed feeling about it, but I wanted to give it a try. And it seemed to work out well.
The first year I went back, I had help, which didn't work out too well. So my mother pitched in
and helped me. And then I didn't do anything for a few years again after that. I’d been kind of
burnt. And then, when my children were on a good schedule in school, I decided to. Actually,
what happened was that I had applied for subbing. And Metuchen, on my application, saw that I
was a librarian, and they needed a librarian very badly for their three elementary schools, and
they wanted me to cover all three schools, and I said, “No.” I wasn't ready for that, and my
husband didn't want me to work full-time, you know. “I'm just looking for either subbing or part
time.” And I said to them, “Why don't you try to find a part-time librarian for each of the three

54

schools?” The thought had never occurred to them. They thought it was a wonderful idea. So
the one who was leaving, for the same reason that I didn’t want the job, said [that] she would
stay, you know, for just twice a week, for one school. And they had me for the other school, so
they just had to find one more. And it was part-time, for quite a long time. It was twice a week.
And then, it was increased to three times a week, and then, I guess, both of my children were in
high school by that time, when Metuchen finally passed a budget. They never passed budgets
before. They had been trying to create full-time elementary school libraries, and they couldn't
because the budget was never passed. They finally passed a budget and that's when it became
full-time.
KP: That’s interesting, because Metuchen is now having similar problems with the school
budget.
AB: Yeah, they always have trouble with their budget. It was just that few years running that
they did not have trouble.
KP: Oh, I didn't realize that. Oh, that's interesting.
AB: Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I think for one reason, their taxes are very high to begin with. They
have the same problem as Highland Park does. They both lack big tax-rateables. And the taxes,
being as high as they are, where are they going to cut? People cut schools. I don't think their
elementary school has, I shouldn't say that. I don't know whether their elementary schools have
full-time libraries or not. It would be a shame if they don't, because …
----------------------------------------END OF TAPE TWO, SIDE ONE--------------------------------KP: Just before I flipped the tape, you mentioned that you enjoyed working in Metuchen.
AB: Oh, very much. Very, very much. I had, my first principal, Dot Gaydos, who passed away
just about six months ago, was a wonderful person. She was so dedicated to her job. She had
been a WAC, incidentally. Yeah, she didn't go to Douglass, I don't think, but she …
KP: But she had been a WAC?
AB: She had been a WAC. I think she was a sergeant. I don't think she was an officer.
KP: And it sounded like she was very proud of being a WAC.
AB: Oh, she was. And she ran that school with such a tight ship. But she was very dedicated.
She was unmarried. Her whole life was her profession. And I worked under a number of
principals. And to get back to what I was saying, when they finally passed the budget and we had
all this funding for the library, we developed this wonderful, actual, physical library, and the
program and everything improved because they had more money. And then, two years before I
left, they were cutting costs again. And they assigned me two schools and I had to shift between
two schools. And that wasn't too bad, but when it came time to ordering, at the end, of the year

55

and closing up two libraries, it was a monumental task. When I first started working there, I had
a crew of volunteer mothers who were absolutely marvelous. And I had more than I could use,
and, of course, as time went by, more and more mothers had to go to work, and I had practically
no volunteers. And the end of the first year, when I was running the two schools, I developed
shingles from the pressure. The doctor said it was from the pressure, anyway. And, generally, I
can work under a lot of pressure, but I couldn't take that.
KP: I imagine that you experienced a lot of pressure in the OWI.
AB: I had been, yes.
KP: And Time-Life.
AB: But this was, this physical pressure was just overwhelming. And, of course, I had a family
now, too. And I had decided, when I returned the following fall that if I didn't, wasn't getting
more help, or they were not improving the situation, I just would not stay on. And I also was not
doing my job the way I wanted to. I mean, I felt that I couldn't do the quality performance that I
had done before.
KP: So you would have stayed if Metuchen was a little better organized?
AB: Yeah, if the situation had been better.
KP: You would have worked there quite a few years.
AB: Probably, I would have probably, until my kids were out of college. But, as it turned out, I
left before. I had regretted leaving because I did nothing for about a year or so. And then I
started subbing, and I subbed mainly in Highland Park.
KP: So you’re still subbing?
AB: Well, I am, but I'm hardly ever available when they call me.
KP: We had heard about some of your trips.
AB: Well, not only that, you know. I'm tied up with a lot of other activities. And we have a
granddaughter living near us. We never had grandchildren near us before. They were always in
Massachusetts or Texas. Now that we have one here, I'm more involved with them.
KP: You've become very active with Douglass. You mentioned earlier that you’re more active
now with the school.
AB: Yeah, well, I'm active at reunion time, I'm very active, very busy. And I'm class
representative for the alumni council. I've declined office. I don't want any of the …

56

KP: You don't want to be president?
AB: No, I don't want to be president of my class. No, I feel, I'm close enough, you know, as far
as traveling, so I can represent them at meetings and things like that. In fact, I had a call from, I
don't know what Flora wants, but she called me on Friday. And I didn't find, I didn't get home
until after I knew she would be gone and I haven’t called her. I don't know what she wants.
KP: It sounds like the war speeded up your career a little. The OWI really was a new
opportunity.
AB: Oh, yeah. It was really a turning point. I would have stayed on at Pathe News. I wasn't as
happy, at the time I left, I wasn't as happy as I was when I first started. I was very happy there,
you know, the first year or two, and then. I don't like to be, I'm not aggressive, not aggressive at
all, but I don't like to be overlooked, either. And I felt that I was overlooked, that time, for the
position because I was really much more, much better qualified than the chosen person. And I
felt that I would be doing much of her job for her and I didn't want to have to. And, you know,
once you get pegged like that, it’s hard for you to move up, too. So I think I made the right
change with that.
KP: How did the war affect some of your classmates and friends?
AB: Well, I started out commuting with about four other girls, three others. And of the three,
one of them had been on the training squad at Macy's, and right after Pearl Harbor Day, the
Raritan Arsenal really burst. It really, and all these jobs opened up and they needed all these
college-trained people, I guess for, I'm not sure what kind of work they did. I think a lot of it
probably was pretty confidential. So one of my friends worked there. She was happy to
relinquish her commuting every day. And two of the other girls I commuted with, went to work
for the post office in Manhattan as censors. In fact, one of them was Frieda Feller. Frieda gave
you her name, I think. I believe they censored mail. If I remember correctly, they had both
majored in French at NJC.
BT: Oh, yeah, yeah.
AB: So, that's where they went. Let’s see if I know, I don't really know where others went.
They were my closest friends, really, at the time.
KP: Had you or any of your friends ever thought of enlisting in one of the services?
AB: I had a glimmer of a thought, but I didn't really do much about it. And my, I don't think any
of my other, if they did, I wasn't aware of it.
KP: You never had any discussions with anyone?
AB: No, I don't think so.

57

BT: I'm kind of anxious to find out how much actual recruiting went on at NJC. But, of course,
by then you had left.
AB: That's right, I was out. I imagine in 1942, from, you know, right after Pearl Harbor on, they
must have done a lot of ...
BT: I think there was ...
KP: Lara, do you have any more questions?
LF: I can’t think of anything right now.
KP: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we weren’t ignoring you.
LF: You keep hitting my questions.
AB: It’s being covered one way or another.
LF: Yeah.
KP: Lew's talked about your children very often to me.
AB: Oh, yeah. I'm sure he has.
KP: And your children seem to follow a real family tradition. They seemed to have the
opportunities you and your brother didn't have …
AB: Yeah.
KP: … in terms of advanced education.
AB: Yeah, yeah we've tried to do as much for them. They were good students, so, you know, we
knew that they were capable of doing whatever they wanted to do. And, in fact, we just heard
last night, our son is very, he doesn't communicate too well, when it comes to blowing his horn, I
guess. We were, we called Texas last night and we spoke to our granddaughter first and she said,
“Oh, did Dad tell you that he was elected to the Edison High School Hall of Fame?” Is that what
it's called? Yup, the Eagles.
LF: My mother went to Edison High School.
AB: She did?
LF: Yeah.
AB: What year did she graduate? Or what was her name?

58

LF: Her name was Carolyn Moken,
AB: Let's write that down. What's your mother's name?
LF: Carolyn Moken.
LB: Merkins?
LF: Moken. M-O-K-E-N.
AB: Do you mind my asking how old she is, and then we could tell whether or not …
LF: Well, now she'd be about fifty-two or fifty-three. Something like that. She's probably older
than your son.
AB: Yeah, she probably knew our niece who went there. Was she one of the earlier students at
Edison High?
LF: I think so.
AB: Yeah, I bet she knew Georgine Glasser. I think Georgine was one of the first graduates of
that school.
LF: My mom grew up in the area.
AB: Oh, did she?
LF: Yeah.
AB: Well, we can't, we didn't come to Edison until ‘58. They wouldn't have known one another,
but she could have known our niece.
KP: You had grown up in this area and you came back in the ‘50s. So you've known this area
for a long time. What has struck you about what has changed the most?
AB: I think I've seen more differences than continuities.
KP: What were some of the key differences that you’ve noticed.
AB: Well, the schools, for one thing. I went to Hamilton School, which is now a, it’s a school, I
think, for children with disabilities. I think emotional disabilities. I'm not [sure]. And then, of
course, Highland Park High, it was Franklin High. At the time, it went up to the ninth grade and,
of course, now it’s, I think, seven through twelve, now. And the whole environment at the
Highland Park High School is so different from when I went there.

59

KP: How different?
AB: I don't know, I just feel that the controls aren't there that were there when I was there. The
whole environment is much more permissive. And not always in the right direction, I feel . Of
course, I'm square.
KP: How did you feel raising your children in a much more permissive environment? You
mentioned how shocked you and your son were going through the dorms at Vassar.
AB: Yeah, well, of course, that permissive period didn't come along until they were, you know,
in high school. I don't think [that] there was that great a difference when they were younger.
They were really young when we moved here. I think their childhood was pretty much, pretty
similar to ours. Wouldn't you say? Most of their friends were from the neighborhood and, you
know, we carpooled and they had curfews, which they didn't resent, didn't object to them.
LB: We ran a firm ship.
AB: Yeah, we did, we did. But they didn't seem to object to it. They didn't have a lot of things
that a lot of their richer kids, richer friends had, but, then again, they had some advantages. We
always had the books that they needed. And they were very happy kids. Very active, well liked,
they always had a lot of friends. So it wasn't until they were ready almost to go off on their own,
anyway, that this permissive period arrived. And once they went away to college, we know how
they behaved at home, but we just hoped that they did the right thing away from home as well.
BT: And hoped you raised them right.
KP: Neither son served in the military?
AB: No, no, our older son would have been subject to the draft, and what I think he did, he
volunteered and then, how did that work? He volunteered and they didn't need him at the time or
something. I think it was one way of avoiding it, because he wanted to be able to finish college.
He was at Penn at the time. Then, of course, by the time he graduated, there was no draft
anymore.
LB: I doubt he would have been drafted.
AB: No, there was no draft then, but when he was, he had a number when he was at Penn.
LB: Yeah, he …
AB: And somebody told him that if you don't wait until they call you and you try to enlist and
they don't need you, you’re kind of off the hook. I think that was the situation.
BT: That might have been true.

60

KP: During the interview, you mentioned that Lew was very active in Edison politics.
AB: Yeah, he was.
KP: Did you choose to be active or was it by default?
AB: By default, mainly. Well, my own, my only real contribution to politics was when we first
moved here. Somehow or other, we were recruited to register people for voting in this area,
‘cause nobody was registered.
LB: We were the committeeman and committeewoman.
AB: I wasn't the committeewoman.
LB: I was the committeeman.
AB: You were the committeeman, and, as your wife, I had to help him. And we used to have
people coming to the house all hours of the day and night. And every day of the week, yeah, and
we would register them. And we knew that they were coming.
LB: We were allowed to register, if you were a committee person, you could register people in
your home.
AB: And when Lew became a councilman, I wasn't that interested, really. I went along when I
had to, you know, socially. I wasn't that, what should I say, excited, yeah. I went along because I
felt that I was expected to.
KP: Were you active in any other community organizations?
AB: When the boys were younger I was an active PTA member. I was active in my sisterhood
temple. And Douglass, I was always involved in that, because living so close to the college, I
was always called upon to help out with reunions, which I enjoyed doing anyway. And for a
while, I belonged to a Brandeis women’s group, a woman’s group at Brandeis University. But
most of my, I've been most active, I think in our temple sisterhood. That's where most of my
efforts go, even now. I'm not as active as I used to be, but I still do quite a bit. And I'm also
involved in the volunteer work at the Central of New Jersey Jewish Home for the Aged. And
now we're both involved with the Jewish Historical Society of Central Jersey. And let’s see,
what else?
LB: You do a good job at cooking.
AB: Oh, I help out the Jewish Federation. I do phone calls, you know.
KP: So when you were working, when you first had a newborn son, who did all the cooking?

61

AB: Well, before I went to work, of course, I did it. While I was working, we managed to get
our breakfast ourselves and when I came home, this Jamaican, who took care of our son usually
had dinner started for us. I told her what we were having. She was really very helpful.
KP: It sounds like if she had stayed, you really would have had the ideal world.
AB: Oh, yeah, she was just so wonderful. She stayed with us for less than a year and went back
to Jamaica. And she used to visit us every year.
KP: Oh, really?
AB: And she visited us until our older son’s freshman year at Penn. She had a sister in New
York and she would come to visit her and always come to spend a weekend with us.
KP: So you really built up quite a friendship.
AB: We did. I was so sorry we lost contact. The last time she visited us, she was not well. She
had some sort of leg problem. And we never heard from her again and I've tried contacting her
sister in New York and apparently she wasn't there anymore. We just kind of lost touch. I'm
afraid she must have passed away because we would have gotten a Christmas card or something
from her and we didn't get anything. No more communication.
KP: And then, when you were working part time at the library …
AB: Well, I managed pretty well. I had a more structured life. I think I had managed better than
I do now. I had help. I had a part-time worker that came in three times a week, who was very
good and did a lot of the things for me that I would have had to do when I came home. So I
managed well. And as I said, I was better organized.
KP: Is there anything we forgot to ask you?
AB: I don't think so.
