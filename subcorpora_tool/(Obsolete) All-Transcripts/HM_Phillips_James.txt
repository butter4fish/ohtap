Story_ID: 120608
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, I use all of them on the color wheel.  I don't like dressing in bright colors.  But, no, I don't really have a favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I think spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My studio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.
Story_ID: 120609
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but separately--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Jettie Elizabeth Brown.  And that's Jettie, J-E-T-T-I-E, Elizabeth is E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Brown, B-R-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 17, 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know where in Virginia?
Speaker 2: I'm going to make an assumption, in Franklin County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's in south central Virginia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --between Roanoke [Virginia] and Danville [Virginia], Nixburg [Virginia], that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can't.  The only thing I know is my great-grandmother was a full-blooded Cherokee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather's brother, they had the whole family tree.  But unfortunately, I couldn't put my hand on it to--like I could go back and really trace that.  But actually, it wouldn't help, because it only deals with that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your great-grandmother was a Cherokee.  Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother's having a hearing problem, so I couldn't get to that on the phone.
Speaker 1: Now, did your great-grandmother bring any Cherokee culture to the family?
Speaker 2: No, not that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean if it's there, it's about--it's about as prevalent--or we were made aware of it as much as the African.  You know, you have to search to find that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, people didn't--so they didn't consciously--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --conserve either culture.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, not consciously, anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you know anything about your great-great grandfather, I mean your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about your grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [James Brown] was married twice.  His first wife died.  I had one, maybe two aunts that were off-springs from that relationship.  And the rest is from my grandfather's last wife, and she was dead by the time I came on the scene.  So, I don't know anything; I don't even know her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your mother was, was it the first one or the second one?
Speaker 2: My mother is the second one.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: James Brown.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't know the middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was named after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is, now I assume--were they farming, were they doing the rural--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they dealing with any big crops, or were they just--
Speaker 2: Well, the chief crop that we dealt with was tobacco.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, actually, in that whole area that is the chief crop, for the most part.  And, you know, we grew our own food.  And we had some livestock.  We went to the grocery store just to get certain items.  So, we were pretty much self-sufficient.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you grew up out there on that particular farm?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was born in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  And then I guess my mother and father, they went their separate ways, and my mother decided she didn't want to raise me in New York City.  So, I'm not even sure if I was a year old before she brought me down to [Gretna] Virginia to live with my uncle and aunt and my grandfather.  And my uncle and aunt, they were my mother's brother and sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were their names?
Speaker 2: My uncle's name was George Brown, and his nickname was Jonah.  And my aunt was named Della Louise Brown.
Speaker 1: Della Louise?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Louise was her middle name.
Story_ID: 120610
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind your mother's [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] first name, Jettie?
Speaker 2: I'm not aware of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It just seemed unusual, and I just thought...
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean Jettie, what's that?  That's like a piece of land that sticks out in the water, right?  I mean, that's all I know.  But I do know there are, I guess some English names... Jettie?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I never heard of it as a name, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess it's not that unusual, I guess.  But I thought there might be a story there.  How did, did your mother talk about growing up, and what it was like in that part of Virginia, growing up?
Speaker 2: I know when I grew up what I experienced.  I'm not, all I know is at some point the family moved from Franklin County [Virginia], and they settled in Pittsylvania County [Virginia], which is the county next door.  And they bought some land in a little town that's called Gretna, Virginia.  That's G-R-E-T-N-A.
Speaker 1: Gretna, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's like between, it's like forty miles from Danville [Virgina] and about thirty-three miles from Lynchburg.  And there are a couple of little towns in between.  Like, Danville is south, so the next "big" little town would be Chatham [Virginia].  Of course, you know, they had--that's famous for the military academy.  And then Lynchburg [Virginia], there's a little town about twelve miles going north towards Lynchburg named Alta Vista [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Chatham, is that VMA [Virginia Military Academy] there?
Speaker 2: It might be.
Speaker 1: The Virginia Military Academy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did your mother have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A lot of people in those days didn't.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know, I know.  Now, I don't know--my aunt, she went to nursing school, but she didn't finish.  Now, my mother, I'm not sure she did four years; I'm not sure of that.  But I know when she did come back to--when my grandfather [James Brown] got real sick, she came back from--well, at that time she was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--to Virginia to help take care of my grandfather.  And she got a job as a secretary at school, and she was also doing substitute teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she definitely finished high school, and she--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You say she may have finished college?
Speaker 2: College, I'm not really sure.
Speaker 1: Did she go to college?  I mean, which one did she go to?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, I don't know.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  But she did some subbing, and was a secretary?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that implied she did something else.
Speaker 2: But I mean when we moved, when she moved me to Philadelphia, she was working as a nurse's aide in Bryn Mawr Hospital.  And then later on she got a job doing social work for Montgomery County in Morrisdale, Pennsylvania.  And she worked her way up through the ranks until she retired, as some kind of specialist, I don't know exactly what.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, but you're not sure about where she finished or anything?
Speaker 2: Sorry?
Speaker 1: You're not sure about where she finished school?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Or where she went either?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 120611
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: All I know is it was Frank Phillips.  And that's F-R-A-N-K-Y, and Phillips, spelled the same way, P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I know absolutely nothing about his side of the family.
Speaker 1: Do you know his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing.
Speaker 1: Was he from that part of Virginia, as far as you know?
Speaker 2: Well, what I--I've heard stories, one, he was from Kentucky.  Two, he had some artistic talent.  In fact, I've seen some drawings.  And I have, my mother has a couple of drawings that he did of her.  And one story is that he was a chef.  But that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I take it you didn't really know him, growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: At all?
Speaker 2: I mean, if he walked in the room, I wouldn't know him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story that your mother or other relatives tell about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't tell me nothing, nothing about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, he's coming in from someplace else.  Was he in the Army or something?  Or was he in--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did he work someplace in that area, you know, as a chef?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I mean, they didn't tell me anything.  I didn't really, I didn't ask.  I think, I guess I didn't miss him, because for my mother and my father, I had my uncle and my aunt, you know, for the father figure and the mother figure, because they're the ones who raised me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather [James Brown], my grandfather had like a third grade education.  And when he was in school, he got hit in his eye with a snowball that had a rock in it.  So, he was blind in one eye.  And as he got older, the other eye started deteriorating.  So basically, one of my chores was to be like his other eye.  So, I stayed home while they were--when I was real young I stayed home while they were out working in the fields.
Speaker 1: Okay, to take care of your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But that's all you know about your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] and father were together for a brief period of time, and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is obviously right after the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you don't know if he'd been in the service or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what kind of drawing did he do?
Speaker 2: He did, he did a pencil drawing of a portrait of my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did it look like her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time, yeah.  I mean, it's like the photograph over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife [Shellie Gross Phillips] had, she had written her thesis paper on me.  And she had gotten some of the photographs from my mother that she included in her thesis paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's interesting that your mother gave you his last name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or maybe he gave it.  I don't know if he was around when you were born, or what.
Speaker 2: I guess growing up in a little small town like Gretna, I mean, see, if you...  Let's see, do you know [Washington,] D.C.?
Speaker 1: A little.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I guess if you left Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and you went up to Silver Spring [Maryland], you've gone through the town.  It's not--and that's stretching it.  Now that's really--actually, if you go over here to Columbia Road, you've gone through the main part of town.  And [Highway] 29 runs straight through, that's the main street.  When you come into town, they have a sign, "Welcome to Gretna, Virginia.  Ain't no big thing, but it's growing."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 120612
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, as far as you know, you might take after your father [Frank Phillips] as an artist, I mean in terms of having artistic talent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that must be.  Because nobody on my mother's [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] family's side that I know of had any, expressed any kind of interest in art.  They had--one of my aunts, she had a daughter, who was like thirteen years older than me.  So, of course, being a daughter, she had to learn how to play the piano.  So, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, when you think about the other people you were raised with, I mean, what did you get from your mother and your grandfather [James Brown], and your aunt [Della Louise Brown] and uncle [George Brown]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't artistic, you know, it wasn't about art.  I mean, I told them at a very early age that I wanted to be an artist.  And they said, okay.  I mean they didn't encourage it, but they didn't really support it.  And like every summer, I mean, I used to get this roll--big huge roll they'd do billboards in school.  I'd get a roll of that paper, and in all of my free time, that's all I did was draw.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have, now do you have brothers and sister?
Speaker 2: No, I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you're the only child, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, well--
Speaker 2: Actually, I'm the only surviving son on my mother's side--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which supposedly would have kept me out of Vietnam.  But I had to resort to some other ways to get out of that.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, did you have cousins?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Growing up, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean my grandfather [James Brown]--the first wife--he had two daughters if I'm not mistaken.  Maybe one of my other uncles would have--I don't know.  But the uncles and aunts that I grew up with, I had a, he had a--George had a brother named Clarence Brown, and he had a brother named Harry Brown.  And the daughter that I know that was by the first wife, her name was Minnie, I guess Minerva.  And I guess she was the oldest.  I could have this backwards.  Her name was Virginia, and she was killed in an automobile accident when maybe I was something like three or something, three or four.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the household when you were growing up, you had cousins that grew up with you?
Speaker 2: Well, the cousins that I grew up were from my Uncle Clarence's wife's sister.  And so they had, they had a lot of relatives; I had a lot cousins.  I have another cousin--
Speaker 1: So, did they live there with you?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: They were just coming to visit?
Speaker 2: I mean, they lived in the area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, they lived on their own farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my--oh, I think my grandmother was a Potter, and that was the family name.  And so, I have two cousins which were around my age.  One was named Phyllis Kelly, because her mother is a Potter, Lucille, she married a Kelly.  And then I have Geraldine Potter, who now resides in Florida.
Story_ID: 120613
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I saw that on there.  In reference to--give me a--
Speaker 1: In reference to the first thing that you remember in life.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see.  The first thing I remember in life?
Speaker 1: That you can remember, that you were really conscious that you knew you were, you know, that you were going to hang on to.
Speaker 2: Maybe, maybe the stench of hog killing time, I don't know.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That was bad experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, whew.  They did it on a hill.  Well, it was like a little valley, and then the house was on the other hill, so it just carried.
Speaker 1: I've heard of that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't--it's the smokehouse.  I don't like salt to this day, because that's how they preserved the meat.
Story_ID: 120614
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, in the same vein of discussion, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sounds I guess would be of Charlie Parker, "Bird with Strings."  Because we lived, we lived on a hill.  And Route 29 was below us, and there was a railroad track.  It was a funny thing.  The first time I took my wife to Gretna, she says, "Black people actually do live on the other side of the tracks."  (Laughter).  I said, "Yeah."  So, and then there was this Phillips Gas Station.  They called them fillings stations then.  And of course, they had a black side and a white side, and so they had different jukeboxes.  And somebody must have loved Bird [Charlie Parker], because they'd come in every day, or every other day, and he would play "Bird With Strings," that was what was on there.  And "Laura" was one of the tunes, and "Star Eyes."  At that age I didn't know who Bird was, or who these songs were, you know; I found that out much later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is the late '40s [1940s] when you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, later--
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't realize that in those days, jazz was popular music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't necessarily--not necessarily popular down there, at least not in that area.  Because all we heard was--you turn on the radio and it's the Grand Ole Opry, Hank Williams, unless you get Charlottesville, which is interesting, because--I'm going to assume it was Charlottesville.  Because I heard, the first time I heard of Michael Olatunji was on that station.
Speaker 1: A station from Charlottesville, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Olatunji?
Speaker 2: From the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I heard Joe Harriot.  And then they come back with "Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces" by Pat Boone.  (Laughter).  So, it was crazy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But yeah, that's all I heard was the Grand Ole Opry, Red Foley, and Hank Williams, and those types.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until Elvis came, you know, and then that's a whole other story.  But then there was--okay, during that time we got a station from Tennessee, Nashville.  And that's the first time I heard Johnny Ace, "Oh, My Darling," that song.  I think that was probably the last thing he did before he killed himself playing Russian roulette.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're talking about WLAC down in--
Speaker 2: I don't know, I was a little kid.  All I know is--
Speaker 1: --right outside of Nashville.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then later on, it was Jimmy Reed.  And then from that same gas station, here comes the Flamingos singing "I Only Have Eyes for You."  And that just blew me away, what they were doing with the doo-wop thing, and how they changed that song.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you can--so, where was the proprietor?  So, the gas station had two sides, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was the side that the black people would come to, was that run by the same white people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But they provided--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had their own--they had the jukebox for black clients.  And then they had Red Foley and them on the other side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And interestingly enough, I don't remember a time when the music clashed.  So, I don't know if they controlled that so whoever put their money in first--or either they played the white side first and then played--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there were two, two separate jukeboxes?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: There were two different sides of the building?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It was segregation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Down the middle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Memories, that's what I remember, Jim Crow, very well.
Story_ID: 120615
Speaker 1: So, now, where did you start school?  What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Actually, the white school was called Gretna High School [Gretna, Virginia].  The black school was called Northside [School, Gretna, Virginia].  And Northside was a combination of elementary school, junior high school, and high school, all lumped into one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was called Northside School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Northside School at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was the black school, which meant that all the students were black, and all of the teachers, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: About how big was the school, I mean in terms of class size?
Speaker 2: Well, the classrooms, I'd say they were like twenty, you know, just normal size classrooms--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in terms of the number of students.
Speaker 1: And about how many classrooms did they have?  Did every grade have its own class?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because--they built the new school because the first school was just a little, a little, almost like a brownstone.  And so that's where the early, like, elementary classes were held.  And then when they built the new school down the hill, that's where they had a junior high, and elementary, and the high school.  And we all used the same gym, you know.  So.
Story_ID: 120496
Speaker 1: It just dawned on me.  You were, so your parents [Jettie Elizabeth Brown and Frank Phillips] met in New York [City, New York].  Is that where they met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, somehow that escaped me; you said you from Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's--okay.  Brooklyn's a big place, so a lot of people are there, so, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was born at St. John's [Episcopal] Hospital.  I don't know, but if you ever do Nelson Stevens, he was born there, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The same hospital in Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, now what was your mother doing in New York at that time?  Had she gone there to work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, the typical--leave the South for a better life in the North, you know.  My aunt, Minnie [Brown], she left and she was doing--a maid for this well-off family in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] called the Williams.  My mother was working in a factory.
Speaker 1: This was during the war [World War II]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: When a lot of--
Speaker 2: In New York, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --munitions jobs and, you know, jobs like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, once they separated in New York City, she just took you to [Gretna] Virginia?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, is there any indication your father even knew where you might be?
Speaker 2: I think my aunt [Della Louise Brown] kind of told me a story that he was around for maybe a few days trying to--so I guess hanging out in the woods.  And they wouldn't let him come to the house.  So, that's all I ever heard about that.
Speaker 1: So, he did, he did come and try to find you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, supposedly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right, I just wanted to know.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Story_ID: 120497
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So, when you start school, you're at Northside School [Gretna, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you said you liked to draw.  You started drawing as a, at an early age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when you started drawing, you think?
Speaker 2: I'd say maybe five, four.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you would draw on big rolls of paper, or--
Speaker 2: Well, that came later.  But I mean was drawing on whatever I could get my hands on, you know, cardboard, wood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were your--what would you draw in those days?
Speaker 2: I would draw cars, or I would draw--of course, during that time, you know, you'd draw cowboys and Indians, right?  So, I'd be drawing cowboys and Indians.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's right, that's what was big then for kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Cowboys and Indians.  Now did you, did you have art instruction in school, in elementary school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean, on that level?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they give you time to draw, I mean in school?
Speaker 2: No, that came later.  They hired this one teacher [A.B. Spellman, Sr.].  First they hired his wife [Rosa Spellman], and then they hired him.  And I think she kind of snuck him in there, because I think he had an incident with the person that was the principal at the time.  So, she kind of snuck him in.  So anyway, he was a geography teacher, and maybe some math classes.  But he drew and painted.  And so, he was teaching--it was maybe me and a couple of other people on the side.
Speaker 1: About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: This was like in, maybe I was in sixth grade, sixth or seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was his name?
Speaker 2: A.B. Spellman, Sr.  And of course, you know who his son is?
Speaker 1: Yeah, [HM] A.B. Spellman, of the National Endowment for the Arts.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was his son.
Speaker 1: For many years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, an appreciator of jazz music, like yourself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, A.B. Spellman, right, yeah.  So, this is A.B. Spellman, Sr. who's teaching art?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of materials did he have for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, some water-based poster paint, mainly drawings.  I think it was a couple of kids that were, who were working with clay.  But it was mud, you know, terra cotta, no clay.  (Laughter.)  And we didn't have a kiln. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the one that would give us that big roll of paper every summer to take home.  And I would spend my summers, well, my free time drawing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's, well, if he hadn't been around, you wouldn't--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, that's hard to say.
Speaker 1: You might have found some other way.
Story_ID: 120498
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because, well, when I got shipped off to the suburbs of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], there--which was like culture shock in my life.  But it was the only time I've gone through culture shock.  I could major in art, I had a double period of art every day.
Speaker 2: Now, this is in high school?
Speaker 1: This is in junior high.
Speaker 2: Junior high, okay.  So, how old were you when--
Speaker 1: Junior high, senior high, and high school.
Speaker 2: How old were you when you were sent to Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to go into eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, how, well, give us some background on how that decision was made.
Speaker 1: Well, my mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] felt she wanted me to get a better education than what I was getting at Northside [School in Gretna, Virginia], or anywhere in the South.  Because well, the facilities we had, we had secondhand buses from the white schools, secondhand books, among other things, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did she send you to live with your aunt [Minnie Brown] in Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: She, well, okay, after my grandfather [James Brown] died, she moved to Philadelphia, and she was living with my aunt in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania].  Bryn Mawr is a suburb of Philadelphia, and it's part of the "great Main Line."
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think, like, we've interviewed people from the Lower Merion [Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's where I went to school at.
Speaker 2: Okay, the Main Line.  Now, this is where a lot of rich people--
Speaker 1: Yes, at one point it was supposed to be the second richest township in the country.
Speaker 2: Right.  And black people that work for them live in the area, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Some do--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, okay, you have--
Speaker 2: --and come from somewhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have these pockets of black people and poor whites that live in the town.  So, you've got like a couple of streets--well, Arden was a little different, it has a number of streets.  So, they have a larger black population.  But in Bryn Mawr, it's like two and a half streets.  The full streets that are all black would be Warner Avenue and Prospect.  And the next street over is Merion Avenue, which is where my aunt lived, which was half black and half white.  And, but there was an African American Methodist church on Merion Avenue.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, your mother basically established herself there first and then brought you up--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --afterwards.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is--well, you'd been there before, right, to visit?
Speaker 1: Well, she brought me up for a visit one summer to see how I liked it, maybe two summers.  No, I think it was one summer.  And then she told me that she was moving me there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, I had made friends, I thought.  So, you know, I was comfortable with it.
Story_ID: 120499
Speaker 1: So, this [Phillip's move to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] is right after your grandfather [James Brown] passed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandfather, I think he died, it must have been like '58 [1958] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you spent a lot of time with your grandfather, right, helping him?
Speaker 2: Um, pretty much, yeah.  I mean that's what--that was my chores when I was real little.  But the older I got, the sicker he got, so it wasn't much I could do.  And then also, I was being taught the art of farming.  (Laughter).  So, you know, I spent more and more time, as I got bigger and older, working in the fields.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like farm work?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't go back to being a farmer now, no.  I mean, it was okay.  It had its ups and downs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't totally bad?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Because the face you made wasn't very--(Laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I mean, you know--well, an only child--because we had to have, we had to hire helpers.  So, I got a chance to interact with some of the kids in the town that were black, you know, because our neighbors were all white.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The neighbor would be like from here to maybe Georgia Avenue, as opposed to living, say, in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], where you walk out the door, and wham!  You know, big difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because you've got some space separating you.
Speaker 1: So, were you excited about going to Bryn Mawr?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the beginning, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, how did you do in school when you got there?  Were you up to speed with the-- or were they--
Speaker 2: No, well, I had to take a test.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they gave me the option of whether I was going to repeat the eighth grade or go on to ninth grade.  And after they explained it to me, I decided to repeat the eighth grade.
Story_ID: 120500
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what was the name of your school in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's part of Lower Merion Township [Pennsylvania], but it wasn't Lower Merion.  See, the school--Lower Merion's population got so big they had to build another school.  So, they had, in Rosemont [Pennsylvania] the high school was called Harriton, H-A-R-R-I-T-O-N, Harriton High School.  And the junior high school was called Bala Cynwyd.  No, it wasn't; it was in Bala Cynwyd [Pennsylvania].  Let me think of, what the hell is that school's name?  I pushed the school out of my mind.  It'll come back to me later.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Welsh Valley [Middle School, Narberth, Pennsylvania], that's it, Welsh Valley.
Speaker 1: Welsh Valley?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cynwyd, there are a lot of names that are like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went back and repeated the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, all right.  Now, were there any--I mean, so, well, what was the racial makeup of the school?  Was it integrated, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, yeah.  But this school system--Lower Merion had a very large black population.  This school system, when I graduated it must have been three hundred kids, and there was just barely ten of us.  I don't think it was quite ten.
Speaker 1: Just ten out of three hundred?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's at Harriton, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that's the high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Were there any--so--
Speaker 2: And junior high school was about the same. Because when we graduated, we all, you know, went to the next level together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you were like 1/30th of the class.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now were there any special teachers at--first, at Welsh Valley?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean they had an art teacher, for one.  That was special to me.  They also had shop.  I didn't take shop, because it was a choice between--I could major in art or I could, you know, you could take--that second period took up the shop class.  So, I never really got into, like mechanical things.
Story_ID: 120501
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what else did you like to do, growing up?  I know you liked art.
Speaker 2: Well, I liked sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Baseball and basketball.  I wasn't big on football.
Speaker 1: Okay, baseball and basketball?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you, when you got to high school, were you part of any clubs or anything?
Speaker 2: Boys' Club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was about it.
Speaker 1: Did you have to work while growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I worked, I was hired at the restaurant, I was a busboy.  So, well, I explained to you about the area, right, and the kind of people that lived there, right?  So, I'm working, just started.  And so, I'm carrying a tray out to pick up the dishes on the table.  And I look over and I see some of my white classmates.  So, I said, "No, this is not going to work."  (Laughter).  Plus, I had to wear a uniform, and I didn't like the uniform, never did like uniforms.  So, fortunately, somebody who was working in the dishwashing room got sick, and they needed somebody to replace them.  So I said, "I'll do it."  So I went back and I worked back there, you know, washing dishes.  And that's where I decided to stay.
Speaker 1: Because you didn't have to come out and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --okay, and mingle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The nature of that area is a lot of service jobs, right? For the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, pretty much.  I mean there are some civil service jobs.  But yeah, it was basically--well, like I said, that's why those black people live in those little towns, because they were either maids or they were chauffeurs, and they had accumulated a certain amount of wealth and they bought their homes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, in school, did they track--
Speaker 2: I mean some of them, not all of them, you know of course.
Speaker 1: Did they track you in school?  Like, put everybody who thinks they're going to college in one group?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.  They took us, they would--the guidance counselor would tell us, "Oh, yeah, you can, when you get out of school, you can get a job working on--on the trash company."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you say he would tell the black students that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I have a friend of mine.  He's a psychologist, and they told him that.  And in fact, he's the head of the Black Psychologists Association [Association of Black Psychologists] in the country.
Speaker 1: Who is that?
Speaker 2: Monty--Wilbur Monty Whitney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was in Cincinnati [Ohio], but now he's in Atlanta [Georgia].  We keep in touch.  We're the same age, but I ended up going to school with his brother [Stan Whitney], who's a year younger than him, instead of being in the class with Wilbur.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, regardless of what kind of potential you were demonstrating there, I mean, you were counseled that you weren't going to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you, did you think that you were going to college when you were in school?  Did you have any, did your mother push that idea?
Speaker 2: I think they were--because my mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] was probably concerned that I get out of high school, because the only thing I was interested in was art.  I mean, I liked science and I liked geography.  But the rest of it, you know, I was just there.  And for some reason, a number of--I don't know if they were harder on them or what the deal was.  Some of the people before me that went through the school system, they ended up having to repeat a couple of the grades before they graduated.  In fact I had this one--one of my friends--his mother told my mother, "Oh, yeah, he won't graduate, because you know, it's going to take him an extra year."  So, my mother was really hoping and praying that I would be one of the ones who would graduate on time, which I did.
Story_ID: 120502
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you're in school and, you're in high school, and you graduated in '62 [1962] or '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four, [1964], okay, '64 [1964].  Now, you're in school when the March on Washington takes place [in 1963].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you actually came to the March?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  How did you get a chance to go to the March?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually didn't finish talking about things when I was in [Gretna] Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Like I said, I was saying we had our farm.  We had what I thought was our forty acres, which turns out to be twenty-two acres.  And there was this white family, and they had a sharecropper.  And the sharecroppers that they had, they had about three of them during the time that I was there, they were all white.  Now, the house that I grew up in, it was basically a log cabin.  And then they added on a kitchen, and a porch, and several other rooms, and upstairs.  The house that the sharecroppers lived in was about the same.  The only difference was, I mean, what I saw visually was they, they kept it painted.  They painted the logs white, and where the dirt--they painted that brown.  So, you had this brown and white posh looking cabin.  Ours was just a cabin.  And then later on, they would put that brick siding on it to uplift, spiff it up.  So, so, the sharecroppers, they would have families, they had kids.  And then of course, the Ingram [ph.] family, which owned--where the sharecroppers worked from--they had kids.  And they were all a little older than me.  So, they'd want to play, or I'd want to play, because I had nobody else to play with unless I went into town.  And wasn't old enough at that time to go into town on my own, which was about a mile away.  So, we would play.  And we would have these little incidents.  And they'd, of course, end up using the "N" word, right, and we'd end up fighting.  So, and they would come back the next day.  "Can..." they called me Jimmy then.  "Can Jimmy come out and play?"  So, this went on.  And of course, if they saw me in town, you know, they'd look the other way, and I'd ignore them, too.  So, this went on back and forth.  And then the old--Mr. Ingram, the old man, he used to work for the railroad, and he only had one arm, so he was scary.  There was another family called the Clays [ph.] that lived at the end of the road, and I used to play with their two sons.  And Miss Ingram was very nice.  She would invite me in the house, and he'd come home and chase me out.  He had a son, Frank, Jr., he was a schoolteacher; I used to play with his kids.  And his wife, I was okay with.  But he'd come home and he'd chase me out.  (Laughter).  So, this thing went on.  It was either--somebody--the mother or the father, it was either one or the other.  Like, the Clay kids, the mother didn't like me associating with them, but I kind of grew on her, so then she said it was alright.  So, I had this back and forth thing.  And like I said, the town was a mile away.  So as I got older, I started going into town hanging out with the black kids.  And of course, I went, I would see them in school.  And of course, we'd go, we all went to church together.  So--
Speaker 1: Was that--you said it was, what kind of church was it?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 120503
Speaker 1: So, when Mr. Ingram [ph.] found out that I was moving to North [to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]--because he would always come there and try to talk to our family, "It's a shame about this segregation," da da da da da.  Well, what he was trying to do was trying to get the family to sell him the land, so he would own all the land all the way to the tracks.  So, when he found out I was going, my mother was taking me north, he came down and he said, "Now, did you hear me?  Don't you go up there and get mixed up with them northern agitators."  (Laughter).  So, me being a teenager, of course, when I got north I got involved with the most radical thinking groups of people I could find.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, what group did you get involved with?
Speaker 1: None, really, because I'm not that type of person.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't believe in joining--you know, I belong to AfriCOBRA [the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists], and I belong to the Weusi [artist collective].  But those are the only two organizations, and I still keep a certain independence from them.
Speaker 2: Now, well, how did you get to the March on Washington [1963]?  That's how we started this strain, but--
Speaker 1: Well, so, okay, that's pretty much the South. So, I get to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I'll tell you about these kids that I had befriended.  So, they found out I was moving there, so then I became a target--so you know, the one to pick on, or the one to make fun of.  And that was easy, because I dressed country, you know, being from the South.  So, there was that issue.  Then they started playing the dozens.  And I wasn't even aware, fully aware of the dozens, 'cause I didn't hang around black kids that much.  So, that was an issue.  So, I had to--
Speaker 2: This is in Philadelphia [Pennsyvlania]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is in--
Speaker 1: This is in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Bryn Mawr.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I got that, and then I saw another side of racism when we started going to school.  They didn't use the "N" word.  You know, they had things like-- they called you a spear chucker, or a Mau Mau, because this is during the time of Jomo Kenyatta.  And, you know, also during--they called you Pygmy.  That was during the uprising between the Pygmies and the Watusis.  And I think the Pygmies slaughtered the Watusis about a hundred to--something like that.
Speaker 2: It was really the Hutus and the Tutsis, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, they would call you things like that.  And then like when you'd call them on it, they'd say, "Oh, man, it was just a joke, man."  You know, because they would call each other kikes and wops, and things like that.  But it wasn't the same thing, you know.  I mean, even calling a white person the "C" word is not the same thing, you know.  So anyway, so we had, there were like two groups, three groups, actually, of white people.  First of all, growing up in the South, all I'd hear was WASPs [White Anglo-Saxon Protestants].  I never, well, I knew there was an Italy and there was a Germany, but I never ran into Germans or any Italians, or any Irish people.  You know, it was just all WASPs.  So, but there were like three different groups.  There was like the old-line rich people.  And then there was the Jewish community that--some was probably, you know, nouveau rich and all of that, and they might have had some old money.  But generally, for sure, they made their money, because they had their stores in South Philadelphia.  Now, you say you've been through Lower Merion Township [Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, see, that's right on the border of City Line Avenue [U.S. Route 1].  So, that means Overbrook [High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So a lot of those kids, before those schools and those divisions were put up, those kids, they went to Overbrook.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where Wilt Chamberlain went.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and Wayne Hightower.  And let's see, who else?  I can't think of her name right now, a singer [Rosetta Hightower, Dee Dee Sharp, etc.].  It'll come to me later.
Story_ID: 120504
Speaker 1: All right, so, so you were telling about how you got involved in the March [on Washington, 1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So anyway, since I was sort of alienated all the way around, I started hanging out with another guy on my block who was a musician.  And so, I started hanging out with him down in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], going to clubs and stuff.  And in the meanwhile, you know, we were, I had been a part of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I forgot that part.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  One thing you didn't finish.  You were telling us there were three groups of white people.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You said there were the old Irish people, and then there were the Jewish merchants from the--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah--
Speaker 1: --stores in South Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then--
Speaker 1: And you said one of the--
Speaker 2: And then the third part were these poor white people from, they were actually on the border of Manayunk [neighborhood in northwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], because that's where they came from.  And somehow or another, the borderlines for Lower Merion Township [Pennsylvania] included some of those people.  So, they would come from that part of Philadelphia over to Welsh Valley [Middle School] in Harriton [sic Narberth, Pennsylvania], to go to school with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And some of them were, let me see, they were sons of police officers, and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, back to the--so, the NAACP, you're going with a friend of yours who's a musician, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--
Speaker 1: To the NAACP--
Speaker 2: No, no.  We were, we all joined.  It was like three of us.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It was Stan Whitney, which is Monty's [Wilbur Whitney] brother, he was an aspiring artist.  There was this musician's brother named Harry Pollard, he was an aspiring visual artist.  And then there was an older guy that was supposed to graduate named Jarvis Holly [ph.].  So, in high school there were four, they had four blacks that were interested in being artists.  And in junior high school, it was just the three of us.  So, we ended up joining the NAACP chapter in Ardmore [Pennsylvania].  And one of the meetings we had, they brought in Medgar Evers to speak.  Like, he was very enthusiastic, and got everybody all fired up about joining and contributing, and doing whatever was necessary at the time.  So, because of the NAACP, that's how I ended up coming, we ended up going to the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now the spring before, Medgar Evers was shot and killed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you all were aware--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of that, because you had met him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we were aware of what was going on.  I had, one of my friends, he died because he was taking a shipment of goods on a truck down South for the--tent people is not the right word, because that's the group here in Washington--but the people that were doing voter registration--
Speaker 1: SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For SNCC?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Back in--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he had I think a flat tire, and he was jacking the truck up, and the truck turned over and crushed him.  So, yeah, so we, we all went down to the March on Washington.
Story_ID: 120505
Speaker 1: But getting back to the piano player, Alfie, Harry's brother, I started hanging out with him, going downtown.  And we used to hang in a place in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] called Rittenhouse Square, which had these divisions, too.  There were like--people who--homosexuals and gay people had their own side.  And the drug people had their own side, and then they had a section where black activists met and talked about various things in terms of the [Civil Rights] Movement.
Speaker 2: Now, Rittenhouse Square is an area, or a place, or what is it?
Speaker 1: It's a park.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's like Center City between Walnut, and I can't think of the next street over.  But it's between 20th and 19th Street.  They have a big, huge flower show there every year.  And then, you know, people would come through like Bernie Siegel; he didn't live too far from there.  Anybody who came into town, like any time--like when Cannonball came to the Showboat or the Peps, they would come in and hang out in Rittenhouse Square.  That's where I met people like Charles Lloyd, Ted Curson, Louis Hayes.  I think Louis is a Philadelphian if I'm not mistaken, yeah.  And, you know, all kinds of people.  The actor, Boyle, Peter Boyle, used to come through there.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So we, you know, we'd go downtown and hang out in Rittenhouse Square and go to clubs, go to--we'd either go to--they had a couple of folk clubs like 2nd Fret, and there was another one.  And of course, people like Richie Havens used to come down, and that's how I met him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, he just passed away last year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, yeah.  That's the one--
Speaker 2: Was that like a folk song--folk singer?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was from Brooklyn [New York].  So, and then on weekends we would, we would go to New York and hang out.  Because back in that day on the weekend, you could, like for $5.25, you could get a round-trip ticket from Philadelphia to New York.  So, we'd go up and hang out in Rittenhouse Square and then on the Lower East Side [Manhattan, New York], and come back the next day and go to school.
Speaker 2: So, you're, you're still in high school [at Harriton High School in Rosemont, Pennsylvania] at this point, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, that's, you're seventeen when the March on Washington--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: --took place.  So, you had a lot of freedom.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.  My mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown], well, she worked nights because she was--aside from working, doing social work, she still was doing, working at the hospital part-time in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania].  So, I mean, like when I was nineteen I told her I was moving to New York [City].  So, she didn't really, she didn't want me to go, but she didn't stop me or even make a big fuss of it.
Story_ID: 120506
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now, you came out of [Harriton] High School [Rosemont, Pennsylvania] at eighteen or nineteen?  Was it--
Speaker 2: No, I was like eighteen, or seventeen and a half, something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know you did eighth grade over again, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that put you about a year behind.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, but, so when you were on the verge of graduating, what were you--you were thinking about moving to New York [City], right?  But still, I mean, what did you think you were going to do?  Artwork?
Speaker 2: Well, getting back to this social scheme at the school.  You know, I was interested in basketball.  So, and when I was in junior high school, I played soccer.  I was on the soccer team, I was a goalie.  And so when I got to high school, I decided I was going to try out for the basketball team.  So, they had this guy they hired as a teacher.  And he apparently had been working with what we would call now "at-risk" kids in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, he brought his ideas around.  And so, he was working with some of the so-called at-risk kids at Harriton.  And like I said, I wasn't really interested in any of the subjects outside of art.  So, I was just barely making it through.  So, he was a basketball enthusiast, and he started this summer league.  Now, our school, like I said, we only had two or three players, two or three black people in it.  We excelled in tennis, swimming, soccer, cross-country.  But things like football and basketball, no.  (Laughter).  Because we, because they didn't really have any black players, for one thing.  Lower Merion [High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania], on the other hand, were champs, even before Kobe Bryant came there.  I mean they had won a number of... and I think Kobe took them to the state championship.  Now, I don't think they won a state championship, but they had won a lot of city and district championships.  They were a powerhouse at one time.  So, he starts this summer league, this particular teacher.  And so it's like a team from Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], which is us, the black team.  And then there was another part of Bryn Mawr where James Palmer comes from.  And Jimmy Dikes, who used to manage the Detroit Tigers, they had their own team.  In fact, we used to play each other at the Boys Club.  And then so they had--the little Jewish section, they had their team.  And then there was another group that had their team.  So, we had this tournament.  And everybody got eliminated except for the guys from the other side of Bryn Mawr and us, on the black side.  So, we played off, and we went through three overtimes.  And they just won by one point.  But what happened, we come back in the fall, and apparently this teacher had turned face, and decided--because I think the Jewish people decided that they didn't want any black players, because they didn't want the same thing that would happen down in Lower Merion [High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania] and in Overbrook [High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], with the black players getting all the little--all their daughters and stuff.  So, they decided they didn't want to have a black team.  So, they cut us the first scrimmage.  So, that was the end of my taste for sports, and that's when I started really focusing on being an artist.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I started thinking about hanging--just forget sports, and hanging out in those kinds of environments, you know, just hanging out at the club and listening to music, and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, at that time, the music was my main focus more than the art.
Speaker 1: Did you play any--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --any music?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean when I was in, when in was in, when I was in Virginia, since my mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown]--you know, she did substitute teaching, and she became friends with the band leader, the band teacher.  And he decided it would be cute if he had a couple of--what do they call them?  I can't think of the name of them.
Story_ID: 120507
Speaker 1: Majorettes or cheerleaders?
Speaker 2: No.  Oh, wow, you know, the people that dressed up in costumes.
Speaker 1: Drum majors, or--
Speaker 2: No.  Mascots, mascots.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, mascots.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they said it would be cute if they had these two kids from elementary school as part of their band mascot.  So, they got one of my friends to be the majorette, and they put me in the band carrying this big drum, which I couldn't carry.  Because at that time they had drum and bugle, so they switched me over to bugle, which I couldn't play.  And then they graduated to trumpets, and I couldn't play that.  So, that was the end.  I said I can draw, I don't need to--so, in a way I was sorry, because I really loved music.  But then after what I heard, I don't know what I could play, compared to what I paint.  (Laughter).  You know, I'm my own man when I'm painting.  So, yeah, but music--well, you know, even at the point--you know, this was when, around the time I guess when [HM Amiri] Baraka and them came out with the Black Arts Movement--so, I--Baraka, and Larry Neal, you know, and others.  So, I actually thought the [Black Arts] Movement was about the music at one point.  Because, you know, that's--well, that's how they spoke.  And so, like, with the music first, and then there was dance.  And then as a support, there was visual art.  You know, because when you look at it, Larry Neal and Baraka, they were promoters and supporters of the music.
Speaker 1: Right, (unclear) people and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and all the--Apple Cores [magazine column].  And then A.B.'s [HM A.B. Spellman] "Four Lives and Bebop."
Story_ID: 120508
Speaker 1: So, were you still close to [HM] A.B. Spellman at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, actually--
Speaker 1: Well, he was down in Virginia, that's right.
Speaker 2: No, no, he was in, he--actually he went--he went to school with [HM Amiri] Baraka here at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's much later; that's later, though.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was, he's older than me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, at that time when I came along, he was probably here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you know, he was in school--Baraka, Marion Brown, and Stokely [Carmichael], and all that crew.  Yeah, I met him like when I first moved, when I moved to New York, in like--well, I used to see him, I didn't really meet him.  I didn't meet until later on when he moved here to take a job at the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts], that's when I really met him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But when you were in high school--I'm trying to get at, like--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Were you reading like the Negro Digest and books like that?  I mean, things that--where were you reading about Baraka?
Speaker 2: Oh, well--
Speaker 1: In Jet [magazine] or Ebony?
Speaker 2: No.  Remember, during that time he was still on the beat poet circuit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he would come to--he and Ted Jones, you know, they would come to Bryn Mawr [College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania].  And Ted Jones was a painter, originally, yeah.  So, you had people like that.  There's still people like that who come through Bryn Mawr, Bryn Mawr College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were seeing these people live--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during...  Now, what's the difference between what people were doing in the Black Arts Movement, you know, that made what they were doing different from what came before?  Because we had black artists before, and black poets before, and black musicians before.  What was the difference?
Speaker 2: Well, the difference is the art was, it was a propaganda movement, and the art must support the Civil Rights Movement.  And you had to create images that were in support of the Movement.  Otherwise, you know, it wasn't relevant, and it wasn't about art for art's sake.  You know, it was art for people's sake.
Story_ID: 120509
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, is the first time that, you know, black artists started consciously talking about black art?
Speaker 2: You know, we got--you have the Harlem Renaissance, quote, unquote "The Harlem Renaissance."  And, you know, you have people, I guess [Joel Augustus] Rogers and Alaine Locke, that are talking about African American artists need to go back to the African legacy and explore the ancestral roots and use that as a foundation.  Some of those artists--maybe I can think of one particular artist in particular--he might do a still life, and he would have a piece of African fabric on top of it and maybe a piece of African sculpture.  Then there are people like Aaron Douglas, who are a little more out there, even though they say the poet [Carl] Van Vechten and this other painter--I can't think of his name, it'll come to me later--had influence.  But I can't imagine them standing behind Aaron Douglas and telling him, "Well, put the yellow over here."  You know, so he had to have a sense or a conscious to do this--the actual work, you know.  And then of course, you--that kind of died with the stock market falling, the Depression, and also then you got McCarthyism coming in, and that didn't help things at all.  You know, a lot of black people suffered from that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was because if they were for social changes, they were branded as Communists?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And so, that might be the beginning of the division, where some artists, some African American artists want to be mainstream, and some other African American artists wanted to deal with their consciousness.
Story_ID: 120510
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, well, we haven't even graduated you from [Harriton] High School [Rosemont, Pennsylvania] yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you were, so when you graduated from high school did you have like a, did you take the college prep course?  Did you take like--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --science stuff, or did you take the general course?  Or what did you take?
Speaker 2: No.  The guy's name was Jarvis Holly.  The older guy that was in our class that was taking art classes, he was, after he graduated he started taking, going to night school at the Philadelphia College of Art, which is now the University for the Arts, on Broad and Pine in Philadelphia [sic University of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  They had the facade of the old school, and it's still there at Broad and Pine Street, which is around the corner from the Showboat, where the Showboat used to be, which later on became the Bijou.  So--
Speaker 1: So, he preceded you at the Philadelphia College of Art?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, what I did was I worked and I saved up my money.   I worked in the summer.  I worked at Horn & Hardart's for a while and then I worked at J.C. Penney's.  And I enrolled in some classes at the Philadelphia College of Art.  I was thinking somebody was going to pick up the tab, but it didn't happen.  So, I did like one semester at the Philadelphia College of Art.  And then I became more interested in going to New York, and kind of lost interest.  Because at that time, Harry Pollard, he, when he finished, when he graduated he went directly to New York, and he was in the [University City] Art Students League on 57th Street.  Of course, the Art Students League don't offer you a degree.  But he was staying there, and he would come home talking about how he used to go and hang out at the Five Spot and the Half Note and listen to John Coltrane all night, or Thelonious Monk or Horace Silver.  And he, well, his brother being a musician, he knew people.  Like he knew Horace, he knew Elvin [Jones].  So, you know, he was a direct connect to the musicians.  So, I said, yeah, I got to get to New York so I can hear that music.  Because, you know, what I wanted to hear would only come to Philadelphia every now and then.  So, that was my big push.  So after that one semester of art school, I worked, saved my money, and moved to New York.
Story_ID: 120511
Speaker 1: This is 1966, I guess, or--?
Speaker 2: This is, no, in the fall of '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Fall of '65 [1965], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you're in New York City.  And, okay, so what did you do in New York?
Speaker 2: At first I got a job at J.C. Penney's again, because I had already worked there.  I was living with my uncle who lived in Brooklyn, my Uncle Harry, for a while.  He asked me to leave because he had a small flat, and also he didn't like the hours I was keeping.  And plus, he had to get up early in the morning.  So, I said, okay.  So I left, and I moved in with Harry and some other people that he knew.  So, and then I got a job as a messenger.  Actually, that's how I learned New York City, being a messenger going all around in different boroughs.  And then--
Speaker 1: Now was this on, were you on a bike or on foot?
Speaker 2: No, walking, walking, and taking the Metra, the train or the bus.  I preferred the bus because I could see more and learn more.  I remember when I first got to New York I was living in the Village, trying to get to Harlem on West 4th Street.  I must have tried that about four times before I realized the A train is not the only train that comes through West 4th Street.  There is the D, which goes into the Bronx [New York], and then there's the E.  And I always ended up somewhere in the Bronx at 125th Street, or I'd end up out in Jamaica, before...  (Laughter).  And I looked at the map and I said, "Oh, this is where it's going wrong."  So then shortly after that, after a couple of other tries and some other jobs, I got a job working as a, doing window display for this ladies' wear company called the Plymouth Shop.  And they had stores all over Manhattan [New York].  And I think they even had a shop out to Long Island [New York] in Paramus, New Jersey.  And so, the main store was at 50th and 5th Avenue.  And the window display people would have to travel to all their stores.  So, I got to know the Bronx and Paramus, New Jersey, because I got stranded out there one day and tried to hitchhike into Manhattan.  And nobody would pick me up, so I ended up walking from Paramus, New Jersey to Manhattan.  So, now, the only problem with window display is seasonal work.  You know, you got the holidays, and then pretty much after the spring line is put in, the summer is pretty dead.  You know, it's almost like the art scene, you know, there's nothing really happening.  So, I had to find other work.  But then the next fall, they would hire me back again.
Story_ID: 120512
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did the Black Arts Movement, or what you were hearing about it in those days, influence the work that you were doing?  I mean what were you doing before, and how did it change?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, like I said, I was really interested in the music.  So, I was a doing a little bit of art, I wasn't really doing--I mean like I would work, and then I could go and sit in Slugs all night.  You know, because you could sit in Slugs.  All you had to do was buy a beer and you could sit, if you wanted to, you could sit there for three sets.  Slugs is a club that is down on the Lower East Side on 3rd Street [in New York City], the far Lower East Side, as they call it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then one day, you know, I go to the [Village] Vanguard.  I could get in because I would go with Norman, Norman Connors because, you know, musicians could get in.  So, the Vanguard, the Gate, the Five Spot [Cafe], you know.  Occasionally, you know, I had enough money where I could pay for my own way, but most of the time I was just hanging out with him.  That's how I got to know the musicians in Sun Ra's band, through him.  And like, living on the Lower East Side, that's where the majority of the musicians were.  You know, you walk down the street and, you know, you'd run into Albert Ayler, or Cecil Taylor, or Kenny Durham, Roy Haynes, you know, they would just be on the street.  In fact, how I met Pharoah [Sanders], was one day I was walking from the East Side to the West Side.  And we were in each other's--the same arts place.  And he was going to the bus station--the train--because he had a gig at the Showboat in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, I walked with him down to West 4th Street, and we got to talking.  And that's how we sort of became friends.  And you know, Pharoah was never close to anybody, so we didn't really became tight or anything like that.  So, then one day--
Speaker 1: So, you and him weren't close friends, Pharoah Sanders?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean not at that time, because he wasn't trusting people in New York, you know.
Speaker 1: Was he playing with John Coltrane at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because the group was Pharoah Sanders, John Coltrane, Elvin Jones, Jimmy Garrison, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but then they had Rashied Ali.  He had two drummers when they first--two drummers when they started out, Rashied Ali and Elvin [Jones].  And occasionally he used a second bass, McCoy and Jimmy Garrison.  And it was like maybe several other people in the band on the horn, on either alto or tenor, before he settled for Pharoah.  Because he used to have Carlos Ward, he's an alto player.  And then he, I have a couple of recordings of some concerts where he had an unidentified horn player.  In fact, the concert they did in Seattle, there's a couple of unidentified horn players on those.  And then actually the first time I saw him after [the album] "Ascension" was at the Village Gate.  And he had Archie [Shepp], Pharoah [Sanders], and Carlos Ward.  And--
Speaker 1: Archie Shepp?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's the one that [HM] A.B. [Spellman] wrote a review and trashed the band, because he couldn't hear anything.  And you couldn't.  (Laughter).  I mean the first set you could hear, because Elvin was late, and it was just Rashied.  And I think they played "Afro Blue" for the whole set.  And then Elvin came along, and I remember I was, I went to the club.  I was going to draw, because that's what Harry used to do; he'd go to the club and draw musicians.  He had all these drawings that he did of Elvin Jones.  And I went and sat down, and I happened to sit beside this guy named Marzette Watts who was a musician and a painter from Atlanta [Georgia].  He said, "You ain't going to draw anything."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "You wait."  So, when they started playing, you know, I didn't draw anything.  (Laughter).  I was just sitting there, just taking it all in.  I was dumbfounded.
Story_ID: 120513
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Now, but when you--now, do you listen to music when you paint?
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a different experience, though, right, listening to it without them being there I guess?
Speaker 1: Well, yes and no.  I mean if you listen to that particular music in that period, you know, you can reflect back on it.  I love like the World Saxophone Quartet, but the energy's not there; but I really like what they do.  And some of the younger musicians like, I can't think of the guy's name, he's from Chicago [Illinois], alto.  Henry Threadgill.
Speaker 2: Henry Threadgill, right.
Speaker 1: And I like, well, Anthony Braxton, but he's like from that period, too.  But he's like from Chicago with the musicians, like with Lou Hall and those guys.  I used to read about Lou Hall in Down Beat [magazine].  But it wasn't until, I think, about the mid-'60s [1960s] that I actually heard him.
Story_ID: 120514
Speaker 1: Now, are you selling artwork at this point at all?
Speaker 2: You mean like in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't--
Speaker 1: When did you start--?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get--so I remember one day I had invited Norman [Connors] over to where we were staying at.  And so, he says to me "You call yourself an artist?"  He said, "You don't even have an easel."  And that's when I started, "Yeah well, this is alright hanging out in the clubs listening to music, but I've got to focus on what I'm supposed to be doing."  So, that's when I started really started focusing on visual art.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, had you--now, by this time I suppose you had started oil painting, right?
Speaker 2: No, I was working with acrylics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing portraits.  You know, I would do paintings of people like LeRoy [Clarke], musicians, things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in--so you're really becoming a, I guess a part of the New York scene, with all of the things that are going on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the country, the country is going through a lot of changes in this period of time.  There are riots--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and other cities--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in '66 [1966], and '67 [1967] in Detroit [Michigan].  Now, you painted a picture we have here called "The Dealer" from 1966.  Is this one of the--do you remember this one?
Speaker 2: "The Dealer?"
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: At that time--that's in the Driskell collection [University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland].  But that's misdated, that was done around '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  I'm going to scratch it off here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We have it in the wrong space.  Well, what were you--were you painting in the style that you're known for in those days?
Speaker 2: No, not back then, no.
Story_ID: 120515
Speaker 1: Doing representational type--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then, let me see, about the middle of '66 [1966] my mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] got sick.  So I went back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I got involved with the Lee Cultural Center while I was there.  And that's how--
Speaker 1: What is the Lee Cultural Center?  Is that, is that a--
Speaker 2: It's a cultural center that's located at--off of 40th and Market Street in West Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And it was run by this East Indian named Shulamayar [ph.].  And I believe he was East Indian; he could have been West Indian, but I think he was East Indian.  And they had a lot of performances there.  They had drama.  They had an art class that was taught by Reginald Bryant who was, who worked for the College of Art [now University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I guess he was a public school art teacher.  Yeah, he was a public school art teacher.  And then they had a music class that was run by this vibist named Bill Lewis, and occasionally they would have concerts there.  And they would have other things happening, like Michael Olatunji and his band came and performed.  And then Muhammad Ali came out there and did a talk.  I think that's where--so anyway, Reggie Bryant was trying to organize artists.  And so he had the, he had some of the elite artists in Philadelphia at that time, like Humphrey Howard, Charles Searles, and Barkley Hendricks.  And what he was asking the artists to do was to pool their money, and give a certain percentage of their sales towards this Black Arts Movement.  And they said no.  (Laughter).  So, it never happened.  So, but, you know, I was taking classes there, and as my mother got better I ended up deciding to move back to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, this would be in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] been assassinated yet at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that happened while I was in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was living in West Philly.
Speaker 1: Were there riots in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, North--I think it was mostly North Philadelphia.  Well, they weren't in the part of West Philadelphia that I was living in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So, but most of the news that I got was the riot here and in Washington [D.C.] and Detroit [Michigan] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and in New York [City, New York].
Story_ID: 120516
Speaker 1: Okay, so you moved back to New York [City, New York], this is after April of '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do in New York the second time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started working at this department store printing display signs.  And then I had a friend of mine who had heard about this school called a printing trade school, so he was enrolled in that.  And that was, the class was at 14th Street, and the printing trade school was at 23rd Street.  So, Chuck took me by there, Chuck Mitchell [ph.] is the guy's name, and he introduced me to the proprietor, Mr. Jenkins [ph.].  And apparently, Mr. Jenkins was getting money, I guess.  I don't know if it was from the state or the city, to give students loans to go to this trade school.  And the majority of the students that were there were West Indians and Puerto Ricans.  So, I became very interested in opaquing.  And that's a technique where you mask out one background to superimpose an image on top of another.  And it's done with special paint, and you have to do, you have to work on both negatives.  You have to work on the background, take out what you need there, and then you have to take the negative that you paint--that you superimpose on the background--and paint out the back side of it, so it won't, so it won't come through.  And then you put two negatives together and print it.  And a very good opaquer, you have to really look real close around the edges to see how good he is.  And also hair, because strings of hair are hard to do, too.  Now, I guess they can use computers to do all that stuff.  So, that's what my focus was, I wanted to be an opaquer.  And then along comes this guy, he's a printing broker.  He's the head of Allen Press [ph.]; that was the name of his organization.  And he was looking for someone to work--because it was a two-man operation.  And they gave me, I took the job.  He liked me, I interviewed, and he gave me the job as an assistant production manager.  Because the production manager was this older guy named Lee, Lee Kuhns.  And basically it was like a glorified position, because I did all the dirty work.  I went around and packed up the stuff and made sure it got shipped out.  And at first it was alright, and then finally I caught on.  Because when they went to meet with clients, they always found something else for me to do.  (Laughter).  So, I mean at one point it got so bad they had me--Mr. Lippy, Allen Lippy, he was the owner of Allen Press.  They were like at 20th and 5th Avenue.  He had double-parked, and so they had me go, they wanted me to go there and sit in the car while they were conducting business with the client so I wouldn't learn that part of the business, because they weren't interested in me learning that part of the business.  So, around this time my painting is really beginning to pick up.  And I got ill, so I took off a week.  I took off a week, and then I started painting.  And then I said I'd take off another week.  So, it felt good, you know, working full-time on the work.  So I went back to work, and they thought that I was looking for another job somewhere.  So, they were happy to have me back.  And about a month later I quit, because I was doing eight to five and then go home and paint.  And then I decided, no, this is not happening.
Story_ID: 120517
Speaker 1: So were you selling paintings by this point?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was just painting.
Speaker 1: Had your paintings changed any at this point?
Speaker 2: They were, yeah, they were beginning to change.
Speaker 1: All right, so you were--
Speaker 2: So, I started working with the African motifs.
Speaker 1: This is 1971, or something?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, this is '68 [1968], '69 [1969].  So, since I had left Allen Press, I had to make ends meet somehow.  So, I became a messenger at a liquor store down in the Village at Broadway and 8th Street.  And one of the guys--they had more than one person that was making these deliveries.  So, one of the guys had a brother that was a member of the Weusi.  His name was Rene Pyatt.  His brother that belonged to the Weusi was Ronald Pyatt.  So, he introduced--I told him what I was doing.  He was also an artist, too.  So, he said, "Well, come on, I'll take you uptown so you can meet the Weusi."  So, I went up there and he took me by the building.  They had, they rented two floors in this brownstone on 132nd Street, they were co-ops.  And you know, they had all these beautiful, black images.  And I said, wow, this is...  But since that didn't really happen in Philadelphia with the Lee Cultural Center for the visual arts, you know, this was like, this was where I wanted to be.  This is what I, this is like heaven in a sense, you know, meeting the Weusi.  So--
Speaker 1: So did you get a, did they have a place for you to actually--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, they had their own gallery.  They rented a space for the gallery.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's the difference between AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] and Weusi.  Well, most of, the majority of, all the AfriCOBRA members have an art education background.  The Weusi, they were all self-taught for the most part.  I think the only person that has a degree would be Milton Martin [Muhammad Mutufau].  But I don't think that's in art, I think it's in education.
Story_ID: 120518
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of how it got started, I mean how the Weusi got started?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know the history of it?
Speaker 2: There was a group, it was like over a couple hundred of them in New York [City], black artists, and then they split up.  I think they were originally called the, one of their names was "20th Century Creatives."  And then they split up, and then about eight or nine of them started the Weusi.  And they rented this space and they started showing. And then part of the group, they started another section in Brooklyn [New York].  One of the artist's name was Ted Jemola [ph.].  And what they started became the precursor for the East Community Center.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, this is in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: So, you're saying the group that preceded Weusi--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --is the group that started the East--
Speaker 2: Well, no, these are the guys that went out there, and then the East started--
Speaker 1: Well, they started in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  They left the group in Manhattan [New York], in Harlem, and they went out to start their own gallery in Brooklyn.  And that became the East Community Center [The East Educational and Cultural Center for People of African Descent], but that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think the East, well, I first heard of it around '70 [1970], '71 [1971], because he used to do a lot of concerts out there.  And that's how, that's how I happened to go out there.
Story_ID: 120519
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said there was a brother named Ted Jemola [ph.], he was one of--
Speaker 2: Ted Jemola.
Speaker 1: Ted Jemowa?
Speaker 2: Ted Jemola.
Speaker 1: Jemola, okay.  J-E-M-O-L-A?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ted Jemola.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then there was another gallery in Harlem [New York] called "The Black Man's Gallery" that was run by James Snead and Tony Norton, who later took on an African name, I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, so you've got like--you know, the East [The East Educational and Cultural Center for People of African Descent] becomes like a whole lot of things.
Speaker 2: It was a school, too.
Speaker 1: An independent school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Publishing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Black news?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And doing visual art and--
Speaker 2: Well, most of the time that I was out there was for the music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because they had a club, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well--
Speaker 1: Or a space?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a space where they played.  Yeah--
Speaker 1: It wasn't a club, but you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You'd leave there at three o'clock in the morning and your ears would be ringing all the way to six o'clock the next morning.
Speaker 1: I know I've got a copy of "Pharoah Sanders Live at the East."
Speaker 2: No, that's not true.
Speaker 1: He wasn't there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It wasn't recorded there?
Speaker 2: That was in a recording studio, I was there.  And I remember that day, because that was the day they found out that Donny Hathaway [January 13, 1979] had committed suicide, on that recording day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they recorded it in a studio, but they said it was live at the East?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They brought people from the East Community Center and had them in the studio.
Speaker 1: My bubble is burst now.  But, you know, it's still great music.
Speaker 2: It is, it is, yeah.
Story_ID: 120520
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Well, so this is, so, now did you know anybody in The Last Poets in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the original Last Poets, Alan Nelson...
Speaker 1: David Nelson?
Speaker 2: David Nelson, right; Alan Nelson is a drummer in Philadelphia.  The Puerto Rican, Felipe [Luciano], I knew him.  And the other guy, I can't think of his name, he was an actor, too.
Speaker 1: Was it Kain?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gylan Kain.
Speaker 1: Gylan Kain.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gylan Kain, yeah, I knew those guys.  So, they used to come by the gallery.  Leon Thomas used to come by the gallery.  He was real close to a couple of the members.  One of the members, Taiwo DuVall, he's on the first drum with "The Passion," he was the percussionist; he played with Olatunji.  Bakara used to come by there, because his...  On the corner, originally, was the New Lafayette Theater, and that burned down.  And across the street, [HM Amiri] Baraka's sister, Kimako [Baraka], opened up a coffee shop there, and occasionally she'd have musicians coming in.  I remember seeing Gary Bartz and his group in there.
Speaker 1: So, this is big culture you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a lot--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all these names--
Speaker 2: And then there was, I think the Baby Grand was there on the corner of 132nd Street and Lenox; I've seen Eddie Harris play in there.  Up the street on 7th Avenue was [Count] Basie's club, he had a club.  I remember seeing--hearing Miles [Davis]--seeing Miles come in there and play.  And then there was, of course, Big Wilt's Small Paradise, and I remember the Ohio Players being in there.  (Laughter).  So, yeah, and then down the street is the Apollo [Theater] on 125th Street.
Speaker 1: So, things are jumping--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in this atmosphere.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 120521
Speaker 1: Now, are--and your artwork had already taken like this direction of doing--
Speaker 2: It was the beginning, it was beginning to get there.  We were, I had exhibited--and a couple-Weusi [Artists Collective] used to do these annual outdoor exhibitions on St. Nicholas Avenue [in New York City] every year.  And it was a big crowd drawer, you know, people came from all over the boroughs just to see.  Actually, that's where I first met [HM] A.B. Spellman, was there.
Speaker 1: Did you know that he was the son of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the A.B. Spellman [Sr.] that taught you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I used to see him down in the Village in Nedick's all the time, but I never spoke to him, you know, I didn't get the nerve up to speak to him.  But being--I guess being a visual artist now--he and his wife walks by and I introduced myself, and so we started talking.  And that's how we got to know each other.  Actually, that first outdoor exhibit that I exhibited in, that's where I sold my first painting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was it of, do you remember?
Speaker 2: It was a figurative, sort of like a silhouette painting of Lady Day [Billie Holiday].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about--now in '72 [1972], you painted this picture, this--if I'm going too fast, slow me down.  But in '72 [1972], you painted this piece called "The Dealer."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were you trying to do with "The Dealer?"
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, well, you got to bring me back to that if you want to--okay, "The Dealer"... like, what Driskell [The David C. Driskell Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] has is just a study.  It was a bigger painting.  And what I was speaking to was, I think it was, yeah, it was like '72 [1972] that I noticed there was a drastic change going on in the community.
Story_ID: 120522
Speaker 1: All of a sudden, I noticed that all of these cultural institutions were slowly disappearing, and the [African American] community was being infiltrated with drugs.  You'd see more guys standing outside on the corner in the winter by these barrels of fire.  And it was all this drug activity.  In the meantime, a couple of blocks away, you see the police up the street taking pictures of everybody.  I guess this is during the heyday of Frank Lucas, and I can't think of the other guy [Leslie Ike Atkinson].
Speaker 2: Right, the guy glorified in "American Gangster," the movie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  That was in their heyday.
Speaker 2: Now, this was--
Speaker 1: And this is like, yeah, '72 [1972].  And the New Lafayette, they had been thriving, because they had moved in the--I think on 132nd Street, I think the Audubon Theater.  No, not 100--I'm sorry, 158th Street.  They got funding, they got some funding from Ford.  And then some of their people left and went to Hollywood, like Whitman Mayo.  He was one of the later ones, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was on--
Speaker 1: I can't think of this other guy.
Speaker 2: --Sanford and Son, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And of course, Stan Lathan was connected with him, because his brother was one of the actors, Bill Lathan.  There was another actor [Roscoe Orman] that left, and he was featured on several episodes of "Kojak," and later on he went on to play Gordon on Sesame Street.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I can't think of his name right now.  So, all of a sudden, you know, all of these cultural things are really going down, and there's this big thing about the drugs.  So, the painting was speaking to that.  And the images were kind of stylized and inspired by African rock cliffs.
Speaker 2: Okay.  These are the cliffs that are off the, near the Sahara?
Speaker 1: Well, they're all over.  They're in North Africa, too.  In fact, some of them are in Morocco, and places like that.  And they attacked the foliage that existed before the desert was there.  And they have images of giraffes and elephants.  And, you know, of course, in our times, you know, they don't exist up there, because it's all desert now.  So, that's what that painting is about, dealing with that forest atmosphere, and just to change the whole vibe of the whole community.
Speaker 2: So this, in the visual art form, is I guess similar to what the Last Poets were doing in their poetry.  They were talking about the demise of the neighborhood in Harlem [New York] because of the drugs.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Right after the Vietnam War--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as the Vietnam War was tailing off--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess as we know now from the information released about Frank Lucas, he was bringing drugs directly from Cambodia.
Speaker 1: From Vietnam, yeah.
Speaker 2: Not just him, but--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 120523
Speaker 1: --that's where it was coming from.  So, New Lafayette [Theatre] burned down, you said?
Speaker 2: The original New Lafayette--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was on 132nd Street, on the corner of 132nd and 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  People were starting to revive the memory of Malcolm X in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, Michelle's Bookstore was still there.  That was still a drawing place, on 125th Street on the corner near Lexington [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Now that was a huge bookstore, with pictures of all the African presidents in front.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because those, they were originally Garvey-ites, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, yeah, they moved that to build the Adam Clayton Powell office building and parking lot.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I haven't been up there in so long.
Speaker 1: So, all this is going on in the mid-'70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh--
Story_ID: 120524
Speaker 1: And your artwork is--now, so, you're developing your style now I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  My real, probably real breakthrough was in '68 [1968], '69 [1969].  I did a painting called "Gigi" which I don't have anymore.  It's a casualty of the divorce.  (Laughter).  But that was my first breakthrough.  And you know, I was researching African artwork, and I hadn't got to Aaron Douglas yet.  But I was listening to the music; I was listening to a lot of music, African music, from the UNESCO and Folkway series.  And then I would go down to the museum, the Natural Museum.  And I would go to the African Pavilion and study all the artifacts they had in there, and go to various galleries that were dealing in African art.  And I'd go in there and browse and look at things.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you think that was important?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Why did you think that was important?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't do that.  That's why I'm asking.
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to--I was, well, I was seeing the motifs that they would use in the work.  And I was seeing them as rhythmic, and I was seeing them as music.  And also, it activated the forms, because it had magical powers.  You know, like the foot sample and zig zag line, that's the life force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: So, did you like track down what culture that comes from, or did you keep track of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because they were all, they were all labeled at the museum.  But as far as doing a more involved investigation, I didn't really do that until I got here [Howard University in Washington D.C.], because they had the Museum of African Art--not this museum--but they had the old one over on the hill behind the train station.  But that was a lot too, but we'll get to that later, I guess.
Speaker 1: Well, we're getting towards it right now I think.  So--
Speaker 2: So, anyway I was going--this is how I was compiling my research.  And I'd become accepted as a member of Weusi [Artists Collective] by then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because of the way the work was changing. Also, I was influenced by Adam Molo Lubay Foler [ph.], he was one of the members in the group.  And he was painting more or less in what they call the "hard edge" style, just flat paint.  And how I started getting interested with the sharpness of my lines was through the opaquing, what I learned from an opaquer.  But that really came later, too, because I really--when I did paintings like this, I wasn't really concerned about the lines being straight.  I just had this feeling that I wanted to get out.  So, around that time, that's when I started to find out--well, I found a book, "Contemporary Art of Africa" by Ulli Beier, and in the book was Skunder [Alexander Boghossian] and then about a year later, I met him.  So, that was like, wow.
Speaker 1: This is Skunder, the Ethiopian?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Skunder Boghossian.  So, then I started hearing and reading about other African art through "African Arts Magazine," artists like Twin Seven-Seven.  Well, he was in, he's also in "Contemporary Art of Africa."  And then there was Papa [Ibra] Tall, and through "African Arts Magazine," I saw more a more in-depth look at his work because of the work he was doing with his tapestries.  Because in "Contemporary African Art," they only had like one drawing of his work, and that was in black and white.  But when I saw the color, and the way he was using the motifs in the work, that really affected the way I was seeing things.  So then Weusi did this show, "Resurrection," that was at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York].  And we decided that we wanted different colors on different walls.  So, I volunteered to help paint the walls, because Spriggs, Ed Spriggs, he was the director at the time.  He said, "Yeah, you can do it, but you're going to have to do it yourself."  So, I volunteered to paint the walls.  And he must have been impressed with that.  He probably also wanted to get the Weusi involved with the Studio Museum [in Harlem].  So, he asked me to be one of the artists-in-residence.  So, that's how I became one of the artists-in-residence.
Story_ID: 120525
Speaker 1: Now, who is, give us a little background on the Studio Museum [in Harlem, New York].
Speaker 2: The Studio Museum is a pilot, originally of the Museum of Modern Art.  And according to [Ed] Spriggs, he gave me the lowdown.  Originally, the plan was--it had, it was in the space next to the building where the [HM] Barbara Ann Teer Theater--that's another Chicago [Illinois] person--and Olatunji had his cultural center [Olatunji Center for African Culture in Harlem].  It was like, actually, it was kind of like in the middle of the block.  And there was a liquor store below that was owned by Willis Reed, and his brother ran it.  And so upstairs was this big huge room, and then there was a small room.  Supposedly, William T. Williams was supposed to be the artist-in-residence.  That's where they got the name, Studio Museum.  So, he was going to have this big space as his studio, and then the East, the small space was going to be exhibit space for art exhibits.  Spriggs came in and he changed all of that around.  He decided it was going to be a west wing with a big space, and an east wing.  And they had a space upstairs, and he rented that out to be the space for the artists-in-residence.  So we were upstairs, the artists-in-residence was upstairs on the second floor, along with the education department for the Studio Museum.  So, but, before that, one of the reasons why there was bad--the way I found out that there was bad blood between Weusi and the Studio Museum, is according to a couple of the members, before I joined the group, somebody from the Museum of Modern Art [MoMA] came to them and tried to buy them out, and they promptly threw them out.  So, there was this bad blood about the Studio Museum and Weusi [Artists Collective].  So, a lot of that happened back then, you know.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 120526
Speaker 1: So you're in, you got kind of caught in the middle, you know, being a artist-in-residence and the Studio Museum [in Harlem] and being a member of Weusi [Artists] Collective, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But it didn't--well, they were--the Weusi members, they were happy I was there, you know, because it added more prestige to the Weusi Gallery.  So, they didn't have a problem with it, you know.  So, it was Valerie Maynard and LeRoy Clarke.  They were the two artists-in-residence, but they were paid.  And then there was sort of like a handyman, and his son was a sculptor.  He was a sculptor too, but he was working in the capacity as a handyman around the museum.  And his son's name was Justin George.  And then they gave me a space, no salary, I just had space.  And then they gave this other artist from Brooklyn named Stephanie Weaver--her husband was a filmmaker named Lloyd Weaver--she was the other artist-in-residence.
Speaker 1: So, there were like four artists, you know, in the--
Speaker 2: Right.  Valerie was in the printing workshop up there at the time.  And as well, as she did her sculptor there also--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the Studio Museum.  I'm not sure exactly what LeRoy's job was, but he was there as an artist-in-residence.
Speaker 1: LeRoy Clarke?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was from Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so this is 1975?  Seventy-Four '74 [1974], '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  This is '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-Two [1972], okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-One [1971], '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because the Weusi show opened up the end of '70 [1970] and went to '71 [1971].  And somewhere in there, I don't know if it's--I'm not sure if it was before or after Weusi that AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] had its show.  And that's where I--you know, I actually think maybe--because see, Weusi did--no, AfriCOBRA did two shows at the Studio Museum.  So, I'm kind of like getting those dates a little mixed up.  But that's where I met Wadsworth [Jarrell] and [HM] Napoleon [Jones-Henderson].  And I think near the end of the show, [HM] Jeff [Donaldson] came up for a visit and that's when I met him.  So, I'm, let's see, I'm kind of thinking it was, it was after--the Weusi show was before AfriCOBRA, I'm not sure, because [Ed] Spriggs introduced me to Jeff as being a part of Weusi.  Because Jeff had met, he had met Ademola and maybe somebody else from Weusi at CONFABRA [in 1970].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you become a member of AfriCOBRA.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's later.
Speaker 1: Oh, much later.  Not in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, in '73 [1973]--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I'm talking about--I haven't gotten to '73 [1973] yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Story_ID: 120527
Speaker 1: So, so, I was looking at--well, I met Wadsworth [Jarrell].  He was in the gallery the night before the show was supposed to open, finishing up a painting.  (Laughter).  So, I got to hang out with [HM] Napoleon [Jones-Henderson], we spent a day together.  I was trying to get him up to the Bronx where I was living, to see the work that I was doing, which was the work that was inspired by the African rhythms.  One of the things I decided, I did this piece called "Mystic."  That was like one of the major features that was in the Weusi [Artists Collective] show where I had a figure, and I was using the African motif draped around the figure, and then had the African motif in the background.  And I wanted, that's another reason why I think the AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] show was before the Weusi show.  Because where I had seen that was the way Watts was using the B motif in his figures and in the background.  And that's when I started merging the foreground with background or figure-ground, merging that figure-ground relationship, so that it would look at first like just one motif, or one pattern, or one tapestry-like feeling.  And then maybe some people see it right away, and some people don't see it all.  And some people, the images have to be pointed out to them.  But they're there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you're trying to create depth in your work?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not concerned about depth, at least not in terms of perspective--one or two point perspective.  I'm more interested in I guess creating a contrast, mainly with the color.  Because, you know, everything is flat, and the negative space, I want that to be a statement to itself.  In some cases I look at the negative space as being more important than the figure, you know, in terms of figure-ground relationship.  So, there's this, I guess you would call it a fight, between the two.
Story_ID: 120528
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so, well, tell us about what happened in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, before that--well, this painting behind me, this is called "Cosmic Connection."  I had a guy who was a student of mine.  He came to me and said he wanted to study with me.  And I kind of looked up at him, and I said, "Well, man, I'm just now starting to develop what I'm doing, you know.  Are you sure you don't want to go study with somebody else?"  So, he said no, he wanted to study with me.  So I said, "All right, you can come and use, you can use part of my space at the Studio Museum [in Harlem]," because I was just starting there as an artist-in-residence.  So, he came along.  But he introduced me to these guys, they were promoters, and they were putting on this John Coltrane Award concert at Town Hall [Manhattan, New York].  And they wanted me to do an exhibit.  So, with my experience of visual art playing like a backdrop to the music, I told him, no, I wasn't interested in doing that, but I would be interested in painting a backdrop for the concert.  So, that's how this came about.  And then there's some question about some event that happened at the same time that you asked me about in the questionnaire, on the back page of those questions.
Speaker 1: I don't know if we're talking about the same questionnaire, but--oh, just a statement here that we have, saying that your painting--"Painting is an endless search for discovery."
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: That's not it?
Speaker 2: Well, anyway, well, I'll get back to it--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --if it ever comes up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, so I did the painting.  The bill--the musicians on the bill were Alice Coltrane, Archie Shepp, McCoy Tyner--they all had their own groups--and Pharoah Sanders.  And Alice had just put out the strings album, "Journey in Satchidananda."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, not that one, no.  Something about consciousness, "Universal Consciousness."  And then the one, "For Love Supreme" with Swami [Satchidananda] on it.  So, she had an orchestra, a full string orchestra, plus her group.  So, the performance was a sell-out.  And we were supposed to get paid the next day.  So, we go up there and we find out there ain't no money, because Alice Coltrane demanded to get paid up front, and she took all the money.  So, the musicians are mad.  I mean, it was so bad that Elvin was going to take one of the guys out on Broadway and 47th Street and shoot him.  But his wife, his Japanese wife stopped him.  So, finally we figured out we're not getting any money.  So we packed up the paintings, the musicians packed up their instruments, and they left.  And so, getting back to the Studio Museum, there's this real dismal mood.  You know, everybody's all down and out.  I said, "Damn, did they hear about the concert?"  So, it turns out this is the same day that Attica [prison riot at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York] happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where the album that Archie did ["Attica Blues"], "Money Blues, Attica Money Blues," is from those two incidents.  That's where that comes from.
Speaker 1: Money and the Attica, this is the Attica prison in New York?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The prisoners took over--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the prison--
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: --for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then they got slaughtered, lost their lives, some innocent people, too.  So, that's where "Attica Blues" comes from, that Archie Shepp album.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.
Speaker 2: So, yeah--
Speaker 1: Who promoted this, who owed you the money?  Who are these--?
Speaker 2: The promoters.  I don't even remember their names anymore.
Speaker 1: I thought I'd ask, because I thought-
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The names, they weren't, they were just starting out.  But that was probably their first and last concert, after that.
Story_ID: 120529
Speaker 1: So, I think I went to an NNCA [National Commission for Culture and the Arts] conference, and I met--I hadn't met Nelson [Stevens].  And we had started talking about doing a show together.  And we ran into [HM] David Driskell, he was at Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee].  So, he said, "Sure, you can do a show down there."  So, that show that I did at Fisk, I did--Charles Searles, he created a show with me and Ellsworth Ausby.  There were two one-man shows at the Pill House in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that's connected with the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  And then I did a show here in '72 [1972].  Jeff [Donaldson] brought me in to do a one-person show.  And then I did the show at Fisk with Nelson [Stevens].  And in the meantime I was coming back and forth from New York [City], down here.  You know, I'd get in one of those moods where I needed a break.  So, I'd go to [Washington] D.C. or either I'd go up to Boston [Massachusetts], or I'd go to Philadelphia and hang out with Charles Searles.  Or I'd go to Boston and hang out with David Chandler.  I'd come down here and I'd hang out with Skunder [Alexander Boghossian], and Wadsworth [Jarrell], and Jeff, and Frank.  So, I started developing this friendship with the AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] members, and so that's how it came about I was interested in joining, and they were interested in me joining the group.  So, that's how that came about.
Story_ID: 120530
Speaker 1: Okay.  Give us a little bit of history on AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists].  Now, what is it exactly?
Speaker 2: AfriCOBRA was formed around, I think maybe Weusi [Artists Collective] may be a year older than them.  I think AfriCOBRA was formed in '68 [1968], and Weusi was formed in '67 [1967], something like that, if I'm not mistaken.  But it's a collective of artists that were very much involved in quote, quote "propaganda art for the struggle."  And their approach was they had themes that they worked from.  And they would pick an issue that they wanted to deal with, that of course dealt with the struggle.  And each member in the group was to come up with an aesthetic statement dealing with the theme.  Weusi was different, like, first of all we had some Muslims in there; we had some people that were very much involved in African religion.  So, our image wasn't as necessarily as overt politically as AfriCOBRA.  They also, AfriCOBRA had a manifesto.  So, one of the things they did in the manifesto that we still use today, is they redefined the principle of art in terms of how it relates to the struggle, and how it relates to Pan-Africanism, and later, TransAfricanism.  So, they, AfriCOBRA took it another step further, where they decided they wanted to make their more work accessible to the community.  So they did, each artist was responsible for creating a set of prints that could be distributed economically for anybody in the black community who wanted a piece of artwork.  So, that's how that comes about.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now you became an artist-in-residence at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, [HM] Jeff [Donaldson], when he became Chair, he brought in Wadsworth [Jarrell] to teach photography.  He brought Frank Smith, who later became a member, because at that point he wasn't a member.  But Jeff knew he was quite capable to teach art education, and they didn't have anybody.  And then Gerald Williams came in as a grad student.  Frank and Wadsworth, while they were here, they were working on their master's.  So, they were in the grad program, too.  So, we found out Skunder [Alexander Boghossian] was being promoted to a lecturer, and they needed an artist-in-residence, so I applied.  And of course, this coincides at the same time I'm trying to join the group.  So, that's how that happened; I became an artist-in-residence and then I joined the group.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you, so how long were you here that initial time?  Was that appointment for a year, or two, or what?
Speaker 2: Um, it was a three year appointment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was year to year.  But I was, I was, I was there for three years.  I think my second year was like Jeff's last year.  No, the end of the third year was Jeff's last year as Chair.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So, he was working on, he was working on Festac [77 in Lagos, Nigeria] during that whole period, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: That's the one in Nigeria.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '77 [1977].  I forgot I had those on. [Taking off glasses].  Yeah--
Speaker 1: So, now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, originally, it was someone else that was the Chair.  And I think they got ill and they resigned, and that's how Jeff became the Chair.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, were you--now, what was your work like now?  How it is changing?
Speaker 2: Well, it was evolving; it hadn't evolved to this at that time.  And I think that's one of the reasons why--I mean in hindsight when I look at it, I think that's one of the things that Weusi--not Weusi-AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] was attracted to, about what I was doing.  Because Jeff was also a member of the Organization for African Unity, and he was interested in what African artists were doing.  And he wanted to keep AfriCOBRA up and running with the same force that they were generating from their work.  And so, I was doing that.  So, that's one of the reasons why maybe he was interested in having Skunder come to Howard.  So, it probably--I think he was interested in Ben Jones at one point, but I don't think that worked out.  It was another artist named Jim McCoy he was interested in, and that didn't work out.  But seemed like I worked out, so I joined the group, and then there was a shift in the works, the look of the work.  And it probably had--I mean it's changing now, with people bringing in people like Michael Harris and Kevin Cole, and this new brother from Africa that teaches at Texas University.  I can't think of his last name; I can't think of his name right now, who works in various mediums.  I mean he does some fantastic things with bottle--no, tin cans, soda bottle cans.  But at one time there was very lucrative work, at least by four of the major members, who was seeing things the way I was seeing them.  So, but that became--after I left [Washington] D.C., it was being taught that that was the AfriCOBRA style.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  There is a similarity in the work--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of I guess--
Speaker 2: So, I mean when I came back, people were saying, "Oh, you paint..."  I got a job down at another school, and they said, "Oh, yeah, you paint in that AfriCOBRA style."  I said, "AfriCOBRA style?  What are you talking about?  I was doing this before."
Speaker 1: You were doing it before AfriCOBRA.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So anyway--
Story_ID: 119320
Speaker 1: So the group [AfriCOBRA] was moving away from just the struggle in regards to the black community in the continental United States, and became more interested in the struggle in the whole diaspora.  And that's where [HM] Jeff [Donaldson] came up with the idea that the word "Pan-Africanism" wasn't working, because it only spoke to English-speaking people. And French-speaking artists, they related to negritude.  So, what he came up with was the term "TransAfrican" which means wherever you live or wherever you go, whether it's Canada or even Europe, the African element will come; if you're black, the African element will come out in the work.
Speaker 2: So, did Jeff Donaldson coin that term, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, he wrote an essay on it for the university magazine, and there are copies of it around in the office.  But that was his term.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, this is--
Speaker 1: See, Jeff, he was, he was the architect that really changed Howard [University in Washington, D.C.].  He was significant in helping bring in Donald Byrd, the development of the--more emphasis on jazz at the university, because it wasn't like that before.  And of course, he brought in us, which changed the look of the art department.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean there were people--every time we do a faculty show, Paul Richard [art critic at the Washington Post] would come up and write about the new black art school at Howard.
Speaker 2: Right.  It certainly--I mean just reflecting back on it, the school at Howard had a sense of a style like what they would say of a painting school in Europe that they have, in a sense that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, there was a motif that everybody was--
Speaker 1: Maybe three or four years ago, they had an alumni show.  I think it was eight decades of Howard students.  And you could look and you could see the influence in the work of the artists that were selected.  Now, they didn't have everybody in there, but the curators that selected--they picked, I guess, the work that was more, I guess AfriCOBRA-ish-influenced than the other work.
Story_ID: 119321
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you mentioned Donald Byrd.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Donald Byrd actually trained--you know, the musicians he trained here, you know--
Speaker 2: The Blackbyrds, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, the group.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They had a hit record.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that tradition still exists, because now they have a group called Afro Blue.  And I think they were on one of those shows like American Idol or something like that, yeah.  I don't watch that stuff; my wife watches it.  But--
Speaker 1: Now in 1973, are you married by this time?
Speaker 2: In seventy--no, I first got married in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: That was a short-lived marriage.
Speaker 1: Oh, the first one, okay, the first one.
Speaker 2: And the second time I got married was in 1983, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we're going to wait to get to that.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not--okay--
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that later.
Speaker 2: It's not necessarily something to be talking about.  But go ahead.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's another one, huh?  All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 119322
Speaker 1: So, [HM] Haki Madhubuti was a visiting artist [at Howard University in Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He did poetry in those days, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --did a lot of--
Speaker 2: I didn't really get to know him that well.  He lived in the building next to me.  He lived in the building called Harvard Hall, and I lived in the building called Park Ellison.  And I knew John, what's his name, the poet from New York that was there at the same time?  O. Killens, John O. Killens [John Oliver Killens].
Speaker 1: John O. Killens, right, he's a much older man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: A novelist.
Speaker 2: I kind of saw--I think he used to come by the Weusi Gallery, you know, so he was aware of who I was.  I wasn't aware so much of who he was.
Speaker 1: All right.  Toni Morrison was on the campus, too, right, at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They had the radio station in a trailer behind the football field.
Speaker 1: That's WHUR?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they put on, they used to put on a lot of jazz concerts in Cramton [Hall].  They had Norman Connors there one time.  They had Jon Lucien one time.  And when I first got here, they had Sonny Rollins.  And then down the street, there was the Ed Murphy Supper Club, and he used to bring in people like Sun Ra.  He brought in Norman [Connors], he brought in Freddie Cole, and numerous other acts.  He originally built what used to be--what's now the Howard Bookstore that was at that Howard Hotel [Howard Inn].  He built that, and then I think he sold it to Howard.
Speaker 1: And his name again?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: His name again?
Speaker 2: Ed Murphy.
Speaker 1: Ed Murphy, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ed Murphy, all right.  So, this--
Speaker 2: You know where that, you know where the bookstore is, right?  And right across was the parking lot, that's where his supper club was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He brought in Arthur Prysock a couple of times.
Speaker 1: So, the bases were covered around here, sounds like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of culture, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean of course there's Blues Alley and a couple of other places.  Charlie Byrd had a club in Silver Spring [Maryland].  He brought in--I've gone to see McCoy Tyner and Sun Ra there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then there was a place--it's a coffee shop now. And on 7th Street, 7th and H [Street] maybe, it was called--they used to do concerts there, and they used to bring people in like Don Cherry, David Murray, Henry Bluitt.  It was run--D.C. Space, that was the name of it.  It was run by this visual artist and some of his friends.  And they kept--I think it was running up until maybe the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And it just kind of died out, like everything else.
Speaker 1: You know, it's a close association with music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 119323
Speaker 1: Did you ever do any album covers?  Did anybody ever ask you to do a cover?
Speaker 2: Norman [Connors] asked me to do one once.  And the record company opted to use a photograph of him, since it was his first album.  But he did use the title of the painting, it's called "The Dance of Magic."  That was like his first album.  That has Gary Bartz on it, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So none of the--you never got a cover?
Speaker 2: I talked to Lenny--Lenny White talked to me once about it.  But I didn't want my work to be album cover art.  So, I didn't really pursue it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, why not?  I mean, those are the days that you could get a big--albums were big, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And everybody would see it.  Some artists like, well, Mati Abdul Klarwein and other people got, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but still, but when people think about their artwork, they think about Miles Davis's album cover.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, very few people know who Mati Abdul Klarwein [Abdul Mati Klarwein] is.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Look at the work, all that beautiful work that was done by, whoever did the album for Earth, Wind, and Fire with all that Egyptian mythology in it [Abdul Mati Klarwein].  You know, but, you know, that's an album cover for Earth Wind and Fire.  It's not--this artist--it's not out in any major museum or--
Speaker 1: I think that's Klarwein, too, I think.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: "The Last Days and Times?"
Speaker 2: I really don't think that's his, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's somebody else.  I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not his style.
Story_ID: 119324
Speaker 1: So, you were at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] until '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977] was the festival, but you didn't go, right, to Festac?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't make that, no.  Yeah, that was early '77 [1977].  So, by the end of May, that was the last semester.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after 1977?
Speaker 2: Well, they brought in a new Chair.  She said if there was any money for--they promoted me to lecturer.  But she told me there was no money for a lecturer.  So they said I could work, get a part-time position.  And I didn't really understand; I didn't even know if a part-time position was like it is now.  So, I told them no.  And so, from '77 [1977], '78 [1978] to '79 [1979], I worked for CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], the CETA Arts Program.  It was [President Jimmy] Carter's thing, and they had an arts component.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I started out as an artist-in-residence for this organization that was on 14th Street called the Afro-American Datanamics.  And I was--the main office for the CETA office was down in Chinatown.  And so then I was assigned to the Duke Ellington School for the Arts [Washington, D.C.], and some gallery out in the southeast called Sign of the Times Gallery, somewhat out near Minnesota Avenue.  That didn't really work out, because they didn't have the materials.  So, I ended up working at the main office, and they got me to do a mural for the Vital Statistics Office, which was down on Pennsylvania Avenue around 6th Street at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did you, what was your subject matter for the mural?
Speaker 2: I was just working from a motif.  I just gave them a design from a motif that was based on the grid, because I started working that way.  I started looking at African-American quilts and traditional African textile design, and started working with the grid.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you were there for a year in the CETA position?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119325
Speaker 1: And during the time that I was an artist-in-residence, I had a one-man show.  Of course, it was written up in The Washington Post by Paul Richards, who says, "A new artist-in-residence."  And then one of the things that Jeff wanted me to do as an artist-in-resident was to design a mural to go in Cramton Auditorium.  And supposedly during the student takeover, one of the things they asked for was more murals around the campus.  And supposedly the murals were supposed to be changed every four years.  Now, they were painted on Masonite, and installed on the wall by a contractor.  They had brought, you know, Eugene [Edaw] Wade.  I think he came here as a, I believe he was a grad student.  And he did the first mural.  And this mural, his mural work was very figurative.  And so, he had all the important people in the struggle of black people--Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], Malcolm X.  Of course, Martin Luther King and Malcolm, they were pointing in two different directions.  And some other prominent--maybe Frederick Douglass was in the mural, I'm not sure.  But I do remember those people.  So, that stayed up for four years.  Then I came in as an artist-in-residence, and so Jeff asked me to design this mural.  And I designed it, and I painted it with my class.  And so we did most of it--we started it in the spring semester, at the end of the spring semester, and finished it up over the summer.  So, when the new student body came back, it was a different mural on campus.  You know, it was a mural like the work of--with all of these African motifs, and you couldn't see any figures in it.  So, I got lumped into a power struggle, because the students were protesting some professor that they found out was from South Africa.  And then South Africa was a real no-no then.  I mean, you can't drink no Mateus [rose wine], because it comes from Portugal, which supports South Africa.  (Laughter).  So, I got thrown in with that football.  The students didn't like the new mural.  A certain poet from New York [City] wrote an article for the student paper about how Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] is changing its direction and settling for a quasi-abstract African image instead of a people-oriented image--a former alumni.  So, I was catching a lot of flak, but [HM] Jeff [Donaldson], he shielded me.  He did a good job of keeping those people off my back.  So, what I found out, everywhere I'd go I had to start all over again, because of the nature of my work.  When I went to California, I had the, ran into the same problem.  I had to start, almost like starting from the beginning and start all over, to establish myself. So, we got past that incident.  And one of the things that the professor, who was teaching contemporary African art and traditional African art, he brought in an exhibit of contemporary artists, which was, this was after Festac [77 in Lagos, Nigeria], in fact.  So, that was pretty--that was pretty profound.  And that also made it more easy, because people could see--in terms of how the work was working with the struggle in terms of the diaspora.
Story_ID: 119326
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is, this puts us to about 1980, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is when you were granted a National Endowment of the Arts [NEA Artists] Exchange Fellowship?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, that came about--well, that time [HM] A.B. [Spellman] was working at the Endowment.  And we, since he moved here, you know, we had been talking.  He bought several pieces of my work during his tenure at the National Endowment.  And there had been numbers of times I'd had my work in his office.  So, he came to me one day and says, he asked me if I was interested in going to England.  I said "Not particularly."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "Because they have this exchange program, and through expansion art, you can apply and you can go and live and work abroad.  Then he said, "Also..."  And I said, "Well, I'm not really interested to going to England at all, for a number of reasons."  So, he said, "Well, we also have some in Japan."  I said, "Well, that sounds appealing."  So, I went to the Library of Congress and did some research on Japanese art, and I found this artist that was doing several things; he had zig-zag lines in his work.  And so I wrote up a proposal that I wanted to go and do independent research and study with this particular artist.  And his name was Yosaka Maita [ph.].  It turns out--but I don't make the connection when we meet, until I come back.  Now, he and Skunder [Alexander Boghossian] were in Paris [France] at the same time; they knew each other in Paris.
Speaker 1: So that's, that almost sounds more than coincidental.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But when he was talking about Skunder, he was talking about he dressed flamboyantly, and had drove these expensive sports cars.  And I said, "Well, you must be talking about Papa [Ibra] Tall," because he was in Paris around the same time.  And it wasn't until I got back and I was showing Skunder my sensei's photograph and his work, he said, "Oh, that's my man from Paris."  I said, "Oh, man, I could have called him and had you guys hooked up."  So, yeah.  So, I applied for the fellowship, and went over and ended up staying seventeen months.  It was a good experience.  I mean it turns out that my sensei--it's a Japanese word for teacher--he was a mandala painter.  And I had become aware of mandalas before I left New York [City].  But it didn't really appeal to me, because it was working on a square, and it was working with a sphere, a circle.  And it wasn't really working the way that I was moving things in my work.  My work had things moving in sort of, like, arcs and curvilinear movement with the African motifs.  So, I just sort of put it aside.  But after doing some research and looking at traditional mandalas, particularly the ones from Tibet, I became more interested in it, because they used symbols.  And I decided I could make a statement by using symbols.  If I wanted to make, say, a militant statement, I didn't necessarily have to have guns and bandoliers.  You know, I could use certain symbols in certain combinations.  Or I could use an alphabet, rather than English, where it could be read right away, or it could never be read at all.  But I could still make a statement by incorporating these symbols.  So, that's how I got involved with the mandala.
Story_ID: 120531
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us what a mandala--I mean, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Mandala, it's M-A-N-D-A-L-A.  It's similar to the way mandala--Nelson Mandela spells it, only it has two 'a's instead of an 'e' on the end.  And what that--mandala actually is the Oriental name for a cosmogram.  So, it's really a cosmogram, not a mandala; that's just the name of that particular cosmogram.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, this is a round painting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but in a circle.  Most of the time it can go either way.  Usually the square--I think the square represents the universe, and the circle represents the earth.  Or, it might be in reverse.
Speaker 1: So, the circle is in a square?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, a series of circles within a square.  Generally in the more intricate ones, there's a large circle in the center, then you have circles on the cardinal points.  And then it can get more complex, like, then you got them on the cardinal points, like, say southwest, northwest.  So, you end up, you can end up with eight spheres, you know, thinking that way.  But yeah, so I spent a lot of my time, again, going to museums and going to temples.  I made several trips to Kyoto [Japan] and other places.  I ended up doing two one-person shows at both American Centers in Tokyo [Japan] and in Kyoto.  The American Center in Kyoto was a little more enthusiastic about what I was doing.  So, they were able to get me reviews in all three of the national newspapers.  So, that was a pretty big thing.  I mean I would, I couldn't even go down my street without somebody snagging me into a bar wanting to buy me drinks, because they'd read about me.  (Laughter).  And at that point, I was stationed in Tokyo at the International House, but they got me a house out in like Chiba Prefecture.  It's like a highway between the airport and Nyita [ph.] Station, which is about fifty miles.  So, yeah, they wanted, they had a celebrated black artist that lived in their Prefecture to come and have a drink with them.  So, that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you learn from that experience?  I mean did it change you at all?
Speaker 2: In a sense.  [Come on in].  I think, well, you know, I was looking at this new concept.  And I was looking at how I can make artwork that was more meditative and more spiritual.  And for me, in terms of producing the work, it was more spontaneous, because there was--the work there was visualization.  So--
Story_ID: 120532
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, this, we're talking about--but we're talking about what you learned in Japan.
Speaker 1: Oh, I just started to see a different direction for me to take my work.  Because even back in the days when I was in New York [City], I had somewhat of a problem.  Because I didn't really fit--the way I was working, with the work-- even though, you know, it had a strong connection with the African imagery and had a strong connection with the music--I had, I didn't fit in, because the uptown artists felt that it wasn't political enough.  So, they had issues with it.  The downtown artists--because there's two divisions of artists in New York [City], probably in Chicago [Illinois], too.  You got the uptown artists and you got the downtown artists.  And the downtown artists, most of them are in the galleries, and then people in uptown at the time were more political.  They felt that my work was too African and too political.  So I didn't really fit, because they weren't really looking at what I was doing, or they weren't aware of what I was doing.  And the same thing happened when I did the mural at Cramton [Hall at Howard University in Washington, D.C.].  So, I was looking at this new way of presenting my ideas and making my statement, and still maintaining my sense of abstractionism.  And see, one of the things--since I was in this limbo, one of the things that attracted me to AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] was the fact that they were very much into abstraction.  Because they had--one of their principles is mid-point mimesis, which means that it's like a place between realism and abstraction.  So, that was one of the reasons why I gravitated towards them and eventually stopped associating with Weusi [Artists Collective].  Well, one of the reasons was distance, particularly when I got to California, you know, it was too far away.  So, this was a new--I guess you would call it a new search, a new direction for me.
Story_ID: 120533
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you come back to--you go to California as soon as you come back, right?
Speaker 2: Not right away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came back in '81 [1981].  So, it wasn't until '83 [1983] that I went out to California.  And I was invited out to California by Jim Melchert.  Oh, wait a minute, let me go back to--I want to finish the cosmogram thing.  Let me go back to that, it's important.  So, yeah, I was working with this Buddhist iconography, but I was replacing it with African iconography, or imagery.  And while I was there--for some reason the Japanese had this fascination with the pyramids and Egyptian culture.  And, you know, I was seeing a lot of documentaries on the educational channel dealing with pygmies and things like that.  So, when I got back to the [United] States in '81 [1981], one of the shows that was at the East Wing Gallery was a show that was curated by Robert Farris Thompson called "The Four Movements of the Sun."  And basically, that's a cosmogram from the Congo.  It can be diamond-shaped, which mandalas can have a diamond shape; if it's just a square, turn it on the side.  It can be circular, and it has four cardinal points, the points on each side.  Well, in the Congo one represents birth, life, death, and re-birth.  So, it's still, in a sense, that evolutionary cycle that's actually in Buddhist iconography, reincarnation.  So, that's when I realized that mandala was a cosmogram, because they have cosmograms in Haiti.  They got cosmograms that they draw in the sand in Zimbabwe.  And so the cosmogram, if anything, is TransAfrican in that sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, also that drew me to do more investigations on the relationship between African American quilts and traditional African textiles.  That way, I could keep the music involved in the work.
Story_ID: 120534
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were telling us about--
Speaker 2: Oh, California--
Speaker 1: --the University of California.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Berkeley.
Speaker 1: This is '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jim Melchert.  Jim Melchert came to the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] around the time I was just getting ready to leave to go to Japan as chairman of the visual arts component for the National Endowment for the Arts.  I met him through [HM] A.B. Spellman.  And when I got back he called me and wanted to know if I was interested to come to Berkeley, because he was the chair of the art department at U.C. Berkeley--if I was interested in coming out there as a visiting lecturer.  And I said "Absolutely."  So I packed up and went out there, and ended up staying in California for ten years.  Pretty much, I've done ten years I guess everywhere I've been--ten years in New York [City], ten years here in [Washington] D.C., and ten years in California.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, was all the time spent at U.C. Berkeley?
Speaker 2: No.  I was a visiting lecturer for the one year.  It was a one-year appointment, and then I got a re-appointed for a second year.  And then after that, I was pretty much on my own.  And then during that time, I got a job working as an artist-in-residence in the jail system; I was in the city jail in San Francisco [California].  And I was out in San Bruno County Jail, which was an interesting experience, because one of my co-workers was a sculptress, and she works in metal.  But she had to make everything in cardboard, because they couldn't--they couldn't have--because they would probably make weapons with the metal.  And so, you had to turn in--like, we had scissors and stuff like that, and you had to turn them in.  One time I forgot to turn them in, and when we got to the guard gate, they stopped us and wanted to know if I had the scissors.  And I had them in my back pocket, and I said "Oh."  Because they were getting ready to put the whole jail on lockdown.  So--
Speaker 1: Is it the same for paint brushes?  What kind of--
Speaker 2: Well, we could use paint brushes.  Yeah, we could use paint brushes.  But--
Speaker 1: I mean those can be sharpened, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, fortunately, I had to collect them all at the end of a session.  So, that, and I got a couple of mural commissions.  I got one in Hunter's Point.  That's a part of San Francisco.  It was because this particular artist, he, it was his commission, but he wanted to do another, a much larger commission down at the Sargent Johnson Cultural Center.  So, he introduced me to the San Francisco Commission on the Arts, I guess the public art people.  That's not what they call it, but that's what it is.  And so, he had them switch and give me the Hunter's Point commission so he could do that one.  Because when you do those commissions, you can't do them back to back.  There's like a waiting period before you're eligible to apply for something else.  So, I did that commission, and then later on I got a commission from the California State Council on the Arts to do a mural for one of the Caltrain tracks, which is like a commuter train out there.  So, I did that, and then I was in the running for a mural commission in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  We got all the way up to making the decisions on approving the designs.  And then the mayor pulled the budget, they claimed.  And then when they decided to get back on the bandwagon with that commission, the ones they had picked, the six of us, we were considered the semi-finalists, if you wanted to compete.  But in between that, I got the mural commission for the Philadelphia Airport, so that made me ineligible to compete for the Criminal Justice Center.  So, that's pretty much what I was living off of before I moved back to the East Coast.
Story_ID: 120535
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the airport commission came in '94 [1994]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's called "Gateways to the World?"
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, that's when it was dedicated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was almost three years that I had did the work, and had it in storage waiting for them to do the dedication.
Speaker 1: How large is it?
Speaker 2: It's eight feet by sixteen feet.  And it's three panels, five by--wait, I'm sorry, that's eighteen feet.  It's five by six, I think, something in that area, yeah.  They're individual panels that work as a unit.  It's a triptych.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so is this, well, was this mural a departure from your normal style?
Speaker 2: Actually, for this particular piece--because public artworks, for the most part, they have to be site-specific.  So, since this is an airport, I had to kind of move in a different direction.  What I created still has an African element, but it's based on the Ndebele paintings that they do in South Africa.  And they have images of planes in their motifs.  And then there's another motif that looks like a razor blade.  So, between that and the painting, I have planes taking off and landing.  And then I have this, like, I just took this razor blade motif and designed it so it looked like an airstrip, with runways coming in from all four corners.  And then in the center, I have like a control tower that is stylized in these Ndebele motifs.  And then of course, I have ground transportation.  And then the control towers and the middle panel and the two runways, they mirror each other; they're in the opposite direction.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how was it received?  Did people like it?
Speaker 2: People like it, you know.  After 9/11, it was in a place that was a security risk, so you couldn't go through that area unless you had a ticket.  But now I understand they moved it to another area, and they had to do some cosmetics on it, like clean it up and put it under glass.  But I haven't been out to the airport to see where it is since they did that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, this is a pretty big, this is a nice big contract--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --for three years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Unfortunately, it was thrown out after three years.  So, you can break that up, you know.
Speaker 1: This is a public art project--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Percent for the Arts, City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], yeah.
Story_ID: 120536
Speaker 1: Now, this is, just speak to that for a minute, because a lot of artists don't know anything about that.  They don't know that this is a revenue stream for artists.
Speaker 2: It's a revenue stream for artists, but you have to, you have to think in terms of you're doing something that's site-specific.  It has to relate to the site, it has to relate to the people in the community, and it definitely cannot be political, because you will not get the commission.  A lot of the work is a play or a party on things, kind of comical.  And color is limited, because they say they don't want the work to be a spectacle--to stop traffic or cause accidents or anything like that.  So, it's, a lot of the public artworks are kind of muted in color.  Some of them are colorful, not all of them are muted.  But the largest amount of money is in the more permanent work, and that would probably be some kind of metal sculpture or ceramic tile.  It's difficult for people of color to get into that three-digit category.  They don't mind--you know, it's like three levels.  There's, like, GSA [General Services Administration] is probably at the top.  And then there's like community murals.  There's city murals, and then there's like community murals.  And people of color can get all the community murals that they want 'cause they only go like to about maybe forty thousand dollars, max.  But that three figure number, it's kind of tough.  So, the whole idea is--I mean, I know people that do public art.  As soon as they get one commission, they're working on applying for another.  Because you can get them, but sometimes they can backfire on you, like the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where we met for almost two years, and ended up with nothing.  I mean, all our expenses were paid; we got paid for that, reimbursed for that.  But as far as actually getting a commission, it didn't pan out.
Speaker 1: So, the law will pay you to, I mean, for your design work ahead of time?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, you get--it's called a percent for the art, which means that a certain percentage--it started out as a half percent and then it went up to one percent.  And I think now it's like two percent in some places, where two percent of the costs of, you know, rehabbing the building, or building a new building from the ground up, goes toward the purchase of art within and outside the building.
Speaker 1: Now, this is federal law, right?
Speaker 2: It's federal law, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Federal law, state law, and local law?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and public art is supposed to be an open competition.  Well, it's supposed to be a competition, because there's various categories of the way those competitions are handled.  Like, it could be tri-state; it could be like limited to just Virginia, Maryland, and [Washington] D.C.  The, there's one category where the art commissions can pick the artist that they want, and there won't be any competition at all.  And then there's a national and international, where anybody can apply.  So, it's interesting, because, like, before I got the commission for the State of California, I was picked to be one of the judges to select the finalists.  And it was like a one-day process--of like three hundred and something artists' slides.  You hold them up to the light, and maybe reject--and go through them like that.  So, you really don't get to see the person's actual work.  You know, now they do them on CDs.  Still, you're not--it's very different to look--it's like a recording.  You listen to live music, and you listen to the records; it's not the same.  It's like looking at a photograph of this painting; it won't be the same as the actual painting.  There's something gonna be lost.
Story_ID: 120537
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, all the judge has done is looking at a two-dimensional--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --re-creation of--
Speaker 1: And then they pick maybe three or four people that are considered semi-finalists, and they interview those people.  And the more support materials, in terms of your--you become a salesman.  The more support material you have, the better you can sell your idea.  And then if you get the commission, at that point you consider yourself an independent contractor; you're responsible for everything; you've got the budget.  You generally have a designated budget, and you have to stay within the confines of that budget.  You have to really--it's a good idea to come to the actual figure, because if you bid too low, they're going to say "Well, maybe he doesn't know what he's doing. So, you know, maybe his work may not be good, or he doesn't have experience."  And you can't go over.  You can go over for some things, particularly with the sculpture pieces, because that can get kind of expensive.  And if you're working with contractors, and the contractors that are like, say, building the building, if they stall the project so they can get more money--and then there's a cost-of-living factor, that you might get more money.  So, but basically you're responsible for insurance, and you're responsible for having the work installed.  And the insurance that you get has to cover the piece of work for at least a year.  And then, whoever you're doing the work for, they take over ownership.  You've got to get all your materials; everything comes out of that budget.  So, it's real critical that you know what you're doing.  And really, like, they have what they call a designer's fee, which is like twenty percent; that's what the artists get.  Of course, now, if you're doing your own work, you can work around and get more money.  But if you've got to fabricate it out, now, more than likely that's all you're going to get.
Speaker 2: So, you mean if you get a commission and you design a mural--I mean all you did was to design that sculpture?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: Well, see, I don't do sculptures, so I would have to fabricate it out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or, I don't have the space.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I would have to fabricate it out.
Speaker 2: Twenty percent would go for you conceptualizing whatever it is?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And the rest of it would go to whoever has to forge it and mount it, and all that?
Speaker 1: Right, and installation, right, all of that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Install it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Or treat it, or whatever?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the material it takes to do that?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The reason why I asked is because these are pools of money that a lot of minority artists don't know about.
Speaker 1: I know.  And see, that's one of the classes I teach.  And the way that I have the class set up is to teach or give them an introduction of how you go about applying for these things.  Because if you don't follow certain directions a certain way, you're automatically rejected, you know.
Story_ID: 120538
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at some point, you decided to work on an M.F.A., right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Master of Fine Arts.
Speaker 2: When I came back from California--well, see, I guess when I was in New York [City] in the early '70s [1970s], there were a lot of artist-in-residency jobs available.  So, I guess I didn't really concern myself about going back to school, although I had looked at it.  But I was told they would only take a certain amount of my life experiences and apply it towards my undergrad.  So I didn't really pursue it, because I wanted to do more.
Speaker 1: But to get a position teaching in a college or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, during those times you could.  You had artists-in-residence and you had like visiting lecturers.  But the artists-in-residence now, it could be a week, it could be a month.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But these other places, it was more of them available, because there was more money for the arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But an M.F.A. is like a Ph.D. for someone?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's a terminal degree.
Speaker 1: It's a terminal degree.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So I was, when I came back, I got a position at Hampton [University in Hampton, Virginia], because one of their professors decided to quit in the middle of the school year.  So, they brought me in for the spring semester, and I did a semester.  And they said, "Well, you know, we need somebody with a M.F.A., or otherwise, we'll lose the position."  So, I didn't get the, I didn't get to replace this guy that left; they hired somebody else.  So, I was living in Virginia, in Madison, Virginia at the time.  And I was talking to Dr. Tritobia Benjamin, who used to be the assistant dean here [at Howard University in Washington, D.C.]; she's retired now.  So, I was telling her about my situation.  She said, "Well, what about, why don't you contact Leslie King-Hammond at MICA, because she has a program."  So, she actually contacted me through Warren Logan, who's a sculptor in North Carolina.  And so, I found out that they had this program.  They had it here at MICA, Maryland Institute College of Art.  And they had it at Chicago Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago], and I want to say maybe California College for Arts and Crafts; I think that's right.  They would take all of my experiences and apply towards my BA, Masters of Fine Arts, which meant I would go directly to grad school for two years.  So, that's how I got into that program, and that's how I got my M.F.A..  I got it in 1998.
Speaker 1: Well, was it difficult to do?
Speaker 2: No.  I just approached it as if I was preparing for a one-person show.
Story_ID: 120539
Speaker 1: The only difference was--well, no, here at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] you have to, you've got to pretty much write a written defense.  There, being in art school at the time, you could just make a statement.  And I think it's like that at American U[niversity in Washington, D.C.], too, in their art program.
Speaker 2: So, you make a statement and put up a show?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that what it is?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But see, here, you have to write a written statement, do an oral defense of the statement, and then the statement has to relate to the work.  It's not that the work relates to the statement.  It's, the statement is in support of the work.  And then you don't do a show here; they do an exhibition.  Well, you'll have your work up.  You can have it in a gallery during your oral defense.  But generally, it's only up for maybe a week or a day or so.  And then at the end of the semester, if you're one of the ones that graduate, you get to participate in the group's graduate show in the gallery.  So, that's how it works here at Howard.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  And--
Speaker 1: So, I think--what you have to write here, in the defense, the written defense has to be a minimum of thirteen pages.  I think, from what I understand, James Porter had a lot to do with that, because he felt artists should be able to write about their work, because he was an art historian as well as a painter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, that's how Howard has that tradition--you have to have this written statement.
Story_ID: 120540
Speaker 1: Well, did you have a--what was your theme, and how many pieces did you produce?
Speaker 2: I had maybe about, maybe I had about ten pieces of work.  Most of the work was small pieces on paper, but I have one piece that I worked on for almost two years.  And then I had another large--maybe I had another large canvas piece that was four by five.  The piece I worked on for two years, that was eight feet by four feet; maybe eight feet by five feet--eight feet tall and five feet wide.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, and the theme was basically what you'd been doing all along?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't change anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was older, and so was Warren Logan, because we're around the same age.  So, George Wellen, he was in the program at the same time; we all graduated together.  So, that was it, that's how we went about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, as of 1998 when you received this, now, you're fifty-three--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and have been all this time being an artist-in-residence here and there, and doing public park works and other things.  But now you're eligible to get a full--
Speaker 2: Retire. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --time, full-time faculty position.
Story_ID: 120541
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I got the qualifications, yeah.  But I didn't--my last semester I replaced a professor at Coppin State [University in Baltimore, Maryland], Luke Shaw.  They had two art professors at Coppin.  They had a woman that taught, I think she taught photography, and she died that fall.  So it was just Luke, and then he died during the Christmas break.  So, they hired me to cover his classes.  And so, while I was doing my last semester in grad school, I was teaching.  And at the end of the semester, I had gotten my M.F.A..  And they were interviewing candidates to be a full-time replacement, and I was one of the ones, along with some other people.  They picked Linda Day Clark, I think, mainly--well, someone told me it was because she had connections with the BMA, Baltimore Museum of Art.  I think she was working there at the time.  She still might hold a position there, I'm not really sure.  So, she's the one that got the job.  So, one of the people happened to--that was in the running--happened to teach at Suitland High School in P.G. County [District Heights, Maryland].  So, she says, "If you need a job, I can tell you where you can get it.  But it's going to be hell, and don't hate me for it."  (Laughter).  So I said, "All right."  So, she put my name in.  Actually, the chair of the department had met me, because the chair of the visual arts department was in--MICA has an educational program.  It's like a four-year program that they run during the summer.  So, she had just got her degree from there.  So, she called me, and my wife answered the phone.  She says would I be available for an interview.  So, she says, "He'll take it."  (Laughter).  So I went out for the interview, and I got the job.  However, Suitland is an arts magnet, like Duke Ellington School for the Arts.  But I got stuck teaching comprehensives, so I didn't get all the--what you call it--the artsy people.  I got just the guys who had to take art, because it's an easy credit to graduate, you know, or something you have to take to get out of school.  So, three years was enough of that.  So, during that time, Al Smith, a good friend of mine, he became chair of the department.  And so, he's the one that hired me.  He had been there, he had been at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] before me.  He went to school in Boston [Massachusetts], and [HM] Jeff [Donaldson] hired him during the same time when he first came.  I think he either hired Al either before or after he hired Skunder [Alexander Boghossian], I'm not sure which comes first.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, Jeff Donaldson was still here, but he wasn't the Chair, right?
Speaker 1: No, he--
Speaker 2: Had he left?
Speaker 1: He was the Chair, and then he became assistant dean in the art department.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this was when the art department was forced to merge with arts and science.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Before that, the art department was an independent entity all to itself.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, all right.  So, he was in his last couple of years, right?  Jeff?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: This was like--
Speaker 2: Two Thousand--
Speaker 1: This was like in the eighties, late eighties and early nineties that he--
Speaker 2: No, I was asking about when you came in.  Was Jeff still there?
Speaker 1: No, no, he had left.
Speaker 2: All right, so he was gone.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't trying to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was trying to find out what was going on when you got here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, Jeff had retired.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's when [Dr.] Tritobia Benjamin became the assistant dean.  And she had been the art history teacher for years, and the curator of the gallery.  That's part of the assistant dean's job as well, you know, to run the music, and drama, and visual arts department.
Story_ID: 120542
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, well, so how has it been like here at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.]?  Has it been better than Suitland [High School in District Heights, Maryland]?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, much better; I don't have to be a policeman.  There are some students though, that I have to remind them that they're no longer in high school.  You know, you have to do your own work, or you have to work.  You know, you can't expect to just skate by; you have to actually produce something here.  So, once they get straight with that, it goes pretty smoothly.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You know, do you have--well, in 2006 you participated in the Art Embassies Program, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they bought a piece of my work from Norman Parish Gallery in Georgetown [University in Washington, D.C.].  He had his 15th year anniversary show, and I had two pieces of work in that show.  And they came and bought both of those pieces.
Speaker 1: I think it's interesting that your work was purchased by the Republic of Togo.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, African American art goes full circle to Africa.  I mean, it sort of--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --ties it up, doesn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In some ways.
Speaker 2: I know they picked, they picked some work from Charles Searles and his wife [Kathleen Spicer].  And I know also Alonzo Davis did an installation there of his work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's the American Embassy, and these are black people.  Well, we should have some black art here in this Embassy.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 120543
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, that's--you know.  What are some of the other highlights of your time here at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, getting promoted and keeping my job, that's a highlight.  (Laughter.)  I just got promoted to associate professor.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, well, the Mural Commission in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; going to Japan on that fellowship.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about here at Howard.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, not the whole life yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see.  Oh, I was picked, they picked--when President [H. Patrick] Swygert retired, they picked a piece of my work to give to him as a gift from the provost's office.
Speaker 1: What was the title of it?
Speaker 2: "Freedom Fighter."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I had been painting an exhibition in the faculty show.  And he liked it, and he was going to purchase it himself.  He liked it because he had been in Ghana, and they had a lot of Adinkra symbols in the work.  And he didn't move on it, so when he retired--I don't know how it came around, but there were a couple of other pieces of work he was interested in, and they picked mine.  So, that's how that went down.  Let me see, what else?  Well, my students, they did--well, this one student, Mekbib, an Ethiopian student, he designed this mural for a gospel rescue mission down in Chinatown.  Well, what they wanted was a mural that had all the important people in the Civil Rights Movement, from Frederick Douglass on up to [President Barack] Obama.  So, he took it back to Menelik--being from Ethiopia--through slavery on up to Obama, and he did two murals.  And well, he had some Kennedy in it; he had some Adam Clayton Powell and Rosa Parks, on one side.  And then he has the Obamas on the other side.  And also he did two stained glass, one of Obama and another one of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  And the Gospel Rescue Ministries is a rehab place for drug addicts and alcoholics.  They gave us a bunch of awards and stuff, so you know, it was a big thing.
Story_ID: 120544
Speaker 1: Now, do the students today relate to the, to the philosophy that you came along and got involved with?  You know, the philosophy of having a powerful statement in art that would push forward the liberation struggle?
Speaker 2: There is quite a few of them that do, and then there's a few that don't.  But generally, by the time they finish up here, they ended up in that direction.  I mean, in fact, a couple of students have come through and said, "Well, I don't want to do anything that's political.  I just want to make my art."  And then they end up--it might not speak to the struggle.  I mean this one particular student, she did a thing on big women, because she was big.  So, that was a statement, and it was all very feminine, and had very feminine elements to it in terms of--feminist elements to it.  Another student, she was a journalist, supposedly.  And she didn't want to do anything political, but she did a whole--her whole thesis was on the complexion thing.  You know, so that was political.  So, you know, they changed.  I don't think they do it just to get out of the department, I think they're really kind of serious about it, you know, when they take on those projects.  But like, one of the--we were just moving this one girl's work, the one that works with the ovals--she's just doing it on process, and that's fine as far as I'm concerned.
Story_ID: 120545
Speaker 1: Now, do you have like a--what is your artistic philosophy today?
Speaker 2: I don't think it's changed.  You know, I still stick with the same statement.  I may add--it depends on the venue.  Like, if I've got to put together something--which I am going to have to do soon--I might add some things and give a little more background as to why I'm doing the work, and give more of a verbal statement about what inspired the work, and where the work is traditionally coming from, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: I know the artists of the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] that came along with the Black Artists Movement spent a lot of time trying to go back and recoup, you know, symbols of the African past--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and blend them with messages, you know, that were needed in the Movement in those days.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, that's what I--from my studies with the cosmogram, that's what I'm doing.  They have kind of a--like for one period of time I was doing some artwork, and they had a type of writing called Nisidi [sic Nsibidi].  And that's like in the cross-river area between--
Speaker 1: Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nigeria and Cameroon.  And then there's another set of writing systems in the Congo called the Ki-Kongo, which use arrows.  And you can see it like in some of your artwork that's maybe in Cuba and in Brazil when they use these frimas, these arrows.  But they don't really have anything else traditional.
Speaker 1: Can you spell those for us?
Speaker 2: Frimas and--
Speaker 1: The first one was called Nisidi.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, let me see.  I can go close.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, get us close.
Speaker 2: N-I-S-I-D-I, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And the other one, the other form?
Speaker 2: Ki-kongo, actually, that's the language from the Congo.  That's with a 'k' not a 'c.'  K-I-and then a dash--kongo, with a 'K.'
Speaker 1: Ki-kongo, okay, with a 'k."  And then--
Speaker 2: And then the frimas, I'm not sure how that's pronounced, but that's probably a Spanish word, and that's F-R-I-M-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But these are, are there any African American symbols that we missed over the years that are incorporated into the work that you do?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not in the alphabet, not anything verbal.  But getting back to what I was saying about the stylization I was doing at the time--I would come up with a statement, and then I would have a friend of mine write it out in shorthand, you know, that the secretaries use.  And then I would take the shorthand and stylize it like the nisidi writing.  So, it's still, it's readable and it's still English, but it's in shorthand.  But it has like these little added things to it that would make it look like it's somewhat of a foreign language, which it isn't.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: Oh, there are times, you know, I think, I feel a kinship with, say, Jay Cateland and Fadra Hines [ph.], because they were both--Jay Cateland was white.  But he was an artist that left New York [City] and he came down and worked at the Smithsonian for years and years.  So did Fadra Hines, he worked at the Smithsonian.  So, I don't know.  If I, I think if I had stayed, I would like to say that things would have been different, in terms of me being more successful.  And I don't know what you call successful.  I mean, my work is successful, but financially, it's kind of lacking.  (Laughter).  Maybe I could be just as big as [Jean-Michel] Basquiat and Alaf [ph.] of course, if I had stayed in New York, you know, I don't know.  But I know at the time, I was going around to some of the downtown galleries.  And when they would say they'd call me, I knew what that meant.  And I went to one gallery, I think it was--I don't remember the name of it.  I think it was the OK Gallery.  And he said, "They're not ready for this yet."  And I'm thinking, "Well, when are they going to be ready?  I'm right here now, you know."   (Laughter).  So, I've pretty much gotten away--I have--all the way from commercial galleries, except I do shows with International Vision over on Connecticut Avenue.  I'm getting ready to do a show in the fall in Baltimore [Maryland] at this gallery called New Door Creative.  So, they're both black-run galleries.  I think that's probably the only thing I'd probably want to do over, if I wanted to do anything over again.
Speaker 1: So, make the public more receptive to you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember back in the day, Encore Magazine was in its heyday.  And they had Bennie Andrews writing articles on art.  And he wrote this one article called "The Twenty-One Club."  And what that meant was there was like maybe four hundred African-American artists in New York City, and only twenty-one were being represented in galleries, commercial galleries, meaning the downtown galleries.  And he said that wouldn't change unless somebody died, or if they moved out of town.
Speaker 1: So, it's sort of a quota.
Speaker 2: It's a quota, yeah.  Even though with the Black Arts Movement, there are more people getting exhibits, and more African Americans holding positions as art administrators and things like that, but it's still a quota.  And the attitude is still the same, too, because they had an exhibit of artists from this collection here at the Corcoran.  It was called "Thirty Artists," just thirty artists, but all the artists were black artists.  So, I don't think I--I couldn't catch the review that was in the Washington Post.  But I did see the review that was in the city paper, and they were saying, "Well, there's no theme in the show.  It looks like it's just randomly put together," blah, blah, blah.  And that's the same thing they were saying when we were doing shows in the seventies:  "You know, they just threw a bunch of these artists together, there's no theme."  Same wording, but a different time.
Speaker 1: But the criticism a lot of people have of the AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] artists is they all, they have too much of the same thing.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Yes, because, well--
Speaker 1: But, that is a criticism that's leveled.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they work--it's a co-op group.  And, like, they work and they do theme projects, and their work has a certain look.  But the new group now, it's changed, I mean, with the addition of people like Adgar, again, Adgar Cowens, and Michael [D.] Harris, and a guy from Atlanta, I can't think of his name--Kevin Cole.  AfriCOBRA has a different look now.  And of course, Sekelis [ph.] occasionally has a different kind of look, too.

Speaker 1: All right.  Another question we always ask is, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your artistic legacy?
Speaker 2: I'm committed to painting.  I mean, that's the first thing I do when I get up in the morning.  I have to do certain things like walk the dogs, things like that.  Then I go and I paint.  Even if I'm teaching, I try to get in at least two hours before I go to work.  And when I come home, you know, I'm straight down in the studio working.  And I feel I have to work every day.  It's, and that's one of the reasons why I guess there is a certain amount of consistency in my work, because I work at it every day, like a musician practices.  Certain musicians practice around the clock.  So, I paint around the clock.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your legacy is your work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thanks for putting it that way for me, I appreciate it.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 118845
Speaker 1: Tell me this.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My concern is that they be more supportive of the visual artists.  I mean, the African American committee--community, sorry, they're committed to support the arts, but it's entertainment art.  And then the artists they do support are established--I guess the artists that have that Madison Avenue commercial gallery look.  Or they get somebody--they hire somebody to buy work for their homes, you know, they hire consultants, instead of going out and actually looking at the work and make decisions on what fits their taste.  And a couple of years ago the Black Caucus artist, [HM] Sam Gilliam, the filmmaker [sic painter], that's the first time I've known them to honor a visual artist.  You know, what happened to Romare Bearden, artists like that, you know?  You don't see--well, there's a certain amount of diplomacy there.  But you don't see--from what I understand, a collection of artwork is in the White House now.  It doesn't--you see very few African American artists.  So, I think that's one of the--probably if that was one of the mistakes I made, I was, I thought that the black community was going to support us artists, or the black community was going to support itself and become self-sufficient.  But we're still consumers, to a large degree.
Story_ID: 118846
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us something about your family.  Now, you told us you were married twice and it didn't work out too well.  But are you--
Speaker 2: I'm married for the third time, and so far it's working out.  We went together--we've been married thirteen years, so we're looking for another thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you meet your wife in the field of art, or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't teaching here at the time, but she was a student.  She was an art history student, and that's how we met, up at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have children?
Speaker 2: I have two sons [Skunder Phillips and Kamal Phillips] and a daughter [Anika Phillips].  And my daughter has a son and a daughter.  She had another son, but he only lived ten days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got two grandchildren--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and two children?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are they artists at all, any of them?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they want to go as far away from that as possible.
Speaker 1: You mean, seriously?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You mean as far as possible, or just--
Speaker 2: They didn't feel the need to create.  So, I mean, you got to feel the need.  I mean a lot of people have talent, but they don't--if they don't pursue it, they're not going to do anything with it.  And if they don't feel the need to do it, they're not going to do anything with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything.
Story_ID: 118847
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but it's a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a dedicated painter; that my artwork is my life, you know.  And that's all I ever want to do, is just paint.  I don't want to be a chair of the art department; I don't want to be an art administrator; I don't want to be a politician or a community leader.  I just want to paint, and I get mad if I can't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're quite welcome.

VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, go ahead and tell us about that photo.
Speaker 2: That's a photograph of me and my wife, Shellie, Shellie Gross Phillips.  I have a tuxedo on, so that must have been on our wedding day.  But she doesn't have her gown, her wedding dress on.  So, maybe that was at the reception or something.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a baby picture that I have.  My wife tried to restore it, and that's why I have the two images there.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is me in [Gretna] Virginia.  I was about age three or four, in the front yard of the farmhouse.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my mother [Jettie Elizabeth Brown] and my father [Frank Phillips].  That was sometime during the forties [1940s], before I was born.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a picture with me and Michael Harris at the (unclear).  And it was a dedication; they were honoring [HM] Samella Lewis that year.  That was probably about ninety--no, 2003 or 2004, something like that.
Speaker 1: That's her in the middle, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is 1994.  This is at the mural dedication at the Philadelphia airport.  That's Mayor Rendell.  He was mayor then, and he went on to be the governor of Pennsylvania.  That's Barbara Bullock, she's one of the artists.  And the artist on the other side, that's Laney, and I can't think of his last name off the top of my head.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me in 1972 in Harlem [New York].
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a picture of me with Frank Smith in the center, and [HM] Jeff Donaldson in 1973.  I think it was at Frank's house on Water Street for an AfriCOBRA meeting.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of us at the Jeff Donaldson memorial service and memorial exhibition.  And that was in the gallery at the university.  That's, from this direction that's Aggie Collins [ph.], Ron Anderson, and next to him is Maury DePilsen, he's now deceased.  Napoleon Jones-Henderson, Frank Smith, Nelson Stevens, Michael Harris, and myself.  And that was two thousand--the date, man, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005], maybe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, that sounds about right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
