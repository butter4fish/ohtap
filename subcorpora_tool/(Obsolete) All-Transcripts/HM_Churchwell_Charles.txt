Story_ID: 495328
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Churchwell, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Leeannah, L-E-E-A-N-N-A-H, Leeannah, Delaughter is her maiden--D-E-L-A-U-G-H-T-E-R, Churchwell [Leeannah Delaughter Churchwell].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-four [1894] was the birth; Madison, Florida, M-A-D-I-S-O-N, Florida.
Speaker 1: All right, Madison, Florida.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very li- very little.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Only her sister.  I never knew my grandmother on maternal side, nor paternal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, do you know--did you hear any stories about them, about what they did for a living or what they--where they lived, or--?
Speaker 2: In Madison, and she was a, a housemaid, and mother grew up in Madison, and, among things she did, told us about picking cotton.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have a chance to go to school when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: She dropped out of elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was functionally literate; she could write.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did she do like farm work afterwards, or did she do cleaning, or what did she do?
Speaker 2: She, she did maid work; she worked for families, and she took in washing and ironing, especially during World War II [WWII].  There was a, a, a naval--an [U.S.] Air Force glider training camp [Dunnellon Army Airfield, Florida] not too far from Dunnellon, and she was determined to have her own house, and she would--in addition to working in families' houses, she would wash and iron for soldiers, did their uniforms and saved all the money she could to buy a lot so she could build her own house.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a lot of determination 'cause she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a determined lady.  When Papa died in '37 [1937], Mama was left with paying off a debt.  She had to borrow money to bury Papa, and even though Papa worked very hard, he could never get out of debt, because this man he worked for owned everything.  He owned the grocery store where Papa bought his food on credit, and Papa lived in his house.
Speaker 1: So he was sharecropping basically, share--renting (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was almost as bad as sharecropping if not worse.  He could never get out of debt, so when he died, he was in debt.  When he died, Mama had that to pay off, plus the money she borrowed to, to bury him, and she was left with nine children to raise: one girl and eight boys.  And people asked her to give them one of us so they would raise to help her out.  She said, "That's not helping me. I'm gonna keep these children together, and I'm gonna raise 'em myself."  And that's what she did.
Story_ID: 495329
Speaker 1: We all stayed together in one house she [Churchwell's mother, Leeannah Delaughter Churchwell] was renting from the man Papa [John Churchwell, Sr.] had worked for, and she was determined to get out of that house and get her own house.  So she got a job and my sister, who's the oldest in the family, and my next two older brothers, they got jobs to help support the family, and they all three had to drop out of school.  So, with mother working and Juanita [Juanita Churchwell Hunter], my sister, the oldest; Tom [Thomas Churchwell], the next oldest brother, and Alfred [Alfred Churchwell]--the three of them helped support us.
Speaker 2: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then, after Papa was buried, he had one sister who lived in Newark, New Jersey, Aunt Lucille [ph.].  She came to the funeral, and she noticed while she was there that Juanita was working for a family as a domestic.  She told mother if she would let Juanita go back to Newark with her, she could work and get paid much more, and because she would be staying with her, she could save money and send it home and help mother pay off the debt.  And so that's what--mother reluctantly let her go, and it was a good thing because Nita did get a very good domestic job there, and she was able to send money home after each payday.  She sent mother a money order, and mother would use that money to pay off the debt, and the other money she would make, she would save toward her house.  That continued up until World War II [WWII].  Then, Nita gave up the domestic job and got a job in Delaware with DuPont company [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware].  That picture you see up there on the wall is the one that she preserved because she put a plastic cover over it while she was working at DuPont.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of your family in--
Speaker 1: That's a family picture.
Speaker 2: From what year?
Speaker 1: About '37 [1937].
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-seven [1937].
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-seven [1937].  That picture, each of us has a copy of it, and prominently displayed just like that over there (points).  And we tell all of our children about that picture.  And if you look at it, you'll see--I'm standing there along with all of my siblings.  I do not have any shoes on; I can't really remember when I first got my first pair of shoes; I do know I was in school because I walked to school.  In the winter it was frost on the ground, but we had to get to school.  There were no buses except for the white kids who rode by in the big yellow bus, but we walked about four miles to and from school.  Well, at any rate, mother was determined to get that house built, so she saved; after Nita helped her pay that debt off, she then started saving money to buy the lot, and at the end of World War II, she had saved enough money to buy the lot.  She buy--she bought the lot, and it was covered with palmettos.  I mean anyone who is from Florida know those palmettos just grow in big clumps, and we had to clear that lot, but we cleared it and she built her house.  It was really a shotgun house, but it was hers, and she was proud of it.
Story_ID: 495330
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, John Dozier, D-O-Z-I-E-R, Churchwell [John Churchwell, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not know the date, but place was Dothan, Alabama.
Speaker 1: What--I'm sorry, what, what, what is it?
Speaker 2: Dothan.
Speaker 1: Dothan?  D-O-T-H (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) T-H-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alabama.
Speaker 1: Dothan, Alabama.  Okay.  But was he older than your mother [Leeannah Delaughter Churchwell]?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I have no idea how old, how much older.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it--but they was, looked like they were about pretty close together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was probably born in the 1890s--early 1890s (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in that same--yes, yes, they were about the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've been--and some of my niece and neph- nieces now are doing some research trying to determine where in Dothan Papa really was born.  We suspect it was on a plantation, and we've been trying to figure out how he and mother got together.  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is Dothan--okay, is Dothan near the Gulf [Gulf of Mexico], or is it
Speaker 2: It's inland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's near the western border of Alabama.  And since Papa was a great walker, he would walk miles.  Matter of fact, he had to walk to work, because he worked for a owner of a turpentine still, so he had to walk out to the--these pine trees to do his job.  So we speculate that very likely, since Dothan is near the western [sic.] border of Alabama, and Madison [Florida] is near the western border of Florida, that it would not be unreasonable for Papa to walk from Dothan to Madison, or in that neck of the woods, for them to have met there because my sister [Juanita Churchwell Hunter] was born in Madison.  She's the oldest of the family.  My oldest brother [Thomas Churchwell] was born in Madison, so he and mother met somewhere in Madison.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story about how they met?  Do they--did either one tell the story of how they met and got together?
Speaker 2: We have no information, and I never as a boy listened.  I, I have no information.  My sister may have, but I have no idea how they met (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.  But they, they got together in Madison?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Okay.
Story_ID: 495331
Speaker 1: Now your father [John Churchwell, Sr.] died when--how old were you when your father died?
Speaker 2: 'Bout eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he died in '37 [1937], about there.
Speaker 1: Now, now how did he die?  I mean what, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had double pneumonia.  He had--as I said, he walked to work and from work, and I remember vividly, he came home in the fall, and he--drenched with--he was wet, and he caught a cold directly after that, and it led to pneumonia, and he went to bed and really never got up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  People rarely, you know, die of pneumonia now, unless they're very--they're of advanced age, or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --but that's--was that common in those days, for people to--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, very common.  If you caught pneumonia, you were in bad trouble because of the living conditions.  Houses were not very warm, and you had to--if you had to work, you had to get out in that inclement weather, so it--all of that was against you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there was no sick leave or anything like that, right?  If you were sick, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never heard of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So if you were sick, you just had to--and you needed the money, you had to go.
Speaker 2: You had to go.  You had to go, and that was the problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your--did you ever--did your father ever talk to you about growing up, or what it was like for him growing up in Dothan, Alabama?  Or did any of his relatives or anybody else talk, tell you about his growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I--it--I never talked about, and I never heard Papa talk about that, except the hard work that he had to do.
Speaker 1: Did he do mostly like farm work, and that sort of thing, or--
Speaker 2: Farm work and handyman, and carpentry and labor, which was the same thing he would do after work in the turpentine mill.  He always had a farm to help feed us.  We had potato farms--patches, and corn fields, and vegetables--all of those he would grow after, in the evening and on weekends.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know if your father had a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 2: Just by--like where the elementary.  He could write and figure, read the Bible.  That was about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never saw any books in the house, other than the Bible; that's one of the strange things about my life.  I never saw a book in the house except the Bible, yet when I was in school, I developed the habit of reading, and that's reading.  And although I spent forty years as a professional librarian, I never saw a library until I went to college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Hm.  Now, that's interesting.
Story_ID: 495332
Speaker 1: Now tell me, when you think about your parents' [Leeannah Delaughter Churchwell and John Churchwell, Sr.] personalities, your--their, their talents, their, their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think it's sort of evenly-distributed because I'm a workaholic, my daddy was a hard worker.  I think I'm pretty determined when I set my mind on something, and mother was a determined person, so I, I think I have some characteristics of both of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think mother was more influential than Papa, because she raised us after Papa died, and we were relatively young, so our personalities were shaped a great deal by mother.  So I, I sort of chuckle when I hear people talk about how, how poor-off children raised by single parents, 'cause I say that's nonsense.  It depends on who the parent is, 'cause my mother raised us by herself, and all of us, every one of us, have a great respect for hard work, and not afraid of it, and each of my brothers who died left their widows with a home.  They're living in the homes my brothers left them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tom's [Thomas Churchwell] wife, that's the oldest brother, she lives in Dunnellon [Florida] now, in the house he built.  Alfred [Alfred Churchwell], the next older brother, his wife is living in the house that he built, and J.D. [John Churchwell, Jr.], a deceased brother, his wife is living in her house in Columbus [Georgia].  So I think our parents were very influential in our lives, in teaching us a value system, especially not to be afraid of hard work.
Story_ID: 495333
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember walking to school [Dunnellon School, Dunnellon, Florida] with no shoes, with frost on the ground.  I remember the big yellow buses passing us.  I remember never seeing a brand new text book in school; they were always text books that white kids had, had used, and we got second-handed.  I remember those very clearly.  And I remember the first job I got working for a white family, and it was working at a dairy, and I remember very vividly of having to get up at four a.m. in the morning to get to that dairy to get those cows milked so that we could deliver milk at eight o'clock in the morning; we would have it for breakfast.  Now, I must've been about--no more than twelve or fourteen at that time, and I, I remember doing that and--as a--dropping out of school to do that, and I remember as a child when a new principal came to Dunnellon, named Mr. Simpson [ph.], he visited the family of every child who should have been in school but wasn't there, and I remember him coming to our house and meeting with mother [Leeannah Delaughter Churchwell].  I have no idea what they talked about, but it's not difficult to discern because when I came home, mother told me to tell the owner of that dairy that I had one more week to work because I was gonna gonna, gonna go to school.  So I'm sure Mr. Simpson convinced her that I should go to school, and that's what happened.  I quit--stopped working, and this was when I was in--when I went to school because of my age, not because of my size; I was very small, comparatively speaking.  He--they put me in the sixth grade, and I remember that.  So I was in the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: How old were you at that time?
Speaker 2: I must have been about fourteen or fifteen at that time, because I stayed in school.
Speaker 1: Now, was--go ahead; were you gonna say something?  Oh, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and again, Mr. Simpson was a, was, was a--an enormous influence on our--my life.  He impressed upon me the importance of an education; he did all of us the importance of getting an education.  I stayed in school until I was about--just as I got around eighteen, I joined the [U.S.] Army; Mr. Simpson was extremely disappointed.  I told him I would finish high school when I got out of the Army.  He was still disappointed.  But I had not finished high school when I went in the Army.
Story_ID: 495334
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back a little bit and tell me about where you grew up, and what your house looked like, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Dunnellon, Florida in a, a shotgun house that we paved the walls with paper, with paper sacks.  We'd tear them--tear them open and paste 'em on the wall to try to keep out the wind.
Speaker 1: So, so there was no drywall on the wall?  It was just--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head). There, there was no--we didn't know what drywall was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These were just planks, and there were the cracks between the boards, and the roof often leaked; they were tin roofs.  You could hear the rain falling and, unfortunately, sometimes when the roof was being put on, a nail was put in the wrong place and pulled out, but the rain would find those leaks, and you'd have to put buckets on the floor to catch the water as it would leak out, and you--and Florida in the monsoon period, those were leaky, leaky roofs, and you had--busy with buckets and tubs to capture water.
Speaker 1: Okay so, who was--how, how close was your nearest neighbor?
Speaker 2: These houses were in a row, but with a yard between the two houses, so it wasn't--the neighbors were not too far.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in a--in the town part--the village, I guess, of Dunnellon (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eventually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I said Papa [John Churchwell, Sr.] always had a farm, and he would rent a house sometimes out near the farm, and we lived--that's where I really was born, out there in the country.  When I go to Dunnellon now, I often take the back road, because I can point out where I used to live, and eventually, we moved into, quote, town, 'cause Papa bought a house, or rented a house in town, that was from the country now.  In other words, in town, you had sidewalks and you could walk downtown, whereas otherwise we just had dirt roads--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --warm sand in the summer between your toes and feet; sand could get so hot, hot in the summer and cold in the winter, and no shoes.
Story_ID: 495335
Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Now, what was your first school, and what--how old were you when you first went to school?
Speaker 2: I, I must've been twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was that long before you even went to school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is really dramatic then, because you--you said you were working on--at the dairy--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --and so forth, and you, you were going to school but it was taking too, too much of a toll on you to work and go to school at the same time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You get up in the morning, you see, at four o'clock to get to the dairy, to get the cows milked, and you deliver the milk so it'll be there at eight o'clock, and after that's over, you go to school--up until Mr. Simpson [ph.] came to town and told mother [Leeannah Delaughter Churchwell] I ought to be in school full time, and I had to give up that job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me this now, what--did you--could you read before you started school?  Had you learned how to read before you started school, or did you have to learn in school?
Speaker 2: Nita [Juanita Churchwell Hunter] my, my sister, she had school, and she would teach us out of McGuffey [McGuffey Readers], so I could do a little reading, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when you entered school you could do something; you could do enough to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So they--you said that they put you in the sixth grade?
Speaker 2: I think, I think it was about the sixth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was the name of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only because of my age, I think it was, not because of my size.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Dunnellon elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did they call it Dunnellon Colored School, or did they just call it Dunnellon Elementary?
Speaker 2: Colored school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And about how many students were in, in school with you?
Speaker 2: The school taught everything, you know, so everybody was--I'd say there might've been--may have been forty or fifty children in that whole school.
Speaker 1: Okay.   And was it a one-room school, or did it have like more than one room, a couple rooms, or what?
Speaker 2: The first school I went to was called Dunnellon School, but it was really in a church [Second Bethel Baptist Church, Dunnellon, Florida], and then after--they moved us out of there, put us into a school that was operated by the county, a building--one big building.  But the first school was in a church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it a black church in the neighborhood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One--yes, Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One big room.
Story_ID: 495336
Speaker 1: Now, wa- was it the church that your family attended?
Speaker 2: Same one, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Second Bethel Baptist Church [Dunnellon, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay, Second Bethel, Bethel Baptist, okay.  N- now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every Sunday, Sunday school, afternoon service, and BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America]--Thursday night prayer meeting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your family attended all of those functions?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) And we with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: They would send us to BYPU, but we all went to Sunday school.
Speaker 1: And BYPU was in the evening, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bapt- yes, Sunday afternoon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Baptist--what's it stand for?
Speaker 2: Baptist Youth Program [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 495337
Speaker 1: Now, did you--when you started school now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now wha- did they teach--in those days, what kind of history would you get?  Would you get like standard U.S. history out of the textbooks, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's it; standard history out of textbooks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--was there ever attempt to teach black history by any of the teachers?
Speaker 2: No.  Never heard of that until I got to college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But these were black teachers though in the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of 'em were.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Very dedicated.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, when you look back on it, do you think that they probably didn't have a sense of what their history was, or didn't really think it was important, or what?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Speaker 1: I said when you reflect back on your experience of learning history in school, do you think that your teachers knew their own history, or did they not think it was important, or what?
Speaker 2: They knew it--what they were teaching, yes.  Again, most of these teachers, as I reflect, were not four-year college graduates.  These were teachers who had gotten two years of college and got certified to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't get a four-year until Mr. Simpson [ph.] came, the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of the teachers were two-year trained.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what they call a normal degree, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  But they were dedicated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were some of your teachers' names?  What were their names?
Speaker 2: Mr. Simmons [ph.] and Miss Compton [ph.] and Miss Bowers [ph.], and now I can't think of--Miss Martin [ph.], who was the institution--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but she'd been there.
Speaker 1: She'd been there a long time, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, your school was supposed to be supported by the county, right?  But--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you got the used textbooks and the--were the teachers--do you know if they received a decent salary or not, or--?
Speaker 2: No, they were underpaid.  As I read back to history and say they were terribly underpaid as I think about it, and as I said, we never saw a new textbook.
Story_ID: 495338
Speaker 1: Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for (laughter)--I laugh, because I was valedictorian of my class, but when you think about there were five of us who graduated (laughter).  That was no big deal, because when I got to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I discovered that there were students from schools like Parker High School [A.H. Parker High School] in Birmingham [Alabama], Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School] in Nashville [Tennessee], Sumner High School [Charles H. Sumner High School] here in St. Louis [Missouri].  These were good students had, had--I didn't see a, a microscope until I got to Morehouse; I didn't even know what a microscope was.  I didn't know what a, a Brunson burner [sic. Bunsen burner] was 'cause I never saw a chemistry laboratory until I got to Morehouse.
Speaker 1: But when you think about it--I mean you were valedictorian of your class--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: --but, but you didn't, you didn't have those things, but you went on to get a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you must have been a pretty good--you would have been a good student at those schools, I would guess.
Speaker 2: If I had, but I, I was a hard worker though, man, and I was--Mr. Simpson [ph.] taught us never to give up on anything, say, "Hang in there and study it.  If you study long and consistently, you'll get it."  He hammered that home; he knew they were not giving us what we needed to succeed but, but giving you an attitude, he could work on that.  And that's what he worked on, was the attitude.  He knew that we didn't have a, a laboratory.  He knew that when I went to Morehouse, there were things that I was going to see that I never seen before, but he instilled within me the determination to succeed, so when I took chemistry and failed it at Morehouse, I brought my textbook home with me and studied until I finally saw the light.  I went back and took it over, and passed it; that's what got me by.
Speaker 1: Well, as quiet as it's kept, it's study that gets everybody's--everybody by, unless they know somebody that can get 'em by without studying (laughter).  So, so you did the right thing; you did what, you know, everybody does on some level--they have to study.  So--now, you said you went from school to--after you graduated, you went to--did you go into the [U.S. military] service directly?
Speaker 2: No, I went in the service before I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right; that's what I thought you--okay.
Speaker 2: And when I came out of the service--I went back to high school when I was nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, you said that, that Mr. Simpson was very disappointed, that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, but when I came back--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and told--he was still there--and told him that I wanted to come back to high school, he was delighted, and he told me that the superintendent of the school board made allowances for veterans, and if I came back and took an examination, that I could join the eleventh grade.  So when I came back, I took the examination and was placed in eleventh grade at nineteen, and, as I say, rest is history.  I, I graduated in the spring of '48 [1948]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from high school--
Speaker 1: And then after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at twenty--I think at twenty-one.  Most students are coming out of college (laughter), but I went to Morehouse when I was--
Speaker 1: Twenty-one.
Speaker 2: --twenty-one.
Story_ID: 495339
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the [U.S.] Army though.  What, what--now, you became a sergeant in the Army, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now, how did that happen, and what did you do?  What service did you provide in the Army?
Speaker 2: That was in order to get out of the cold weather.  Since I didn't have any skills when I went in the Army, they put me in security, and I had to guard the--the building I was guarding was headquarters and, and I walked--.  Now, I'm in a little town north of Seattle, Washington called Edward[AB1], Washington [sic. Edmonds, Washington], and snow, which I'd never seen, and I was walking around this building cold, and would look inside and see these people in there typing, and I saw one fellow who could really type, and I really wanted to do that.  I had never seen a typewriter before, and so I buttonholed him once when he was coming out of the office and asked him how could I learn how to type, and he said, "There are armed forces manuals that will--where you can learn how to teach yourself how to type," and he won't--he say, "You won't get up to the sixty-five word per minute to be classified as a typist," he said, "but you can, you can do well enough to be classified as a clerk non-typist, and that's a person who works in the office but is not required to type."  So I studied this book and taught myself how to type, and took an examination, posted, it was a post-examination for a clerk non-typist, and I took the examination and passed it, and became a clerk non-typist.  And by the time it was--for me to be shipped overseas, when I got over there, I was that proverbial blind--I mean one-eye man in, in a blind village.  Nobody else in my company could type at all, and the company had to have a clerk, so I became the company clerk, making out the payroll, the morning reports--those are essentials.
Speaker 1: Now, now, sir, where did you go?  Where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Manila [Philippines].
Speaker 1: Manila?
Speaker 2: The Philippines (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Philippines, okay.
Speaker 2: --and Subic Bay [U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines].
Speaker 1: Now, what year is--what year did you join the Army, first of all?
Speaker 2: Forty--this must've been forty--
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945]?
Speaker 2: Five [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I think I read it's '45 [1945], okay.  So were in from '45 [1945] to forty--
Speaker 2: Seven [1947].
Speaker 1: Forty-seven [1947], okay, okay.  So, you're in the Philippines and, and you're the only one in the outfit that can type?
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).  And I kept that job, and then I was promoted to sergeant.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: That's what I did during the entire, entire time I was in the Philippines.
Speaker 1: So, what was your official title, sergeant of what?
Speaker 2: Company clerk.
Story_ID: 495340
Speaker 1: So, are there any stories about the Philippines?  Now, now, you had never been very far from home, right?
Speaker 2: I hadn't been out of Dunnellon [Florida] 'til I got in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Hm.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hadn't seen a swimming pool when I got out of--before I went into the Army.  As a matter of fact, when I went to Fort Benning [Georgia] for my training where they had a swimming pool, I wouldn't get in it 'cause I thought it was dirty because I learned how to swim in a river, and my hometown had beautiful fresh water rivers; that's where we swam.  To come--to swim in a, a pool?  Man that was terrible.  So I didn't see one until I was in Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: So, you actually had a clear freshwater river to swim in in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, man.  That water was--you could see it coming up; at the head you could see it bubbling up.
Speaker 1: Out of the spring, huh?  Right there in that--
Speaker 2: Out of the spring.  You could see it coming up; it still does that now.
Speaker 1: Now, what's it called?  What's the name of the river?
Speaker 2: Blue Run.
Speaker 1: Blue Run, okay.
Speaker 2: That's the official name of it, Blue Run, because water looks blue; you could see the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: That's where every--everybody in my town, that's where they learn how to swim, in the river.  You don't (makes sound).  There was no swimming pool in my town; it wouldn't have survived.
Speaker 1: So, did you go across to Manila [Philippines] on a boat or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --or did they fly you?
Speaker 2: It felt like a boat (laughter).  No, it really was a--had been a [U.S.] Merchant Marine ship--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --had been converted into a troop ship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was laughing, because I was so sick.  I got seasick and stayed seasick for three or four days.  It was 'bout the fifth day before I got my sea legs, man.
Speaker 1: Now, you entered the service--this is just before the official integration of the U.S. Armed Forces by Truman [President Harry S. Truman], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I was the--I was--
Speaker 1: --they were still segregated, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, very definitely.
Speaker 1: But did you hear the rumblings of talk about the desegregation of the Army when you were in, in the Army?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: They didn't talk about it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If they did, I didn't hear it.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was out of the Army and read that report, that special report that was written that impressed President Truman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was a report written by--
Speaker 2: It was a special committee set up--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it was called 'To Secure These Rights.'  I remember it very clearly.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: The other thing I remember very clearly as a boy, I had a paper route after school and on weekends.  The Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] carried stories, of course, about the airmen at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Boy, we used to look forward to getting that paper--
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: --to see these picture of these boys in these jackets and caps--very impressive.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.  So you read about the Tuskegee Airmen ahead of time--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: As they were reported in the Pittsburgh Courier, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you see any of the other black papers down in Florida--the, the Norfolk Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide], or the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't know anything about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought the Pittsburgh Courier was it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you never got the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] either?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --didn't hear about those until later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Much later.
Story_ID: 495341
Speaker 1: What was the Philippines like?  I mean did it, did it--were you surprised at the people or, or the customs of the people in the Philippines?
Speaker 2: It was--see, after it had been bombed, it was (gesture).  So this was--when I got there, it was almost like a ghost town because buildings had been gutted with bombs and then the--and there were guerillas living in the hills.
Speaker 1: Were, were these Japanese soldiers, or were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they were Philippines.
Speaker 1: Filipinos.
Speaker 2: Filipinos, who had never stopped (laughter)--who'd never stopped fighting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had been guerillas when the Japanese were there, and they just kept going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't have anything else to do.
Speaker 1: So they were freedom fighters, I guess, or--as such, you know, I guess, who didn't want any, any foreign group there.
Speaker 2: No.  You see, they--it was still a, a U.S. possession, and they really wanted their independence, and the U.S. eventually gave it to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any stories from your stay in the Philippines that come to mind?  Anything unique or special happen there?
Speaker 2: No, except those monsoon long rainy periods.  And the Subic Bay [U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines] where we were, it was only--faced the border of the South China Sea.  It was right down there, and you could walk.  I remember Billie Holiday, 'I Cover the Waterfront'?  I can remember hearing some of the fellows playing that, and I would be walking the beach and would see the fishermen out there; they fished with these nets.  They'd have these nets in the boats, and they'd take 'em out and drop 'em, and then pull them in full of fish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it remind me now, when I read the Bible about Pete [Peter] and his brother Andrew fishing, and Christ comes along and, and tells 'em to follow him?  I think about the Philippines when I used to see those fellows dropping those nets to pull those fish in.  They would be full, too.  But that's the way they made their living.
Story_ID: 495342
Speaker 1: What were race relations like in the [U.S.] Army when you were in the Army, just before the desegregation of it?
Speaker 2: It was--you know where--you'd go to town, and, in this case it was in North Texas where I took my basic training, Sheppard Field, Texas [Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita County, Texas]--rigidly segregated.  Columbus--Columbus, Georgia was rigidly segregated, and on the base you had segregation.  You had white clubs, I mean, white recreation rooms, you had black recreation rooms.  And the black companies or the white companies, they were separate, and you didn't cross the line.  You stayed with yours; that's the way it was when I was there, and that's what President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was still that way in the Philippines when you were there, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Separate. Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Very definitely separate.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. When you were getting ready to come back, I mean you knew you were going right back home, right, to, to Florida?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think about that now.  I was glad to get back to Dunnellon [Florida], boy.  But I remember coming back, landing in San Francisco [California], and then having to catch a train, which was the Northern Pacific [Northern Pacific Railway], back home, back east, and we went through Sacramento [California].  And having grown up in an environment that was totally segregated, it was quite liberating to get in Sacramento and see in a restaurant with white tablecloths, too, and I would, I would go in there; had never done it before.  That was my first experience with an inte- integrated situation was in Sacramento, California.
Speaker 1: So you say you were about nineteen years old then, twenty (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Almost, coming out of the Army, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 495343
Speaker 1: Let's fast forward to--we, we already talked about s- going back to high school, and when you were ready to graduate from high school, now how did you end up at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  How did that happen?  How did you end up going to Morehouse?
Speaker 2: A friend and I were talking one Sunday.  He was in high school, but his mother had sent him to a better high school out of town, and we were talking about college, and I even--after we talked, I applied to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] and got a catalog, and they had in there that you had to know Latin and Greek, and I hardly could spell Latin, and had no idea what it was (laughter), and I knew that was not something.  I had never heard of that.  But we talking about Morehouse, and I told Mr. Simpson [ph.] about what I--and he knew a dentist in Ocala [Florida], which was a small town, who was a Morehouse alumnus, and he gave me a, a viewable magazine called, The Alumnus from Morehouse, and I start thumbing through that, saw the pictures and was impressed with what I saw, decided that that's where I wanted to go, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have any difficulty getting the financial resources together?  Could you--
Speaker 2: No, because you see, I was a veteran, and Morehouse was as glad to see me as I was to see them because that was assured income.
Speaker 1: Guaranteed tuition, yeah--
Speaker 2: Right, which most (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) through the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], right?
Speaker 2: Right, which most students didn't have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had the G.I. Bill, and that got me through Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Otherwise, I never would have gotten to college.
Story_ID: 495344
Speaker 1: So Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], okay.  Here were are, 1949?  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Forty-eight [1948] to '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1948.  Okay.  So, what--was Morehouse a culture shock for you?
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How so?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd never heard of calculus; I'd never heard of psychology, never heard of the word orientation, and all of these things, man, first--freshman orientation.
Speaker 1: You didn't know what that was (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Hadn't the slightest idea what that was (laughter).  So I was in a, in a daze therefor.  Orientation was almost over, man, before I knew what (laughter), before I knew what it was.  But you ended up--but I ended getting my, a class schedule, and I remember getting English composition which I knew nothing about, but I fortunately had a dedicated teacher name Juanita Toomer.  She was--Miss Toomer was determined that everybody was gonna learn how to write.
Speaker 1: Now, was she related to the famous author Jean Toomer?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, but I really don't know.  But she--I remember the end of that first semester.  You know, teachers in those days, they sign your class card, and I remember going into the Trevor Arnett [Trevor Arnett Library, Atlanta, Georgia] there to register for the next course.  Miss Toomer looked at me and said, "Mr. Churchwell [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], you didn't."  She said, "But I have great hopes for you. I'm gonna pass you."  So I got out of that English composition class because she gave me a grade and let me go and with, with the understanding that I was going to do better, and--didn't do much better, but I did enough to know that what I didn't know, and then when I graduated, I was a little better off because I didn't know things, and I knew I didn't know them.  And I ran into another outstanding lady, Dr. Virginia Lacy Jones, who was dean of the library school and got me in library.  She saw some of my first writing and told me, "Mr. Churchwell, how did you get out of Morehouse?"  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 495345
Speaker 1: Now, let me go--I don't want to take you too far too fast, but we'll go back to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] for a minute.  You got a--you must have a story about Dr. Benjamin Mays.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Dr. Mays was something else, man (laughter).  He was great impression, and you went to chapel every day, and he would be--often be the speaker and, and he would say, "You're already behind.  You've been behind a hundred years, segregated--this country is not gonna be segregated always.  Segregation is going to end, and you're gonna have responsibilities, and you need to prepare yourself for it."  And he said, "You can't prepare yourself in that rec room."   He say, "I go in the rec room in the morning, you're in there playing games.  I go in the rec room in the afternoon, at noon, you're in there playing games," and he said, "Now, those boys over there at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] they aren't in any rec room and they're already ahead."  Say, "You haven't got sense enough to engage in recreation."  Said, "I'm gonna close that down; you have to stop spending time in that recreation room, and don't start praying when it comes to examination time because God doesn't answer those kind of prayers.  You need to pray every morning you--when you're going to class; that's when you need to pray."  And he would lay it on the line and, and those teachers followed him out.  And we had a chemistry teacher--have you ever heard of McBay [Henry Cecil McBay]?
Speaker 1: No, but that was your chemistry teacher?
Speaker 2: That was the chemistry teacher, and that's--and the kids would tell you, "That's her [Churchwell's wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] cousin" (laughter).  He was the one who flunked me, and I went home determined to pass it.  But he, he would flunk--everybody decided McBay was just crazy (laughter).  Because he would flunk--it wasn't unusual for him to flunk 80 percent of his class in general chemistry, and, and he said, later, when I got to know him, he said one of the thing he appreciated about Dr. Mays, he never said anything to him about the number of students he failed, he said, because he had some colleagues at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] where if a, if a professor failed 80 percent of the class, president would call him in and let him know, "Look, those boys are paying tuition.  You gotta--can't send that many students home."  But Dr. Mays never said anything to him about that, and he was sending 'em home going and coming, and Mays supported him all the way.
Story_ID: 495346
Speaker 1: So Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] would never let up, and he would, would talk about us like animals if he found us submitting ourselves to any segregation.  At those times, the Fox Theatre was the theater in Atlanta [Georgia], and all the first-rate movies came to the fox, but you had to go upstairs, blacks did, and Dr. Mays would come in sometimes and say, "I understand that some of you men have been degrading yourselves by going down to the Fox, going up to that roost."  He said, "Now, you should never degrade yourself that way.  Stay out of the Fox."  He said, "You should never go up, subject yourself to that kind of indignity."  He said, "If Jesus Christ came to Atlanta tomorrow and the only place he appeared was in the Fox, I'm afraid I'd have to miss seeing him" (laughter).  "If I had to go up there, I'd, I'd have to not see him."  And he'd come in and he said, "You just shouldn't do that."  And in those days, if you traveled Pullman [Pullman Palace Car Company], and you went to the dining room, they would pull--you would go in the dining room and they would pull a black curtain in front of you, and he, of course, traveled Pullman, and he would tell us about how humiliating that was.  But he said he wouldn't, he would not eat; he'd get up and walk away when they pulled that curtain; he'd get up and walk out.  And he said what the segregationists didn't know, that he was walking out because of that indignity, and he was going to a better meal at a cheaper price than anything they served.  He said, "Because the, the dining car waiters respected me for that, and I had more food than I could eat, because I'd go to my room and they'd feed me in there like a king" (laughter).  But his point was never subject yourself to indignity of segregation, but he would hammer home, "It's not going to last.  It's gonna go, and you be ready to walk through the door when it goes."  And that's what he--over and over again.  And he did that, and it, as I tell young people, when I was at--on campuses, that I took that advice seriously, and it worked for me, because I distinctly remember when I got my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I was the first one to walk through the door when the schools were integrated in the South at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas].  That's because of what Dr. Mays had said--I took it seriously, and a lot of other students took it seriously, 'cause many of the kids--many of the leaders today went through that same mill with Dr. Mays, because he was determined to turn out leaders, and many of 'em took it seriously.
Story_ID: 495347
Speaker 1: Now, who, who were some of the other students that were with you?  Off-camera we were talking about Babatunde Olatunji or Michael Olatunji.
Speaker 2: You remember when Foster [Henry Foster, Jr.] was recommended for the surgeon, U.S. surgeon [surgeon general], and he was turned down because he had engaged--had advised a young lady to have an abortion?  Foster was in our class; he was one of our classmates.  The head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Pasadena, California], Jimmy King [James King, Jr.], was a black kid from Columbus [Georgia] high school, one of McBay's [Henry Cecil McBay] students.  Chief of surgery at Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] for a long time was Robert Simmons.  He was a, a schoolmate, one of those who caused a lot of us to get bad grades because--run the curve up, but he was chief of surgery there for a long time at Howard.  Jimmy King was at Jet Propulsion; Charles Meredith [Charles W. Meredith] was at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and came back and was the first chancellor at Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], and all of those were students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What's that black actor name?  I can't think of his name now.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: He was expelled; 'course Mike Lee [sic.] came after me.
Speaker 1: A black actor?  He was--he was expelled from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: You say a black actor who was expelled from Morehouse--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was in class with you?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't; he was after me.
Speaker 1: Oh, after you, okay.  I'm talking about the ones that were in there with you--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --but, yeah.
Speaker 2: Mike Lee's father Bill Lee was in school with me.
Speaker 1: Oh, Spike Lee's father.
Speaker 2: Spike Lee's father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Bill Lee was his father; he was in school with me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, he was a musician, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, very, very good musician--Bill Lee, yeah.
Speaker 2: William Lee, but we called him, of course, Bill.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 495348
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] you want to tell us before we graduate you and send you to graduate school?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from Morehouse you want to tell us before we talk about graduate school?
Speaker 2: There was one fellow name Ramsey [ph.] who--big eater; he ate, would go around the dining hall; anything anybody didn't eat he would--on their tray, he'd eat it; he was a scavenger.
Speaker 1: He would eat at the plate--out of the plate where the person--
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was just, he was just a big eater; he was hungry.  And he--it was true that when you go through the line, if you were a fraternity brother you got extra helpings.  Well, Ramsey went to the dean, Dean Brazeal [Brailsford Reese Brazeal], and told Dean Brazeal, said, "There's unfairness here, dean, in this college."  Said, he said, "What do you mean, Mr. Ramsey?"  He said, "Some students get more food than others, and they get larger helpings than others, and I'm tired of it, and I don't get enough to eat."  Said, "Some students in a clique they get it."  And Dean Brazeal said, "Well, now, Mr., Mr. Ramsey, we can't have that; we gotta break that up."  And he say, "No, no, Dean, don't break it up" (laughter), "I want to get in it" (laughter), now that's the truth.  "No, no, Dean, don't break it up; get me in it."  And everybody stopped calling him Ramsey and start telling him, "Get me in it."  But he was good; he was--at--in those days, Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] to reduce cost, the presidents agreed to reduce dupe- duplication of courses, I mean, duplication of faculty, so Morehouse agreed to hire the chemistry professors, and Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] agreed to hire physics professors, so if a Morehouse student needed physics, he would take it at Clark, and if a Clark student needed chemistry, would take it at Morehouse, and that way you could always get the courses you needed.  Ramsey was not only a big eater, he also had a great mind, and you could only take fifteen hours.  If you took more than that, then you had to pay extra tuition.  Ramsey always took more, but he would take one at Clark; if he gets his fifteen at Morehouse, he would then go to Clark and get a course and not tell them that he was registered with fifteen at Morehouse, or vice versa.  And he'd make those classes but he would skip one and go to the other, but he could skip classes, but he was good enough to do that, but he also would graduate with double major if he did it that way, which enhanced his possibilities at getting a job.  But Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] didn't know anything about that because if it had, been bad trouble.
Story_ID: 495349
Speaker 1: Now, you, you graduated with a major in, in what?
Speaker 2: Math.
Speaker 1: Math, okay.  And--now were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Barely, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now, for somebody who didn't know what calculus was in high school, how did you take the math so easily?
Speaker 2: Because when--we taught good arithmetic in, in my school, and I didn't have sense enough to know that arithmetic is arithmetic.  And then--but by time I got to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I--as I went through this orientation period, I signed up for courses I didn't know anything about, and by the time I got to my sophomore year, I was more knowledgeable and I could study to, to pass a course in calculus one, but that's 'bout it.  That's what happened.  I didn't--courses I should have taken my freshman year, I didn't take until I got to my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: But you, you said you had a solid foundation in math from high school, so you were able to--
Speaker 2: Well, arithmetic, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, arithmetic.  But you were able to catch on pretty fast, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's about it.
Story_ID: 495350
Speaker 1: So now, what were you gonna do with this degree when you graduated?  I mean--now you're on the verge of graduation.  What, what were you gonna do next?
Speaker 2: Teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Teach math?
Speaker 2: No, just be a school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't sign up for practice teaching like you're supposed to, so when I graduated, I didn't have a teacher certificate, but I had a job in the laboratory, in the chemistry lab.  And the work I had to do was go to the library and check the literature citations, and when I would go to the library to look up chemical abstracts and biological abstracts, it kept me in the library a lot.  Dr. Jones [Virginia Lacy Jones], the dean of the library school, which was located in the library [Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta, Georgia], saw me in the library so often, and contact me one day.  I was over checking the citation for my boss in the chemistry lab, and she asked me have I--had I ever thought about becoming a librarian.  I told her, no, ma'am.  I didn't know what that was.  And she gave me a cram course and said, "Now, we have a course for beginning students and, and seniors in college can take that first course because it's a core course all library students have to take." Said, "If you're interested, you can take it your senior year, and if you pass it, then you'll be eligible to enroll in library school the next year."  And she say, "If you get that far, I might be able to help you get a scholarship."  So I took her advice and took the core course my senior year at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I passed it, and then she admitted me to the class in library school.  And I told her, after I graduated from Morehouse, I didn't have a job and I didn't know if I could come back to school.  She said, "Well, if you want to come, I'll find you a summer job."  So she found me a, a job in, in--at Alabama State College [Alabama State College for Negroes; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] in the library as a reference assistant, and told me, "Now, after that experience, if you want to enroll in library school, come back and I'll see if I can get you a scholarship."  So, when I spent that year working in Alabama State as a reference assistant in the library--
Speaker 1: And that was the summer, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Summer, okay.
Speaker 2: Summer after graduation.  I then went back and told her I, I wanted to go to library school, so she enrolled me in library school.  Because I had taken that core course my senior year, I only needed four other courses, so I was able to take those.  So, in '53 [1953], I went to library school that year on a Carnegie scholarship that she got me.  Otherwise, I couldn't have gone--on a Carnegie scholarship, and went the full year.  The scholarship paid the tuition, not room and board, so she intercede for me again, I then got a job in the dining hall in the dormitory; that paid for my room.  I worked at the steam table and washed dishes, and went through library school and came out in '53 [1953].  She got me my first job at Prairie View A&M College [Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas].  The best thing that happened to me there, that's where I met her (points) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay now, when you graduated in '53 [1953], you had a, a master's degree in--
Speaker 2: In library science (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Library science, okay, masters of science in library.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to Prairie View and you, you met your wife [Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] at Prairie View.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You met your wife at Prairie View.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about that.  How did you meet her and what happened?
Speaker 2: She was in one of my classes, a pretty good student.
Story_ID: 495351
Speaker 1: After we [Churchwell and Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] got married, I just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, wait a minute, though.  I just wanted to ask.  Now, did you have a long courtship?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No?  Okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So you knew this was the one for you, and she did too?
Speaker 1: She didn't have much of a choice (laughter).  Well, choices she had were losers (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I had been--see, I was thirty and--I was thirty years old by now, so I had just about made up my mind about what I wanted, and what I didn't want.  And she came along at the right time, and I was impressed with her.  So after we got married, I decided I didn't want to continue to teach library science; I wanted to be a university librarian.
Speaker 2: Now, now, why?  What's the difference?  I mean--well, I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the difference is, is that being a university librarian, I'm responsible for being sure that the institution and the students get the information they need to, to pass their courses.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, is there a difference in terms of pay and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, much different, a great difference.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In my case, it was a big difference, and I wanted to be a university librarian and so to do that, if you had a Ph.D. degree, the sky's the limit.  So we decided I should go back--go to the--go to graduate school and get a Ph.D. degree.  I applied to the schools and the, the one that I got in was the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and looking at the tuition (cough), it looked like we could afford that because I used up all of my G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] as an undergraduate [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]; I had no more G.I. Bill.  So we agreed that she would work, and I would go to grad school.  She'd be the breadwinner, and that I would go to Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] alone for the first semester and see if I could hack it, and at the same time look for housing for, for her to join me.  That is our plan, but I got to Champaign-Urbana--segregated city, discriminatory, would not rent; I could not find housing for the two of us that first semester.  So I passed my courses in grad school the first semester, but I couldn't find housing.  And we decided that we didn't want to go through that again with me one place and she one place.  So I withdrew from library school after the first semester and went back to Texas where she was, and we had to come up with a different plan.
Story_ID: 495352
Speaker 1: When I was in library school, the New York Public Library [New York, New York] tried to recruit me for its staff.  When she [Churchwell's wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] was in library school, they tried to recruit her, too.  We both had that recruitment material, and we went through it and we said, "Why don't we call New York Public and see if they're still interested in us?"  This is '59 [1959], I think, now.  And we did, and they said, yes, they'd still be interested in us, so we decided that I would withdraw from library school, because we didn't have housing, and go to New York [New York] and work, then save enough money, and then we'd come back to library school.  And we had the housing problem again, but I have a sister [Juanita Churchwell Hunter] now who's still living in Newark [New Jersey] who has her own house, and so we decided that I would go stay with her and get situated with New York Public with the job and look for housing.  So that's what I did.  We went--I went to Newark and lived with my sister and commuted from Newark to New York every day, and looked for housing, and when I found housing, contacted her and told her to come on up, I had housing; so she then came on up to New York.  We both worked in the New York Public Library system, didn't save much money, but we did a lot of other things in New York--first-run plays, and learned about the city.  She's a, a, a movie buff, so we saw a lot of movies and didn't save much money, certainly didn't save enough to get back in school, but since I was a reference librarian, a notice came across my desk where it stated that the state of New York higher education board was setting up a, a, a, a fund to support citizens who wanted to go get--students who wanted to get their Ph.D. degree.  They would underwrite it at a, a low rate, and the student would repay it after it gets a degree, so we decided that's the route we ought to take, so I applied and was approved for a New York State higher education loan.  This was in 1960, I think it was.  We got the loan, and then wrote the dean of the library school and told him why I had withdrawn--we couldn't find housing because it was--they wouldn't rent to blacks, and I asked him to help us get housing.  He wrote us back and told us that he had investigated and had found us housing in graduate student housing, and that I should return to school.  So we went back to University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] and we lived in graduate student housing; she got a job.
Story_ID: 495353
Speaker 1: She [Churchwell's wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] was also pregnant and had a miscarriage (laughter).  I was laughing, because she got pregnant again after the miscarriage, and that's the daughter, our older daughter now.  I came home from school [at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] one evening and she was saying that she wasn't feeling well, that she had a stomachache and she had tried to make an apple pie but it didn't turn out well (laughter).  I'm chuckling, because it turned out when we got to her obstetrician, she'd lab- had labor pains all afternoon, and she called it a stomachache (laughter).  And it turned out that it, it was born pre- very prematurely, and the doctor had prepared her for it and she was put in a incubator and stayed there for several days.  And then the State of Illinois has a, a premature center in Springfield [Illinois], and doctor got Linda [Linda Churchwell Varga] in there, and she stayed for several weeks until they were sure she could survive on her own.  Then she came home, and same time, I'm still in school and she had to stay home with the baby, so I got a job, part-time job.
Story_ID: 495354
Speaker 1: Still working on a Ph.D. degree, finished all my course work, time to write the dissertation, went to work on that.  Had a hard time passing my preliminary examination because, as it often happens, there's one professor in there who didn't like the color of my eyes, but--and wouldn't pass me, and I took it to the dean, and the dean examined the case and decided the professor was wrong, that I should be passed, and I did.
Speaker 2: Now, now, what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 1: The history of library education--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --from 19--from 1919 to 1939.  And again, I had a problem because the dean of the school didn't like historical studies; he wanted a statistical study and I didn't.  Again, the--I went to Dean Downs [Robert M. Downs], and he examined my proposal and approved it, and I wrote it and he approved that.  Then I was up for graduation, and I graduated and applied for a job at Ohio State University [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  I didn't get it, and I thought it was unfair because I thought I was really qualified for it.
Speaker 2: And--just one second though, before we leave the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  Now, you were--when you were there--before we started, I was asking you if you knew Dee Brown, the author.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you have any reflections about him, the author of 'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'?  He was a librarian (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was a very good librarian in the agriculture library, and very good, and was very instrumental in doing what the dean wanted him to do.  Wanted--he wanted librarians to do more writing, and Dee fitted that mode.  He was a low-keyed fellow but very business-like, and did his work and did his research and his writing at the same time.
Story_ID: 495355
Speaker 1: Well, the reason I got on that was that I got this job and graduated, and I didn't get the job at the white school I had applied to, Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], very disappointed.  Same time applied to Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University] in Baltimore [Maryland], and--Central State [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], it was called at that time, in North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Was North Carolina Central?
Speaker 1: That's what it is now.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.
Speaker 1: And Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]; all three of those were interested in me.  And while I was beginning to negotiate with all three of them, a fellow who, a white fellow, who was a schoolmate of mine there at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] graduated ahead of me, and became director of libraries at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] and--his name was Ed Holley [Edward G. Holley], and I went to an ALA meeting--we were talking about ALA earlier.
Speaker 2: That's American Library Association.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It met in New Orleans [Louisiana] and I went and was staying at the Roosevelt Hotel [The Roosevelt New Orleans], and one evening I was walking down the hallway and--Ed and I had knew--had known each other at the University of Illinois, and as I was walking down the hall he stopped me, he said, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], what are you gonna do next year?"  He knew I had gotten my degree.  I told him I was gonna apply for a job.  He said, "Look, we're going to have an opening at the University of Houston."  Said, "I sure would like to have you to apply."  Now, this is the old boy system working.  And so I went back to uni- went back home and got a letter from Ed saying, "I want to make formal the suggestion I made to you informally at the Roosevelt hotel, and we'd like to have an application from you."  So I sent in an application applying for the job, and I got it.  So when I graduated from University of Illinois, the University of Houston was just integrating its student body, as were some other southerner schools.
Speaker 2: So this is 1967, right?
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: So I joined the University of Houston as the first black faculty member as assistant librarian.  It was a good move but a stressful one.  That's when the doctor first diagnosed my high blood pressure.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: But after two years there, I decided I wanted to direct a library myself.
Story_ID: 495356
Speaker 1: Oh, the one--let me back up there 'cause I missed an important point.  Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], Central State [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], and Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] wanted me, and Houston [University of Houston, Houston, Texas] had offered, Ed [Edward G. Holley] had offered me this job.  So I was frustrated about not going to the black schools [HBCUs] because I had this whole history of helping others, especially other blacks, and so I felt that I should go to a black school.  I went to the dean who'd helped me before, and told him what my dilemma was, and he asked me, he said, "Now, do you know A.P. Marshall?"  I said "Yes."  Now, A.P. was a very prominent black librarian at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri] and had been there for a number of years, very prominent in, in the American Library Association; I knew him well.  So, Dean Down [Robert M. Downs] asked me if I knew A.P. Marshall, I told him, "Yes."  He said, "Well, A.P. has been at Lincoln, the black school, for a number of years, and been trying to get out."  Said, "But no white school will accept him, will not invite him for an interview."  Say, "I've written several recommendations for him, but they simply will not invite him.  They invite in less-qualified white candidates."  He said, "I don't know," he said, "it's just a fact a life; they will not invite a black librarian from--."  Said, "White schools will not invite a black librarian from a black school."  He said, "It's wrong, all of that," he said, "but it--that's the way it is."  He said, "Now, you got a chance to go with Ed Holley down in Houston [Texas], or you can go to Morgan, Tuskegee and Central, and get in the same predicament that A.P. is in."  Said, "But if you're gonna be happy and--."  Say, "But what's your ultimate goal?"  I said, "I want to direct an ARL library."  There were no black ARL libraries.
Speaker 2: So, what do you mean by ARL?
Speaker 1: That's the biggest library, the biggest university libraries.
Speaker 2: What does that--what is ARL (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That would mean the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]--those are the Association of Research Libraries.  But the small libraries aren't in that group; I didn't want a small library, I wanted the big ones.  He said, "Now, if that's your goal, you better not go to Tuskegee, you better not go to any of those black schools because you're gonna be blackballed the same way A.P. is now, and has been for several years."  Said, "My recommendation to you, if you want an ARL library, you go with Ed Holley to Houston."  And that's what I did.  I stayed there two years, decided I wanted my own--direct my own library, and the position at Miami University [Oxford, Ohio] became available; I applied, and I got it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, now--
Story_ID: 495357
Speaker 1: I just want to pause a second here and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There--now, you were there--you were in Houston [University of Houston, Houston, Texas] in 1968?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there '67 [1967], '68 [1968], and I left in '69 [1969], didn't we [Churchwell and his wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell]?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was there when Dr. King was assassinated--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there was turmoil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ed Holley [Edward G. Holley] came to me and said, said, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], what do you recommend?  Look like we're gonna have problems on the campus.  What do you, what do you think we ought to do?"  He said, "There's a question about a closing to avoid the problems."  I say, "I would recommend you stay open and put--."  I had, I had found out that Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] was going to do the eulogy, and I suggested to Ed that, "Keep the university open, but place televisions around the campus so they could see and hear Dr. Mays," 'cause I--you know, he's quite an orator, and I knew he was gonna do an outstanding job, and that people ought to hear it, and if the students heard it, they would be moved and that would probably take the sting out of whatever unhappiness was brewing.  So, the university took that suggestion and set up TVs throughout the student union, several locations, so all--and kept all--dismissed all the classes so they could--while the eulogy--funeral was going on, so students could just watch the, the, the funeral, and that's what happened.  And the students were extremely impressed with what Dr. Mays had to say, and there was no problem at the university.  But, as you know, all hell broke loose in Newark [New Jersey] and some other places.
Story_ID: 495358
Speaker 1: Shortly after that, the Miami position became available, and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is Miami University in Oxford, Ohio?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I applied for that one and I got it and--
Speaker 2: Now, what position was that?  What was the title?
Speaker 1: The head librarian, head librarian.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Director of the libraries.
Speaker 2: Now, that's one of the venerable universities in Ohio.  Probably the oldest--
Speaker 1: You're right.  Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --the oldest one; the--called the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] of the West, at one time they called it--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they (laughter), but it was highly regarded.
Speaker 2: --back in the 19th century, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: It was highly regarded, no question about that.  It did--and did operate like a lot of private schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So we, the president [Phillip R. Shriver] and I, agreed on salary, and I agreed to go.  And then she [Churchwell's wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] and I was talking and I told her, I say, "Look, I forgot an important thing."  She went, "What was that?"  I say, "I agreed for that salary," I say, "but I forgot to negotiate moving expenses" (laughter).  She said, "Now, look, you can't go back, you've already agreed."  I say, "But I'm gonna go back and tell him the truth, and tell him I forgot my moving expenses.  I need to re-open the negotiations."  And I did, and he agreed to the salary plus moving expenses.  No, moving expenses and housing, that's what it was, because we had to sell our house in Houston [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I couldn't wait until we sold it.  So I needed housing at Miami until we sold our house.  So I went back, negotiated moving expenses, housing, until we sold our house in Houston, and we agreed.  So we called the movers.  She did her own packing, but we got to move and we got a house on campus, close enough for me to walk to my office, and the rest is history.  And we, we always agreed that we'd never make a lot of money, so there wouldn't be any legacy, financial legacy for the girls, so we agreed to give them the very best education we could, and they would be on their own.  So when we got to Miami, the best school for children was McGuffey Laboratory School [William Holmes McGuffey Laboratory School, Oxford, Ohio], and I negotiated getting Linda [Lina Churchwell Varga] in McGuffey so she didn't have to go through the public school system which was not that good.  So Linda went to McGuffey, which was the best school in town, elementary school.
Story_ID: 495359
Speaker 1: And then we went to--after--how long was it, five years?  Well, whatever it was, when we left Miami [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think '74 [1974], you went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], okay.  So, how did that cone about?  I mean why did you leave Miami?  Was it a, was it a better offer at Brown?  Is that what it was, or--
Speaker 1: Better offer and a little disagreement I had with my supervisor.
Speaker 2: Now, who did you report to?
Speaker 1: The provost.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, the '65 [1965] equal opportunity act took into consideration that higher education often--there was often spouses involved when faculty members moved.  And because of the nepotism rules, both could not be hired unless they were in different departments.  Now, she [Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] was a librarian in one of the branch campuses at Hamilton [Ohio], and I was the director of libraries at the main campus, but the rule says, "As long as the spouse does not report directly to each other, there is no problem."  Well, she was on a branch campus, which I was administratively responsible for, but she was not reporting directly to me; she reported to the librarian in Hamilton.  My supervisor didn't interpret it that way, and I told him that that's the way the law reads, he wouldn't interpret it that way, and told me that she would have to quit her job, or either I would have to.  And I said, "She is not gonna quit her job," I said, "but--and because there's no reason she should."  While we were arguing over that, I had a friend who was--Bob Wedgeworth [Robert Wedgeworth], who told me that the Brown position was coming up, and I had a friend there at Miami, a white friend, who knew the assistant to the president at Brown, Kelsey Murdock, and he told Kelsey that I may be available to move from Miami because of the conflict I had.  So Kelsey told the people at Brown about that, and they sent me a letter and asked me if I wanted to apply, and Bob told me--my Wedgeworth friend told me, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], Brown's a good slot--you ought to go for it."  So I did, and at the same time I did that, the American Library Association recommended me as a possible candidate for the position of librarian of Congress.  I wasn't enthusiastic about that, so I didn't pay it much attention; I went on to Brown.
Speaker 2: This is 1974, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 495360
Speaker 1: --Went to Providence [Rhode Island].  Unfortunately, Providence has a very poor public school system.  It's very unfortunate because it's a Catch-22 situation.  It has very good private elementary schools, and as long as those private elementary schools exist, people who can support the public school system are siphoned off, so we, like most parents, didn't want to risk sending our children, two girls, to the public school system.  We shopped around there, and looked at the two private schools for girls and chose the one called Lincoln School for girls [Providence, Rhode Island], which we couldn't afford, yet felt, to carry out our major scheme, was giving them the best education we could.  We talked with the people at Lincoln, and they said, "Well, your predicament is not unique; we have several parents who can't pay the tuition, but we have an arrangement with the--a company in New Hampshire, which will pay the tuition when due, and you pay--repay it over time."  So we took that approach and put both up in the--in Lincoln School for girls, and have not regretted it because they got a superb education.  But mostly, it was like Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]: it's an attitudinal thing.  You train 'em with certain attitudes toward things, study habits, responsibility--all of those things were engrained.  We never had to wake them up for school--to get up to go to school; never had that problem.  Never had the problem of homework because they gave 'em homework, and they were expected to do it, and they did it.  In that respect, we never--the other thing we said to them, that, "You make up your own mind, you make your own decisions.  We're never gonna dictate to you what you should do, but if you make a decision, as long as it's not illegal or immoral, we will support it, but you have to make up your mind."  We, we taught them that and, and I was the first one to get, get it in the neck.  One winter in Providence, it was horrible cold.  It was a cold, long winter.  And I had a brother living in Fort Myers, Florida, and so I called him that winter and he said, "Come on down here, man, the sunshine is pretty, it's great."  So I told Yvonne [Yvonne Ransom Churchwell], I said, "We ought to go spend the, the break, the Christmas break, when they get out of school, in Fort Myers."  She agreed, and when they came home from school, we were at the dinner table.  I'm sitting at the dinner table and I say, "Well, when you all get out of school for the break, we're going to go down to Fort Myers and spend the break there."  The little one, Cynthia [Cynthia Churchwell], looked at me, wanted to know, "Who gave you the right to make that decision?"  (Laughter)  I was speechless for a moment then, so all I could say is, "I made it because I'm the biggest."  That's all I could say (laughter).  Talking about I should have brought her to the table to discuss it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, what happened?  Did you go, or did you--
Speaker 1: We talked it over--we went--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --and it was beautiful down there, walking the beach, and left all that ice and snow in Providence.  But the point is, is that that's the way we raised the two of them.
Story_ID: 495361
Speaker 1: When they chose their husbands--one--I was talking with their husbands; both of 'em are white, and so I was talking with Brian [Brian Varga] one day and, and I had been somewhere talking to some of my friends at church, and I came back, Brian was, was sitting out there on the deck and he said, "What did y'all talk about at lunch today, Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell]?"  I say, "Well, we shared war stories about living in the South with dignity."  And he said, "Well, when you do that," say, "well, what do you tell your white--your, your black friends when they find out that your girls married white guys?"  I said, "If I--if they raise the question, I tell them we told them to make their own decisions, and we told them we're gonna back them if it was not immoral or illegal."  And he looked at me (laughter), he say, "I, I know what that is."  He said, "I know about that 'cause I been on the tail end of those decisions, so she makes up her own mind; there's nothing I can do" (laughter).  You [Churchwell's wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] didn't know Brian and I had that talk, did you?
Speaker 2: That's your son-in-law, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He died of cancer--how many years ago?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Two.
Speaker 1: Two?  Two years ago.

Speaker 1: Now you were at Princeton from, from '74 [1974] to '78 [1978], and--
Speaker 2: At Providence--Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island]--
Speaker 1: I mean at Brown, yeah, in Providence, yeah--Providence, Rhode Island.
Speaker 2: How long was I at Brown, four years?  Now, you see (laughter), I'd a still been at Brown if I'd a--been left up to me 'cause I was having a great time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what happened, what happened that you left Brown?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I--Yvonne [Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] is a very friendly person, but New Englanders are not that friendly; they are very closed that way, and she speaks to everybody.  And at the store--if she goes to the store two times, when she gets to the cash register, she will strike up a conversation with checkout, but the people at Brown didn't--Brown--I mean at--and Providence didn't respond to that type of friendliness, and that got to her, man.  And one day it really got to her, and she was coming home from the store--I guess she coming from the store, and somebody ran a stop sign and hit her.  Boy, she got home and she was fit to be tied.  Oh, she wanted out, and she kept at it until the girls [Linda Churchwell Varga and Cynthia Churchwell] picked up on it and decided they didn't like it either.  And I had a friend who was at Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] call me and told me, he said, "We got a vacancy at Washington Univer- they need a new librarian and I told 'em about you, and they're gonna send two faculty members up there to interview you."  He say, "Now, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], I know you."  Say, "Now, don't turn 'em down cold; at least hear what they got to say."  So, the two faculty members they came up from Washington University to Brown, and came to my office and looked around.  And the Rockefeller Library [John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library] at Brown [Providence, Rhode Island], it is a beautiful facility.  They came in and looked around and became--took an inferior attitude and became very intimidated with what they saw, and they were not a good salesperson for Washington University, and so I didn't take 'em very seriously.
Story_ID: 495363
Speaker 1: I didn't tell her [Churchwell's wife, Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] anything about it (laughter), because I knew she wanted out.  But unfortunately, for me, she had a, a, a, a childhood friend who's--who, who was living here in St. Louis [Missouri], and her husband worked for, at that time, AT&T [Southwestern Bell Telephone Company; AT&T Inc.], and she had unlimited telephone privileges.  And somehow--I don't know how she find out that those men had to come up to interview me about Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], and I had--didn't say anything about it.  And this friend found out about it and called and was telling her about it, and she found out that I didn't say anything about it to her (laughter), and boy, she got teed off and told me that I should have shared that with her because I didn't want to--didn't want to leave Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island].  She was right about that.  And we discussed it heatedly, and then I made a mistake of saying, "Okay, I will leave Brown and go to Washington University or, or anyplace, as long as it is not a step down.  As long as a--if it's horizontal move on up, but not if it's a move down, I'll move."  And so Washington University--these two faculty members went back, and even though they did a poor job, they were impressed, and I got this letter from Washington University saying that they wanted to offer me the job, and so I sat down and wrote up a list of the conditions would take for me to leave Brown.  The first number one was they had, had to be an excellent--no, I had to have university housing equivalent to the university housing I had there at Brown, and I called it physical plan at Brown, and asked 'em to send me a blueprint of the house we were, we were given at Brown.  They sent me the blueprint, so I sent that blueprint to Washington University with the other conditions, and the number one condition is that the house I get had to be comparable to the one I had at Brown, and it must be in a school district that has an excellent elementary school system because we wanted to get out from under that tuition we're paying in Providence [at the Lincoln School, Providence, Rhode Island].  And so I sent my list, long list, and, of course, had to move--sent my long list and--to the provost at Washington University, and they responded, saying, "We have your list and the plans, and we'd like for you and Mrs. Churchwell to be our guests to see what we have to show."  We came down, and they had a beautiful house, and it was comparable, and we came down, and there's some things we didn't like, and there had to be new draperies, so the house had to be redecorated.  And, after we looked at that, it looked like it was a done deal, but it wasn't done for me because we had decorated the house we had in Providence [Rhode Island], and it had cost us a leg and an arm, and we were still paying off that interior decorator.  So, after I got back, I wrote Washington University and told them that I had this debt that I had incurred, and in order to go through with the Washington University situation, I would need a no-interest loan to pay off that debt.  They agreed, so they supplied the loan so we could pay off the indebtedness we had there, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 495364
Speaker 1: So you came to, here to St. Louis [Missouri] to Washington [D.C.].  Now, now, you became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: I mean to Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis] here in St. Louis [Missouri].  You became the, the dean of library services?
Speaker 2: Here at Washington University.
Speaker 1: And you stayed here, what, nine years, I believe, or--
Speaker 2: We stayed here longer than we stayed anyplace; that was primarily because they do have an excellent--we lived in Clayton [Missouri]; that's a suburban city--high rent district, which we weren't paying.  It was a university house.  But they have a superb school system, the best, really, in the area, one of the best in the state.  Many people paid tuition to get their children in the district.  So we stayed here because they [Churchwell's daughters, Linda Churchwell Varga and Cynthia Churchwell] were in school, and we didn't want to move until they got out.  That's why we stayed here longer than we did any other place.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, any, any--anything of--any stories from your stay here at Washington University, from '80 [1980], '70s [1970s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  One of the--when I look at my whole career, one of the things I'm proudest of is what I was able to--the people I was able to help at the library here.  Like many university libraries, they have a large non-professional staff--clerical staff, and here at Washington University, they had a large clerical staff, primarily African American women, but there were no supervisors, because they didn't have the formal qualifications like high school education, and other type of things and--.  But I looked around and I saw there were black women who had been in the department for a number of years; the only thing that was lacking was the formal credentials.  They had demonstrated the human skills, and I made three of them supervisors, and they are still on that staff today.  Two of 'em are ready to retire, but they got excellent benefits and got better retirement as a supervisor.
Story_ID: 495365
Speaker 1: There were no professional librarians on--black, on the Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] staff, no professional librarians.  And by sheer accident one day, I discovered there was a young black man in the copy room.  His name is Rudolph Clay, and I went back to my office and asked the secretary to give me his folder.  She gave me his folder and I discovered that he was a graduate of Washington University, but the only job he could find was that clerical job in that copy room, and I called him up to the office and asked him had he ever thought about becoming a librarian.  He said, "Yes, sir, but I can't afford it."  And he said, "My mother is, my mother is ill and I'm her sole support, so I can't afford it."  And I told him, I say, "But if you could get a scholarship, would you go?"  And he said, "Yes, sir."  I knew the dean of library schools at several schools, University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], and the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I called Russ Bidlack [Russell E. Bidlack] at Michigan and I told him--this was during the era when they were trying to diversify staffs in early--and just couldn't find (air quotes) qualified candidates.  I told Russ, I say, "I've got a young man here who I think would make an excellent librarian, but he can't afford to--the tuition at Michigan, can't afford to come."  And he said, said, "Church [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], if you recommend him, I'll find the money."  And he did.  And so I recommended, so Rudolph went, and today he's now head of reference at Washington University.  And I discovered the same thing existed for a young lady--black young lady who was in the art library as a clerk, and she was a single mother and I talked with her.  She would like to be a librarian but she couldn't afford it because she had a daughter.  Now, Rudolph is now at Michigan, going on through his program.  So I called Russ again, I said, "I've got another case, but I think she'll make a good librarian."  I said, "But she has a daughter."  He said, "Well, we'll see what we can do."  He found one for Cheryl--that was her name, Cheryl Holland, found her in the married student housing, found a (unclear), and we sent her to Michigan.  Today, she's a reference librarian at Washington University.  Those are the things I'm most proud about, as I look back over my career.  Other things I've done--excellent things, like improving the library system, are quite significant.  One of 'em is quite unique, but I--when I think about the people I was able to help, that's the most satisfying.
Story_ID: 495366
Speaker 1: Well, when you think about the--everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could, or change?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--there are some things I would differently.  I would be more patient with people and, and supervisors I had who made bad decisions.  I would spend more time trying to convince them.  For example, just as I left Miami [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio] because of my dispute with my supervisor, I left Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] for the same reason.  But I would--if I did that one again, I'd do it over.  There's an old saying, "It's more important to do the right thing than to do a thing right."  And when I left Washington University that was applicable to my situation.  I don't believe in going around your supervisor to talk to a higher person, and that is what I should have done at Washington University when I was having difficulty with my supervisor.  I should have gone around him and gone directly to the chancellor because if the chancellor had been informed about what the heck my supervisor and I were disagreeing with--about, he would not have backed my supervisor to the extent that he did, the extent that was unacceptable to me, so I left.  The reason I feel that Bill Danforth [William H. Danforth], the chancellor, is a very humane person.  If he had known why I was disagreeing with my supervisor, he would have backed me.  What my supervisor didn't know and what Bill didn't know, we had a good agreement with the Special School District in St. Louis [Special School District of St. Louis County].  St. Louis has a school district for slow learners, and they keep them until they feel they can find jobs for them, and we had that--an agreement with them that we would hire graduates of that program.  It's all right to have students to shelve books, but students at Washington University and other good institutions are pretty bright youngsters, and they get bored shelving books.  But from the Special School District, slow learners, they can shelve 'em all week, and we were hiring them to do shelving.  My supervisor thought my staff was too big, and she hired some consultants to come in to analyze my operations.  Consultants came in and confirmed what my supervisor thought--my staff was too big.  Consultants saw these slow learners methodically working, doing the work accurately but very slow, and they concluded that if we got rid of some of those and just brought in some--fewer number but working faster, we'd get the work done.  And so they sent in a recommendation to my supervisor that I was overstaffed, and should be reduced.  They put a number there, I forgot what it was, that number.  And the number they had, the group that it hit most was those slow workers.  And so when that--he came--got that recommendation, he asked me to implement it and I told him, "No."  And I told him why.  He didn't, he didn't buy it; he bought the recommendation.  Now, I'm sure if I had gone to Bill Danforth and told him that they want to cut those particular students, Bill wouldn't have backed him.  But I did the right thing in management; I didn't go around him.
Speaker 1: But you wish you hadn't now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 495367
Speaker 1: Now, you went on to--you went from Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] to Wayne State [Wayne State University] in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went there as professor, a tenured professor at Wayne.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you enjoy working at Wayne (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And probably would have stayed if my wife [Yvonne Ransom Churchwell] hadn't entered the picture.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: She convinced me that I--Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] was having problems, the library school was, and they got in touch with me and asked me to come help them with it, and I didn't want to be bothered with 'em, man, I was doing fine at Wayne.  And Dean Jones [Virginia Lacy Jones], who had got me in the whole field, had for years been trying to get me to come back to Atlanta [Georgia], but I told him the truth, I say I couldn't afford it.  The salaries they were gonna pay was inadequate for the lifestyle and what I wanted for my family.  So I told her I couldn't, couldn't afford to come.  But when they came this time that probably didn't exist.  We'd gotten the girls where they wanted--we wanted them, and we didn't have the problems, and so she hit me over the head with that and told me now, I could go and help them because she'd be glad to stay here until Cynthia [Cynthia Churchwell] got out of high school, and Linda [Linda Churchwell Varga] was with me in--at Wayne State.  So we didn't have that problem, so I acquiesced and I went to Clark Atlanta University.
Story_ID: 495368
Speaker 1: Tell us about the endowment at Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Every university has had problems with advanced technology because of the cost.  When I was at Washington University and we had to automate the library, I made a recommendation, which the chancellor accepted, was that we should not automate unless we have money to continue the cost of operation.  Otherwise, I said, automating would be like telephone service--you just get the instrument.  The telephone company will give you that instrument, because that's gonna what they make their money off; they make their money off the service, same with computer technology.  They don't make their money off the hardware; they make their money off the upkeep and a continued upgrading, so you got to have a way to keep it going.  So I made a recommendation that, "Don't automate unless you have a way to continue to pay for it."  And my staff and I recommended about how much it would take, and I went to my supervisor and he recommended that I go to the vice chancellor for finance and make the proposal to him, and I told him.  He say, "Well, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell], what you need to do is go to Bill Danforth [William H. Danforth] and convince him that you need an endowment, and of that annual interest, you use only half of it annually to pay for the operation annually, and let the other half plow back in so that it will continue to maintain its buying power."  Made that recommendation, so before I left, we set up a $4 million endowment--automation endowment.  Today, that endowment brings in more money than my successor [Shirley K. Baker] is able to spend, so she has doled out money throughout the campus where there's a need, because it's in the 20s now--millions.  It's the only university in the country that has that kind of money for automation, and they have, according to the chancellor, they have the best automated library in America, because it has the money to do it because of that endowment that I recommended.  And it's, it's--you go over there now and look at what the students have in the cafeteria.  Oh, a student can go in and, and computers are available for them; laptops are available for them to do whatever they want to do because of the money they get from that endowment.  Well, the non-human thing--that's the other thing I'm proud of, but the--I'm proudest of the people I was able to help along the way.
Story_ID: 495369
Speaker 1: We didn't have a--any, any story from Detroit [Michigan]?  You were there during the--I think I guess the--Coleman Young was mayor of Detroit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was (laughter).  That Coleman was something else, boy.  He just was not very--he wasn't diplomatic at all, and as a re- unfortunate, too, because the city needed somebody who could work with people because it was gutted from that--
Speaker 1: The riots and stuff, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  That was a unfortunate situation, but I understand now they finally got somebody who can work with the community as a business community.  But I worked up to tenured professorship at Wayne [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan], and apparently I was doing work that they were pleased with because the president, President Adamany [David Adamany], when he heard that I was leaving, he wrote me a letter; I'm sorry I didn't keep that letter.  And he urged me not to leave, asked me to take a leave of absence so I could come back whenever I wanted to, but I didn't, didn't have enough foresight to take advantage of that, so I went on to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where did you live in Detroit when you were living in Detroit?  Did you live in the city (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, again, I used my same approach; I told 'em I--they wanted me to come as a visiting professor, and I agreed I would come if they provided housing in walking distance of my classroom, and they had a university home facility called--apartment called, Chatsworth [Chatsworth Apartments, Detroit, Michigan], so they brought me up and showed me what they could offer, so I had an apartment in walking distance of my office on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the same time Linda [Linda Churchwell Varga] wanted a master degree in--a master of arts degree in teaching, and she wanted to go--I've forgotten; I think it was Temple [Temple University] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and that tuition was horrendous, and I told her, "Look," I said, "Now that's not reasonable."  I said, "You can get a very good M.A.T. right here in St. Louis [Missouri] at the University of Missouri [University of Missouri-St. Louis]."  She said, "No, I don't want that."  So, when I decided to go to Wayne State, I checked their school of education, and they had an M.A.T. program, and after I went up to look at the housing, it was a--I had an opportunity to get a two-bedroom apartment with a kitchen, so I set on a two-bedroom apartment.  I came back and told Linda, I say, "Look," I said, "why don't you come and go with me to Wayne State; let me show it, and you can enroll at Wayne State and get a M.A.T.," and so she agreed to that, and she did go with me and she got an M.A.T. from Wayne--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --while I was there.
Story_ID: 495370
Speaker 1: Now, we'll go to Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] again, yeah.  Now, you were, you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went there as dean of the library school--
Speaker 1: This is 1990, yeah, and you were there--
Speaker 2: --and I was there less than a year when the provost decided to leave, and he recommended to the president that I be appointed his successor.  I didn't want to be the provost, so I told him I'd take it on the interim basis, and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You did that about a year, then--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I had the stroke.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you were there, yeah, as interim provost in '91 [1991] to '95 [1995], right?
Speaker 2: Four [1994].
Speaker 1: Oh, '94 [1994], okay.  And then you had a stroke.  Now, tell us about that.  Now what--just--you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The--I don't know if you are familiar with the book, 'Road Less Taken' by Scott Gregory--Scott Peck [sic. 'The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth,' M. Scott Peck]; he was a practicing psychiatrist, and he said there are two kinds of neurotic people.  One is a person who simply will not take responsibility for anything, and the other one is, is a person who feels responsible for everything; I fell in that last category.  When I was the interim provost, when things went wrong, if I thought I could correct 'em, I just felt obligated to try to correct 'em, and ended up doing three jobs because they--when--they needed doing, and nobody else as doing them.  And in the process, I had a stroke.
Speaker 1: So you think it was the stress?  Just too much stress?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 495371
Speaker 1: We were talking about the aftermath of your stroke.  How long was it before you were able to resume your duties?
Speaker 2: I was in therapy almost a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were no longer interim provost, I think, after--during that period of time, I guess; you had to--
Speaker 2: Yes, for--yes, for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But when you came back to work, you came back as the director of the Robert W. Woodruff Library [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I didn't--after my stroke, I didn't do that anymore.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't?
Speaker 2: I don't think I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I did the dean of the library school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, I was doing three jobs; that was the problem.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: When I came back from my stroke, I stayed dean of the library school--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: --until I retired.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, had the schools merged by then?  Were they Clark Atlanta U [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you were telling me, when I came in, that you were part of the--one of the things that you did was to negotiate the acquisition of the John Henrik Clarke papers for Clark Atlanta U; is that true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: You were telling me, when I came in, that you were part of the--that you were part of the acquisition of the John Henrik Clarke papers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, we, we--it really wasn't a paper; we got it as collection--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --his book collection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what we got, a book collection, and I had created a special room for--that those books were housed in.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I didn't know him before that.
Speaker 1: Now did you--when--now, you're one of the, the--probably the, one of the top black professional librarians in the university system in the country, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: But, for what you're telling me, you didn't really know the people in black studies that well, I guess, right?  Or did you?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) until I got to know Mr. Clarke; that was really my--and then I got to know Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] and Cornel [Cornel West].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, by the time you--well, before you retired you, you pretty much knew the group that--the, the best. I mean the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the better group; I mean the group of--the most noted, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the black studies people, yeah.
Story_ID: 495372
Speaker 1: When you manage a collection like the collection at Clark Atlanta U [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]--I mean are there--what are some of the precautions you have to take to keep the collection intact?  Is that--how--
Speaker 2: The--see, Clark Atlanta University is one of--see, you know, the Atlanta Univ- are you familiar with the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia]?  See, in the, in the early '30s [1930s], President John Hope of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and the president of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Florence Read [Florence M. Read], all agreed that there were certain things they could beneficially have in common; one of 'em was the library.  So they acquired money from--I forgot the name of the foundation but--the foundation that helped a lot of black institutions--to build a library that would serve all of the institutions in Atlan- black institutions in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Was it the Carnegie [Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching] (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not Carnegie; it was Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: Rosenwald Foundation [Julius Rosenwald Fund], right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the secretary of the Rosenwald Foundation was name Trevor Arnett, and he, on behalf of those institutions, was very instrumental in getting the foundation to give the money to build one big library for all of these schools, and in honor of him, they named the library, the Trevor Arnett Library [Atlanta, Georgia].  And that was the library that was in existence when I came to Morehouse, and all of us used that one library: students at Spelman, Morehouse in particular.  Clark had its own small reading room; Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] had its own small reading room; but Morehouse and Spelman and Atlanta University all had the Trevor Arnett Library, and it was that way until sometimes in the late '60s [1960s] or '70s [1970s], that the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] gave a large sum of money to reorganize those schools into what later became known as the Atlanta University Center, Incorporated, and established one administrator over that, called him a chancellor.  Each institution was still independent, but they would operate as a unit because technology with computers was becoming very expensive, and there was supposed to be one computer--
Speaker 1: One computer lab for--
Speaker 2: Yes.  One administrative--it was supposed to be one administrative computer that would handle all registration, all payroll.  It was--that was the way it was supposed to work, and up to a point it did work until that money ran out.  It was a one-time grant; it wasn't continuous.
Speaker 1: Not like the endowment that you established in Washington [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it began to pull apart.  It's now composed of Spelman, Morehouse and Clark Atlanta University, and the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia].  Morris Brown, of course, had closed, so the Atlanta University Center now is really composed of those three s- but they still operate the library--got one big library.
Story_ID: 495373
Speaker 1: Now, we've talked about, I think, most everything, I think.  That--is there anything I haven't discussed that you think we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay, because we talked about the family--we talked about a lot of things.  But the last question is similar to legacy but--when you were talking about your legacy.  How--sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would like to be remembered--if anybody came to Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] and looked at Washington University's library and see how it is--has been expanded physically, I would like for them to remember that that was a recommendation to extend that library underground that was made by Charles Churchwell [HistoryMaker Charles D. Churchwell].  Or if they go to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] and they look at the library system there, and they look at the John Hay Library [Providence, Rhode Island] and see that it has a unique preservation center for the state, I would like for them to remember that it was under Charles Churchwell leadership that that preservation center was set up in the John Hay Library, available to the entire state, or any library that needed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much, sir.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Thank you.
