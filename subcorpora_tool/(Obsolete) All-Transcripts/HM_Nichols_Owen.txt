Story_ID: 196874
Speaker 1: Now, if you would, Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], let's talk a little bit about your mother, starting with her name, where she was born, and how she grew up.
Speaker 2: Her name was Pearl Hockaday when she got married, and she became, of course, Pearl Hockaday Nichols, and she was born in Raleigh, North Carolina and she was more of a child raiser than anything else, because I'm one of ten children, and she was a wonderful, wonderful person.
Speaker 1: And, did your mother ever share any stories with you about how she grew up and what life was like growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, not to a great extent.  There were things that she shared; for instance, there was a time when she was complaining to my father [William Henry Nichols], who was her husband, of course, about not having enough money to buy food for the family, and my father said to her, "There is flour there."  In other words, you take the flour and make some biscuits or some kind of dish, and sure enough, she took the flour and made some dumplings (laughter) and some, in the morning she made some pancakes.  In other words, she had to be very innovative in order to be able to have food for her family on that particular day, and I thought that was wonderful that she was able to do that.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about what life was like for her when she was a little girl?
Speaker 2: Yes, life was very good for her as a little girl.  She dearly loved her mother [Alice Hockaday] and her father; especially her mother.  I never saw my grandfather, my maternal grandfather.  He was deceased before I was born, but her mother lived until I was three years old and it's amazing that I remember so much about my grandmother, yet I was only three years old when she died.
Speaker 1: And, did she ever talk about just like what Raleigh was like when she was a little girl?  Did she ever kind of describe the city and did she grow up on a farm or in the city?
Speaker 2: She grew up in the city and she certainly would talk about segregation and what we as black children could not do and what we had to do in order to be able to get along in the kind of setting that we found in Raleigh, North Carolina.  So, in effect, she was teaching us how to live in the kind of society in which we grew up.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things did she tell you about segregation?
Speaker 2: Well, you go to the store, you better have the money there, otherwise you're gonna get accused of stealing.  You could not go to certain places and when you go to a department store, for instance, you couldn't go to the rest rooms that the white people went to.  There were signs there, black and white, and she said we have to go to the ones that have the black sign on them.  You rode the bus or the train, you couldn't sit where the white people sat.  You had to sit in a certain place because you were black, and this kind of thing she taught us so that we didn't get ourselves in trouble trying to do what we were not supposed to do.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother, Dr. Nichols?
Speaker 2: The most wonderful mother ever.  That's the only description I have.  I don't think anybody's mother could compare as far as I'm concerned, with my mother.
Speaker 1: And, your mother was a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 196875
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father now, Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols].  Would you please share with us his name and where he was born?
Speaker 2: His name was William Henry Nichols, and he too was born in Raleigh, North Carolina; actually, he was born in Garner [North Carolina], which is a small town adjacent to Raleigh.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Garner for us?
Speaker 2: G-A-R-N-E-R, yes.
Speaker 1: And, did he ever share any stories with you about what life was like growing up in Garner?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote a book entitled 'Things My Father Taught Me' [Owen D. Nichols], and that book indicates all kinds of things that I learned as a result of being the son of William Henry Nichols, and there are just so many things there that it would be difficult.  I will share a couple with you.  For instance, he worked for Meredith College [Raleigh, North Carolina], which was at that time, a white woman's college in Raleigh, North Carolina and while I was in elementary school, he would take me to work with him on Saturday morning.  He was a janitor at Meredith College, and he would take me as a little boy.  Now, one of the places he had to clean up was the science building at Meredith College, and, believe it or not, even before I started school I learned to read, and I would go into the teachers' offices and get books and start reading them at the age of five.  The truth of the matter is I was a very shy youngster, and I was afraid to go to school, and I didn't start school until I was seven years old, and as a consequence, I was older than almost all of the students in my classes and, strangely enough, I was offered a chance to be moved to a higher grade several times, but I never was moved to a higher grade.  I spent the same time as everybody else spent in school, but I learned an awful lot from just being able to look at these books in the teachers' offices while I was under the age of seven.
Speaker 1: And, did your father ever share any stories with you about working at the college and what that was like for him?
Speaker 2: This shows in the book, by the way.  I remember so well, one Saturday morning, that my father was having a discussion with a Mr. Hamrick, who was responsible, he was the financial director, in a sense, of Meredith College, and the discussion was about a raise.  My father said he needed more money.  Well, at the time, he was only making something like a dollar a day, or seven dollars a week, and he wanted to double it and Mr. Hamrick said that the college didn't have that kind of money, and my father said, "Well, I have to have at least an additional fifty cents a day more," and he talked Mr. Hamrick into agreeing with him, and I, in my later years I learned that that was a means of negotiating and I actually had to use my ability to negotiate when I was a Howard University [Washington, D.C.], because I became the university's negotiator for seven union contracts, and I think my success really was based upon what I learned in my early days with my father arguing with Mr. Hamrick with respect to how much money he ought to be able to make.
Story_ID: 196876
Speaker 1: Did your father [William Henry Nichols] ever share any stories with you about his life as a boy and the kinds of things that he liked to do as a boy and, you know, just what life was like in Garner, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: The thing he liked to do most, not only as a boy, but as an adult, was to fish and he would talk about fishing to his children a lot, and I had three brothers and all of them, too, liked to fish and so did I, and this is strictly because of what my father had to tell us about fishing.
Speaker 1: What did he tell you about fishing?
Speaker 2: That that's the way to go out and get some food without having to buy it (laughter), and enjoy it while you're doing it, and he used to tell us that a lot!
Speaker 1: Uhmm-hmm, uhmm-hmm. How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: This, again, appears in the book ['Things My Father Taught Me,' Owen D. Nichols].  My father was not a highly formally educated man, but as far as personal knowledge, internal knowledge, he was a master.  He knew far more than most people I believe.  There's one thing that I have to share with you.  When I was a little boy, he wanted me to learn how to paint, and when he was ready to teach me how to paint, he said, "Let him use the old brushes."  In other words, he said that if I could learn to paint using the old brushes as opposed to the good brushes, that means that when I was able to use the good brushes, I could paint better than other people, and sure enough I learned very well how to paint using the old brushes.  Now, when I was in graduate school at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], there was a man who worked in the chemistry department that wanted me to paint his living room at his home.  He said I do not want you to put drop cloths over the furniture.  It'll scratch it.  I don't want you to move anything.  I want you to paint it just as it is, and sure enough I painted the living room, did not get a drop of paint on anything, although nothing was covered, and that is strictly a result of my father teaching me how to paint using the old brushes.
Story_ID: 196877
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your origin, Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols]?  Do you know if your people came from free people or slaves or how far back can you trace your origin and your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Well, I know my mother's [Pearl Hockaday Nichols] grandfather actually was white, and his wife, which was her grandmother, of course, was black, but they were not married, and this is sort of like slaves being used by owners.  I'm not going to give the name of her grandfather, but I know that her grandfather was in business in Raleigh, North Carolina, and he would make some provisions for my mother's grandmother, who then would make provision for my mother.  But, there was, I cannot specify exactly what the origin of our two families were, my mother's family and my father's [William Henry Nichols] family, although I know that it did go back into the slave era.
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your grandparents, and we'll start with your maternal grandparents, and I know you said that you didn't know your maternal grandfather, but you do have some varied memories of your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yes, even though I was only three years old when she died, she died in 1932.
Speaker 1: And could you also start by telling us her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Alice Hockaday, and then she--yeah, Alice Hockaday was her name, of course.
Speaker 1: And, can you spell Hockaday for us?
Speaker 2: H-O-C-K-A-D-A-Y.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about your grandmother.  What do you remember?
Speaker 2: She was a lady who was eloquent in her movements, eloquent in her thinking.  She had one problem that I didn't particularly like and, believe it or not, I learned this early.  She didn't like people that were very dark in color, but she changed a little bit because my father was much darker than my mother and all of my brothers and sisters, nine of which there were, had, I guess, color closer to my mother than to my father.  I had two brothers that were fair enough that they looked like they could be white, but my mother was very fair also, of course.  I have to tell you this little story.  One of my brothers was in the [U.S.] Army back in World War II [WWII], and he came home for a visit and when he left he went to the bus station, Greyhound bus station and he left something at home that he meant to take with him, so he called on the telephone and asked my father if he would bring it to him at the bus station.  Well, my father took me with him and my brother, who was fair, was in the white section, and we, he had his cap over his head so that his hair couldn't be seen because that would have given him away, and when he saw my father and me coming, he said, "Go, go, go, go.  Don't come over here!"  He did not want them to know that he was black!  And that is an event that stays with me and makes me laugh every time I think about it, but that particular brother wanted the people to think that he was not one of us, okay?
Speaker 1: So, did he pass often? Did he do that often?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know.  That was the only time that I ever had that experience with him.  Now whether that's what he did in the Army, I have no idea, but he certainly--maybe it's a matter of his doing that in places where he could get away with it, but I doubt very seriously if he could have gotten away with it as a soldier in the Army.
Speaker 1: What was your father's reaction to that?
Speaker 2: Laughter.  (Laughter) We laughed at that for years, believe me.  And there are times even now when I tell somebody about it and I laugh about it.  (Laughter) I told my wife [Delores Nichols] about that a long time ago, and she loves to tell that story.
Speaker 1: So your father wasn't upset or disappointed that your brother was trying to pass (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, not at all.  He was tickled (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because it was a way of beating the system, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely (laughter).
Story_ID: 196878
Speaker 1: Well let's talk a little bit about your paternal grandparents.  Did you spend much time with them and know much about them?
Speaker 2: I never knew my paternal grandfather, but my--oh, you said paternal, not maternal.
Speaker 1: Paternal, yes sir.
Speaker 2: My paternal, I never knew either of my grandfathers, but my father's [William Henry Nichols] mother lived to be 108 years old!  She lived longer than anybody I've ever known personally.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Sarah Nichols.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about her?
Speaker 2: Well, she had several children, probably eight children, I believe, and I know of only two, the males, my father and his brother, Uncle Jim [ph.] (laughter).  Now, Uncle Jim was a carpenter, a bricklayer, a concrete builder.  He could do all kinds of things with his hands, just like my father could do with his hands.  My father was very talented when it came to construction and I remember an event that happened with my Uncle Jim.  He had to build a gate to a cemetery in Raleigh [North Carolina] and it was concrete on the sides and then, you know, a cover over the top that was concrete.  Something strange happened.  After he built the gate, it fell down and, of course, they wouldn't let him do it again because it fell down (laughter) but I will never in life forget that gate that he built out of concrete and it just collapsed.  Now it may have been related to something that I experienced when I was in the [U.S.] Army in Korea.  I was an army engineer, and we were doing some road building, some bridge building, and one time some concrete was mixed and they couldn't get the concrete to set like it was supposed to, and I took a hand of sand and I rubbed it on the ground, and it turns out the sand was silt, and that was the reason why the concrete wouldn't hold.  Now, whether that was the case with my Uncle Jim with that gate at the cemetery, I don't know, but I was given a lot of accolades by the people in the Army when I gave them the reason as to why the concrete wouldn't set.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, her life was spent primarily taking care of her children just like my mother's [Pearl Hockaday Nichols] life was spent taking care of her children, and there were no specific stories except that we would go visiting the home, my father's home place in Garner [North Carolina] from time to time, we'd take our grandmother with us and she'd talk about the farmers did the growing of all this corn and other vegetables, and each time we would go there, somebody would allow us to go out on the farm and pick corn and other vegetables; particularly, one of my aunts, which was my grandmother's daughter, of course, who had a farm in Garner and my grandmother used to tell us about how they were able to get food when they needed food, but didn't always have the money with which to buy the food.  It's almost like the thing of my mother having to make do with the flour when my father told her, "There is flour there."  (Laughter) My grandmother had the same kind of attitude toward preparing to take care of her children, okay?  But I know of no funny stories or specific stories other than the fact that she was always fully sensitive toward being able to take care of her family.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about what her life was like as a little girl or as a young woman?
Speaker 2: Well, she did talk about the fact that she liked to run, and the fact that she lived on a farm when she was first born.  She had a lot of space in which to run and rather than running out on the road, she would run around the farm and just have a good time doing it (laughter).
Story_ID: 196879
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up was being afraid to go to school because of shyness.  I was just afraid of people and, even today, I can't quite figure out why that shyness was so blatant with me (laughter) because there are people now who say I don't believe it, I don't believe it.
Speaker 1: And even though you grew up in a house with so many people?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I said I was seven years old when I first started school.  There was an interesting thing when I was in high school [Washington Graded and High School, later, Washington Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina].  The teacher would ask questions and I would seldom respond to the questions because I was afraid.  I remember my English teacher in high school said that my greatest hope is to get you to open your mouth and answer questions and talk when you're supposed to talk.  Well, I think she accomplished that and I started talking when I was supposed to, and then I developed a philosophy on my own.  I said to myself that if I can stump my teachers, then I will have learned everything my teachers have to offer.  If I cannot stump my teachers then there is something that I did not learn that the teacher did not tell me.  And so, I started asking questions after questions of my teachers, and I kept that philosophy throughout college, throughout graduate school.  As a matter of fact, I was auditing a course in organic chemistry at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] when I was working on my master's degree.  I was auditing it because it was organic chemistry, and being a physical chemistry major, I did not have to take organic chemistry for credit.  Well, the professor, Professor [Robert Percy] Barnes, put me out of his class.  He said the reason he put me out of his class is because I ask so many questions that I interrupted the way he was teaching the class, and the fact that I was auditing the class, he got away with putting me out.  If I had been taking a course for credit he couldn't have done that, and one other thing about questions.  Dr. Kelso [B.] Morris was my inorganic chemistry teacher at Howard when I was working on a master's degree.  When I went to Howard in 1969 to work and the first two years I worked, I was the president's executive assistant, and the president [HistoryMaker James Cheek] being my former classmate [at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], and I must say that the reason he got me to come to work for him that I was valedictorian of the class in which he graduated (laughter).
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols, do you mind if we kind of go back a little bit and we'll catch up with college?  Is that okay?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Oh, whatever you say.
Story_ID: 196880
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you this.  What were holidays like in your house growing up as a small boy?  Were they special times?  What were Christmas and Easter and Thanksgiving like growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, holidays were always special in our house and with the size of our family, we had the opportunity to do a lot of things that smaller families could not do.  Christmastime, of course, we always put up the Christmas tree and decorated the house, and before we were old enough to realize who Santa Claus was, we'd always go to bed early and wait for Santa Claus to come, and then before daylight we'd get up and start looking to see what Santa Claus brought us.  And, there was always something that we liked and enjoyed.  Now, on New Year's Day, there was a tradition where you were supposed to cook black-eyed peas, and one of the things we did with black-eyed peas, of course they were cooked with ham hocks, and the more black-eyed peas one would eat on New Year's Day, the more money one was supposed to get during that year.  In other words, each pea represented a piece of money.  And so, we would just eat as many black-eyed peas as we could get in our bodies (laughter), thinking we were gonna get more money that year because of eating all those black-eyed peas.  That was strictly a tradition and my family had all kinds of traditions.  One was that if you were passing a cemetery, you do not point at a gravesite, because they say if you pointed at a gravesite, your finger might rot off before it was over (laughter).  So, we did not point at gravesites (laughter).
Story_ID: 196881
Speaker 1: Could you give us the names of your siblings and their birth order, including yourself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.  Yeah, well, as I said I was born on April 8th, 1929.  My oldest brother, and see--I have to start with the numbers, because the first nine of us, believe it or not, they were two years apart, each year.
Speaker 1: So, but you don't have to give us their date of birth, but just give us their names, including yourself, where you are in the order.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  The oldest of my siblings was my brother William Henry, Jr [Nichols].  Next to him was my sister, Sarahleigh [Nichols].  Next to Sarahleigh was my brother, Eugene; Eugene Milton Nichols, and he was left-handed, by the way, and I'll tell you the story about him before it's over (laughter).  Next to Eugene was Edward [Nichols].  Next to Edward, and all so far, all four of them, are deceased.  Now, the next one is Marie [Nichols Hunter], and Marie is still alive.  She's the oldest of us and there are six of us left, five sisters and myself.
Speaker 1: If you could give us their names.
Speaker 2: Marie, Marie Hunter.  She was married, her husband is deceased, and she's the oldest of the sisters, and Marie is seventy-nine years old.
Speaker 1: Sure, but if you could just give us the rest of the names, Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols].
Speaker 2: Okay, sure.  Next to Marie is Pearl, and she's married.  Pearl [Nichols] Smith.  Next to Pearl is Owen, myself.  Next to me is Margaret, Margaret [Nichols] Ratcliff.  Next to Margaret is Doris [Nichols] Vinson, and our youngest sister is Cynthia [Nichols] Falcon.
Story_ID: 196630
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], if you will, tell me a little bit about what daily life was like in your house growing up; so, you'd wake up in the morning and what would follow?
Speaker 2: We'd wake up in the morning and get ourselves dressed; now, we did not have a bathtub when I first grew up.  Washing ourselves, we had to do it in little sinks, and bathing we had to use a tub, a wash, a tin tub, and we would take baths, at the beginning, once a week, and that would be our Saturday night!  But, we would wash up, of course, in the sink every day.  With time, and this was when I was in high school, actually.  No, it wasn't either, I was in the seventh grade.  I remember very well.  I was working for a grocery store and delivering groceries and delivering oil, delivering kerosene (laughter) and I was able to develop a little money, and I helped pay for a bathtub for our house.  Now, my father [William Henry Nichols] who could build anything, of course, he, along with Uncle Jim [ph.], built a bathroom, the structure for the bathroom and we put the tub in and put the stool in and we finally actually had a bathroom and then, of course, on Saturday night, we didn't have to use the big tin tub, we used the bathtub (laughter).
Story_ID: 196631
Speaker 1: During the day, we, the kids did not go far away from home.  We were always close to home because we didn't want to do anything wrong and go anywhere we weren't supposed to go.  Our parents [Pearl Hockaday Nichols and William Henry Nichols] had taught us in such a way that we should not go out and do wrong things, and so we were afraid to go out and do things, so we all spent our time either in the yard or in the house, and sometimes, of course, going to playgrounds and doing play, but all of my brothers and sisters were very conscious of their behavior and what they were supposed to do and what they were not supposed to do.
Speaker 2: Can you describe your community, your street, or your block growing up?  Do you remember the name of the street you lived on?
Speaker 1: North Haywood Street [Raleigh, North Carolina] is where I was born.  There was one white family that lived on the corner of the street, at Haywood Street and Lane Street.  Every other family I knew in the community was black, and that, the white family did not have a close relationship with any of the black families in the neighborhood as far as I know, but a number of black families did have very close relationships; the people who lived next door to us, and incidentally the house where I grew up, the house to my immediate right was my maternal grandmother's [Alice Hockaday] house at one time.  That's where she lived, that's where she died, and so my mother's family, in effect, lived next door to her family and then the other people in the neighborhood all were good neighbors and we, I never remember having any real problem with the neighbors, but the one white family across the street had no relationship whatsoever, and the white family, by the way, owned a business where they did tombstones, and that was about a block and a half away from where we lived, but that was their business, but I'm not sure how many of the black families ever even bought tombstones, as whether or not they could afford them during that time.  But, it was a wonderful neighborhood.
Speaker 2: That was unusual to have a white family.  How did that come about?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: They were there when I was born (laughter) so I really don't know.  Evidently, it was so close to where their business was that they probably had the house built, or they had the business first up the street from them, and then had the house built, but they wanted to be close to their business, I assume.  And that's why it was there.
Story_ID: 196632
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], can you tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness (laughter).  Well, the first sight that reminds me of it is we were one block away from Oakwood Cemetery [Raleigh, North Carolina], and we would walk down the street and look at all of the tombstones and, incidentally, Oakwood Cemetery was for white folk, not for black folk.  But we would sometimes walk through the cemetery and look at rabbits running around the cemetery, and we'd see all kinds of sights in the cemetery, and that certainly stays in my mind as a little boy walking around looking at the sights in the cemetery.  We would go to, I told you I went to St. Monica's School [Raleigh, North Carolina], and one thing that just won't leave my mind is looking at the nuns wearing their habits, and I always was fascinated by the fact that they were just different from other people all the time, (laughter) and I just couldn't get that out of my mind.
Speaker 1: What sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't remember too many smells, but the sounds of--
Speaker 1: Like, if you smell something and takes you right back to Raleigh [North Carolina], do you have any experiences like that?
Speaker 2: Well, I can smell my mother [Pearl Hockaday Nichols] cooking rabbits (laughter).  I loved the smell of her cooking those, roasting those rabbits and, believe it or not, when I grew up I actually cooked a rabbit myself and I got it truly from the way I watched my mother cook and the family loved that rabbit so much they wanted me to start cooking the rabbits all the time.  And I guess there's another smell that I remember that affects me even today.  I have been told by many people that I cook the best barbecued spare ribs of anybody they've ever known (laughter), and believe it or not, I do not eat barbecued spare ribs.  I don't eat pork at all, but the smell of barbecued spare ribs cooking was so great that I certainly cannot forget that, and I now cook them, to some extent, based upon the smell that I remember when I was a little boy (laughter)!
Speaker 1: And what sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: The one sound that I remember more than anything else is the sound that I heard when we go to a funeral of a [U.S.] military person and they would blow 'Taps' at the funeral service.  I will never forget the sound of 'Taps' and, believe it or not, when I was in the second grade, I learned to blow the trumpet, so I learned to blow 'Taps' early in life myself, and one of the reasons, I suppose, is the fact that I learned on the trumpet is because of the sound of 'Taps.'  I wanted to be able to blow the--make that sound, myself.  But, that has been with me all my life and still is.
Speaker 1: And is that because you lived so close to a cemetery?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 196633
Speaker 1: Tell me, do you have any other memories of growing up that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Not the earliest stages; as I said, I was very shy and stayed as close to my parents [Pearl Hockaday Nichols and William Henry Nichols] and my sisters and brothers as I could, because I'd like for them to do the talking as opposed to my doing the talking.  I was about to tell you about something that happened at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] with Dr. Kelso [B.] Morris  if I may.  When I went to work at Howard, he found out that I had been, that I had come back to work and I was in the president's [HistoryMaker James Cheek] office as his executive assistant, as I said, and Dr. Morris came up to the office to see me and the first thing he said, "Oh, how I remember you and your questions,"  (laughter).  Because I told you about the philosophy that I had developed about asking the teachers questions to get everything I thought the teacher had to offer.
Speaker 1: Umm-hmm, umm-hmm.  Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me the name of your elementary school and what your experiences were like there.
Speaker 2: St. Monica's Catholic School [sic. St. Monica's School] in Raleigh [North Carolina], of course.
Speaker 1: Was it a private school?
Speaker 2: Yes, private, Catholic school, yes.  And, it was a small school.  It had four classrooms, and there were two grades in each classroom.  Grades one and two were in one classroom, grades three and four in one, grades four and five in one--what am I talking about--grades five and six in one, and grades seven and eight in one.  Four classrooms.  I remember a rather interesting incident.  When I was in the third grade my teacher, Sister Emily [ph.], was naming some cities in the area and she said something about the City of Cary [North Carolina], and I said, "Sister Emily, it is not Kerry, it's Cary."  She says, "It's Kerry."  Well, it turns out that she was totally wrong.  We called it Kerry, and about six months later she said to me, "I'm sorry, but you were right.  It is Cary, North Carolina, not Kerry, North Carolina." And, by the way, Cary, North Carolina is one of the biggest developed cities in the State of North Carolina.  It's probably five times as large now as it was when I was a little boy, and it's really a very, very large city.
Story_ID: 196634
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you remember some of your other teachers at St. Monica's [School, Raleigh, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Sister Marie [ph.], Sister Emily [ph.], Sister Marinas [ph.], oh, I remember their names (laughter), and as I said, I started blowing the trumpet when I was in the second grade and the band director was Father Carl [ph.], and he taught kids how to handle their instruments and how to learn music very, very well.  I--that is the basis of my ability to read music very well, even today.  I sang with the choir.  We were all required to sing with the choir in elementary school and, believe it or not, I still sing.  I went to an event just yesterday, where I sang two solos (laughter).
Speaker 2: And, how were your parents [Pearl Hockaday Nichols and William Henry Nichols] able to afford the tuition at St. Monica's?
Speaker 1: Ten cents a week, and we could afford, they could afford ten cents a week.  That's all the tuition was.
Speaker 2: And, was your family Catholic?
Speaker 1: No, no.  Now, there's an interesting story about Catholicism.  Two of my sisters, Pearl [Nichols Smith] and Marie [Nichols Hunter], and I took the instructions to become a Catholic, and on a given Saturday, we were supposed to go to St. Monica's [Catholic Church, Raleigh, North Carolina] to be baptized.  Well, it turns out that I didn't know where they were.  They didn't know where I was.  We did not get together to go to get our baptism.  We didn't say anything to each other the rest of the day about it.  We didn't say anything to each other for several months about it.  We all decided independently that we weren't going, and as a consequence, we did not go, and I'm not sure even until this day exactly what caused us to do that, but we did not talk to each other at all about it, as I said, for several months.
Story_ID: 196635
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school [St. Monica's School, Raleigh, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: English was always my favorite subject until, of course, I went to college [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  Well, even, I take that back.  Even when I went to college, I considered English as a major, but I loved mathematics too, and the first time I went to college, the first day I went to college, I registered as a math major.  I went back to my high school [Washington Graded and High School, later, Washington Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina] to let my high school teachers know that I'm now a college student.  Going to my history teacher, her husband was the chairman of the chemistry department at Shaw University, and she asked me, "How did you and my husband get along today?"  I told her, "I'm sorry, Ms. Peron [ph.], I didn't see your husband."  She said, "I thought you said you had registered."  "I have."  She said, "You better go back and see my husband.  He's got something for you."  I went back to the campus; again, this is the first day at college. I went to Mr. Peron's office and said, "Mr. Peron, how are you?"  He said, "I'm fine.  How are you?"  I said, "I'm fine."  He said, "Where've you been all day?"  I said, "Well, I registered and then I went back to Washington [Graded and] High School and saw your wife and she said I needed to come and see you."  He said, "Well, how could you register without seeing me?"  I said, "Well, Mr. Peron, nobody told me that I had to see you to register."  He said, "Well, what is your major?"  I said, "Math."  "Ohhh."  He said, "I thought you were going to major in chemistry.  I was told that you needed a job and I was going to give you a job as a lab assistant."  I said, "Oh, Mr. Peron, I sure need a job.  What do I need to do?"  He said, "You have to be a chemistry major."  I said, "Well, if I go back and change my major from math to chemistry, may I have the job?"  He said, "Yes."  So I went back through the registration process, changed my major from math to chemistry my first day of college.  Now, as far as I know, Shaw University has been in existence since the 1890s, no, 1865, I believe, and to my knowledge, no new freshman student has ever been given a lab assistant job at Shaw University without having taken some chemistry courses already, and this was purely because of my record in high school.
Story_ID: 196636
Speaker 1: Let's go back to elementary school and tell me a little bit about during that time, did you have dreams and aspirations during the elementary school years and if so, what were they?
Speaker 2: During elementary school, I really didn't have any particular dream or aspiration with respect to career.  There was, I don't ever remember any discussion in elementary school with respect to where you're going next.  And so, I left elementary school actually a year early.  I left St. Monica's [School, Raleigh, North Carolina] after seven years and I went to Washington [Graded and] High School [later, Washington Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina] for eighth grade, so I spent five years in high school, eight grade through twelfth grade, but for some reason I just decided I wanted to go to high school, and so I left St. Monica's and went to Washington High School after seventh grade.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your friends in elementary school, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were lots of friends I had in elementary school, Thomas Cook [ph.], Gloria Hart [ph.], and I must say this to you about Gloria Hart, when I was in the seventh grade, no this was, I'm thinking about Gwendolyn Haywood [ph.] who said something, but Gloria Hart, I remember, sat right in front of me in either sixth grade or seventh grade, and for some reason, I really never had a heavy southern accent.  My speech is different from my whole family, and I think the main reason is because I said something incorrect when I was in the fourth grade, and the Sister got on my case and I became very, very sensitive about grammar and what I said.  I remember so well--the teacher asked a question and Gloria Hart looked around after I answered the question and she said, "You think you're so proper!"  (Laughter) And I will never forget that, but the fact that I spoke not with a southern accent, a lot of people have gotten on my case over the years, believe me, and as I said, all of my family speaks differently from the way that I speak.
Speaker 1: And, did most of the black kids in your community and in your neighborhood, did they go to St. Monica's, or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  St. Monica's was a small school, remember?  I said there were only four classrooms with eight classes, two in each of the four classrooms.  Now most, there was an elementary school called Lucille Hunter [Elementary School, later, Hunter GT/AIG Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina], and that was the largest elementary school in the area where I lived, and most of the black kids in our area went to Lucille Hunter.  All, my family, my sisters, Cynthia [Nichols Fanlcon], Doris [Nichols Vinson], Margaret [Nichols Ratcliff], Pearl [Nichols Smith], and Marie [Nichols Hunter], all went to St. Monica's.  My older brothers and sister went to Lucille Hunter.
Speaker 1: Umm-hmm, umm-hmm.  And where, did you ever catch any flack in the neighborhood for going to the private school?  Was that ever the case?
Speaker 2: No.  I never remember catching any flack whatsoever about doing that.  Some of the kids in the neighborhood didn't want to go to the Catholic school anyway, and the main reason is that the nuns were all white, and they didn't want to have white teachers, okay?
Speaker 1: But it was different at Lucille Hunter.
Speaker 2: At Lucille Hunters all the teachers were black, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, was St. Monica's integrated or was it a black school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, oh no, all black.  All black students, but white teachers.
Speaker 1: White, right.
Speaker 2: No white teachers whatsoever.  And plus, the priest, Father Carl [ph.], was white.
Story_ID: 196637
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], let's kind of move on to, and I know you didn't attend junior high school, but around those years so like sixth and seventh grade, tell us a little bit about what kind of young man you were becoming.  How would you describe yourself at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, sixth, seventh grade my interests were primarily school and family and I didn't have a whole lot of association outside of school or outside of my family.
Speaker 1: Did you play any sports or--?
Speaker 2: Softball was my favorite, and I remember, and this was in eighth grade, actually, I had gotten out of St. Monica's [School, Raleigh, North Carolina].  I remember the coach, the football coach at Washington [Graded and] High School [later, Washington Magnet Elementary School,, Raleigh, North Carolina], also coached kids playing softball and I was a pretty good hitter, I have to admit, and one day we were playing a game of softball and the coach told the guys who were playing out in the field, "Be careful, move back now, because he's gonna get that ball way out there!"  (Laughter) I'll never forget him saying that.  Yes, I hit quite a few home runs playing softball, and there's something I have to tell you about Coach Williams [ph.] as we go along, when you had ask me about high school.  It's something very important that I have to tell you about him.
Speaker 1: Well, during the junior high school time frame, tell me a little bit about who was influencing you.
Speaker 2: My teachers and my parents [Pearl Hockaday Nichols and William Henry Nichols], my sisters and brothers.  As I said, two areas of great concern and that was school and family.  It was, church did not have a lot of influence for me at that early stage, but I have to admit that when I was in the eighth grade, going to Washington High School, Washington High School was quite a distance from where we lived, and since it was not integrated, we had to walk and as a consequence, I walked past two other high schools to get to Washington High School, and one Saturday morning, I had to go to the high school for something and I passed by the church where we went, which was First Baptist Church [Raleigh, North Carolina], and as I came back I said to myself, "I'm gonna get baptized" when I was in the eighth grade.  Nobody told me, but I said to myself, "I'm going to get baptized."  The very next morning at church, I gave myself to the church for baptism, and as a consequence I was baptized when I was in the eighth grade at Washington High School, and I, of course, stayed a Baptist as long as I lived in Raleigh [North Carolina], but now I'm a United Methodist and have been a United Methodist for many, many years, but that day in eighth grade is the day that I decided that it was time for me to get baptized.  And, from that point on the church has been a major influence in my life.
Speaker 1: And during the junior high school years, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Not really, other than being able to achieve academically.  That's one aspiration I always had.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you would be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, in my high school yearbook, there's a strange statement (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But during junior high school year, what were you thinking?
Speaker 2: At that point, I didn't have any specific dream with respect to what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I developed specific dreams in high school.
Story_ID: 196638
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about high school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --starting with the name of your high school.
Speaker 2: It was Washington [Graded and] High School [later, Washington Magnet Elementary School,], again, in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little--do you remember some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Well, my first teacher in eighth grade was Mrs. Kelly [ph.].  Mrs. Kelly was also a music teacher.  She directed the choir at Washington High School, and that's probably the main reason I sang with the choir, because I was her student (laughter).  Most of her eighth grade students sang with the choir, since she was both the choir director and an eighth grade teacher.  And, as I said, I learned to play the trumpet in second grade, so I joined the high school band and, actually, became the first trumpeter in the high school band (laughter) and when, in Mrs. Kelly's class, of course, that wasn't considered the regular high school class.  Well, I guess it was at that time since they did not have middle school specifically, but my, I remember many of my teachers, Mrs. Kelly, my eighth grade teacher, and then going to ninth grade, Mrs. Peron [ph.] was my history teacher, the same lady who sent me to her husband when I went to Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina], Mrs. Suzette Perry [ph.], my chemistry teacher, who came to be my favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: Math and chemistry.  Math was favorite.  Chemistry was second.  The sciences, I liked all of the sciences, and the reason I liked the sciences much better than I liked the other subjects is that--in taking courses like history and English, you had to remember things too much.  In the sciences you could compute the answers and that's why I liked the sciences so much better than I liked the other social sciences.  And, as a consequence, I did science and took every science course I could.  I took math, chemistry, biology, I think--
Speaker 1: Tell me a little about what kinds of dreams and aspirations you had during high school.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I wanted to be a mathematician and, believe it or not, I wanted to be a fashion designer.  In my high school yearbook, the question as to what you want to be when you finish--in my yearbook, it indicates I want to be a fashion designer and/or a mathematician, and even today I love fashion designing.  I never got into it, but believe it or not, I pick an awful lot of my wife's [Delores Nichols] clothes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you enjoy drawing or just drawing the different fashions or just the whole-like fabrics?
Speaker 2: Deciding what, yeah, the fabric and looking at other people's designs and liking what I see, or disliking what I see.  I'd love to be able to make a decision on what is good and what isn't good.
Speaker 1: In terms of fashion--
Speaker 2: And, and I wanted to be able, at some point, to have some influence on how fashions were designed, but I never really got into that, but my wife really appreciates the fact that I can go pick something for her and bring it to her and she'll love it (laughter).
Story_ID: 196639
Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts about college in high school [Washington Graded and High School, later, Washington Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in high school, I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to be able to go to college, because of the fact that we were not a very rich family, believe me, as far as money is concerned, but I was very, very fortunate and the fact that I was the valedictorian of my high school class, I got a scholarship and so I was able to go to college with some scholarship money, and then after two years of college [at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], I went to the [U.S.] Army and spent three years in the Army, and then coming back from the Army, I had the GI Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] as well, and so I had scholarship money and GI Bill money, and I was able to--
Speaker 1: But let's go back to those two years of college...
Speaker 2: Okay, the first two years of college--
Speaker 1: Where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: Shaw [University]--
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: In 1948.
Speaker 1: Umm-hmm.  And were you surprised at all that you were the valedictorian, or was that something you were striving for?
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted to do the best I could, and I never made a grade below a B in all of my schooling.  I never made a C in anything, and I felt that what you were supposed to learn, you better learn, and I have to admit that going to school was the easiest thing that I've ever done.  I really never had any problem with any kind of course I ever had.  I was very fortunate that I was able to learn what I was supposed to learn, and you know that not only was I valedictorian of my high school class, but I was also valedictorian of my college class--
Story_ID: 196882
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], let's talk a little bit about your experiences at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you were at Shaw from 1948 until 1950, until you were drafted.
Speaker 2: I was not drafted.  I volunteered for the [U.S.] Army (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, until you joined the Army.  Okay.  Well, let's talk a little bit about from '48 [1948] to 1950.  What were your experiences like at Shaw?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  As I said, I had changed my major from math to chemistry on my first day, and I, I just thought that I was having a ball.  Now, something very interesting happened in my second year.  I loved English and I considered changing my major from chemistry to English, and the reason I considered changing my major from chemistry to English is I thought I wanted to go to divinity school, and I went to, and Shaw has a divinity school [Shaw University Divinity School, Raleigh, North Carolina], by the way.
Speaker 1: Why were you thinking you wanted to go to divinity school?  Had something happened in your life?
Speaker 2: Nothing specific, but my thoughts about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life just changed.  And, I went to a professor of divinity, and his name was Dr. Grady Davis, and I told him that I was thinking about changing my major to English so that I could go to divinity school.  He said to me, "You need to fight this thought as hard as you can and continue to major in chemistry like you're majoring unless you get to a point where you can't help yourself, and if you get to that point then change your major."  He said, "But as long as you can fight it, don't do it."  And, as a consequence I fought and fought and fought, and I didn't change my major from chemistry to English.
Speaker 1: Why do you think he told you that?
Speaker 2: Well, he felt that one had to be totally sincere and felt that one was supposed to go that way rather than simply doing it because the thought entered one's mind.  And, I don't have any problem with his having done it, but I sometimes wish I had done it anyway.  As a matter of fact, after I went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] to work, and got ready to retire, I actually was going to divinity school then and applied and was supposed to register on a particular day and I thought about Dr. Davis so much I changed my mind even then.  Now, I'm talking about 1989 now.  (Laughter) And, as a matter of fact, when I first started working at Howard in 1969--
Speaker 1: Now, hold that thought for me, Dr. Nichols.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, that's some, that's a higher education area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go back.  Sure, sure, sure.  Let's go back--
Speaker 2: But it all started back there.
Story_ID: 196883
Speaker 1: But let's go back to around 1949, 1950, you're--
Speaker 2: I was in the [U.S.] Army in '49 [1949]--what am I talking about, my first two years at Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, you were at Shaw, yes sir, yes sir.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in college?  Were you joining any clubs, any fraternities, that kind of thing?  Those first two years?
Speaker 2: I actually joined the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity in 1950, my second year at Shaw, and--
Speaker 1: And were you enjoying college life?
Speaker 2: Well, yes I was.  But then the Korean War started and a friend of mine and I decided that we wanted to go into the Army and get commissioned.
Speaker 1: Why?  Why did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: Well, we thought we were gonna be drafted sooner or later, but if we volunteered we probably could do more than we could as a draftee.
Speaker 1: And so, what year did you join the Army?
Speaker 2: In 1950.
Speaker 1: And how long were you in the Army?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like for those three years?
Speaker 2: Now, I had the, the first experience I had was very, very interesting.  One normally takes basic training at the beginning of an Army career.  When I went into the Army, I was sent to Fort Bliss, [El Paso] Texas, and there was no battery clerk in the office of the division that I was a part of.
Speaker 1: And what's a battery clerk?
Speaker 2: It's like a secretary, in effect.  And, since my records showed that I had taken typing in high school [Washington Graded and High School, later, Washington Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina], and knew how to type, I was pulled out of basic training and put in the battery room as the battery clerk and never had basic training in the Army.  I don't know of anybody else who served in the Army without having basic training! (Laughter) Now, I had applied, of course, for Officer's Candidate School [sic. Officer Candidate School, OCS], and was finally accepted and when I went to OCS at Fort Riley, Kansas, and had to do all of these things with respect to the code of arms with the rifle, I didn't know what to do with the rifle, because I had never had basic training.  But somehow I learned, but it was not easy, and I was fortunate enough, and my friend, by the way, Johnny Burke [ph.], who graduated from Shaw with me, the two of us are the ones who went, and fortunately for me, I made it through OCS and got commission, but unfortunately for my friend, he did not make it and so he had to stay and enlisted man until his term was up, but, and they sent me to the Corps of Engineering [sic. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]; I guess, that's because of my background in chemistry the first two years of college, and as a consequence, I became an engineer in the Corps of Engineers, finally went to Korea, and this, again, is between 1950, well, and '53 [1953]. And, while I was in the Army, by the way, I got married (laughter).
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: In 1952.  And, I was sent to Korea, my wife [Delores Nichols] and I were engaged before I went to Korea and while I was in Korea, my oldest brother [William Nichols, Jr.] became very ill and I was able to come back to the [United] States on emergency leave because of his illness, and he recovered and got well and lived for several years longer, although they thought he was only gonna live a few weeks or months, and while I was here, the woman to whom I was engaged said to me, "Why don't we just go ahead and get married now?"  (Laughter) And sure enough, we went to Dillon, South Carolina, the last weekend of October 1952, and we got married on October 29th, which on this October 29th, will be fifty-two years, and it's been a wonderful life with that lady who became my wife almost fifty-two years ago.
Story_ID: 196884
Speaker 1: After you left the [U.S.] Army--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in 1953, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Went back to Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] to complete my other two years, okay?
Speaker 1: So from '50 [1950]--and, what year did you graduate from Shaw?
Speaker 2: In '55 [1955], '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: And you graduated at the top of your class?
Speaker 2: Yes, I graduated at the top of my class that year too.
Speaker 1: What was it like being back after being gone for three years?
Speaker 2: A piece of cake.  Didn't do anything I was, I felt just like I did before I left.
Speaker 1: What was it like being a student who was married?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that, I never did live on campus to start with.  I lived at home with my parents' [Pearl Hockaday Nichols and William Henry Nichols] home the first two years, and then my wife [Delores Nichols] and I got a place in Raleigh [North Carolina] called Washington Terrace and we had a ball living away from home now for the first time.  She had, she got a job at St. Agnes' Hospital [sic. St. Agnes Hospital, Raleigh, North Carolina] and she had about five different positions really.  She was the hospital clerk; she distributed, I forget the adjective to put before drugs, drugs that had to have special distribution, she was in effect the secretary to the director of the hospital, she had all kinds of things to do, but I would go over at night and spend time with her and it was just a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after you graduated from Shaw?
Speaker 2: I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for a master's degree, and--
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, the reason I went to Howard was this.  When I was at Shaw, we had a professor from Howard to come to Shaw to speak to a group and he said to me that I ought to come to Howard after I finish Shaw.  He was chairman of the Department of Physics, and I was talked into coming to Howard by him, and the first semester I was at Howard, he gave me a job as an assistant, a lab assistant in the Department of Physics, even though I majored in chemistry!
Speaker 1: Deja-vu all over again, eh?
Speaker 2: But, I was still majoring in chemistry, in physical chemistry, but he gave me the job in the Department of Physics.  The second year I got the job in the Department of Chemistry as a lab assistant, and I stayed at Howard for, what, I guess two-and-a-half years working on a master's degree.  And while I was there, by the way, I was offered a job at South Carolina State College [later South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] while I was at Howard, and they gave me a job as associate professor of chemistry.  I had never taught anything.  Normally, one does not get a ranking that high. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Sure.
Story_ID: 196885
Speaker 1: So what were your experiences like in South Carolina [at South Carolina State College, later, South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] as a teacher?  Were you--what were your thoughts about that?  Did you think that this was something that you would be able to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I had not thought about what I was going to do when I left Howard [University, Washington D.C.], but the fact that I was given the offer and accepted it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There's something I need to tell you about Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina], a class at Shaw.  This is after I got back in '53 [1953].  I was taking a course in social studies, and at final examination time, the professor gave us a blue book and a list of ten questions to answer, putting the answers, of course, in the blue book.  His name was Dr. Carl Devaughn [ph.].  I looked at the ten questions, and I didn't like the way they were stated.  So, I rewrote all ten questions for the final examination!  And I wrote him a note at the beginning indicating, "Dr. Devaughn, it is my opinion that the way that you have expressed the questions for our final exam will not allow you to learn what your students have learned from you, and I therefore would like to suggest that they be stated in a different manner," and then I stated all ten of them, and I answered my ten questions as opposed to answering his ten questions.  Now he could have given me a flat F for having done that, but after he checked my paper, Dr. Devaughn said, "I am going to change from now on the way that I express my final exam questions based on what you have done."  He gave me an A and said that it is wonderful what you have done for me.  Now, that showed a lot of security on his part, and I was, I will never forget that.  Dr. Devaughn came to UDC [University of the District of Columbia] in Washington [D.C.] to work some years later, and I would see him from time to time, and every time I'd see him, he would talk about that final exam that I changed for him.
Speaker 1: Now, what would have been your reaction when you were at South Carolina State if a student had done that on one of your final exams?
Speaker 2: A student did do that, but--the student couldn't answer his own questions and that student got an F.  Same, same approach, but he couldn't answer his own questions.  He couldn't answer mine, nor could he answer his.  Now, I could have answered Dr. Devaughn's questions, but I just felt that there were some things he needed to learn that I had learned from him and so that he could think about other students getting back to him what they had learned from him, and I'm telling you I was so impressed with the fact that he accepted it and had the security in his own manner of teaching to let me get away with what I did, but as I said, a student in my class at South Carolina State did the same thing.  I think I had shared it apparently with the class, and he said that the way that I had written the questions, he couldn't answer them the way I wanted them to be answered, and so he wrote, again, his own questions and did not answer a single one correctly.  This was a class in physical chemistry, by the way.
Speaker 1: Did he challenge his grade?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  He accepted it?
Speaker 2: He knew he couldn't answer his questions (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 196886
Speaker 1: Well, after you left South Carolina State [College, later South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], you were there for a year.  You went--
Speaker 2: No, I was there for--
Speaker 1: --from '58 [1958] to '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Oh, that's it, okay. A little over a year, actually.
Speaker 1: You went to the [U.S.] Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: As a research chemist.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  How did that come about, Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols]?  How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: My former professor of chemistry, Dr. [Leon] Shereshevsky, who was the chairman of the chemistry department, by the way, at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and also I was his lab assistant when I went to the chemistry department as a lab assistant.  He had made contact with somebody about me, and I was approached by somebody while I was at South Carolina State for a job at naval research laboratory, and my wife [Delores Nichols], who didn't particularly like Orangeburg, South Carolina, was happy as she could be, and not only that but her mother was very ill at the time, and it would give her an opportunity to come back and be closer to her mother, who was in Annapolis, Maryland, and so I accepted the job at naval research laboratory, and by the way, I was only the second black person, I understand, to have worked in the chemistry division of that naval research laboratory.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of projects did you work on there?
Speaker 2: Surface chemistry.  There was a problem that the [U.S.] Navy had where if ships were in the Artic area, ice would accumulate on the ships to the extent that sometimes the ships would actually sink, and so I was a part of a project whereby we were trying to determine how we could keep the ice from accumulating on the ships and determine how we could, how it could be gotten off easily or how we could determine a method by which it would not, the water would not freeze on the surface of the ships and I worked there for a couple of years and I had a good time doing it, I must say.
Speaker 1: What was the reception like there?  You were the second African American to work in the chemistry department there.  Was there any resistance to you coming on?  I mean, was there any questioning of your qualifications?
Speaker 2: There was no question of my qualifications, but there was one man, one white man, who worked in the surface chemistry department, who would come to the laboratory every morning and look in there to see me to be sure that I really was working there.  Every morning he would come and look to be sure that it was real, that I was there.  Yeah, there was resistance on his part, but he couldn't do anything about it and you know, he was hallucinating.  He just didn't believe it!
Story_ID: 196887
Speaker 1: And so you left there [U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C] in 1962 and you went to work for the [U.S.] Department of Defense?
Speaker 2: Yes, Defense Documentation Center [later Defense Technical Information Center].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us a little about what you were doing there.
Speaker 2: The Defense Documentation Center was a place where technical information was developed and accumulated and distributed to various parts of the defense department so that it would, in effect, teach people who worked in defense things that they did not know.  In other words, it's distribution of information that they needed to know but may not have known, and from a technical standpoint, okay?  And, as a matter of fact, I even went to, now wait a minute, 1969, no, this was another thing I'm thinking about.  They sent me on a trip to Europe one time to discuss some various things with places in Europe, governmental defense organizations in Europe, about the same kind of thing, how to distribute, and this was just before the real computer age got going.  This was a time when we had computers but the computer would use up a whole room, as opposed to being just a little device in front of you (laughter) and so it was a matter, again, of trying to get people around our country involved in defense and people around the world involved in defense to learn more than they would not have learned if we had not been doing this kind of operation.  It's just like setting up a library in a sense, where people can go and find out things that they didn't know and hopefully learn how to do better that which they are doing.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  And so you left there in 1966, and you went to work as a deputy director at the [National] Air Pollution Technical Information Center [Division of Air Pollution, Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare].
Speaker 2: Same, same kind of work except that this was purely involved with air pollution control, and at one time I was supposed to be transferred to the Research Triangle Center [Research Triangle Park] in Durham, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Were you looking forward to going back home?
Speaker 2: I was, and this was in 1969, that I was looking forward to going back home.  My mother [Pearl Hockaday Nichols] was still alive then, and she was just ecstatic, but that's the year that [HistoryMaker] James Cheek became president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and talked me and my wife [Delores Nichols] into staying here and coming to work, first of all as his executive assistant for two years and then as the vice president for administration, a position that was actually created for me.  I was the first person ever to have that position at Howard University.
Story_ID: 196888
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your relationship with [HistoryMaker] Dr. [James] Cheek, because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you all were classmates at Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I hate to say this, but I am.  I used to tell him so much that, "You wanted me to come to work with you because I was a valedictorian of the class when you graduated."  (Laughter) He didn't particularly like to hear that.  (Laughter) But, I'm sure that was a factor in his wanting me to come there because, man, he and I were very good friends; in fact, when we were, he had gone to the [U.S.] Army and went back to Shaw also, and he lived in Washington Terrace [Raleigh, North Carolina], the same place that my wife [Delores Nichols] and I lived, really, about a half a block away, and so we had a very close relationship, his wife [Celestine Cheek] and my wife and him and me, all the four of us, and so we really, we had a friendship connection as well as an academic connection and he, by the way, has a degree in theology.  He's a preacher.
Speaker 1: And, so it had been ten years about since you had been back to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  How had things there changed?  So, you had gotten your master's degree there in 1950 and you were back there in 1969 working.  How had things changed, or had things changed?  Had students kind of changed or the campus changed?
Speaker 2: I think everything had changed, myself.  And I think things changed because of changes in leadership.  It depends entirely upon who is in charge as to what goes on in an institution like Howard.  James Cheek's approach to institutional development is totally different from his predecessor [President James Nabrit, Jr.].  James Cheek was responsible for developing a lot of things at Howard that were not there before he became president.
Speaker 1: Such as--can you give us an example?
Speaker 2: There were buildings that were added, academic programs that were added.  Take, for instance, the two communication facilities; WHUT [WHUT-TV], which at that time was WHMM [WHMM-TV], channel 32 [local digital channel 33, virtual channel 32] in this area [Washington Metropolitan Area].  Channel 32 was developed as it was associated in effect with the [Howard University] School of Communications [Washington, D.C.], which was started at Howard by, under James Cheek, and then I mentioned to you earlier that the radio station was WTOP-FM and was given to Howard University by Katharine Graham of The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Right, Katharine Graham is the owner of The Washington Post.
Speaker 2: She was the owner, yes.  And the reason, the reason that they got rid of WTOP is that at that time the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] limited the number of stations that any given organization could have in one place.  And so, The Washington Post had to get rid of WTOP-FM and gave it to Howard University rather than selling it, and so that was one of the most wonderful gifts that anybody has ever given to Howard University, and now WHUR [WHUR-FM, Washington, D.C.] is--
Speaker 1: Let me ask you a quick question about WTOP.  Right now, WTOP is a news format.  Was that the case when it was given to Howard?
Speaker 2: When it was given to Howard--it was.
Speaker 1: And the format was changed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Into what format?
Speaker 2: Well, the station that Howard now has and the station that it became when Howard got it, they call it something like adult music station; now, that's not the exact term that's used, but it was a station that was developed primarily as an adult music station, you know, appealing to the adult community as opposed to the children's community.
Speaker 1: And what did that do for Howard, to have the television station and the radio station, how do you think that impacted Howard, and what impact, do you think?
Speaker 2: It made Howard a very special institution when it comes to communications.  There was a time when WHUR was rated the highest radio station in the Washington [D.C.] community.  I have a certificate back in another room, congratulating me and Howard University for being able to bring that station to the level that it has been brought, and before we leave, I want you to see that (laughter).  But yes, it has made Howard a very highly regarded institution with respect to communications.
Story_ID: 196889
Speaker 1: You served as [HistoryMaker] Dr. [James] Cheek's executive assistant--
Speaker 2: Assistant just for two years.
Speaker 1: --for two years, and what did you do after that?  You stayed at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], but what did you do?
Speaker 2: I became the vice president for administration and secretary of the university.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  Opening convocations, commencement, all public events, public--commencement convocation, opening convocation, Charter Day convocations: my office was entirely responsible.  I was secretary of the board of trustees for all those years, and therefore trustee matters were all part of my responsibility.  As I said, the radio station [WHUR-FM, Washington, D.C.], the television station [WHMM-TV, later WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.]--the managers reported to me, Cramton Auditorium [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--the manager reported to me, the department of personnel administration was under my area, the department of security was under my area.  I had lots and lots of things; as a matter of fact, when I retired from Howard, three people replaced me (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, were you enjoying this new position at Howard and this new responsibility?
Speaker 2: I was enjoying it, but it was stressful, believe me, because I had so much responsibility, but I thoroughly enjoyed it but, again, the enjoyment wasn't necessarily in my best interest (laughter).
Story_ID: 196890
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], we were talking a little bit about your tenure at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Tell me a little bit about over the years, really, you know, almost a thirty-year span, of how you were, if you noticed any changes at the university, changes in students and the university itself.  What were some of the most significant?
Speaker 2: The addition of certain programs; for instance, when I first went to Howard there was no school of communications.  There is a [Howard University] School of Communications [Washington, D.C.] now and I, I think it provides some opportunities that are really appreciated by students, such opportunities that were not there early on.  For instance, radio, television, and acting as far as that goes, and of course, the College of Fine Arts was there when I got there, but now the College of Fine Arts has been merged into the [Howard University] College of Arts and Sciences [Washington, D.C.].  I believe that's the actual title of it now, but Howard offers such a variety of opportunities that it did not offer before, that students now are just in a better position to do things than they would have been twenty, thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: What changes were you noticing in the students over the years?  So, what were students like when you first arrived at Howard in the mid-'50s [1950s], late '50s [1950s], I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It was '69 [1969] actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  But you, you got your master's degree at Howard.
Speaker 2: I went to school, I went to school there.
Speaker 1: But when you first arrived at Howard, what were students like when you were a student, and what were some of the changes you were starting to see throughout the years?
Speaker 2: This is a rather strange response to that, but I think that over the years students became far more aggressive than they were early on when I first became associated with Howard.  I think students would do things today that they would not do back in 1958, when I first went, first finished here.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Well, they, students have actually gone on strike at Howard over the years.  Students have done things to cause the administration to change what it would be doing, and I think the behavior of students has been such that the administration had to either develop new programs or cancel programs or simply make things different in order to be able to deal with the students and their demeanor of the day.
Speaker 1: But couldn't that be compared to the sit-ins of the '60s [1960s]? You know, the students at Howard and other schools were very involved in that; couldn't that be compared to that in terms of aggressiveness and invoking change?
Speaker 2: I think over time, the manner in which students do things is different.  The manner is not the same.  They may be looking for the same result, but in my opinion, students are much more aggressive today than they used to be and are not afraid to do some things that they would have been afraid to do a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?
Speaker 2: I think it's a combination of good and bad.  It's good that the administration is able to recognize where the students are going, how they are going, and sometimes it's bad because it requires the administration to do more than the administration might otherwise would have to do.  So, I think there's a good side or a bad side, but overall I think that it's good, because it creates in effect the kind of student that would have to function, after leaving Howard, in the way--differently from the way that student would have to function in the past.  So that, in my opinion, is the good side of it.
Story_ID: 196891
Speaker 1: You had mentioned the Arbitron Rating Award that you were the recipient of in 1985, when Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was, WHUR [WHUR-FM, Washington, D.C.] was rated the number one radio station in Washington, D.C. in 1985 among its listeners.  Was that something that was unexpected or did you all know that, you know, that was the radio station to tune into?
Speaker 2: Well, we knew it was the radio station to tune into.  It still is.  (Laughter) But, we knew that our ratings were going up year by year, and--
Speaker 1: Why do you think that was?  Was it, you know, an intentional change that was taking place?
Speaker 2: Well, we felt that there were certain types of programs missing from the Washington community, and WHUR was able to bring those programs in to being.
Speaker 1: What kind of programs?
Speaker 2: Well, let's take the Quiet Storm, for instance.
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about that.  The Quiet Storm.  First of all, tell us a little bit about what the Quiet Storm is, 'cuz it's said that the Quiet Storm originated in Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.  At WHUR.
Speaker 1: At WHUR.  Absolutely.  Describe to us what the Quiet Storm is.
Speaker 2: Well, the Quiet Storm represents the provision of a certain kind of music that it is felt that the Washington  community, the Washington area would like to hear, and, you know, it's not this rap-type music, and of course, rap hadn't even started back then, but--
Speaker 1: But more slow music--
Speaker 2: Slow, easy-going, where people can listen to it and relax, and understand what it is that's coming across.  You know, it's not always easy to understand what music means, but there's a message in music always, and the message that the Quiet Storm was that here is something that we think appeals to youth!
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the DJ who is credited with creating the Quiet Storm, or who is known--
Speaker 2: You mean, who first started it--Melvin Lindsey.  Well, Melvin Lindsey was a smooth operator, let's put it that way, and I think there's no better term to describe him than a smooth operator, and that's how he functioned as a smooth operator, and people liked the way that he was doing things, and they liked the music he was playing and they liked the way he said things about what was going on musically, and he was just a top disc jockey, even though that term is what he was, but he was more, believe me, than a disc jockey.  He was one who knew how to communicate with the people and to provide for the people what people liked, and WHUR and the Quiet Storm still provide together what the people like.
Speaker 1: And has been mimicked across the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  There are Quiet Storm programs around the country.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.
Story_ID: 196892
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about WHUR [WHUR-FM, Washington, D.C.] today.  Do you think it's, the ratings aren't, do you think that the--
Speaker 2: Not as high as they were at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.  Was it because the competition changed or did WHUR change?
Speaker 2: WHUR has not changed significantly in my opinion.  There are new types of music that did come about, especially, rapping, but not only are young people interested in rapping but some older people like it too, and so it gives them a new opportunity to deal with music and, of course, that's not WHUR's theme, primarily.  WHUR is still the Quiet Storm, and in fact, all the time, and WHUR is still providing for numerous groups of people and citizens what they want to hear and WHUR is still highly-rated and there are other stations, of course, that are highly-rated too; but, the fact that that there is more competition now than there was, say, in 1985, that means that some people are going to several different places, and when I say places I mean stations and music providers, than they could go to back in 1985, but I still regard WHUR as number one myself.  Well, take Sunday morning.  I wouldn't even think about listening to anybody but Patrick Ellis (laughter) on WHUR.
Speaker 1: As do most people in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  You'd be surprised how many people go to church on Sunday morning at home listening to WHUR.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Let's talk about WHUT [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.], formerly WHMM.  Did the television station, was it able to grasp the same type of accolades and ratings as the radio station was in the Washington [D.C.] area?
Speaker 2: I don't believe that the ratings have reached the point that they did with WHUR, although, and by the way, you know what WHMM stood for?
Speaker 1: Tell us.
Speaker 2: Washington's Howard Mass Media station, and WHUT is what--
Speaker 1: Tell us.
Speaker 2: Washington's Howard University Television.  My preference is WHMM, myself.  I'm not impressed with WHUT (laughter) and I'd like to go back to Howard's Mass Media, WHMM, but anyway--WHMM also has provided a different type of television programming than other stations in the area, and there have been some that have been developed since that time, and in effect copied off of WHMM or WHUT, and the competition is greater in that area, and so the ratings have to be divided among stations as opposed to being focused upon a single station as they were at one time on WHUR.
Story_ID: 196893
Speaker 1: WHUT [WHUT-TV, formerly, WHMM-TV, Washington, D.C.] has met some significant challenges throughout--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the years--funding and just being able to sustain itself.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: What are some of your thoughts about some of the financial challenges that have faced WHUT throughout the years?
Speaker 2: Well, fortunately there have been significant contributions made to WHUT.  They have, from time to time, they go through the, you know, financial, what do you call them, fundraising activities and, as a matter of fact, WHUR [WHUR-FM, Washington, D.C.] participates in fundraising activities for certain community organizations too, from time to time, but the fact that WHUT has been able to survive all of these years and still continues to survive says something in and of itself.  If there had not been sufficient funding to keep it going, then WHUT would have collapsed, but that's not the case and it can only get better in my opinion, as opposed to getting worse.
Speaker 1: What do you think about--WHUT has a new general manager, [HistoryMaker] Jennifer Lawson from PBS [Public Broadcasting Station].  Do you know her?  Have you had the opportunity--
Speaker 2: Not personally.
Speaker 1: To--
Speaker 2: The name is familiar, of course. The original general managers at WHMM at that time, of course, as I said reported to me, and I always had a very nice relationship with them and I have to mention the name of one person who is currently the manager of WHUR.  There was a time when Jim Watkins was the manager of both the radio station and the television station and Jim Watkins has to be given credit as that builder of both of those stations for Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and he has not received the acclaim that he should have received, because he is the man, believe me (laughter).
Story_ID: 196894
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], you retired from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in 1989.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, as you said earlier, you continue to work only you don't get paid.  Let's talk a little bit about your involvement with Montgomery College here in Rockville, Maryland, in Montgomery County [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Well, not just Montgomery College in Rockville. Montgomery College has three campuses, plus two other facilities, one [Westfield South Center, Montgomery College] at Wheaton Plaza [Wheaton, Maryland], one [Gaithersburg Business Training Center, Montgomery College] up in Gaithersburg [Maryland], but Montgomery College is the largest community college in the State of Maryland, and continues to grow like crazy.
Speaker 1: Tell us what your involvement is with them, and then we'll talk a little bit about that college.
Speaker 2: Well, I've been on the board of trustees at Montgomery College for nine years now, and there are three officer positions on the board; the first one being the second vice chair of the board, the first vice chair of the board, and then the board chair, and one can serve two years in each of those positions, and I have served two years in each of those three positions, and I'm still currently a member of the board, but I've already served my time as officers.  Now an interesting thing--the present president of Montgomery College is Dr. Charlene Nunley.  She became president, I guess, five years ago and an interesting thing happened.  The previous president served as president for twenty-two years at Montgomery College.  That was Dr. Robert [E.] Parilla.  When Dr. Nunley became president and they started talking about a presidential inauguration, nobody at the college had had any real experience with presidential inaugurations because he had been president for so long.  Now normally when they do a presidential inauguration committee, a high level administrator will chair the committee, and others would work with that administrator, but having had a little experience myself at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] with the inauguration of [HistoryMaker] James Cheek, I was asked to chair the inauguration committee for Dr. Nunley and I did, and, of course, the people who worked with me were just wonderful and we had one of the finest inaugurations for her that I've ever known, and I've been told that by many, many people, that her inauguration was absolutely wonderful, and so that's the kind of thing that trustees at Montgomery College, they do anything they can to help the college.  In my opinion, Montgomery College is not only the largest community college in the Sstate of Maryland, it is by far the best and one of the best in the country.
Speaker 1: And, for many students, the only option when it comes to college.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: What do you think about the role that community college plays in terms of providing a college education for students who can't afford the traditional four-year college.
Speaker 2: Montgomery College provides for, not only those students who cannot start in the four-year college, but it provides for those students who can start in the four-year college too, and it's much more economical for a student to do the first two years in Montgomery College, and then go to the four year college, and one of the reasons why Montgomery College is growing so fast with students is that the University [System] of Maryland is now not accepting all students because of financial problems, I guess, and because of certain changes and therefore Montgomery College becomes a place where these students can still go and still get where they want to go in life, and so, it's really a wonderful place and it's what we say, Montgomery College is the people's college, and there's nobody who can't get something out of Montgomery College in this county; as a matter of fact, there are a number of people even out of this county who still come to Montgomery College. It's a wonderful institution, believe me.
Story_ID: 196895
Speaker 1: Now I have to tell you about something else that I do a lot for.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I don't know if you ever heard of the African American Festival of Academic Excellence [later African American Student Achievement and Excellence Awards] or not, I don't know if the name Roscoe Nix is familiar to you.  Roscoe Nix had this idea back in 1989.
Speaker 2: And Roscoe Nix is a former NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--
Speaker 1: Former president of the NAACP, and also a former member of the board of education in Montgomery County [Maryland].  He said that for thirteen years, or fourteen years, he had had this idea of developing a festival, an event, shall I say, it's held annually to honor African American students who have certain high levels of academic performance.  When I retired from Howard University [Washington D.C.] in 1989, he came to me and said that he finally found somebody that he would want to ask to work with him in developing this festival.  And, sure enough I accepted and we started to make plans in 1989, to hold our first festival in 1990.  We started with high school, senior high school students only, and the first year in 1990, we honored 313, or 311 senior high school students and we had about 800 people present, parents and friends.  Since that time, we have gone down to the third grade and in the year 2003, we honored 7000 students and we had 17,000 people present!  We had so many people in 2003, we were not able to find a facility that we could pay for, for having the regular festival in 2004, so in 2004, all we did was send the certificates out to the various schools and they were presented to the students at the schools, but we still sent out more than 7000 certificates.  We are now working on 2005, trying to get an appropriate place with the appropriate money to be able to do it, but it costs us so much to do it in 2003, that we just weren't able to do what we wanted to do.  But that is an activity that has grown in leaps and bounds and somehow we're going to get back in 2005, with that festival.  In my opinion, well and let me say this also.  For the first five years of the festival, I served as chair of what we call the committee that is responsible for implementing it and putting it together and then after five years I felt it was time to let somebody else serve in a leadership role, but I still work very closely with the festival and it, in my opinion, is one of the great things that we, as African Americans, do for our students in Montgomery County, and I just had to share that with you.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols]--
Story_ID: 196896
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], tell me, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Now that's an interesting question (laughter).  I, well first of all, I hope that our African American academic community, namely our students, can get the high level of education that they need to be able to cope with the future and their own future in Montgomery County [Maryland] and elsewhere as far as that goes.  There are those who are not fully in agreement with the fact that African American students always have the same opportunities in educational and academic development that all students have in this county.  There are still some questionable areas and something needs to be done, and there are some things being done, I have to admit, but my hope is that I could say one day that every student in Montgomery County has the same ability, the same privilege, and the same access to learning that every other student has, and if I can say that, and it's meaningful, then I will be very, very happy.  My greatest concern is our younger community that will be taking over all the things that the older community has going today, and I want our African American community to be able and in position to do that which needs to be done, which is in their interest and in the interest of all people who are like them.  That's what I want to see.
Speaker 1: And, why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Well, that's an interesting question.  I have the strange regard for history, myself.  I never liked history and one of the reasons why I never liked history, again, and I said this earlier, you have to remember as opposed to being able to compute. But history, when I was in high school [Washington Graded and High School, later, Washington Magnet Elementary School, Raleigh, North Carolina] and college [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], really was not history about us.  It was history that left us out, and my history books didn't have anything to do about black people in it.  Now there were some history books about slavery, but that didn't do me any good.  So, history, in my opinion, ought to be complete as opposed to history of some of the people as opposed to history from all of the people.  That's my concern about--history.

Speaker 1: And, how would you like to be remembered, Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols]?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Simply as one who is interested in doing the best I can for everybody that I can do something, and if I don't do what I can do then I have not done what I want to do.
Story_ID: 196898
Speaker 1: Dr. Nichols [sic. HistoryMaker Owen Nichols], what do you think, or what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I did something to help my fellow people, and when I say my fellow people, I was talking mainly about African American people, but I also want to do something to help anybody else that I can help somebody do.  It doesn't make any difference in that regard.
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you, and why?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that stands out most to me is the fact that I've been married to the most wonderful person in the world [Delores Nichols] for fifty-two years.  (Laughter) That's been my life, believe me, and if she's happy with me, then I'm happy with me.
Story_ID: 196899
Speaker 1: And any regrets?  Is there anything that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know of anything that I would have done different from the way that I have done it.  I'm pleased with what I've done so far and my hope is that I would be here long enough to do something else.
Speaker 1: Do you think you would have chosen a different career path?
Speaker 2: Not really.  As a matter of fact, when I first started working, my philosophy was that I did not want to stay in one job but so long.  I wanted to move from career to career to career rather than simply have one career and stay in it.  I did not want to do that, and in effect that's what I was able to do.  I've had many different jobs, as you well know, and the main reason is that I wanted to move from place to place.  Now, I stayed at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] a long time, but I had so many responsibilities it was like having several different careers anyway, and as I said to you, three different people replaced me when I retired (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what message do you have, or do you give, to your children [Bryan Nichols and Diane Nichols] and your grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very simple message.  The secret to success is not to do what you like to do, but to like what you have to do.  Just that simple.
