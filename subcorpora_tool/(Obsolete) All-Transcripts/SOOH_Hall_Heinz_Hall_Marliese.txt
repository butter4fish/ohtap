 Wilson  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  Wilson  My name is Latasha Wilson and I am with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University Library. Today is  September 21, 2010. I am in Stillwater, Oklahoma at the home of Heinz  and Marliese Hall. I will be interviewing Heinz and Marliese today as  part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series. Thank you for  having me here today.  You   re quite welcome.  I understand you both were born, and grew up, in Germany. Can we  start out today by having you tell me about your childhood, about your  family and your time growing up?  I was born in 1926. I grew up in a reasonably small town of 17,000  called Schwenningen, which now has grown to about 84,000 and it has  merged with another city called Villingen. My childhood years were  reasonably fun for a child, from zero to ten years. When I grew up, until  1933, we still lived in the Weimar Republic. After 1933, things rapidly  changed into something which I much rather would forget.  And what about you?  Well, I grew up in exactly the same town. I was born in 1930. I didn   t  know my husband at all at that time, not until after the war  World War  II . I could say about my childhood, I grew up really during the war. The  time was not very pleasant for a child. My father was in the war and my  mother raised us children. She had to work in a factory and we kind of  raised ourselves. The time I remember growing up as a child you just  lived day by day and would take it as it comes.  You said until you were ten you had a good childhood.  5  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  Well, I had a good childhood    if you go by childhood I figure ten years  is when you are still a child. I was born in    26, which means I was ten  years old in 1936. By that time the political climate in Germany  had  changed , which a child of ten really couldn   t care less about. At ten  years of age, most German children, girls and boys, had to join either the  Jungvolk or the Jungmaedel, which were organizations of the Nazis. In  these organizations,  the kids could do things like camping, exercise, and  other activities which children enjoy, but they also were  educated to  look at things  in a nationalistic, socialistic way .   If I could render an opinion, these organizations were  something like  the Boy Scouts in this country except they had political overtones.  As  an example, I learned  how to shoot with a rifle which essentially was  the same rifle that the army used, with the exception that it was .22  caliber.  Another example is  I learned how to throw objects which  resembled hand grenades, about the same weight. This was propagated  in competition once a year. You had to run, you had to high jump, you  had to broad jump. I have forgotten whether we had to run 3,000 meters  or not, but this was all over Germany on the same Saturday.  So you were both members of this?  Yes.  I was in the Jungmaedel but I skipped a lot. My parents  were called  about this, but they did not seem to mind that I was absent .  How old were you when you began school?  Both of us went to grade school. This was from first grade to eighth  grade. I was seven years old  when I started and Marliese was six. You  attend for eight years, so until the time you are fourteen or fifteen.  This  was the normal education of children in Germany. After you  completed  grade school , you went into an apprenticeship,  boys and girls did , of  whatever you wanted to become. If you wanted to become a machine  builder or tool and die maker, a baker or any profession, you had to  absolve an apprenticeship for four years, until you were eighteen  or  nineteen. Upon successful completion, you then earned your  journeyman   s license, and could obtain a job in that field.   There  was another option after grade school for people who wanted to  go into administration or business . They went into Realschule, or  Gymnasium today, and they stayed in school until they were eighteen  years old. So you had actually two diversions.  When you were young, do you remember hearing much about World  6  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  H. Hall  War I?  I did.  I did not.  My father was a mountain soldier in World War I. He served in the  Middle East for a little while. He was on a tour of Turkey, a tour of the  Balkans, and  upon his return  he fought the Alpinis in the  Dolomites in  Italy , which evidently was a quiet war. He belonged to a company  which transported their weapons by mules into the mountains and they  evidently exchanged fire every so often with the Italians and the Italians  threw some stuff over the other way.  I know that he was shot in the  foot, but it healed.  By the way, my father   s lieutenant was  Erwin   Rommel,  also known as the Desert Fox, or Wuestenfuchs .  Really?  Yes, my father   s lieutenant was Rommel. I met Rommel once, when he  was a Major, at the Christmas party where he came to my hometown and  was among these mountain soldiers.  Marliese, you said that your family didn   t talk about the First World  War much and that they were     I don   t even know if my father was in the First World War.  No, he couldn   t be,  because he would have been only fourteen years  old, which is too young .  And you mentioned you skipped a lot of activities with the Jungmaedels?  I did.  Were politics discussed openly?  Not in my family, no. We usually would not speak anything in the street.  I had two sisters. We were forbidden to listen to any of the radio stations  outside of what we could receive on the Volksempf  nger.  Well, Hitler was very good   very shrewd. The radios which he sold in  Germany used to be called Volksempf  nger, people   s receivers, or  Kleinempf  nger, small receivers.  The Volksempf  nger cost about 78  DM, and their reception  was rather limited. You couldn   t get to the  outside. You probably could get Switzerland, and maybe Luxembourg,  but that was about as far as it went. So we didn   t hear anything from  7  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  England, we didn   t hear anything from anywhere else. My family, on the  other hand, had a nice Blaupunkt receiver,  which cost about 500  Reichsmark,  where I could get Radio Rabat  and Radio Moscow  on  shortwave. I could even get the United States.  I remember hearing  Thomas Mann several times on Radio Moscow.   I grew up in a little bit different environment than she did. My father  was a Social Democrat and my mother was left of that. We could talk  reasonably open in our house because I was the only son and I wouldn   t  go out and say,    My father is a Social Democrat and he hates Hitler.    He  used to have a saying when the war began, he said,    We lost World War  I and we   re going to win this one, too.     Did you have sisters?  No, I   m the only child.  Were there some values and principles you learned growing up that  stuck with you throughout your life?  Yes, I would say I   m anti-war. I don   t think there is anything good that  comes out of it. A lot of innocent people get killed. I just don   t like war  at all.  What about you?  (Laughs) Well, I went to a military prep school of the Air Force when I  was fourteen years old in the city of Leipzig and we were trained to  become technical personnel for the Air Force. They had these schools  throughout Germany. They had people who were trained in either  building aircraft as a specialty, maintaining engines or maintaining  electronics. I think these were about the three things they did. Now,  when you were fourteen years old, you went out of the Jungvolk and you  went into the Hitler Youth, and  Hitler Youth was included in our  military prep school.   The Hitler Youth had branches. Some branches were associated with the  Navy, some were associated with motorized vehicles, and some were  associated with flying. In the school that I was associated with we  learned how to fly and how to build sailplanes.  Honestly, I did not know  there were concentration camps . I did not  know until the war was over what was going on. I don   t know what to  say. For years, it bothered me very much and I was even sometimes  ashamed to say I was born in Germany because of what happened. When  we came here to Stillwater, I met a lot of nice Jewish people and today  8  Wilson  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  we are still very good friends. It   s alright, you know. Honest to  goodness, I was really ashamed because of what happened. You feel  guilty. I was a child and I had no control, yet it is something that still  bothers me today.  When I came here to the United States, the first thing I think I realized  was we came and lived in Oklahoma City for six years. We came in  1952. I could go on a bus and I could go downtown in Oklahoma City  and I couldn   t figure out why all the blacks went in the back. I was still a  foreigner; I didn   t get my citizenship until five years later, but I could sit  where I wanted, I could go to John A. Brown  department store , I could  go to the restroom, I could go anywhere. There were still signs   indicating black or white . Yet, those were American citizens. They  fought in the war, and I was a foreigner, so to speak, and I had in those  things more rights than they had.  Do you remember growing up not being able to say certain things in the  street?  Oh, yes   I could say it at home, but I couldn   t say it in the streets. But if you were  fourteen or fifteen years old, nobody paid much attention to you. The  city of Leipzig was known as the  fur  industry in Germany. This is  where furriers lived. Even in 1942,    43, you could see people with the  Star of David walking the streets. They just didn   t have enough time to  get out.  At what age did you realize that there was actually going to be another  war?  You mean in Germany? This is difficult to explain to anybody here  because you were educated in school about certain things. We were told  that Germany needed more Lebensraum  living space , and the only  place where we could get Lebensraum was in the East, so this is where  the German expansion started to go.  Did you go to war voluntarily?  I went to the military school and we were told, or our contract said,  when we reached the age of eighteen, first of all we would have to go  into something called Arbeitsdienst  labor service  for about three  months. These were people who worked on streets and  other civil  projects . After that, on my birthday, I had to report to an airport and I  started my time as an airman in the German Air Force.  9  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  And he was three months in the war and four years in prison, as a POW.  We were supposed to go to Orl  ans, or actually the town was called  Olivet, which was outside of Orl  ans, France. By the time we got there,  the British were already there. We played infantry and I was on a patrol  to find out how far the Americans  had advanced. We had no maps, no  radios, no GPS, so in order  to find out we had to ask the French. Well  they would tell us where the Americans were. They told us some  cockamamie story and then phoned the Americans and said,    Here, we  have some Germans.    And that   s the way I  was taken prisoner .  What day  did you begin your time in the air force ? You said your  birthday.  My birthday was in June  and this was  1944.  After we were captured  in France, the Americans  shipped us to North Africa.  There we were  transported to a camp in the Sahara where we stayed for fourteen days.  In the camp they sorted out the German army troops from the SS   Schutzstaffel . After we were separated, they shipped the Army and Air  prisoners to the United States from Oran,  Algeria  and the SS troops  stayed with the French.  They put us in a convoy of Liberty ships, which  were little 5,000-ton cargo ships  made in the US during war time. There  were 500 prisoners onboard our ship as well as damaged war goods,  such as tanks, vehicles and aircraft that were being hauled back to the  US for repair.  We went through the Straits of Gibraltar to get out on the  Atlantic in late October   hurricane season.  At one point,  our convoy  evidently got surrounded by a wolf pack of submarines. The wind was  reasonably high and they took all the POWs on deck, flew flags that they  were transporting German POWs and we never got hit by the  submarines.  We were at sea for twenty-one days, and we did encounter  a hurricane.    What did you eat while you were at sea?    We got C rations. Twice a day we got two cans. One can contained  either pork and beans or meat and hash browns, and the other can  contained a small bag of coffee or cocoa, five cookies, toilet paper and  three cigarettes.   We eventually landed in Norfolk, Virginia. When we got to Norfolk, all  500 soldiers, while standing on deck, stark naked and were inspected for  lice. When we came off the ships anyone that had a mark on them   indicating they had lice  had their hair shaved off  and was sprayed  down with DDT .  To my best recollection I remember that the German propaganda said  10  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  the Americans didn   t have any chewing gum anymore, they had no tires  for their cars, and no bra implants for women.  I found this to be very  untrue.   You found out there was a lot of stuff there which they didn   t tell you.  The German propaganda told us they had absolutely nothing in the  United States. Norfolk, Virginia had cigarette factories, there were cars  everywhere. B-17s were lined up on the airfields to be sent out to the  European theater. There must have been a hundred B-17s with the wings  folded up just waiting to get on the ships. To myself, I thought, there  must be something wrong about this propaganda bit.  After we came on land, we went into a  steam engine  train, rode down  the Tennessee Valley, and  in two or three days  I wound up in Clinton,  Mississippi, outside of Jackson.  It was a cold November day when I  arrived in Clinton. I have never seen a sky so blue in my life.  Isn   t Camp Clinton unique in that many of the high ranking officers  captured in World War II were brought there?  Yes,  I think all  of the generals were kept there, but they were kept  separate from us. Some of them had their own houses and even their  own cars.    What did you do at Camp Clinton?   If you do some research, you   re going to find out that the German POWs  built a scale model of the Mississippi River outside of Clinton,  Mississippi,  the Mississippi River Basin Model . I was only there for  six months or so, then they shipped me to a little town, Brookhaven,  Mississippi, which was about fifty or sixty miles south of Jackson,  Mississippi, almost at the Louisiana border, within forty or fifty miles of  the Louisiana border.  I had an aunt in Oklahoma City who immigrated in 1921 to the U.S., so I  wrote a letter to her. However, I didn   t know her address, so  I  addressed  the letter to    Mr. John Effinger, Oklahoma City    and sent it  off. About three months later, somebody called  from the headquarters  in Clinton. I was informed I would have to return to Clinton from  Brookhaven. The person  said,    You   re going to have to come to  Clinton, Mississippi. You have an aunt and an uncle that have come to  visit you.     I stayed two years in Brookhaven.  Our job was to cut  pulp wood. We  had to cut tree  trunks  in five-foot lengths. A stack from two people had  11  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  to be eight feet by four feet high and eight feet long, peeled.  They had an alligator, too.  Yes, we had a pet alligator  from the swamp. Its name was Bacon. We  used it as a mascot when we played soccer. We would play soccer and  handball, which is also played on a soccer field. We built a tennis court,  and we also played table tennis.  Once in awhile, we found a  watermelon patch and we might partake in a watermelon or two. One  time we came upon a tree that had nuts on it. There were some down on  the ground and we opened them up and they tasted like walnuts. Of  course, they were pecans, which we didn   t have in Germany. We  probably ate the whole crop of this farmer   s trees. He came and told our  foreman that we ate  132 worth of pecans from his orchard, and we had  to work overtime to pay him back. (Laughs) But it was a good time.  Mississippi was great.  Was there much security?  Let me tell you about the security.  In order to go to the jobsite, we had  guards drive us in trucks to the place to cut pulp wood.  They unloaded  us and we went into the woods to cut trees. After everyone had  completed the work that was required, around four o   clock in the  afternoon, we came back to the trucks. One guard had forgotten his rifle  in the woods because he fell asleep under a tree. So here were thirty  POWs looking for this guard   s rifle. We finally found it.   How was the food at the camp?    Generally pretty good. But one time,  we had potato salad and cheese  sandwiches. When I ate the potato salad, I didn   t like it, so I gave it to  my friend. He ate everything. And within five minutes, everybody got  sick. They either had to throw up or they had diarrhea. So, we came back   to the camp  and there were 230 people who essentially had all the  same symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting. The infirmary was just a  disaster.  But they did have an infirmary for us if we needed it.   And then   I forgot what date it was, I think in March   they said we  were going to go home. The foreman which we had, his name was Mr.  Henry. He was a very nice person. He used to borrow money from the  POWs so he could go to Louisiana and buy whiskey. He used to pay us  back by Tuesday.  The last day  before we were supposed to go home,  we built a stack  between two trees which was sixteen feet tall and two feet wide. Then  we made a little walkway and we stuck little bitty branches  on either  12  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  side of the walkway . Mr. Henry came to check  our days work . When  we got  back to camp, we were told ,    President Truman decided you   re  not going to be let go.    So we had to go back to work again the next day.  You mentioned the foreman borrowed money from the POWs.  He was a civilian. Mr. Henry was poorer than we were.  How did you have money?  I had an aunt that used to give me money.  Didn   t you get paid for your work?  We got paid in camp money thirty-two dollars a month; eighty cents a  day. My aunt gave me money.  She came to visit me twice and  she   d  slip me some money here and there, so I had money.  And chocolate chip cookies, too. (Laughs)  We used to get whiskey into the camp, too.  So what would you use your money on?  Just things like that. We had a person who used to come and take the  refuse from the kitchen for his pigs. I   ve forgotten his name. Do you  remember? We visited him later on. He brought these containers. They  were filled up with refuse from the kitchen; kitchen scraps. He gave it to  the pigs. I gave him the money. When the containers came in empty and  clean, there was a bottle of whisky in there, or two bottles of whisky,  whatever. The guard never could figure out how somebody got drunk.   We ended up staying in Brookhaven until sometime in April, probably.  When we left Mississippi we took a train to a camp in New York.  They  shipped us from the United States over to England. Then we went to  Scotland and to Liverpool, where we disembarked, drove down to  London, and for the last two years I was in a POW camp in London.  Would you say overall, did you have a good time as a POW?  Do you think I would have come back?  It sounds like a good time   I enjoyed the United States. I liked the culture, I liked the music.  On  Saturday nights we listened to the Lucky Strike program on the radio. I  13  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  remember LSMFT      Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco.    I listened to  Dorothy Collins, Snooky Lanson. I especially enjoyed jazz.  It was fun  here. I had no problems. The same thing was true in England. I had no  problems in England. In England you could go out  of the camp . You  had to take your POW clothes. I walked around in London. I went to the  British Museum, to the Tate Gallery, to the National Gallery, and to  Hyde Park where I listened to  political speakers of all sorts .  And then you just had to be back by nightfall?  You had to back by a certain time. Yes, we had English uniforms and  they had a green diamond in the back, so everyone knew this  was a  POW . Now, if you knew some people, you could stash some civilian  clothes with them, go over there, take your POW clothes, exchange  them, then you could go to town and nobody knew you were a POW.   Also, if you knew someone, you could get permission to stay overnight  with them. My friend who was also a POW was a butler in a household  and I stayed the night there once.   What if someone didn   t come back at the end of the day?  We had two people that didn   t come home. One was a trumpeter in the  camp band and he became a doorman in a hotel. I passed him every so  often. The other guy just disappeared. The war was over and most of the  British in general didn   t have a great hatred of the German POWs. So I  have not many complaints about my time except I lost four years of my  life.  So where were you when you heard the war had officially ended?  Tylertown, Mississippi. Seven o   clock in the morning at a filling station.  The people were running around;    Nazis Surrender    was in the papers.  That   s where I knew that the war was over.  And  the next month  you went to England for two more years  as a  POW . When was your time as a POW officially over?  That was over in May of 1948.  And they just told you,    You   ll be released today   ?  Then they said,    You   re going to go home.    They took us on a ferry and  they sent us to  Hoeck van  Holland. From there they took us on a train  to some camp in northern Germany. They said,    As far as we   re  concerned, tomorrow morning you can go home.    We brought cigarettes  with us, lots of cigarettes, which they couldn   t get in Germany at that  14  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  time, and we bribed everybody. A friend of mine who I met in this camp  and I bribed a conductor from a train and he let us ride in a post car on  the train. As we got close to my hometown and we bribed a taxi driver  that took us home to my home town.  And what did you find when you returned home?  My mother knew I was coming, so she had a Torte made for me, a nice  cake at home. I took a shower and went to town, to see what my town  looked like.  How did it look?   The railroad ran east and west through town, and everything to the  south of the railroad was essentially destroyed.  In those days in  Germany, the currency   s value essentially was zero. Money didn   t mean  anything. Everything depended on a bartering system. If you wanted to  buy a pair of shoes, you had to find out what the guy wanted for the pair  of shoes. He would tell you he needed a clock or a watch, for example.  So you had to find a watch, give it to the guy, then you could get the  shoes. There was no money exchange.  Then the currency reform occurred in July of 1948. All the bank  accounts were devalued by a factor of ten. Whatever you had anywhere,  you started out with forty D eutsche  Marks. Everybody.  After that, all  merchandise appeared in stores like magic.  You could get cigarettes,  chocolate, wine   everything you wanted, it was there. But prior to that,  you couldn   t get anything, you had to barter. It was a strange time over  there. Then things started, slowly but surely, going back to normal. I  came home in    48 and we had to go through de-Nazification, whether  you were in Hitler Youth or whether you belonged to the Nazi party.  You got to know me then and you wanted to come back to the United  States. We had to wait then four years to come over here.  And we had to get married. I mean, we had to get married due to the  fact     He means, we had to get married because that   s the only way his aunt  and uncle could sponsor us.  I told this story to my doctor here and he says,    Uh-huh       (Laughter)  Because I said we had to get married   So how did you meet?  15  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  My oldest sister, Mathilda, she got married and I was at the dance. I  think that   s how we met, in a caf  , didn   t we?  Yes.  And he knew my younger sister     And your older sister, she went to school with me.  Yes, but he asked my younger sister    well I don   t know what he asked  her.  I just asked her where you lived. So I went over to  Marliese   s  house  and talked to her.  That   s how we got acquainted. Then we started dating and he asked me  if I wanted to come to the United States with him and if you love him  and he loves you, you agree to everything. (Laughs) So yeah, we got  married very young   I was nineteen and Heinz was twenty-four. Two  years later was had a son. He was six months old when we came over  here. We have another son; he was born here in Stillwater. And they  both have degrees from  OSU . Mike has an entomology degree. His  name is Michael and  the other son is  Mark Stephan Hall.  He works for the sheriff.  He has a degree in sociology.  And Mike is a professor at LSU in Shreveport. They have a pecan  research station. Those are the nuts which we stole   We have so many stories to tell. Toward the end of the war, our families  had very little food in Germany. We had to trade tablecloths and goods,  things for my mother, for potatoes and things like that. We went on  farms just so we could eat. I have a lot of things to tell but I usually like  to keep things inside and not talk about it. You kind of don   t want to  think about those things anymore. He has a funny story to tell.  Which one?  The one about the egg in France. When you stole an egg, remember?  No, not eggs, they were peaches  We went into an orchard; there were  fifty German airmen in an orchard. This French guy came along with a  pitchfork and he chased fifty soldiers out of a peach orchard  We were  all kids, seventeen, eighteen years old.  16  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  Yes, I could tell you about when we got occupied by the French in the  afternoon. We were hiding in the forest because the planes were coming  over. They said,    The French are going to be here     so we ran home and  then we went into the cellar. My mother screamed at us to come down in  the cellar and we three girls, we just were too curious. We went out in a  hole and we peaked out and I could see the first tanks coming down the  street. Then my mother screamed again that we had to go down in the  cellar and everybody got locked up. My mother locked my older sister  up in the attic because they were saying people got raped and all kinds  of stuff. So I could tell stories, which takes I don   t know how long. We  had to stand in line to wait for a loaf of bread. I would have a lot to say,  but I don   t want to.  You said your aunt moved to Oklahoma City in 1921. Why did she come  to Oklahoma City?  They had relatives. In those days you had to have a sponsor. Even when  we came over here we had to have a sponsor. You couldn   t just walk in  and say,    I   m going to come here.    You had to have somebody in case  something happened, like if you didn   t get a job, they would vouch for  you or would send you home again. They came over, they had relatives  in Oklahoma City, so then I had some people in Oklahoma. We lived in  Oklahoma City for six years, and then we came to Stillwater.  Because you got a job here?  I found a job here in the Department of Physics  at Oklahoma State  University .  So when you decided to move to the United States what was the  perception of your family and friends?  In Germany, or here?  In Germany.  Well my mother didn   t like it and my father was not too happy that we  moved away, but I think my mother said,    Well, if things are better for  you then go ahead.    Things were pretty bad in 1948. I think the United  States is the richest country, next is Japan, third is Germany. They do  pretty well.  Marliese, what did your family think about you moving to the United  States?  My sister told me my father took it very hard. My mother just thought I  17  Wilson  M. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  H. Hall  married and I belonged with my husband and this is the way it should  be.  Did they ever come visit you here?  No, they did not come to visit, but my sister came to visit and we went  back to Germany and visited once in awhile. Last time I was there was  when my father was ninety years old. That was the last time I was over  there, for his ninetieth birthday.  Wow. What year was that?  It was 1989. He was born in 1899, my father. Oh my, time flies  It  sounds so long ago now, doesn   t it?  So what was the process of coming to the United States? I have heard  there were only so many people allowed from various countries?  Yes.  We had to be here five years and we had to have proof that we were very  good citizens.  I had to register for the draft when I came here. The war in Korea was  going on.  And that was before you were a citizen?  Yes. When you came to the United States, the first thing you had to do  was register for the draft. My uncle didn   t tell me this. I went to the Post  Office one time. I saw a poster there that read    Attention Immigrants: If  you want to stay in the United States you are going to have to register  for the draft. If you don   t register for the draft, you will be deported or  you will go to jail and have to pay  10,000.    So I went down to the draft  board and I got classified as 5A   too old for the draft and I had a son. I  was classified 5A so I never had to go. When Vietnam was happening  they had the lottery system. My oldest son   s number was 362 so he was  fortunate enough not to have to go.  What was the reaction of people in Oklahoma towards you? Did you feel  like you were welcome?  Yes.  I ran into some problems with some people; not very many. I am a tool  and die maker by trade. When I applied for a job, one man said,    Well, I  18  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  will hire you as a machinist helper and we   re not going to be prejudiced  due to the fact that you are German.    But in general we didn   t run into  any problems. We just didn   t.  Did you speak English pretty well when you came?  I spoke English because I learned it in England and some in the United  States.  I did not.  How did you learn English once you came here?  When I came here I spoke French.  How did you learn English?  Well, I went to evening school while we lived in Oklahoma City.  Now I speak better English than German.  The vocabulary     Yes, the vocabulary is much larger now.   While I was in  Oklahoma City I worked for  Folding Carrier Basket  Company . The owner was Jewish and was named Goldman, S. N.  Goldman. (He was married to the daughter of the Katz family of  Stillwater.)  S. N. Goldman, along with Fred Young, who was a  mechanic, invented the first shopping cart, and this company produced  them.  His assistant was also Jewish and was from Germany. His name  was Kurt Schweitzer, and he spoke German as well as I did.  Were you planning on staying in Oklahoma when you came?  I guess so.  I think if I would have a choice again or knew what I know today, I  would have moved to Colorado in the mountains. I love the mountains.  But I like the people here in Oklahoma.  It   s not too far to Colorado. It   s only 500 miles.  I also like the desert, but not as much as you. (Laughs) We have traveled  a lot.  19  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Mostly west.  Tell me about your life here in Stillwater. What was your profession?  At OSU, I was the manager of an instrument shop for physics and  chemistry. We built instruments which the physics professor couldn   t  readily buy off the shelf, so they came down to the shop and told me  what they would like to have done. We had about four or five people  working there and we built what they wanted. That   s it in a nutshell. I  did it for thirty years, and Marliese worked for Biochemistry.  As a lab tech for Dr. Franklin Leech, a very nice person. Very, very nice.  I   m very grateful to him. He was giving me an opportunity and he was  teaching me, helping me along all the way. I worked there for twenty-four  years.  I wanted to ask you about how you think most Germans felt towards the  United States or toward other countries after the war. What is your  perception of that?  Well, that is hard to say. I think maybe most of the Germans were a little  bit a-political. They got defeated pretty badly, and I think they looked at  the United States as maybe the savior of civilization, because in West  Germany they did not have a good impression of the Russians. If I  would have to guess, the Russians probably had a good reason to be as  mean to the Germans as they were because of what they had done to  their country when they invaded it and when they retreated. There were  terrible atrocities on either side. So they did not think as well of the  Russians as they did of the United States.  We were occupied by the French. The French had an intrinsic hatred of  the Germans since 1870, when they lost Alsace-Lorraine. Then they got  it back in 1918. There was an animosity between the Germans and the  French, which has subsided all together now. They get along quite well.  Italy, I don   t know. We had lots of Italians living in our home town.  They were mostly people who did masonry work, terrazzo, stuff of this  sort. They had good ice cream and ice cream parlors.  Gelato?  Yes. Yes, yes, yes. And then Germany used Turks and Yugoslavs as we  essentially use Mexicans, Hondurans, Puerto Ricans, for menial labor,  which no one here wants to do. If you drive between here and Colorado  or anywhere else and you see road work, it   s mostly Latinos. Look at the  people who do the roofs   mostly Latinos. They are hard working  people.  20  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Hard working people and very kind.  So were the Serbians, the Yugoslavs, and the Turks, which Germany  brought in from those countries to do the menial labor in Germany  because nobody wanted to do it.  Today it hasn   t changed. It   s the same everywhere.  Have you stayed in touch with anyone who you met in the war who was  in your POW camp or some friends that you made?  I don   t know anyone from the POW camp but I stay in touch with some  people who went to school with me through Skype. We talk about what  goes on.  The person I talk to  is as old as I am. He had the same  education that I had. We went to similar schools except in another town  and he  did his apprenticeship in electronics . We talk probably once a  week or so, sometimes for an hour, about what goes on in our home  town, in our dialect,  which is Alemannisch, or Alemannic German. It is  closely related to Swiss German.  Now do you speak German?  Yes. I learned German in Mannheim, so some Mannheimerisch.  Do you still speak? Mannheimerisch. Mannheim is a logically arranged  city, isn   t it? Like Faecher  a fan . It came out like that.  I hear that you have several interesting hobbies. Do you want to talk any  about your passions?  I do photography, which is probably my number one hobby. I have a  model train, which is dismantled right now. I was told to dismantle it.  (Laughs)  I collect Marx-like Toys, which are tin toys.  And then I grow  cactus. I was always fascinated by cactus, because we don   t have any in  Europe. I mean, they don   t grow there naturally. So I collected cactus.  At one time I had six hundred of them. I still have about 450 now. I was  fascinated by the flowers.  They are beautiful. Some of them are absolutely gorgeous.  And I observe vultures. That   s another one of my hobbies. Marliese, too,  we like vultures. The way they fly.  So do you go on trips just to watch vultures?  Yes. We go here in Payne County and we shut the car off and let it roll  to see how close we can come to them  without disturbing them .  21  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  Wilson  M. Hall  H. Hall  M. Hall  Wilson  H. Hall  M. Hall  H. Hall  Last Sunday we could get real close to them.  Within twenty feet.  There was an armadillo lying on the street and there were five of them,  but two of them flew away. Three of them stayed and we came closer  and closer and closer. It is interesting to watch. And I like when they fly  off.   Showing photos of vultures.   Wow. This is from last Sunday?  Yes, through the car window. And there was one in there that I cut out   of the picture on the computer . It was a very young one. The young  one   s head is not red yet, it   s still black. And you can see the nostrils on  the vulture there. They can smell.  That   s fascinating. I   ve never seen one that close.  Most people do not like them. We like county road driving.  I like small towns here in Oklahoma. Little towns. Ghost towns.  When you see those old farm houses, just the one room maybe, I always  wish people would have left a little note somewhere so we could find out  more about them, about how they lived, how long they lived in there,   what life was like and how they got to Oklahoma .  When history is written about you, how would you like to be  remembered?  I don   t know. Probably the best way to say it is, do not dislike anybody  until you know them.  I think that about wraps it up.  There is so much hate going on today. The people just throw words out  and then they let it linger. If you take a pillow, cut a hole in it, and let the  feathers fly, you are never going to recover everything which has flown  away. There is too much hate going on in this world. I have learned to  tolerate a lot of people. Once you get to know people, you have a  different opinion about them.  I am sure I have made mistakes and I  hope people forgive me. I have done some good things that I hope  people remember.   22  Wilson  Well I really appreciate you letting me interview you today. Thank you.  -------  -------
