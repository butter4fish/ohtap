 Finchum Today is November 6, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we are in  McAlester, Oklahoma, to speak with Bonnie Waters. This is part of our  Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life project, so thank you for having us  today.  Waters I   m glad to help you.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Waters Okay. On January 6, 1911 a girl was born to Mae and Will Kay, K-A-Y.  Finchum K-A-Y. That   s your last name, Kay?  Waters Uh-huh. That   s what I was going to name my little girl. It turned out to  be a little boy. (Laughs)  Finchum What did you name him?  Waters Robert Gary.  Finchum Robert Gary. Where were you born?  Waters I was born in Bixby, Tulsa County.  Finchum Tulsa County, How did you end up in McAlester?  Waters Well, I came down here and worked for the WPA  Works Progress  Administration . From there, I   ve been on Relief the rest of my life. I  worked for the WPA, and I met a boy who was working for the CCC  5   Civilian Conservation Corps . I   ve worked for all the Relief programs.  I said I   ve been on Relief all my life. I started out, oh I was giving away   commodities .  Finchum Well, let   s back up. Where did you go to elementary school?  Waters Well I started school here. Then, we moved to Bixby when I was a baby  I guess. Anyways, little. Then, we moved to Eufaula. Dad had been  down and bought us a house. Mama and I had came on the train, I guess  from Muskogee. I don   t know where we got on it. I remember getting  off of the train when I got here. It   s my half-brother, he met us in  Eufaula. I said Dad had bought a house. Of course, I was real anxious  about that, a whole new life.  Finchum A whole new life  About how old were you when that was happening?  Waters Oh eight, ten, somewhere like that.  Finchum Old enough to be aware.  Waters Yeah.  Finchum So you had a half-brother?  Waters Yes.  Finchum Any other siblings?  Waters No.  Finchum What did your dad do for a living?  Waters Well, in the later years he had a garage. He and my brother had a  garage. Repaired cars.  Finchum So you had a step-mother?  Waters No, my brother had the step-mother. My dad had been married and  when his wife died, he had a five-year-old boy left. Then when the five-year-  old became a twelve-year-old, he married my mother who was  Mae Crittenden, C-R-I-T-T-E-N-D-E-N. Crittenden, in the Fort Smith,  Arkansas, area. She lived at Waldron.  Finchum How did they meet? Do you know?  6  Waters I don   t know. That   s one of the things that I never did ask. I wondered  how he got from Georgia to Arkansas and how they met. At the time, it  just was Mama and Dad. It   d always been like that. I didn   t wonder  why. They were just, that   s just the way it was. But now, I   d just give   anything to know . There   s nobody I can ask.  Finchum So he grew up in Georgia? Your father?  Waters I don   t know how old he was when they moved.  Finchum Well, what did his parents do for a living? Do you know?  Waters My father   s parents?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Waters I don   t know. He had been an orphan, I think, most of his life, and most  of his talking about it.  Finchum It is a mystery then how he ended up in the Fort Smith area.  Waters Yeah.  Finchum So where did you graduate from high school?  Waters Eufaula.  Finchum In what year?  Waters Nineteen twenty-seven.  Finchum Right before the Depression hit. Did you work while you were in  school?  Waters No. I didn   t have time to work.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject in school?  Waters Yeah, I think if I had to name one it was always spelling.  Finchum That is a pretty good one to have. Did you play sports?  Waters No. I never participated in any sports.  Finchum Well, after you graduated from high school, what did you do?  7  Waters Well, I won a scholarship to Draughon   s Business College in Oklahoma  City. I had had all of it in high school, but I thought,    Well that would  be neat. I wouldn   t have to study,    which I didn   t. I didn   t have to. The  bookkeeping I didn   t like, so I dropped that and put most of my time on  shorthand, which I loved. And I still, as long as I can see, if I want to  remember something, I still use my shorthand.  Finchum They don   t use it much anymore, do they?  Waters No, it   s been pass   a long time.  Finchum A long time. That was a big step to go from home to Oklahoma City at  eighteen. Did you go by yourself?  Waters No, Dad and Mama took me. Found me a room out on Fifth Street.  Finchum Dropped you off and then went back.  Waters Well, of course they saw where I was going to be, and then they headed  back to Eufaula.  Finchum How long were you in Oklahoma City?  Waters About six or eight months.  Finchum Then graduated?  Waters No, just however long my scholarship was for. It wasn   t  long .  Finchum Then, what did you do after that?  Waters Well, an attorney in Eufaula  Charles Whitaker  had contacted my dad  and said he (the attorney) wanted Dad to take me out of school. Of  course, he was going to give me a job in his law office. Dad said,    No.  She   s not getting out of school. It   ll be out in two months.    He   d get so  mad. When he got super mad, the word is tam,    By tam    was the worst  thing he could say.    By tam, she won   t learn anything in three months.     Dad would say,    Well when she   s done. She   s not getting out of  school.    When I finished he was still there in his law office. By that  time, his son was state representative, so I worked for the two of them  which was not much fun.  Joe  Whitaker  was in the city. Course, Mr. Whitaker was in Eufaula.  We   d do it Papa   s way first. When Joe would come home over the  weekend,    Oh no. You got to it this way.    Okay, we   d do it over to suit  Papa.    Oh no Dad  No.    They   d fight between themselves. I   d wait  8  until Charlie, that was Papa, got over being mad. Then, as I said, if he  was real mad,    By tam      One day I didn   t have a thing to do, so I cleaned off his desk. I must not  have had a lick of sense, but anyway I knew what was junk.    My tam   What   s happened to my desk?    I said,    I straightened it up        Don   t  ever touch it again     I said,    You couldn   t find anything on it        Don   t  ever touch it again.       Okay.    I stayed until I decided that I wanted to go  somewhere else.  I sure learned a lot. One of the things, he said,    Take a letter. Mail it  Butenschoen.    I said,    What?       Mail it to Butenschoen. I said,    How do  you spell it?       Look it up. Use the dictionary.    I didn   t even know what  he was saying any more than you do right now. It was a firm back east  somewhere. One of their names was Jevens. J-E-V-E-N-S. And  Butenschoen was the other one. And the Butenschoens still live in  Eufaula, some of them.  Finchum Can you spell that?  Waters Yeah, B-U-T-E-N-S-C-H-O-E-N. Put it all together and say it fast,  you   d never heard it before.    How do you spell it?       Look it up, by  tam  Look it up     I did though.  Finchum Where to start?  Waters There was a book, it was a name. I didn   t know what it was.  Finchum When you left there, where did you go?  Waters Well, one of the welfare programs had come into effect. We gave  away   I decided I wanted to be a caseworker. Oh how I regretted that.  From there the WPA, whatever the next program was. I went with all of  them. I wind up with twenty-seven years with the welfare, counting  here in Eufaula, too.  Finchum That was a pretty good career. Saw a lot of people.  Waters Yeah.  Finchum What were some of the things you would do with the WPA?  Waters Well, you   d go into the home and some of them were pitiful, pitiful. We  had certain things that we could give them. My area was out east of  Eufaula. Sandy and dirt, and the road, when it was wet, I   d get stuck.  When it was dry, I   d get stuck in the sand pile. The postman and store  9  owner whose name was Swick, S-W-I-C-K, said,    I   m sure getting tired  of pulling you out every day.    I said,    Well I   d never make it past you.  You stay where you are. Keep pulling.    He helped me when it was dry  or when it was wet. I   d get stuck in practically the same place on a dirt  road.  Finchum Driving a car?  Waters Uh-huh.  Finchum What kind? Do you remember?  Waters It was a Chevy. At that time they called them a coupe.  Finchum What did he pull you out with?  Waters He probably had a pickup.  Finchum When you were growing up did you have horses?  Waters No.  Finchum You didn   t grow up on the farm?  Waters No.  Finchum In town?  Waters I grew up one block from the city hall in Eufaula.  Finchum So you had an indoor bathroom?  Waters Oh no, but we got one. That was the happiest day of my life. I came  home from  school . We had big bedrooms in the house, of course I was  gone to school, they took a partition out where there had been two large  rooms, and made a bathroom, a small bathroom in the middle. It was  finished but I just couldn   t wait to get myself a bucket of paint to paint  the tub on the outside. Looking back, I painted it blue, of all colors.  (Laughs) Or maybe they had to paint, I don   t know. Anyway, we had a  blue bathtub.  Finchum And it was a happy day.  Waters Yep. It was a happy room   Finchum How did you do laundry?  10  Waters We had a screened in back porch. Mama had a colored woman that  would come wash for us on a board.  Finchum On a board?  Waters (Nods yes) Then, we bought a Maytag washer after that.  Finchum Another happy day.  Waters Oh yeah. That didn   t affect me like     Finchum Like an indoor bathroom?  Waters Uh-huh.  Finchum Maytags, been around a long time haven   t they?  Waters Yeah.  Finchum Well, did your mother sew your clothes?  Waters No. Oh she might make something, but by and large, she didn   t. I was  so short I had to find somebody that could make them to fit.  Finchum Ready-to-wear wasn   t around then?  Waters Oh no   Finchum What would you do for fun?  Waters I always enjoyed time off from work for Mr. Whitaker. Right next door  a girl lived, she just had a room there. I   d come home and eat. Then, she  and I would get out and walk around what they called    the loop    in  Eufaula. They   d go about six or eight blocks up around the Indian  boarding school and you   d wind like a hairpin. (Gestures turning). We  walked and of course we knew everybody along the route because we  made it nearly every night.  One of her stories, in later years, she married and moved away. She  married a, he was a doctor somewhere. I   ve forgotten even what state.  She was telling me that, of course at this time, she was married and had  one child. She said on the train coming home, somebody was talking to  her child and said,    Where are you going?    I don   t know if it was a boy  or a girl, but they said,    Going to Oufall.       You   re going where?        Oufall.    So, she asked her mother to interpret. He was saying Eufaula.  11  But the best he was saying was Ufall.    Where   s your daddy?        Oottawa.       Where?       Oottawa.    And I looked at her and she said,     That   s where we live.    I said,    Really you don   t still live in a place  like that.    There is an Ottawa, Minnesota. Her husband was a doctor  there. She   d tell that with a sinister laugh. She   d get going and she   d tell  that. But they are both hard to say; Eufaula and Ottawa. I   d never heard  of Ottawa. Course I think Minnesota is one of the very few states I  haven   t at least been through.  Finchum I don   t think I   ve ever been to Eufaula. Was it a big town?  Waters No. That   s where the Eufaula Dam is, under the Kerr Administration,  when he was governor.  Finchum So it flooded, some areas around? Did they have to take some farms to  make it?  Waters No. I never did understand what good it did, because it ate up hundreds  of acres of good farming land. One particular place had a several acre  pecan grove. Well, that   s all under water. I   ve forgotten how many  miles of steel iron they used, but a lot. I think they say it touches  eighteen different counties.  Finchum That   s a big lake   Waters It is a big lake.  Finchum It wasn   t there when you were young?  Waters Oh no.  Finchum It was later. Well, when you were young, did Eufaula have a movie  theatre?  Waters We had two  Same man had them, Mr. Roy Greason. One was the  Palace, and one the Princess. They were a block apart. Ten cents on  Saturday, and Sunday it was, I think it was twenty-five on Sunday.  Robbie and I went every night, my friend, she got a job in the bank  there.  Finchum Her name was Robin?  Waters Robbie.  Finchum Robbie. Short for Roberta or just Robbie?  12  Waters Just Robbie.  Finchum Just Robbie. So, you got to see a lot of movies?  Waters Well, they always had new ones. Of course, they didn   t have a different  one every night. They would run like two or three nights and then they  would change. Sunday, they would start a new circle.  Finchum Did you have a favorite one?  Waters The only one that I can even remember was Ramona  1928    I hear  you calling me. (Singing)  Finchum I don   t know.  Waters You don   t know it?  Finchum Can you sing more?  Waters No, there   s kind of some yodeling in it. It   s a pretty song,    I hear them  calling me sweet little Ramona.    I have trouble remembering over the  years.  Finchum It had some yodeling in it? Is that what you said?  Waters    I hear you calling me.     Finchum Doesn   t sound like a Western.  Waters No.  Finchum Well, tell me about meeting your husband.  Waters Well, Gene Waters came to McAlester to work on WPA. He was in the  office where I was working. That   s where I met him. We had one child.  Of course, they   re both dead now. If I didn   t have step-people, because  I was an only child.  Bishop You were an only child?  Waters Yeah, as far as family.  Bishop Just clarifying. Okay.  Waters Of course Dad had this boy, and he lived at home until he went to  World War II. Well, he still came up. I remember when he came back  13  from the war. I had already given them a little like a piece of tin, you  could see yourself in it. They called it a mirror, about that size,  (gestures) which he gave to me. I was so proud of it, when he got home.  Finchum World War I or II?  Waters Two.  Finchum That was your father   s son by a previous marriage, so your half-brother?  Waters My half-brother.  Finchum What was his name?  Waters Fred Lindsey.  Finchum Lindsey, Fred. You said he was twelve when you were born?  Waters I   m sorry, I have to kind of think. I can   t remember. No, he wasn   t that  old. I can   t remember how old.  Finchum That   s okay.  Waters I know he was so good to me. If I wanted something and Dad said no, I  didn   t worry too much. I knew if I could find him, I   d get whatever it  was I wanted. (Laughter) It   s good to have a backup. (Laughter)  Finchum Were you closer to your father than your mother?  Waters Was I what?  Finchum Closer to your father than you were to your mother.  Waters No.  Finchum He would say no, and your brother would take care of it?  Waters Yeah.  Bishop What were holidays like in your house?  Waters Well, we didn   t have to do much on any special holiday. Of course,  Mama was a good home cooked cook. We didn   t eat out a lot unless we  went to Muskogee and spent the day. I always loved shoes. Still do   Course I can   t get out and find them now. I know one time we had gone  14  to Muskogee, just to take the day. Dad would go with Mama and I.  He   d entertain himself doing something else, and Mama and I would  shop. In the afternoon I put my package in the car and met Dad at the  caf   where we were going to have dinner. And on the way home he  said,    What   d you buy? What kind of shoes did you buy?    I said,    What  makes you think I bought shoes?    He said,    Because you always buy  shoes.    He found them  I said,    Yeah.    Course it was my money, he  didn   t care. He   d make fun of my shoes, and I still like them.  Bishop Well, going back to your husband, how long were you married?  Waters Oh, about twenty years  We moved out here, and he put in a jewelry. I  said,    What do you know about jewelry?    He said,    Well, at one time in  my life, I stayed a year with my uncle in Dallas.    And he had taught  them a lot about clocks and watch repair. So he put in a jewelry store in  Eufaula.  Finchum Would you get a discount?  Waters Yeah, a hundred percent.  Finchum Hundred percent? (Laughs) You   d see something you wanted, he   d let  you have it?  Waters I could take anything I wanted. (Laughs)  Finchum There you go   Bishop You said you were married for twenty years? Did your husband pass  away?  Waters Uh-huh.  Bishop So you had to raise your child on your own for a while?  Waters He was a pretty big boy by then. Now, his, my grandson got his  doctorate from   is it Rice College in Houston, Texas?  Finchum Rice.  Waters Rice College. Private college, he got his doctorate from there. I was  talking to him last night and they had offered him a position at the  college when he graduated. He didn   t want it, so they offered him  something he liked and he took it so he wouldn   t have to move. He   s  married and has two little girls. He said,    We   ve got to get you down  here.    I said,    Well I   m ready to come visit,    you know. Of course,  15  when I started to lose my eyesight, I got rid of my car. It   s hard to go  anywhere down here. I have to go to Tulsa or Oklahoma City to get on  a plane to go anywhere.  Finchum Well, did you ever think you would make it to a hundred?  Waters I never even thought to. I   ve had people say,    How does it feel?    Which  is a right question.    How does it feel to be nineteen?    It was fun.  (Laughs)  Finchum Any idea why you   ve been able to live so long?  Bishop What   s your secret?  Waters Not died. (Laughter) I never give a thought to it.  Finchum How did you celebrate?  Waters Well, on my one hundredth my stepdaughter-in-law, who lives in  Wichita, Kansas, decided we were going to get in contact with all the  cousins and aunts and uncles that I could find for her. I did and we had  it at the church, at the fellowship hall. We had people from Arizona,  California, Missouri, between her family and mine, and their kids. She  does everything. She wants to do something every year. This one  coming up, I said,    Let   s don   t do anything. Let   s just   I   m tired of  having them.    I had to convince her. She said,    I   ll be down to pick you  up the day before Thanksgiving, and we   ll talk about it.    (Laughs)  Finchum In other words, you   ll listen?  Waters I   ll listen.  Finchum Did your father and mother live into their eighties or nineties?  Waters Dad died in    56. Mama died in    68. She lived twelve years after he  passed away. My brother lived just across the street from her, so that  was her transportation for groceries. They always got along real good.  Finchum How old was she?  Waters She was in her eighties. She was twenty-one and Dad was thirty-five  when they married. I think that   s right. Yes, because he had this twelve-year-  old child, five-year-old child. He said there was no place to do  laundry or something. He said he   d just have to wear his socks and  clothes until they were filthy then throw them away and buy more.  There wasn   t anybody to wash them.  16  Bishop Well, how important was church in your family?  Waters Well, Mama and I went to Sunday school every Sunday. Dad did not go  with us. He would go to church, but we went to Sunday school every  Sunday. And just recently they   ve had to close the Christian Church  here in Eufaula. It just went down, down, down. They finally sold it,  sold the building.  Bishop Do you still go to church every Sunday?  Waters Uh-huh.  Finchum Sing in the choir?  Waters No, goodness.  Finchum Used to?  Waters No.  Finchum No.  Waters No. Music has never meant very much to me. I have certain ones that I  like.  Finchum Did you have piano lessons as a youngster?  Waters No, I wouldn   t have given a penny for a piano. My son one time came  home from school, he was in the third grade, and said,    Mom, can we  have a piano?    He didn   t have a musical bone in his body either. I said,     Why do you want a piano?       They are so highly advertised.    I said,     That is really not a very good basis for buying a piano so the answer is  no.    That was the last of the piano. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, would you go dancing?  Waters Yeah, oh yeah. We had our fellas staked out.  Finchum What kind of dance?  Waters Heaven only knows what we called it. I know one time, the entire town  of Eufaula was   what do they call it when they close everything? If  there is some disease that is going around.  Finchum Quarantine?  17  Waters Yeah. You couldn   t do anything. Well I was working at the courthouse  then, for the county superintendent. I told her,    Let   s give a weenie  roast.    We did. Course, everybody wanted to go. Somebody had a  truck, and we got the truck and went. So we had our weenie roast. The  next week   the sheriff   s office was just across the hall from me. Erv  Kelley, Pretty Boy Floyd killed him. You remember Pretty Boy Floyd?  Finchum I recognize the name  Bank robber   Waters Yeah. Well, anyway, Mr. Kelley who happened to be our next door  neighbor, big tall man, fierce looking, came walking in. He said,    I hear  you had a weenie roast.    I said,    Yes, we did. We sure had a good  time.    He said,    Don   t you know that everything is under quarantine?    I  said,    We were out in the open, all of us, eating.    I said,    Two of your  kids was on that truck.       Yeah, I guess they were.    He said,    Well as  long as you were outside.    I said,    Well we were all outside, so we  didn   t hurt anybody.     Finchum What was it quarantined for?  Waters I can   t remember, but the theatre was closed.  Finchum Tuberculosis or Polio? The flu would have been earlier than that. I  don   t know.  Waters I can   t remember. The entire town, schools were closed, churches were  closed.  Finchum That would have been about what time period, year wise?  Waters Well, I was about eighteen I guess.  Finchum You were about eighteen? You were out of high school by then.  Waters Yeah, I was out of high school in 1927, and I was working then so it  was after 1927.  Finchum Well, do you remember when they had rationing and all that during  World War II?  Waters Had what?  Finchum Rations? Rationing?  Waters No.  18  Finchum Where you had to have so many points or whatever to get flour or sugar  or whatever.  Waters Yeah, mills.  Finchum Mills?  Waters Little round cardboard disks. A one mill, a five mill, and a ten mill. And  my niece loved antiques and she had a storage closet full of antiques,  including mills. Had a book that my father   s father had kept,  bookkeeping. He had a little store. She had that in it, and somebody  went in and took out everything, which had no value to any of it. She  even had the buttons off her dad   s coat he wore in World War II.  Finchum Hmmm. Do you remember getting to vote for the first time?  Waters What?  Finchum To vote, to cast a vote for the president?  Waters I remember the first time I ever heard them say vote, and nobody else  ever heard his name ever since, I guess, first grade, and his name was  Cox. He was running for president and we were going to have an  election. First grade, second, and anyway, I voted for Mr. Cox with my  x. He didn   t get it. Nobody ever mentions him or heard of him. I  remember thinking that was a big thing.  Finchum Well, you have seen a lot in your life. What do you think is the biggest  invention in your opinion?  Waters Has been?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Waters I think I   d say electricity because you can do so many things with that.  Finchum Including having running water in your house?  Waters Oh yeah, that should be at the top. I remember that blue bathtub. It must  have been eight foot long. It was long as that bed. Big   Finchum With claw feet? Did it have claw feet? The tub?  Waters No.  19  Finchum No. Well, did you learn to sew?  Waters No. I took home ec. I liked the cooking, but I didn   t like the sewing.  Finchum Well, were you a good cook?  Waters I wouldn   t say I was a good cook.  Bishop What was your specialty?  Waters I don   t know that I had one. I always, to church dinners, made a pecan  pie. Now, I can   t even do that because I don   t have any teeth for pecans.  Finchum Well, did you travel much? You  mentioned  Minnesota.  Waters Yeah. I kept getting these mailings from Muskogee travel tours, bus  trips, and we went up to investigate that. I found one and we started  going. Then when we   d get our bonuses I   d say,    Let   s plan out a trip.     So we went with travel tours. I think she moved. She got married   I  forgot what her married name was. Anyway, we made a lot of trips with  her.  And one we were on was in Washington, DC. Our bus driver had pulled  up in that area, and he knew where to go. We got to the White House.  He said,    You can go in the White House if you want to or if you don   t  want to do that, I   ll take you somewhere else.    I said,    I don   t care  about the White House.    Of course he said all you do is just walk down  the hall and look in open doors.  He took us to a roadside bakery. We drove over there, finally he started  to pull off the highway. I thought,    Where are we going?    We stopped  at this, it looked like a lean-to, and he said,    Everybody out.    Out we  got and went in. They were making bread, big slices of bread. Put butter  on it, your choices of jelly. Make yourself a jelly sandwich. You   d  never found it had you not known it was there. Then one time we went  to where they made chocolate candy. Everybody there wanted a big  sack of chocolates. It was bagged by the pound. Everybody came out  with a big sack of chocolates.  Bishop Who went on the trip with you to Washington, DC?  Waters My second husband. He was the one that went on all the trips. He liked  it. One day she asked him, the tour director,    Ray, are you having a  good time?    He said,    Yeah, but I   m trying not to.     Bishop So you were married twice?  20  Waters Yeah.  Bishop How did you meet your second husband?  Waters In my mother   s living room. She had a duplex. He had rented the  duplex. My son and I drove up there one day after work and he was  lonesome and was setting in with her. They were visiting, and that   s  how I met him.  Finchum What was his name?  Waters Ray.  Finchum Ray?  Waters Narramore, my first marriage was Waters.  Finchum So which last name do you go by?  Waters Well, when I was a Narramore, I went by Narramore.  Finchum About how old were you when you married again?  Waters I  was fifty-nine .  Finchum How old was your son?  Waters He was about  thirty .  Bishop Did your first husband pass away when you were in your forties?

I could see the picture on it wasn   t clear so I sold it.  Finchum When did you come here?  Waters I came shortly before Thanksgiving, a Thanksgiving, and I   ve been here  either three or four Thanksgivings,  or maybe more .  Finchum So, after you turned one hundred?  Waters Oh,  I was about ninety-eight .  Finchum And before that you lived at home alone?  Waters Yeah.  Finchum Pretty independent.  Bishop When did you give up driving?  23  Waters When I moved out here. About  eight  years, I think.  Bishop That   s pretty impressive.  Waters Yeah. I had been to an optometrist and he said,    Bonnie, I can   t do  anything for you. You have macular degeneration, and I can   t help you  any.    One day I was sitting here and I called him. He happened to  answer the phone. I said,    I need to come in and talk to you.    He said,     What do you want?    I said,    An eye examination.    He said,    I   ll tell  you exactly what I told you when you were here before but come down  and at least we   ll visit.    I said,    Okay.    I went down. Sat in that chair.  We went through the ritual. He said the same thing. He said,    I told  you.    I said,    Yeah, but I wanted you to say it again. To be sure there  was nothing you could do.     Bishop So you got a second opinion?  Waters Yeah, mine. (Laughs)  Finchum Yours  (Laughter) Is Bonnie short for a name?  Waters No.  Finchum That   s all?  Waters That   s all it is, Bonnie.  Finchum Do you know how she chose that? Are you named after anyone?  Waters Huh-uh.  Finchum No. We haven   t met any other one-hundred-year-old Bonnie   s. I was  just curious. What   s the middle initial?  Waters Kay.  My maiden name.   Finchum Oh, that   s why you were going to name your little girl Kay?  Bishop Well, you lived through the Great Depression. What was the Great  Depression like? Do you recall?  Waters Yeah, it never did affect me personally. We always had   Mama was a  good clean cook. We always had good meals. I remember one time I  was walking home from school past a grocery store, and in the window  was fresh strawberries. I went down to where my dad was. I said,     Winston   s has strawberries.    He said,    Well don   t you think we ought  24  to get some?    I said,    They   re thirty cents a box.    Surely that must have  been a pint. He said,    Well I think we need three boxes. You go back  and get three.    And of course, Mama made shortcake, and we had  strawberry shortcake as long as they stayed on the market. I think if  they   d gone to five dollars a box we   d still had that last shortcake.  (Laughs) He didn   t eat much but what he liked, he wanted.  Bishop World War II? Was that an important time in your life?  Waters No.  Bishop Did that affect you any other than your step-brother?  Waters I did have a letter that he wrote me from College Station, Texas. That   s  where he was located. Just outside of what, San Antonio. And he sent  me a dime in it. Of course, that was ten pennies   Bishop Why a dime?  Waters Well, it was about 1945. For a nickel you could buy a Milky Way   candy bar , we   d save our allowance for.  Finchum So you used it for candy?  Waters Oh sure  (Laughter) As fast as I could go   Bishop Thought maybe he was sending you some money for some stamps to  write him back, but that   s not the case. (Laughs)  Waters No, I don   t think there was any correspondence. (Laughs)  Bishop Well, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  How do you want to be remembered?  Waters Well, as it says in the Bible,    Try to be content with whatever you  have.    That is what he talked of the other day. Seems like it was in     Paul.    That   s what I try to do up here. I   m not content. I want a house.  I want people in it. I want to see again, but I can still talk. I can eat. I  can play my little tapes. Some of them I will just listen to about five  minutes. I see what they are. All I have to do is put them back in the  case and turn the address card over, they go back to the city  Oklahoma  City , and re-mail them.  Finchum You said you play bingo?  Waters Yeah.  25  Finchum You can still play bingo.  Waters Yeah.  Finchum You said you preferred slots. Is that what you said?  Waters Yeah.  Bishop What advice would you give someone who wants to live a hundred  years?  Waters Well, since I don   t know how you do it, I couldn   t tell them anything,  because I don   t know.  Finchum Keep walking.  Waters Keep living. Do the best you can with what you have.  Finchum So you have a sweet tooth?  Waters Definitely.  Bishop What is your favorite candy?  Waters Chocolate.

Finchum The noon meal was called?  Waters Dinner.  26  Finchum Dinner not lunch?  Waters Yeah.  Finchum So your big meal was at the noon hour?  Waters Yeah.  Finchum Had fruits and vegetables?  Waters Yeah, and always meat.  Finchum What would you drink?  Waters A lot of milk. I like iced tea. I don   t like the iced tea out here.
