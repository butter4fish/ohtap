Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Thursday, January 26, 2012, and I   m in Durant,  Oklahoma interviewing Joy Culbreath. This interview is being  conducted as part of the inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame Oral History Project. Joy was inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 2011. Thank you for joining us today.  Thank you.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Can you tell us  where you grew up and give us a little background into your early life?  Well, I   m an Okie. I was born at Boggy Depot, right at the end of the  Great Depression, like so many people. I was three years old when my  family moved to Lubbock, Texas, needing to find work. So, two brothers  and a sister moved to Lubbock and began to pull bolls and whatever else  they could do to make a living. So, I grew up in Lubbock, Texas. I  graduated from Tom S. Lubbock High, eighteen years old. The  following December, I married a man from Durant, Oklahoma and have  lived here, basically, ever since. We   ve been married fifty-four years.  So, I was raised in Texas, but truly an Okie. I   m very proud of my  upbringing and my family. Boggy Depot back in the old days was a very  famous part of Oklahoma. Now, it   s basically just a park area there. The  house I was born in has now fallen down, but you can still see where it  was, and I have pictures of it. Very, very small home. There was a  mother and dad and six children that lived in that house. I don   t really  know how we did all of that, but we did. We were a happy family and a  very loving family. So, that tells you you don   t need a big home and lots  of money to be happy and proud of where you came from.  Well, I   m going to pull you back a little bit towards your time in Texas  growing up. Tell me about the schools you attended, elementary school,  5  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  junior high. Were they large schools? Were they small schools?  Well, in the    50s, Lubbock only had one high school of about 100,000  people, so it was a large high school. Elementary school, it was   I can   t  even remember. The last was Posey, was the name of the elementary  school. Our schools were pretty large, certainly large when you talk  about southeastern Oklahoma schools. Now, Lubbock has several high  schools. Probably in those days, that one high school might have been  larger than what their high schools are now with several there.  Enjoyed those days. The school was run pretty much like you   d run a  university. As a matter of fact, they told us when you graduated from  Lubbock High you were equivalent to a freshman at Texas Tech. We  were pretty much on an honor system. Back in those days, they didn   t  just pass you on to other grades. If you didn   t make at least a C or better  in the core subjects, you took those two hours a day. They didn   t allow  you to take a lot of electives. You might be in reading two hours a day or  English or math or whatever, because when you graduated, you had to  be able to do those core subjects. I see that   s one of the things nowadays  when I visit schools, there are so many electives and a lot of our kids are  not equipped in a lot of the areas that they  need  to be successful in  education and in their life. So, just because we   re so much more modern  today and all the IT we have and all those things, I don   t know that our  schools are any better today than they were.  When you were growing up, were there subjects you gravitated towards?  Well, I always enjoyed math. Of course, we didn   t take physics and all  those types of maths. I   m talking about your basics, basic math and all  that. My dad was very good in math. I   m a firm believer that you inherit  the genes of your parents. I think that I had a quick mind for math. I  think I probably inherited a lot of that from him. But then my mom, she  was the one that was the good reader and the good speller and those  things. So, on my mother   s side of the family, there was a lot of  education and in some of my dad   s, too, although my dad had only a  third grade education. Mother was educated and her dad was educated,  too.  So, what would you do for fun?  Now, or then?  Then.  Then, oh  Well, I used to love to dance and was pretty good. Matter of  fact, one time I danced with Elvis Presley at the Cotton Club in  6  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Lubbock, Texas. We had a Teen Town that on Friday nights, all the  teenagers had a place to go and dance. Buddy Holly had a band. I went  to school with him and that was before he was famous. He was a nerd of  all nerds. But I enjoyed dancing. I did go to a large high school,  therefore we didn   t get to play sports like girls did in the smaller towns.  We had PE, but we didn   t play basketball, we didn   t play volleyball and  compete against other schools. So, we didn   t have the sports thing.  I loved to roller skate. I was pretty good at that. I played roller hockey,  some. We had a team called the Rolling Ghost, and we played some of  the surrounding larger towns. Did some of that, enjoyed it. So, I loved to  skate, loved to dance, was pretty active, always very strong. I feel like,  to this day, that that   s the one gift that God has given me, a strong body.  Even at this age, I   m still able to work, do the things I want to do,  exercise. So far, that has not been taken.  Where do you rank? Are you the oldest, youngest?  Oh, I   m the youngest. I   m the smartest and the best looking of my whole  family, since you asked me. (Laughter)  So, as you   re growing up, any major role models in your life during  those early years?  Well, I think we all have that and definitely, I did. As I said, my mother  and dad were   thank goodness, in the old days your mother and dad  stayed together. So, I came from what now wouldn   t be called a normal  home. I had my own mother and my own dad in the home. They were  always good role models. I had a wonderful mother that was very kind,  very gentle, very Indian. Momma didn   t talk a lot, but learned a lot of  patience. She was a very patient person, a very giving person. So, I  learned a lot from my mother. I think most people my age are going to  tell you that their parents were their heroes.  My brother just older than me, he had opportunity with lots of hard work  and lots of planning and a lot of determination to go to school. I watched  him, I always wanted to go on to school, knew that if he could do it, I  could so he was a role model for me. He played football in high school.  And in Texas, as it still is, that   s almost a god. Everybody thinks football  is it, and we certainly did back in those days. Lubbock had a great team,  and Charles was a great player. So, I was always proud of him, the  things he did in high school.  Had two ladies that lived in Lubbock. I was young, just a small girl. I  used to walk to church. Chapel Hill Baptist Church was just a little ways  from my house. I attended services there. There was a lady by the name  7  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  of Davelle Brown. She was the girls    auxiliary leader. She was not  married. She was about twenty-five years old, so I thought she was as  old as the hills, of course. She was a very pretty woman, but she taught  me about Jesus. Mrs. Lemon was my Sunday school teacher. She really  taught me a lot of scripture and was very good with the young people.  Probably not six months after I was married and moved to Oklahoma,  she died with cancer. I often look back and think about just before I left,  she gave me a wedding shower. She had to have been very ill at that  time. I didn   t realize it, but now I   m older and think back to how she  died, she had to have been. But she still cared about me. So, I would  have to say that both of those women played a great part in my life.  They taught me about the most important person in the whole world that  has ever been or ever will be, and that   s Jesus. So, they played a very  important part in my life.  So, you   re growing up. You   re graduating from Lubbock and you   re  getting married, but before you get married, are you thinking about what  you want to be when you get older?  Well, you have to remember I   m seventy-two years old. In my day,  when a girl graduated from high school, you got married. That   s just  what you did. So, even though I   d always wanted to go to school, I just  figured that I   d get married and I did. Well, back in those days, we  didn   t have birth control. So, within four years, I had three daughters.  Still wanted to go to school, but there wasn   t any way to work with three  small babies. I have a very wonderful husband who has always been  supportive of me, and we talked about me going to school. I explained to  him that I couldn   t be the helpmate I wanted to be unless I was educated.  I knew I could do the school work.  So, we began to plan and figure out,    How in the world can I go to  college?    I wasn   t going to get a scholarship. There wasn   t any financial  aid. Even though I   m Indian, you had to be one quarter, then, of one  tribe. I am one quarter, but not of one tribe. So, I couldn   t even get any  scholarships from the Indians. So, we began to wonder and figure and  plan, and we planted gardens. We raised our own beef. Did everything  we possibly could to save money, and he paid all of my tuition so I  could go to school. Began that, did that for over two years, and when my  youngest daughter turned five to start to kindergarten, then I started  working at the local university here, Southeastern University. Retired  from there after twenty-seven years with them and went to work for the   Choctaw  Nation. But that   s how we planned and how we worked and  saved.  I had a neighbor that had five children and after she put her children on  the school bus, she would come up and stay with my three daughters  8  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  while I went to school. Then after I started Southeastern University, I  finished my education. I have three master   s degrees from Southeastern  and went to school until I was forty-eight years old. Took a class every  semester, just to be sure that I had everything I could that might help me  down the road, and it has. It   s helped me at the Choctaw Nation in the  administrative work that I do. So, always been in school, advocate of  education. I believe that that   s freedom for people and their very best  chance to be what they want to be in life is through education.  Well, you had your mind set and then y   all really worked on it so you  could     Yes.     That   s important.  But didn   t really know what I wanted to be, then. Of course, education  was the thing more for people like myself. I knew I didn   t want to be a  nurse. There were several different areas. I always wanted to go to law  school, but there wasn   t a school in this area. With three small  children   I won   t say it was impossible, but I don   t know how I would  have done it financially or even with all the children to take care of. So, I  never did that. I think when I retire from the Choctaw Nation, I   m going  to go to law school. I   m not sure yet. (Laughs)  I think that   s a great idea.  It   s just an idea. It   s not going to happen. (Laughter)  Was it difficult juggling school and raising your family?  Well, not really. For me, I never tired easily. Just in the last few years,  I   ve learned what being tired is. Now, everyone gets sleepy, but I always  could work sixteen hours. It didn   t matter. I never got tired. So, with a  family and being at home, I didn   t work outside the home. When I   d go  to school and get the children to sleep at night, I could do homework. I  really had what time I needed to go to school, even with my family.  Then as the girls got older   I   m a firm believer in everybody pulling  their own weight. So, I taught my daughters from a very young age to  help. They   re all good workers today, and I   m very proud of them. But  they helped at home. They mowed the yard, they washed the car, they  cleaned the house, just like I did. So, I had a lot of help.  Well, that   s good. What are your degrees in, your three master   s?  Well, I have a master   s degree   my first master   s was in counseling  9  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  because the program I worked in, Upward Bound, TRIO Programs. To  move up, I knew I had to have a counseling degree. So, I got that degree  in school counseling. And then after that, I knew that I wanted to direct  the program, so I got a degree in administration. Then they have what  they call a general education master   s degree. The last one I got just  because I needed to keep my teaching certificate, and you had to have     I don   t know what their ruling is now. Back then, you had to have  certain points and you could   if you took one three-hour class a year,  you could keep your teaching degree updated. So, I always took classes,  but I didn   t take cake baking and all that kind of stuff because I don   t  care about all that. (Laughs) I always took a class that was working  toward another degree, and that kept my teaching certificate up to date.  Well, if you could   you kind of touched upon it just a tiny bit, could you  just walk me through your work history?  Well, basically, what you call real work. Of course, I worked a little bit  when I was young like everybody else did in restaurants and a little  drugstore and all that. But I actually started working at Southeastern  University in 1967 and stayed with them for twenty-seven years. I  retired on a Friday. On Monday morning, I was at the Choctaw Nation.  I   ve been there nineteen years. They hired me to build them an adult  education program. I did that, but during that time, there was a big  transition at the Choctaw Nation. We got a new chief, and he asked me  if I would like to be over all of their education. So, I took on that  position in 1997. I   d been there four years. During that time, we   d built a  great adult education program and still is, to this day, a good program.  So, since    97, I   ve been over all the education programs there with the  Nation and enjoy it very much. One of these days, I need to go home,  but I hadn   t went there yet. (Laughs)  Going back to your time at Southeastern, what were some of the roles  you were involved with?  Well, we had TRIO Programs. I   ve worked in all of them. I also taught  in the business education department. Sometimes one three-hour class a  semester, sometimes two. I enjoyed that. We did quite a bit of advisory-type  counseling with a lot of the students that were there. Those types of  things, but my main job was working with Upward Bound students,  which was a full-time position. Enjoyed that very, very much, got to  help a lot of kids.  In southeastern Oklahoma, Upward Bound has been in existence now  since   the first summer was 1966, one of Lyndon Johnson   s programs.  Anywhere you go that there are Upward Bound programs, you   re going  to find people anywhere from health to education to law. You   re going  10  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  to find people all over the country that have gotten their starts with the  Upward Bound program. It   s a really good feeling when you talk to  different ones that probably would not have gone on had they not had  that influence and guidance that those programs are able to give you. So,  I feel very rewarded that there are a lot of students that I feel like I  played a small part in their life that might have helped them to be what  they are today. So, that   s very rewarding. So, at the university, though,  we did a lot of things. It   s like you do in any education program. You  have a job, but then you do a lot of things. (Laughs) Education is poor,  and they always get all they can out of you in every area that you   re able  to work so that   s how education is.  You ever hear back from some of those students?  Oh, yes. Hear back from a lot of them. Have a dentist in Ardmore that   s  always offered to do me free dental work. Have lawyers, had a young  man from Hugo that is an attorney. He graduated from Stanford, a black  kid that was raised by a grandmother. Her name was Arizona. Very  poor, but very smart. He scored a thirty on his ACT when he was a  sophomore so he had the ability, he just didn   t have the guidance. And  teachers, almost any school I walk into in southeastern Oklahoma will  have a teacher that   s an Upward Bound student. So, it gives you a lot of  joy to see all that and hope that you   ve played some part.  One student specifically, I visited in her home, they had dirt floors and  her mother had died. There were several children and she was the oldest.  Her dad wasn   t going to let her go back to Upward Bound because he  needed her to help. Visited with him, after we did   and she was a very  bright, bright girl   he allowed her to come on back and go to Upward  Bound. And today, she is a research scientist at NASA. You look at  those things, you think,    Well, had you not been there, had you not cared  to go to the home and go that extra step, she might not have reached her  potential.    And we would be less because of it, because there is not any  telling what all she has accomplished and what she   s added to even, for  all of us. We don   t know.  So when you help someone else and you care enough and you help  them, it   ll not only pay them, it   ll pay you back. That all comes from  caring. Anyone could have gone to that home, but you   ve got to have  that energy to get up and go and do it. So those are students. I mean, in  the twenty-seven years, I could talk about students all day long that     and I feel that any student, I don   t care if they   re a mechanic or  whatever, if they achieved the goal that they wanted and were  successful, then that   s a successful student, if they   re doing what they  want to do. And you know as well as I do, the poorest people in  Oklahoma, which is a poor state, the poorest of those are in southeastern  11  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Oklahoma, and there is not any industry, there   s not jobs. So, if they  don   t get an education, they   ve got a very poor chance of ever  accomplishing what they need to. Even to make a good living for their  family is almost impossible. So those are the kinds of things I   ve been  involved in all of my life.  You retired after twenty-seven years and then you turn around and you  start a new job. How did the Nation approach you? Did you know it was  coming?  It was kind of an equal project. I had talked with different ones at the  Nation. I was interested in retiring to do something different. As long as  it was in education, I knew I was interested, knew I could do the job.  The Choctaw Nation in 1997 had very few education programs so there  was a real need there. I came on board in    93 to build just this one  program. Like I said, it   s as good as you   ll find in the state of Oklahoma,  now, and that proof is in all the graduates we have every year. We have  at least 140 students each year that get their GED diplomas. So, the  proof is there in what   s happening.  We have moved from that, even to  doing  all of the testing for all  students in three counties in this area. You won   t find that in the other  tribes. You   ll find the Choctaw Nation are the frontrunners in a lot of  areas. We found that to be true with our language. We   re in fifty-five  high schools now teaching for credit to preserve our language. There   s  just a lot of things that I see the education department has its growth and  a better foundation. I look forward to the next person that comes in with  new ideas and younger that will even establish this even stronger and  better.  How did you know how to get started? Did you look at what was going  on with other tribes, or   ?  Well, not really. I   m one of these people that I don   t have enough sense  to know that I can   t accomplish what I start. Being in education as long  as I have, you   ve got some background, you   ve got a lot of  understanding about what needs to be done. What   s been wonderful  about the Choctaw Nation, I   ve had resources. When I was at the  university, they   re just like your public schools or almost any school.  There   s not much money there. You really have to work with what  you   ve got. One good thing about the Nation, and a credit to them and  less credit to me, is that I   ve always said,    You give anybody enough  money and they can accomplish about anything they want to.    The one  thing that I   ve had in the education department is when we had new  programs to start and we presented that to the council and to our chief,  we   ve almost always gotten the money to do it.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  So, when you begin to work these programs, anyone would know if  you   re going to have classes, you need the best teachers you can find.  We were able to travel. We had transportation. We were able to pay the  students for their mileage when they had to drive. We were able to pay  for their testing so we had incentives for the students. All of that takes  money and we had that. So, I can   t take a whole lot of credit for a whole  lot of things, but I do have   it   s kind of like the people around me tell  me,    I can   t do much but I have more ideas than anybody.    Then I want  them to do the work and accomplish what we   re trying to do. So, that   s  really what it is. It   s all about a vision.  Did you have in mind some key areas you really wanted to focus on?  I did, one of them being language. I   m a firm believer that any  nationality of people, doesn   t matter if you   re Indian or not, you lose  your language, you   ve lost your people. Everything is gone. So, even  though we   re a large tribe, we   re down to about a thousand first-language  speakers. That   s scary. We are losing tribes every day that no  longer have their language. So, those are one of the things that we could  tell almost immediately that we needed to work on and figure out.  The chief came and said,    Build us a language department.    I asked him  how he wanted it done and he said he didn   t know. I didn   t know either.  You don   t know all those things. But you begin to look and see how  other people   it doesn   t have to be Indian language. It can be any  language. How did they preserve their language? And what is going on?  We began to look at a lot of different things. I know one thing, that  you   ve got to get it out there to the people and begin to teach, and  they   ve got to learn or you will lose it so that   s what we did. We went  every direction we could. Whether it be the internet, community classes,  high school classes. We teach in Head Starts to the children.  We   re really seeing a turnaround. Our biggest goal is we   re planning to  build a School of Language, and we hope to have a training center that  we want to train other tribes how to preserve their language. Because we  work through the state department, we jumped up through every hoop  they have. We have to meet all the same guidelines that any of your  public schools would to teach classes, and we   ve been able to do that.  That   s why we can teach for credit. We now call that a world language.  At first, they called it a foreign language. We didn   t want it called that.  So, now we   ve got them to put in there that we   re teaching a world  language. That   s fine with us because this is America and we speak  English here. But we do want to teach the Choctaw language, and we   re  allowed to do that. And to teach it in the schools just like if you were  taking Spanish or French or anything else.  13  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  So, it   s been a journey in the education department. We   ve got lots of  programs. I have a total of sixteen programs and they reach all different  areas. Head Starts, we have fourteen Head Starts. And we   re building  new child development centers every year, which are absolutely  wonderful. The resources we have are second to none to teach our young  children so that   s wonderful. There   s just a lot of things.  Do you have a favorite aspect of your job?  I enjoy people. Probably, the thing I like most is I do get to get out and  meet other people, travel. I   m pretty much a PR  public relations  person  for the education department. I don   t serve on a lot of national  committees. I didn   t have time to do that. I just finished the No Child  Left Behind national committee, so two years of that. I don   t know how  much good it   ll do     How did that come about, by the way?  Well, they were looking for people to serve on that committee. Our chief  is very political. We deal a lot with local, state politicians, and federal.  So, in all of that, they have become very familiar with our tribe, and so  they asked if the education director would be interested. They didn   t  know me from Adam, so it wasn   t me. It was the Choctaw Nation  education. So, then they asked if I would like to serve on that. And after  they did their background checks and all they have to do, I was selected  to serve as one of their primary people. We also had Alan Lovesee, who  is an attorney, that was the alternate that served on that committee. So,  that   s what I like about my job is I never do the same thing twice in the  same day. I think I   d become very bored very quickly if I had to sit in  the office and do everything the same. But I don   t. Everything is  different all the time and I enjoy it.  Well, you   re also very involved in your church.  Yes.  Still teach Sunday school?  I do.  How long have you been teaching Sunday school?  Fifty years.  That   s a long time.  14  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  It   s a long time.  And what ages are you teaching?  I teach young couples and then on Wednesday nights, which is my  favorite time   a lot of your small churches have just about died,  especially on Wednesday nights. People have gotten to the point they  want to come to church on Sunday morning. That   s it. They don   t come  any more. We started working on a program for our children. We are  now feeding   on Wednesday nights, we run from sixty to sixty-five,  every Wednesday night. My husband and I, not having children or  anything, we can go very early and stay very late. We get to cook and  clean and teach children with many other people helping. It   s a big job,  but we enjoy it.  We   ve seen a lot of good things come from working with the children in  our community. They come from all over. This is a small church in very  rural Oklahoma. Blue doesn   t have any businesses. It still has an  elementary school there, but other than that, there   s not anything in  Blue, Oklahoma. The church I attend is the only church that   s in that  area, too. So, we   ve got a lot of potential there. We felt like it   s hard to  get a lot of adult people to keep attending church so why not get the  children. So, that   s probably the most important thing I do, is cook and  clean. (Laughs)  What   s the name of the church?  Blue Baptist Church. It   s in Blue, Oklahoma. So, it   s just a very small  church where the people meet to worship and serve God.  And what is it that still keeps you so connected to wanting to teach  Sunday school all these years and keep giving back?  Well, all of us   my mother told me when she was ninety-eight years  old. She was ill, she knew her life was about over. She said,    I   ve lived  such a short time,    at ninety-eight. Most people would say,    Oh, what a  long life she had,    but that   s short. If I live to be 100, I   ve lived a short  time. What about eternity? There is no time. It   s forever. So, what we do  here, we   re looking toward eternity, forever and forever. So, what I do  here for a short time has a lot of influence on where I   m going to be for  an eternity. So, that   s what I believe. I never tire of it because I really  and truly believe that I   m a born-again Christian and what really matters  in my life is the Lord, Jesus Christ.  In going through your material submitted for the Oklahoma Women   s  15  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Hall of Fame, there was a line in there that I had to read a couple times,  that I loved. I   m sure you have plenty of sayings like this, but somebody  said in your application packet,    You better get in gear or get out of her  way.     I can   t imagine why anyone would have said that about me.  Why would someone say that about you? (Laughs)  Well, I   m really easy-going and patient and never get bothered or upset.  (Laughter) No, I don   t really feel it   s that way, but if I am given a job to  do, I   m going to do the job. So, I don   t have a lot of patience with people  that are whiners and won   t do their work so maybe that   s what they  meant. I don   t know. I hope that   s not true. All of that   s true of me, but I  definitely believe that if there is purpose and you have a job, you need to  get it done.  I think it was a very positive comment.  Okay, I hope so. (Laughter)  I think it   s very telling of your determination and getting the job done.  But I thought,    That   s pretty good.     Well, it   s true, but I don   t always get all the jobs done. (Laughs)  There   s not enough time.  We don   t always get all the things done.  Not enough time in the day.  No.  Well, we learn what we need for our career, the tools for our careers in  many different places, sometimes in the classroom, sometimes real life  experiences. What are some of the most important places you   ve learned  the background you   ve needed for your career?  You have to think about my age. We   re a different generation. People  that are older, we really don   t know anything but work. Younger people  often look for positions. People my age always look for a job, and we   re  very glad when we had one, and we would work hard to do the very best  we could on that job. We have a lot of fine young people today, but  people my age and the generation next to me has ruined a lot of our  young people. They were not taught to work.  16  Nykolaiszyn  You watch people when the clock hits 4:30 or even 4:20 at the Nation.  They   ll be lining up to clock out. Ten minutes before time. We would  have never thought of doing that. We didn   t know what forty hours a  week was. Nowadays, people don   t want to work forty hours a week.  Matter of fact, the chief told me one day that he had looked through  many, many cards just flipping through them, looking to see what he  could find. He looked for a period of over an hour and didn   t find  anyone that had worked forty hours in one week, that either had sick  leave, annual leave, whatever, but there wasn   t forty hours there.  I got to thinking about that, noticing, because we have so much annual  leave and sick leave, people take off a lot of time. I could retire today,  and they   d have to pay me for a year   s work for my sick leave. I don   t  take sick leave. Now, yesterday afternoon, I took half a day to take my  husband to the doctor, but I don   t take sick leave. If I don   t feel good, I  go to work. That   s just our generation. I   m not saying that   s what you  should do. I   m telling you that   s what we do. Or I   ll take two Tylenol  and keep going.  Nowadays, people look for reasons to not be at work. That   s just the  whole difference in the way we do things, the way we think about  things. We were taught that. We were taught to work. My dad never  knew when to quit working. He was a hard worker. He worked too  much. I think sometimes even about my own self, when I go home I  want everything at home just like it is at work. I want my house clean, I  want my yard mowed, I want my car washed. I   ve done that my whole  life. Sometimes, I think how foolish I am. I really mean that, because  I   m doing a lot of things that I   m probably missing some things that are  really important.  I think about Mary and Martha in the Bible and how those two sisters,  one was at Jesus    feet while the other was washing the dishes. I   d have  been washing the dishes and look what I would have missed. So, I really  think that   s kind of the way my life is, that I work too hard. I   m too  much on    everything has got to be done    and that   s not true. But I don   t  know how you change people that have been brought up to work. I think  it   s just in your mind to do that. So, that   s one of the big differences that  I   m going to say that in my generation, we just do things differently than  others. I   m certainly not saying that we   re right. I think if we could  somehow balance that, it would be better for maybe both groups.  (Laughs) But sometimes I think I have too high of expectations of  people, which isn   t always good.  Probably could set you up for disappointment.  17  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Oh, yes. We all have our disappointments. I have five grandchildren. I  never talked to one of my grandchildren about high school graduation,  never. Always,    After you finish college, what are your plans after  that?    Because you know as well as I do, a college degree now, is almost  worthless. You   ve got to have something. People that go to college have  got to plan for a special career and go on to meet that career. College  just won   t do it, and so I always expected that. Never,    I hope they do  that.    I expected it. I think about sometimes that maybe they didn   t want  to go to college. (Laughs) Maybe they wanted to be a plumber or  something else, which is great. But I always expected their best. That   s  kind of the way I live my life.  Well, looking back through your life and even in your career now, any  major stumbling blocks or adversity that gets in the way?  Probably if I said anything, would be that I live in a small town. Had I  lived somewhere closer, if I could have been close, even in Oklahoma, if  I could have been close to OU  University of Oklahoma , TU   University of Tulsa , some of these places, I would have went to law  school. I always wanted to be an attorney. Just couldn   t figure it out  from being here. If anything, I would wish that I could have done those  things. Do I feel bad about it? No. I   m not grieving over it or any of  those things. Everything I   ve done, I look back and I   m fine with all of  that. But I think all of us would do some things differently when we get  older. As far as I married young, I wouldn   t change that. I have children,  I wouldn   t change that. I   m very satisfied and happy in those areas.  But in education, as far as money goes, as you get older, you really  realize that you can be or should be very contented if you have the  things you need. We all have a million things that we just want. We   re  very wealthy in this country. I am hoping to take a trip with Dr. Maggi.  He is a doctor that was in Denison  Texas . He spends three weeks every  two months in South Africa doing surgeries. That   s probably one of the  last things I   m hoping I can do, is to travel some with him in missionary  work and see the country, be able to do some teaching and some work in  those areas. Still have that desire. My mother used to tell me she learned,  she   d say,    I learned something new today. That   s a new  wrinkle  on  my horn, and I   m not ready to die yet.    That   s how I feel. Still got some  things to do.  Looking back   we keep looking back, don   t we?  I don   t have much to look forward to, do I? (Laughter) Few years,  maybe.  Oh, come on, now. Career highlights for you? Surely, you have some  18  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  that just bring a smile to your face.  Well, sure. We all do that. First of all, to have been able to work forty-five  years in education has got to be a high. Just had the health to do  that. And then the offers that I   ve had to be executive director of  education for the Choctaw Nation, what an honor that is. Our people  were behind, we   re still behind, but we   ve come so far. We now have  resources to work with. The Indian people are no different than any  other group of people. You have some very intelligent people that have  so much to offer. And with the things we   re doing now, we   re able to  find these people, help them to meet their potential.  So, career highs for me is any time I see a person meet their potential, do  the things in life that they really want to do and can do, that   s your  reward. If you work in education, it   ll never be money. It   s people and  the things that you see happen. So, my career highs has always been  watching and seeing what other people accomplish. Whether I helped  them or someone else helped them, whether they   re Indian or non-  Indian. That   s a career high for you, is when you observe someone and  you say,    My goodness, I would have never thought that     And you see  them accomplish so much. Those are your career highs in education.  Well, you were inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in  2011. When you got the call, what was going through your mind?     Why me?    Especially after I got there and I saw a general and doctors  and people that I knew had to have done so much. (Laughs) I wondered,     Why in the world am I here with this group of people?    I   m just an  educator. I know a lot of people that have done a lot more than I   ll ever  think about doing that have not been given this honor. So, that   s really  was my thoughts,    Why in the world me?    I couldn   t understand really  why I was nominated or any of those things. Don   t misunderstand, I was  certainly honored. But lots and lots of people deserve it a lot more than I  did, but I   ll always be grateful. It was quite an honor.  I think a lot of people who I talk to have that reaction. You know,    What  a great group of women. Why me?    Because you   re just doing the work  you   re doing, but you   re touching people, and you   re making that  impact, too. Do you remember who introduced you at the ceremony?  Yes, Chief Pyle.  And what was that like, listening to him say all those things about you?  I couldn   t believe he could lie that good. (Laughter) Oh, Chief is a very  humble man, himself. He feels the same way. He   s been inducted into  19  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  everything I guess there is and what have you. He feels the same way.  He doesn   t understand why. He   s just someone that   s had a great vision,  worked hard trying to help people in every way he knows. So, knowing  him like I do, I was proud that he would do that and say those things and  I believe he meant them. So, I was honored to be introduced by the  Chief of the Nation, because he   s very highly thought of.  What does this type of honor mean to you?  I don   t know that it has a whole lot of meaning to me because I don   t  care anything about being praised. I just don   t. I think it means a lot to  my family. That   s kind of how my brother explained it to me, that it  meant a lot to him. I think if he had gotten this honor, it would have  meant a lot to me. My daughters felt the same way. They were very  proud of me and that I was recognized for working and working and  working all these years. But I think I am proud of this more because my  family is proud of this.  Well, through the years, you   ve touched many students and many people  from education to your efforts with church and you name it, everything  in between. How do you feel that now some people may look at you as  that role model?  Well, I don   t really know that. I think I   m a good role model. I say that  because   not because I   m perfect. I   m far from it. But I try hard. I try to  live the same life here that I would live anywhere else I might be  because, you see, I don   t really worry about people watching me so  much, because God sees me. No matter what I   m doing, what I   m  saying, or where I am. He   s the person I need to please. Not people. But  as far as being a good role model, it   s not always all the things that  you   re not doing, because I don   t do a lot of bad things. But I do think  that I try to do some things that   s worthwhile, and that is helping other  people, caring about others. So, a lot of times, it   s not what you   re  doing. What are you not doing? What could you be doing? So, I think I  do quite a few things, that I don   t always just see about Joy. I am a  caretaker, and I do that too much. I want to take care of everybody, and  you can   t always do that. But I don   t think too much about myself or my  own needs.  You   ve made mention of your parents and your family. Are there any  people you   d like to make mention of who have really played a big role  in your life?  Well, other than my family   and we   re a close family. Now, we   re like  any family, we might yell every once in a while, but we all love each  other. That   s the one thing we had in our family. We never had money  20  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  or prestige or any of those things. In the old days, we looked back at the  generations, I   m very proud of my grandfather on my mother   s side that  he went to law school at Vanderbilt and got his degree. For an Indian  boy to go to school in 1894, that was quite an accomplishment. And I  think about how much I would have loved to have talked to him.  I look at my family on my dad   s side, that they were preachers. And I  think about one of them who was the doctor here in Durant, one of the  very first doctors, and I think about how smart he was, because he was  the doctor and the undertaker and the pharmacist. He was a smart man  because he had you any way you went. So, I kind of think about on the  Clark side of the family and how they were pioneers. Times were hard  and they were people that excelled. My mother was a student at the  Oklahoma Presbyterian College, pursued her education.  So, there   s just a lot of things that you have a lot of pride in your family  about. Others, goodness, all of us could name people that along our way,  they   ve been an encouragement to us. Sometimes, just that extra pat on  the back or someone that gave you an opportunity. I think about the  people that hired me on my first job. I had to be as green as a gourd. But  for some reason, they hired me. So, we   ve all got people in our lives that  we owe and we thank. How do you pay back? By giving to someone  else. That   s the only way you can do it.  Any advice for your fellow Oklahomans?  Well, I   m proud of Oklahoma, whether it be the Indian part or the white  part. I   m proud of both. Oklahoma was a land that was   when we came  here, it was just Indian Territory. It   s a poor state. Not as much industry  and things that you find in other states, but if you look around it   s one of  the most beautiful states you   ll find. All of the wooded area and the  mountains and the water that we have. It   s a state to be proud of. I would  just encourage all the way from our politicians that they need to be  honest. They need to care about the people and do what is right. I think  that the people themselves need to be that role model that we need to be  by working hard and being productive and successful and be proud of  ourselves. If you   re not proud of yourself, you can   t help anyone else.  So, that   s why I   m proud of Oklahoma.  Any words of wisdom for boys and girls who want to follow in your  footsteps?  Well, most people, the only way you   re going to succeed and be where  you want to be is work hard. You cannot expect anyone else to get you  there. Not even your parents. Parents can send you to school, but they  can   t learn for you. I would encourage everyone to have respect for  21  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  themselves, work hard, do what you need to do, and be what you want to  be. The opportunities are out there. Even for the people that are the  poorest of the poor. You can do and be what you want to be, but you  have to work for it. So, it   s up to you.  So, what   s next on the agenda? You mentioned possibly some missionary  work. What are you looking forward to?  Well, I   m looking forward right now   we   re renovating our building.  Jones, our school, has just been reinstated. The government took our  school away from us in the    50s. It just was voted into law December  23rd that Jones Academy is reinstated as a BIA  Bureau of Indian  Affairs  School and will be   there   s a lot of transition there that we   ve  got to do, so I   m on that. We   re writing a five-year plan of where we  want to be in the education department five years from now. That   s a big  rock for us, so we   re really working on that. I   d like to see that finished,  Jones reinstated, a language school built, and then I may decide to  retire   from that one job. (Laughs)  I paused there for a second. I was waiting.  I may be a Wal-Mart greeter, who knows. I think I   d make a good one.  I think people who are used to working constantly have to stay busy. I   m  sure there   s a lot of things you could probably do at home, but     Oh, yes. Oh, yes. (Laughter) Well, I wish I liked to cook, sew, crafts, but  I don   t. None of the above. (Laughs) So, I   ve got to be careful. I   ll go  home and look around and say,    What am I going to do now?     You   ve told me a little bit about Oklahoma, and I can kind of tell how  you feel about the state, but what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, being an Indian, studying the history, I look at that sometimes a  little sad. Proud of Oklahoma, but a little sad in how our people came  here, what happened to them, the greed that you see. But you   ve had  greed since the beginning of time, and you   ll have greed when this world  ends. It   s the downfall of most everyone. It will be the downfall of our  country. But when I really look at Oklahoma and I start thinking about  all the things here and what has happened, it makes me a little sad  because right now, we   re into all of this water thing. People wanting all  the water that actually belongs to the Indian people.  That   s a big deal for this part of Oklahoma. We don   t really hear too  much about this up north, but down here it   s a big deal.  22  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Well, the big deal and the reason you haven   t heard so much about it,  it   s not your land. It   s not being taken from your people. I don   t mean  that to be harsh, but when you have a treaty that says forever, then you  have to determine how long is forever? When you just tell people  because this is a poor part of the country, poor people down here, now,  then, you get in the northern part where you have industry and people  with a lot of wealth. Then we just take. Well, what they forgot is the  Indian people are not poor anymore. Now, we have the money to fight  back, and that   s what it takes. We can hire the best lawyers there are,  and we go back to the treaties that said forever. Now then, if we go all  the way to the Supreme Court, there is no other way than to be found in  favor of the Indian people, because it   s all in writing.  I think that   s what they forgot about. We will just decide on the  governor   s level that this is what we   re going to do. The answer today is     No.    Now, we   re as smart as you are, and we   ve got as much money as  you   ve got so we   re going to be fair. That   s what we want, we want to  be fair. We don   t want all the water down here and you not have any.  But you   re not going to take all the water just because you want it. Or  we could go to the forest, the lumber. That was all illegally taken. We  could talk about a lot of things. And we all know this, it   s all in writing.  The treaties are there. So, if you want to go back   but those were things  that happened in generations back that you had nothing to do with, nor  did I. But we   re talking about today, and today we   re not going to lose  our water, and we   re not going to lose our timber just, because someone  else says so. We   re going to do it the fair way, and the right way, and  that   s it.  So, you have mixed feelings about Oklahoma?  Well my feelings are I love the people, I love the state and the beauty of  it and I   m very much for our government. I   m very much for   I vote  and I   m interested in who is running and what we   re going to do and all  that, but it wouldn   t matter if it was something different. Let   s do what   s  right. I   m telling you, people that do what   s right will end up where they  need to be. Whenever you don   t do what   s right, at some point it is  going to come back to haunt you. That   s what is happening now. Things  weren   t done right. Now they think they can continue to do these, and  it   s not going to happen. Let   s just do what   s right, Indians as well as the  whites.  Yes. I think everybody, if we   d just do that we   d probably be further  ahead.  That   s exactly how I feel.  23  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  Nykolaiszyn  Culbreath  And easier to sleep at night.  Let   s be fair.  As we near the end, is there anything else you   d like to add that we  haven   t talked about today? We kind of went a real quick fast forward  through your life.  I really can   t think of anything. You   ve asked me a lot of questions, and  I don   t know anything else I would say other than I appreciate you and  appreciate your interest. Certainly, this nomination has meant a great  deal to me and thank you for doing that. The interview is good. I guess  you   ll archive these and they   ll be something just that is kept. So, that   ll  be good.  As we look back on your life, a question I like to ask people as I close  out interviews is, when history is written about you, what would you like  for it to say?  Probably that she really cared, especially for young people. I don   t have  a lot of patience with adults. I feel like they   ve had opportunities and  maybe made some bad choices. But young people, still, they   re at a  crossroads. I think that all of us, as role models or adults or as mommas  and dads or teachers or whatever, that it is our responsibility to really  care about them and do what we can to help them to take the right path.  So, I would hope that people would say,    She is someone that spent her  life caring about others.     I think they will. Thank you very much for your time today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
