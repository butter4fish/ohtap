Story_ID: 10387
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about your mother, and if you could state her name and tell us what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: Odessa Taylor Marshall, and born, let's see, when was my mother born?  March 15, 1923, in Memphis, Tennessee, only child, and only child, have, I guess had a half sister, had a half sister, all right, which, who I knew.  And, and wasn't raised by her mother.  She told me her mother was mean (laughs), so was raised by her grandmother.  And I guess they moved to--I don't know a lot about my mother.  It's funny, I know a lot about my father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.].  I don't know a lot about my mother, was eventually matriculated to St. Louis, Missouri where she joined the WACs, Women's Army Corps in the second World War [1939-1945], and it was there, about the age of twenty, twenty-one, that she met my father.  And they got married at the age of twenty-three.  So, it's interesting that, she always tells us that she was gonna sit us down and tell us everything because we don't know as much about her and her childhood as we know about my father's childhood.  And after that, of course, a great mother, you know.  After that her life completely changed for this, you know, nothing but my father and nine kids.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say, an only child and then that's how I recognized (unclear).
Speaker 2: And it's funny cause she didn't want any children.  And my father was also an only child.  And he didn't like it, being the only child.  So somehow he convinced, and I'm putting that in quotation marks, my mother to have all of these kids.  She had the last--she had the, actually, she had--it was a big joke.  She had three, and then I guess she tried to stop.  So there's, there's a two and a half year gap between the third and fourth, and then I guess he just willed his way on her.  So she had five in a row after that.  And at the age of thirty-nine, when she had my youngest sister [Doris Marshall], both of them must have said, this is enough cause (laughs) when she came, she wasn't--out of the hospital (laughs), that was her last one.  There was no, no more, no more little Marshalls, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: Father born April 25, 1923.  They're a month apart in age, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, another only child; early childhood, was raised in, in Vicksburg.  And, and eventually he and my grandmother [Louise Pierce] moved to St. Louis where he was, spent, I guess his teenage years in, in St. Louis, Missouri.  And he also joined the army.  And I think he was still in the service when he met my mother.  I think my mother was out of the service, and she was in nursing school.  And so he met her in, in, when he--I think he was actually still in the service when he met her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he talk any about his growing up?
Speaker 2: My dad?  Yeah, my dad, yeah, my dad, yeah (laughs).  My, it's funny cause I know a lot, a lot about my grandmother, and I know that my dad didn't like his, his, his father cause like my grandmother, my grandmother and my father's father were married briefly, and then they split up.  And then my grandmother apparently, I guess went to St. Louis to prepare the way for him to come and, and left him in, by himself, and he didn't like that.  He always talked about he didn't like being left alone.  Nah, he's, you know, he, he was, he was a typical teenager.  I've seen, I see pictures of my dad, you know, when he was a youngster.  And by, by his own admission, he says he was pretty wild .  He was a handful, you know, for my, for my grandmother to raise.  He never got in any real trouble, but he was wild, and he was a lady's man.  He liked to meet girls.  He always said my mother tamed him (laughs).  He always says if he hadn't met Odessa, then he don't know where he would--what would have happened to him cause he was just--his nickname was Joe Baby (laughs), when he was eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two years old.  So he says, thank God, I met your mother cause I don't know what I would have been doing, yeah.

Speaker 1: You're the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Can you give your siblings' name and order?
Speaker 2: Sure, there's, well, I'm number one, and number two through nine, Deborah Ann Marshall.  And there's James Richard Marshall, what's Johnny's middle name?  God, I can't remember Johnny's middle--well, John Marshall.  And there's Jeri Isaiah, Isaiah Marshall, Denise Louise Marshall, named after my grandmother, Diane Odessa Marshall [Freeman], Donna Marie Marshall and Doris Faye Marshall.
Story_ID: 10389
Speaker 1: And what is your earliest memory?  You're named after your father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.]?
Speaker 2: I'm named, I'm, I'm Joe, Jr., that's right.
Speaker 1: Right, are you, are you junior in the full sense of the word?
Speaker 2: You mean am I just like him?  I'm probably like my mom [Odessa Taylor Marshall].  And so most of us even look like my mother, and probably two thirds of us look like my mom.  And my earliest reco-recollection is probably pushing my baby sister in a stroller (laughs).  You know, I remember that.  I remember, I remember, you know, playing in the backyard of this huge house in, in St. Louis [Missouri].  We had this big house, and my grandmother [Louise Pierce] lived downstairs.  It was on Cook Avenue.  If I remember correctly, I think it was 3624 Cook Avenue.  I don't know why I remember that.  And I remember snow, you know, and I remember [Dr. Martin Luther] King's Highway in St. Louis and, and I, I lived there till I was eight.  So I went to elementary school there.  And, and we had this really big house, and we lived upstairs and my grandmother lived downstairs.  And one of the things I--I mean I, if I close my eyes, I'm, you know, I, I see this big backyard.  And we had these dogs, and we used to play baseball in the backyard with my father and my brothers.  And at night, I would go to bed, and I would wake up about one in the morning and sneak downstairs and climb in the bed with my grandmother (laughs).  And then about twenty minutes later, my sister would come down and get in (laughs).  And then ten minutes after that, my brother, James [Richard Marshall] would come down.  So many mornings, we would wake up, and I'd be on one side.  My sister would be on the other side, and my brother would be at the feet of my grandmother.  That went on for a while.  And I remember going over my grandmother's house, and I remember--that's funny cause all these are my father's relatives.  I never met, I, I didn't really meet my mother's relatives.  They were back in Tennessee, I guess.  And I remember going over to my grandmother's house and, and all the aunts and my, my grandmother's sisters would come over and my great-aunts, I guess, they would come over.  And they would be downstairs just laughing and talking, laughing and talking, and I'd be tucked upstairs in the--listening, and I'd say, what are they talking about?  What's so funny, you know?  And that's a memory I really have of them, just--and they talked in this weird language.  It's sort of like pig Latin, but it was their version of pig Latin so that nobody could, nobody could understand what they were saying (laughs).  Years later, my grandmother would explain it to me, what it was.  And I just remember hearing these, these words, what are these words that they're saying?  But I guess they were well disguising it so that we couldn't really understand what they were saying.  And then walking in rainstorms with my dad, you know, he used to take me--it would rain, and my mother would say, you can't take them out.  And my father would take us out, and we're walking in the rain.  And it was pretty, it was, it was, you know, I liked the school I went to.  I went to Catholic, St. Alphonsus [School, St. Louis, Missouri].  And, you know, I liked the nuns, even though they were rough as hell on me.  I remember getting a whipping in the third grade by this nun, the principal, just took in this--I guess I got smart.  And she took me in this room, and took out this long yardstick, stick, you know, these rulers, yardstick rulers and just, just beat the hell out of me (laughs).  And, you know, I went home and told my father, and my father said, well, you must have done something wrong (laughs).  But it was pretty cool.  It was cool, but mostly I remember, you know, that we had, every time I turned around there was a baby coming.  I used to bet on the sex of my future brothers or, and/or sister, at school.  It's gonna--and I, and I started losing because four of the first five were boys.  So I just figured they were all gonna be boys, and after a while I would bet quarters and whatever, and I'd lose.
Speaker 1: So what was that whole experience with new babies coming home, you know, and--cause, you know, it wasn't, actually, you didn't get to be the only one for very long either?
Speaker 2: Not, I'm, I'm May, then April.  So that's what eleven months, I said, I, you know, when we get together, both our parents are still living.  So we get, we really, you know, it's really funny, and, you know, we say, you didn't wait very long, did you?  You know, you just couldn't wait, just couldn't wait, huh?  (laughs) So, it's May, eleven, May, right, for the first three.  And, you know, we, sometimes we say some, probably some pretty cruel things (laughs), but it was, no, it was, it was fine.  I mean it was, it was, it was, I mean one thing I remember about my father was that he was always working, and my mother was always working.  My mother was a nurse, and my father had, you know, different jobs.  He, he drove--in St. Louis, when we lived in St. Louis, he drove, the one I remember for sure was, he worked for this company called Wonder Bread.  And he drove this Wonder Bread truck.  And, you know, he would deliver bread, and I could remember him coming home and giving us all this bread (laughs), we had bread for days (laughs), you know, him pulling him, you know, but he was always out there working, you know.  My dad worked, but he had to, you know.  The kids were coming faster than he could handle.  So he worked one job, two jobs, and he would always--it's funny the things you remember.  He would, I remember on Friday nights he would bring us fried rice.  And it's funny the things you remember, fried rice.  And when he brought that rice, I was so happy, and it's, it's--I mean I remember that so much that I did that for my kids (laughs).  You know, I would go out, if I was gone or on Saturday evening, I would always bring Chinese food home for them.  But, you know, we just, it was a family.  We just kept growing, and, and, you know, you didn't think about it.  They were just your siblings and you had fun with them.
Story_ID: 10390
Speaker 1: So what were you like a little, little person?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a good little boy, good little boy.
Speaker 1: Were you quiet, were you--?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  I was quiet, you know.  I mean that's what they tell me, you know.  I was quiet, I was, you know, I was, I was a little angel, you know, I was a Catholic school boy.  So I'd walk around like this, and I was a good student.  I got As on my report card, and, you know, I was, I was a little angel.  That's what my (laughs), that's what my mother [Odessa Taylor Marshall] and grandmother [Louise Pierce] tell me, you know.  I was just, I was just good.  And, you know, I--except for my occasional run-ins with, you know, the nuns.  I was, they tell me I was quiet and good, and did all my homework, and, you know, didn't get--my, my, my mother and father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] swear I never gave, I didn't give them any trouble.  Of course, I know that's not true, but they say, you know, "Joe, you never gave us any trouble."
Story_ID: 10391
Speaker 1: You had a close relationship with your grandmother [Louise Pierce] then, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Me and my, me and my grandmother--I named her, I named all the kids in my family.  Well, I gave them nicknames, let's put it like that.  My name, I named my grandmother, my grandmother's name is Louise, but early on I started calling her Gugu.  I don't where it came from, G-U-G-U.  So that became her name.  That became--everybody, you know, Gu, nobody even calls her Louise, Gugu.  And then my, the, the sister that was after me, the second one, Deborah [Ann Marshall], I named her Bobbie.  I don't know if I was trying to say baby or what, but she became Bobbie.  And then James [Richard Marshall], I named him Jamesmo, and I guess I quit after (laughs) because they, they took a break.  Maybe they took a break because I was naming all these, naming all the kids.  So, yeah, so, oh, my grandmother, yeah, we were real close, real close.  She's the one that took me to school my first day of school.  And I can remember her taking me there.  And I started school early.  I was, I tested out of kindergarten, so I started school when I was five instead of six.  And I was real scared, and I remember her taking me to school.  And she took me by the hand, she dropped me off, and, you know, I, and I went.  She would take me, and there's pictures of me dressed up in, you know, she bought me my first suit and took me to Forest Park in St. Louis [Missouri] and took pictures.  She took me to her home and, on Paris Avenue in St. Louis and I remember her taking me out to, I guess it was like a patio or more like, I guess some kind of loft, and it was outside anyway.  And, you know, she'd tell me, you know, tell me to say bird, and I would say bird, and this is tree, and this is tree.  So, you know, me and my grandmother, my grandmother and I were always, always close.  And, you know, they--the kids accuse, all the kids were saying, you know, Joe's your favorite, Joe's your favorite, Joe's your favorite, but she would always say, well, he just understands me (laughs).  He just understands me, so, yeah.  My grandmother was a very big influence on me.
Speaker 1: Are there things that she taught you, sort of messages she gave or things that, you know--well, you know how older people give you, you know, teach you certain lessons and things that have stayed with you?
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest one was certainly that "the more you know, the more you owe."  I mean she really did, she literally told me that when I was six years.  And I didn't know what she was talking about.  But that's the overriding message of, of her life that she imparted to me.  And as I grew up, you know, I understand what she meant by that.  You know, I guess another way of saying it is, "to whom much is given, much is expected."  And we've heard that, and her way of saying, you know, I mean it was basically.  And I've interpret that--interpreted that to mean this is what I told her, you know, as you grow and progress in life, so you must help others to do likewise.  And, you know, that's how I--and that's become actually the model and the core value of Omega Boys Club [Street Soldiers].  And then, boy, she was big on John 3:16, "For God so loved the, so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."  She probably taught me that first.  She was a real, very religious woman.  And so I knew that, I mean I, I know it now.  I can just--yeah, so she's, she was a--and my grandmother was a fighter and survivor, you know, raising a, being a single parent back in the--she was born in 1907, and she had her son in 1923.  And, you know, she was on her own.  So, you know, she was a survivor.  She was tough, tough lady .
Story_ID: 10392
Speaker 1: Why did they send you to Catholic school?  Were you guys Catholic?
Speaker 2: That, that was, that was a--my mother [Odessa Taylor Marshall] was Catholic.  My father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] wasn't, and probably hearing an earlier story of a--and my parents have been married almost fifty-six years, and probably right, it tells you how they were able to do it.  Right from the start, my mother was Catholic, and she wanted us to go to Catholic school.  My father wasn't Catholic, and he was like, nah, we can't afford that.  But I, I would say, I mean he's the one that says that my mother convinced him because she believed that this was, you know, education was important and this was the best way to go about it.  But just because of the sheer enormity of the cost, he could have easily have said, no, this is, let's send him to public school.  But they've always been able to work things out.  And, you know, he has acquiesced to her better judgment, if she really thought that it was important.  And they've always had this negotiation, compromise, peace that I think has, you know, allowed them to stay married for so long.  That's how I ended up at Catholic school cause my mother thought it was just the, you know, the best one.  And my father said, okay, if you think so, I'll find the money and make it happen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the school, was it, was it all black or mixed or what was it?
Speaker 2: It was mostly white.  There weren't, there weren't--I mean I look at the pictures, there were maybe two or three of us.  I mean the school wasn't very big.  So I'm talking--in fact, the school was so small that we had first, second and third grade in, all in the same room.  So I didn't leave from class.  I didn't leave--I moved rows over.  And so (laughs), first, second and third grade, we were all in the same room together.  It was, it was, I know I was in the minority, but there wasn't a lot to being a minority, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't a very, very big group of kids.
Speaker 1: Do you think you were disciplined more there?  I mean it had a, it was more of a structure, a rigid structure?
Speaker 2: Well, Catholic school, and I went to Catholic school my whole life.  I never went to public school.  In fact, I never set foot in a public school till I started teaching school.  So I have a real perspective of both because I, I taught public school, but I went to Catholic school.  And I can tell you the main differences are just the expectations, the expectation level in pub--Catholic school is, is high.  There's no such thing as social promotion.  And that's true, that's true to this day.  I mean they expect everybody to achieve.  When I started, when I started teaching in public school, I found out quickly that, that doesn't exist.  It wasn't even close, even though technically, public school teachers have greater credentials, more credentials, they don't have the same expectations.  You know, in, in Catholic school, by and large, no matter what you are, they expect you to achieve.  And if you don't achieve, they're not--you're not moving on to the next grade.  So I got locked into academics early on, and the other piece is that I was rewarded, reinforced, praised.  I mean and I, and I got used to that.  I liked that.  I know with my, my parents would really--I brought home an A, and they went nuts.  So, I liked it, and I wasn't gonna (laughs), and, you know, I wasn't gonna get off of that.  So I just kept going.
Story_ID: 10393
Speaker 1: Now, what was the young Joe Marshall, what was he like?  Did he--what were you like?  What were like?
Speaker 2: What was I like?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Then?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Like I said, I was good. I was a--.
Speaker 1: No, but I mean what, what did you think about or dream about or want to be or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably then a policeman, fireman, you know, I mean I had no idea, just, you know, just probably, I mean I remember thinking about being a policeman or a fireman.  You know, and that was it.  I was, I--there wasn't, I mean those early years were just carefree, fun years, you know.  And I, I didn't see a lot of--at least for the eight years I was there, I didn't see a lot of racial discrimination.  And I know it was there because I would hear about it, but just in the, the circle that I ran in, I mean I didn't encounter a lot of that stuff.  And I didn't get into a lot of, I didn't get into a lot of fights.  Everybody was pretty friendly, and I was protected, you know.  I mean, you know, my grandmother [Louise Pierce] protected me, my dad [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] protected me.  I didn't have a lot of, I didn't have a lot of problems.
Speaker 1: So your life consisted of school and family, family life and church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, going to church, and going to church.  But that was it, you know.  It could have been in the country (laughs), you know, the way things run in the city at that early age.  It was, it was, it was pretty mellow.
Speaker 1: Now, you went, you went to Cath--you went to that school, you said, until '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Until third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, till you were eight [1955].
Story_ID: 10394
Speaker 1: I was eight years old [1955] when we moved from St. Louis [Missouri] to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: Now, what, why did you, why did your family move to Los Angeles?
Speaker 1: Why did they did anybody, why did anybody black move from one place to the other (laughs), you know?  Why did they move from the South to this.  They're always looking for more opportunity, and, you know, there's supposed to be gold in the hills of California.  And I guess my parents just, you know, both of them thought that, you know, the move would be better, that more opportunities, better jobs.  So we packed up and--my dad [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] left first.  He came out here and paved the way.  And I remember when he left, we were like, ah, dad, you're leaving us (laughs).  You know, you're leaving us, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave.  He said, don't worry, don't worry.  And he took the train out here, and, and it was really sad leaving cause I had friends in St. Louis, you know, like, my--brother and sister down the street.  They didn't want us to leave.  It was all emotional.  "Oh, " (whining) "my friends.." (laughs).  And then my mother [Odessa Taylor Marshall], and at that time, it was six of us cause, yeah, the last two [Donna Marshall and Doris Faye Marshall] were born in Los Angeles.  And all six of us are on the train with my mother.  And I remember cause I always tease my sister cause I had to change her diaper, and you know, give her her bottle on the (laughs), on the--I remember doing this on the train.  And we just got on the train and came out to, to Los Angeles, and I saw my dad again, and boy, we were just, you know, and happy we saw my father.  And, and then the--and it was just a different place.  For one thing, we moved from this huge house in St. Louis to this two-bedroom house in Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 10395
Speaker 1: Yeah, [moving] to Los Angeles [California] was, and the, the, the initial difference, the biggest difference was going from this, living in this big house to, well, to six kids, two parents and a dog living in this two-bedroom house.  It might even been a one-bedroom house.  I don't remember two bedrooms.  I'm--it must have been two bed--how could it not be two bedrooms.  But the four boys slept in one room.  We had bunk beds.  So it was myself, two brothers on the top, two brothers on the bottom.  And I don't know where my sisters--they must have slept in the living room, and then they had a, another room or in my parents' bedroom, and probably the baby slept in there, right.  Whoever the baby was at the time (laughter), slept in there.  It was, it was crowded.  It was crowded.  And then they kept having babies, (laughter) so it was like, eventually, we ended up with nine kids in that two-bedroom house.  There were kids everywhere.  And look I--so that was the, that was one thing that was like, wow.  You know, we ain't got no room, right.  And we, you know, we always got along.  We pretty much got along, we did.  You, you know, we had brother-sister stuff.  You know, we'd have, like when my brother and I, the one that, number three [Jeri Isaiah Marshall], my brother, number four, but the third one in the family, we used to have--cause we're only two years apart.  So we got, you know, we'd fight and go to the playground and fight.  And we, and we moved across the street from this park, playground in St. Louis [Missouri] called Har--I mean Los Angeles, called Harvard Playground.  And, you know, to play, and at first I thought the playground, well, I can play, I live right across the street from the playground, what a great place to be.  And, and so, you know, as I moved on from, you know, nine, ten, eleven and twelve, I got about--there were, actually, the first sport I ever really played was tennis because there, you know, there weren't, anybody, I mean they had like, it was like five black people playing tennis.  This is way before Venus [Williams] and Serena [Williams], right?  (Laughter) And I really got involved in tennis, and I'm playing the tennis.  They had tennis courts right there.  So I started playing tennis, and my sister and I got to be pretty good.  And I ended up, you know, we were like the tennis champions of Harvard Playground.  And I thought, you know, I was pretty good until I went to the, wherever champions of playground tennis go to, and I ended up going out to play the white boys (laughter) who were real tennis players.  I never will forget this, a-a-h-h, six love, six love.  I mean I, you know, they just killed me.  I was like, oh, I mean this is real tennis.  This is competition, it was really (laughter) funny, and I'm like, I think, I didn't win one game, you know, it was, it was, and I was like, oh, you know, so it was fun.  And I, I ended up giving up tennis, which was prob-probably best.  My sister kept playing actually.  She kept playing tennis and actually played, played a lot of tennis throughout her teenage and even adult years.  But I gave up tennis for basketball, and I started playing basketball, and played baseball at the park--I always used to play--I never played in school.  I always played at the playground.  I had a great time at the playground.  But the playground in the neighborhood, L.A. had something that St. Louis didn't have, and--at least, maybe it was St. Louis, but I never found it.  There were a lot of gangs in Los Angeles, and so whereas in St. Louis, every stranger was a, you know, was not a threat and a potential and usually were friends.  When I got to Los Angeles, the whole--the cold, hard streets of Los Angeles, I found out that every stranger--I quickly found out every stranger was a potential enemy.  You know, so I used to get jumped.  I would go to the playground to play baseball, and I'd get jumped by guys who were from the other side of town, just to jump me.  You know, they would just jump people, and, you know, jump you and beat you up.  I got initiated into a gang when I got to Los Angeles, about three years after that.  I remember I got jumped severely when I was eleven, and I got initiated into a gang when I was thirteen.  And so it was just very different.  It was very, very different.  You know, I developed this view of young black males in particular that they were, they were two things:  They were not serious students, and they were, and they were potential enemies just because, just because they were.  And you learned, you know, I learned to avoid, and, you know, I learned every shortcut in Los Angeles, (laughter) every backyard, you know, every alleyway, you know, I just learned how to navigate the streets of L.A.  So it was, it, it was a shock.  It really was.  It was very different, and fortunately, I kept going to Catholic school, and my grades were good.  And, and the other thing that, looking back on it, and I say this all the time, the only thing that really saved me because of the streets of Los Angeles, was my father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.], because when I got jumped into this gang, I remember going home and telling him, you know, dad, I'm in this gang now, you know.  And he said, what?  (Chuckle) I said, yeah, he said, and I remember his word, said, boy, you must be crazy, right?  And so then he jumped me out of the gang (laughter) that night.  And I was always more afraid of my father than I was of, I guess they call them now, the homies, right?  So I'm not--really, my father was really big because, you know, he--and I'm pretty sure if it just been my mom [Odessa Taylor Marshall], with the nine kids and the peer pressure that was there, I'd have been dead or in jail.  I always tell them that.  I always tell my dad thanks for not taking penitentiary chances with your children.  So L.A. was a tough place to grow up.
Story_ID: 10396
Speaker 1: Do you think your parents [Joseph E. Marshall Sr. and Odessa Taylor Marshall] were aware of what was going on [gang activity and violence]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  L.A. [Los Angeles, California] is a very deceptive place, and even now, when people go to Los Angeles, L.A. doesn't have the, the high-rise tenements of Chicago [Illinois] or [New] Jersey, and it's, it's green grass and palm trees and sunshine.  So you would, it doesn't look like there's a ghetto in Los Angeles to be honest with you.  And it didn't look like there was a ghetto when I got there in, you know, in 1956.  So, no, not really.  They didn't know, they didn't know, they didn't know.  You know, they learned, and actually, and, and even, even and it got worse for my later siblings because the, the--at least the gangs that, that, that I ran with and the people I knew, that were gangs of my time, they weren't, they weren't vicious gangs.  Well, they were vicious, but they didn't carry guns.  So I might get beat up or knocked out or be in fights or that sort of thing, but I wouldn't get killed.  But later on, when my, my younger brothers and sisters, when the Crips and Bloods came in, then they became deadly.  So they learned, they learned about that, but they didn't really know, you know, know about what was going on.  And I think that happened to most people that came to Los Angeles.  For years, they didn't--they didn't know what blue and red and all that stuff was.  They, they, you know, they didn't know what these kids, they didn't know these kids were killers.  But, you know, we, we persevered, and we survived and the family getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.  And, and things were funny because there were so many of us, we didn't have a wash--we didn't a laund--a washing machine at home, right.  So my, vividly I remember we had this wagon, right, and we would load all these bags of, pillow cases full of clothes (chuckle) in this wagon, and my mother and, and the kids, we just, we just walked ten blocks to the, you know, the washhouse, and we were almost like Pied Piper, my mother was the Pied Piper and all these little kids (laughter) had, going to washhouse.  And, you know, family, family was real--we had a lot, again, even though we were in the mix of--the circumstances were different, but the city was different, but the family was always pretty tight.
Speaker 1: Now, how did L.A. change you as a young adult male?
Speaker 2: Well, you just--you know, between the police and gang members, you became, you know, vigilant and very conscious.  You're always on the run, you're always on the lookout, going anywhere, just, was, was, was really, was--I don't want to say an adventure because that makes it sound like fun.  But you always had to watch your back, always, new territory, in new neighborhoods.  Everybody, I mean every male was a potential enemy, is a potential threat.  So, you know, in that sense, it was, it was, it was, I mean I was real, just treacherous, is the only word I can think of.  Just the streets of L.A. were just treacherous.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what year, you say, what year is this?
Speaker 2: These are the years between 1955 when I ended, when I ended up moving to Los Angeles.  I was eight years old and I entered the fourth grade, through--I left L.A. in 1964 when I graduated from high school, and left Los Angeles to come to San Francisco [California] to go to college.  So you're talking, what between the ages of eight and seventeen, those nine years; it was nine years of running (laughter).  Nine years, I mean you had fun.  You had high school.  Probably the other thing that I experienced in Los Angeles, at least overtly that I didn't experience in St. Louis, was racism, you know.  I never, I never remember being called a nigger in Los--in St. Louis.  But I do remember being called that by both white people and black people in Los Angeles, because I went to Catholic schools, I was, the school was really predominantly white, and the elementary wasn't, wasn't, wasn't too bad.  When I got to high school, I went to this very prestigious Jesuit Catholic high school [Loyola High School].  And there were, I was, there were hardly any blacks there.  So there was a lot, I would encounter a lot of that at the school, at the high school.  So that was the other change, you know.  I just, you know, it wasn't big, but, but I remember that, that stuff hadn't happened in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 10397
Speaker 1: Now, when you said you jumped into the, you got jumped into the gang?
Speaker 2: Yeah, jumped into a gang, right?
Speaker 1: So what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means, I went to the park, and guys came over, lined me up against the fence and just beat me up, and said, you're in.  They beat you into the gang.  And, you know, that's how you get in (chuckle).
Speaker 1: So how did you get out?
Speaker 2: I told them I wasn't having nothing with that no more (chuckle) cause my daddy [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] says, I can't do it.  And, I don't know if they jumped, if they beat me up again.  I don't, I don't think they did.  I just sort of said, yeah, man, I ain't with that, you know.  And my, I, you know, and they wasn't gonna mess with my father.  I mean the gangs weren't bold enough in those days to like take on a grown man cause these, these guys are mostly my age, you know, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years old, you know.  So I said, yeah, I know you guys.  I hang around you guys, but I ain't in this.  I, and so, yeah, it, it, it ended pretty quickly.  I mean I'm, I'm talking about the next couple of days, and when they came around to get me, I was like, un-un.
Story_ID: 10398
Speaker 1: You said you got into the prestigious program at--?
Speaker 2: At, at a Catholic school, Loyola High School [Los Angeles, California], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, I graduated from elementary school, we had to decide whether I was going to public school or Catholic high school.  And, you know, for my mother [Odessa Taylor Marshall], you're going to Catholic high school, and, and, and Loyola High School was, had a great reputation, you know, it was an academic school.  There were other, other Catholic schools, you know, and I, you know, passed the exam, you had to take an exam.  I got in and went there in the ninth grade.  And at those times, those schools were very--those kinds of schools were very renaissance, romance, you know, type schools.  What I mean is, I took Latin, I took four years of Latin.  I took two years of Greek, studied the Iliad and the Odyssey, you know.  It was a great education actually, you know.  I look back on it, I, I wouldn't really change it, you know.  And other people were saying why aren't you taking Spanish, you know, and I understood the practicality of things like that, but reading those classics--it was a good education ex-except, you know, the racism, for the racism, racism that existed at that time.  The other thing that it was devoid of was, you know, there was no, I mean black history was totally bereft from the curriculum.  And I got lucky because when I was junior, I must have been fifteen or sixteen--no, I was sixteen, I read my first book by a black author, which was 'Native Son' by Richard Wright, and I was like, wow, I mean that book was the, the bomb.  And, and that made me realize, you know, that there was this whole body of work out there, you know, that I knew nothing about.  But, you know, the Jesuit education was just great, you know, writing, speaking.  I learned to write well, learned to speak well, and it was, it was good.  It, there were just things that it was missing.
Speaker 1: Now, you said, you were also active in sports?
Speaker 2: I was not active in sports at the school level.  I was active in sport at the playground level.
Speaker 1: Oh, on the playground.  Okay, that's--(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: Right, played a lot of sports at the playground, played a lot--but I, I didn't, I did not, I think I went out for basketball a couple of times at the school, but never made it.  And I wasn't that good.  I had a lot of fun with that.  I didn't have a lot of coaching.  I liked baseball mostly, and I think the toughest thing about that was being, being black in an all-white environment that was not nearly as friendly as being black in a, in my elementary school environment.  I had to, I, if you want to--I mean in a sense I had, it was good that I was able to come back to the neighborhood, and come back to the community, you know, come back to--I mean I lived in the ghettos, what they called the 'hood today.  I lived in the ghetto, so I would leave the ghetto to go to this prestigious Catholic, you know, white high school.  And so I saw, going from a real--I had a real, I had a four-year glimpse of their world, but I was grounded in this other world.  So, but, you know, it, it balanced itself out.  When I was a, I think I was a junior--maybe I was senior in high school, and I had a real incident that, that, that stuck with me.  They had intramural basketball, and, you know, you'll play basketball and, and I was, I wasn't a jock, and I had me and my friends--a couple of my friends and I we got in, and we were playing this team that had all these athletes.  And somehow we were winning.  I don't know how in the hell we wound up beating these guys.  We, we were winning, and the athlete, one guy--this guy's was a, the tight end on the football team, and he was place kicker, and he was sort of a star.  And as we started to win and win, he got more and more frustrated.  And he said, don't let that nigger beat us, right.  And I was like, my friends and I, we just stopped, we were stunned.  And I mean everybody, and he said it again.  And it was like, everybody stopped in the yard, and they were looking.  And the, and the thing I remember more than anything is that priest was standing right there, and he didn't say anything.  I mean he didn't say anything.  And you got to remember now, I was a altar boy.  I was like, everything that a Catholic kid could be.  I mean I'd been serving mass since I was like, you know, fourth grade.  I learned my Latin first, and he didn't say anything.  So I was, so I was like, hot, you know.  And we finished the game, the game and lunchtime was over.  Well, I went to the vice principal, and I'm saying, you know, this guy called me a nigger.  And he said, well, you know, and hemmed and hawed, hemmed and hawed, and I said, and the priest didn't say anything.  I remember the priest's name too.  I said, he didn't say anything, Father so and so didn't say anything.  He said, yeah, well, you have (mumbling).  And I, and I, I wasn't getting any justice.  I told the vice principal, look, you know, if I don't get some justice something, apology or something, I mean I, I said, you know what I said, I said, I'm gonna get my boys and we coming back here and (laughter) we gonna tear this school up (laughter).  I really did (laughter).  I said, we're gonna tear this school up.  And he tells me, and he, and then he told me what, he said, if you do anything, you're not graduating from this school.  And I don't know how they worked it out.  I don't know if my parents came up there or whatever, but I, I really remember that.  I remember that I was wronged and that the, the priest didn't take a stand, and I, I never received--I never received anything, and then I was threatened with ostracism or not, not graduating because of that.  So that jaded me a lot.  It really made me, you know, I, people reveal themselves, institutions reveal themselves, and when I got to college I had a similar incident like that.  But those are the things, you know, and you know, you had to--but you handled it all, you handled it all and you moved forward; you handled it all and you move forward, you handle it all and you move forward, and I graduated.
Story_ID: 10399
Speaker 1: Now, when you graduated, was it assumed that you were going on to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did you end us choosing the University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California]?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I knew I was, well, I was, I mean I thought, well, it's a Catholic school, it's a Jesuit school.  I knew nothing about historic black colleges by the way.  I didn't, I didn't even know Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] existed.  I didn't even know it existed, much less where they were.  So I didn't want to go to Loyola [Marymount] University.  It was in Los Angeles [California].  I wanted to go away.  I didn't want to go too far away.  And I really wanted to go away because now, by now, all nine of us were in the house.  And my father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] was good meting out chores, right?  And one of the chores that each of us had to do was wash dishes.  And sometimes we'd rotate, and you'd have, Tuesday was your day, Wednesday was somebody else's day, but then there were times we'd have to do it a week at a time.  Washing dishes for eleven people is a lot.  You know, that's a lot of dishes to wash.  You got nine kids, you got two parents.  You know, and my mother [Odessa Taylor Marshall] cooked all the time, and that's, you know, so like, when you washed dishes, you'd be like, it's a two and a half hour job, right?  And my father wasn't just into washing dishes.  You had to dry the dishes, you had to put them away, you had to sweep the floor, clean off the counters and take out the trash, right?  And then he'd come and like, you know, is it all done?  And by the time I graduated from high school, I was like, I'm, I'm out, I (laughter), I ain't washing no more dishes.  I'm leave--I was ready to leave (laughter), I'm out of here.  I just had to find a place to go.  And it's, this is so funny.  So I said, where can I go?  And I found this school, which was a Jesuit Catholic university, 'cause I do like the education, University of San Francisco, but I was tired of being around all white people.  I mean I was like, I got to have me some black people in my next school.  USF had a great basketball team.  And, in fact, they were challenging UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] repeatedly at that time.  UCLA was the, the national powerhouse.  They were the, you know, they won all the championships.  But generally they had to play USF in the regionals to get to the, the Final Four at that time.  So I saw USF, and I saw all these black players on the team.  I mean God, they, they must have had ten black players out of twelve.  I said, ah, this is gonna be it.  I can go to San Francisco.  I'll be away from home, and not too far away from home.  I can come home when I want to, and it's gonna be black people at the school.  So applied to USF, got in, came up here, and I kept looking around the campus, and looking around the campus and came to realize eventually that the black players on the team were the only black people in the (laughter) school (laughter).  So here I was again (laughter).  And it's a lot like you can look at Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.].  You see Georgetown University, all of their players, you think the school is black.  The school is all white.  I said, ah, here I am again, the only black person at the school.  And I got up here, and I'm like, well, okay.  So, but I was away from home, had my own dorm room.  Look, as long as you have the dorm room and the meal card, you're complete happy; didn't have to wash no more dishes.  My parents and my sister, we drove up, and I remember the day they left.  I waved, and I was like, ah, I'm on my own (laughter).  It was really, really good.  I remember going home for Christmas.  I couldn't be gone for--I had gone home for Christmas, I went home for Christmas and they'd given my room away (laughter).  I slept on the couch.  And when you left you home, they just moved another one in.  So, yeah, that was the beginning of my career at USF.
Speaker 1: So how was, how was USF for you?  You had been in a different environment all that time really, I mean with the Catholic schools, but this was not--.
Speaker 2: No, this was the same.  It was pretty much the same as Loyola [High School, Los Angeles, California].  It--.
Speaker 1: Same, okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was white, all white again.
Speaker 1: Well, but it wasn't Catholic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Cath--it is Catholic.
Speaker 1: Oh, it is Catholic.
Speaker 2: USF is a Catholic Jesuit school.
Speaker 1: It's not state supp--oh.
Speaker 2: San Francisco State--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I--.
Speaker 2: --is, is a state institution, but USF is like [College of the] Holy Cross [Worcester, Massachusetts], it was like Georgetown.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you, okay.
Speaker 2: It's a Catholic Jesuit university, so I was with the Jesuits again.  And, you know, it was pretty much the same thing.  The only thing was that I was on my own, you know.  And the little, oh, you know, and I met new friends.  It was great being away from home, you know.  I'm in a new area.  I learned, I learned the, you know, I learned--and I started going to parties and all of that and girls and the whole bit.  Freshman and sophomore years were kind of, just exploratory years for me, you know, getting into the curriculum, deciding on a major.  I was a political science major.  But little things happened, and I remember--now, again, and I graduated in '64 [1964], I told you about the incident that happened on the school yard at Loyola when they called me a nigger.  1966 was a big basketball year, and there was this team, the first black, all-black team ever to make the finals of NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] basketball, Texas Western [College, now the University of Texas at El Paso, Texas].  I don't know, but it was Texas Western.  They played this all-white team from [University of] Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky].  And it was a big deal cause you had an all-black team playing an all-white team, that had never happened.  And I remember sitting in the dorms watching the team--watching the, the game, and we didn't have TVs in our room so we all came down to like the rec [recreation] area.  And we're watching the game.  And again, I'm the only black person.  And maybe two--I mean there are very few blacks, especially in the dorm cause the other black students were like commuters.  So I'm sitting there, and all these white people are sitting there, these white kids are sitting there.  And Texas Western is winning the game, the black team is winning the game.  So then these white kids started saying, don't let them niggers beat you; don't let them niggers beat you, right?  And I'm like, damn, (laughter) man, I'm like, (laughter), but little things like that would happen all the time.  And, you know, and, and that was sort of my first two or three years at USF.  You know, I, education was cool, I'm getting into the classes, little things are happening.  I'm exploring the city, I'm exploring the [San Francisco] Bay area.  And the floaty thing with my life began to change.  The, the real, the first big tangible change for me came when I read a, when I read a book called 'Malcolm X Speaks.'  I read that book probably when I was nineteen, when I was a junior, sophomore or junior, I can't remember which one.  I read that book.  And you got remember the times, I mean the times, and I'm in the Bay area, right?  And so all this stuff is going around me.  I'm not sure of what it is, but all this stuff is happening, you know.  I used to read about Malcolm X in the newspaper, and the portrayal of him was his, his hate-mongering, you know.  He hated white people and all of this, and, and, you know, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] is going on and the Civil Rights Movement is going on, and I'm, I'm, I'm in California.  I'm removed from it, but I know it's, I, I, you know, I see this stuff on television, all this stuff was going on over at [University of California at] Berkeley [California].  They'd all be, these protests, the free speech movement, and none of it really, it was just--I'm in it, but I'm not in it.  It's swirling, but when I read, I read this book called 'Malcolm X Speaks,' you know, I'm like, wow.  Then I read the 'Autobiography of Malcolm X,' and then that book was like, after that, everything, just--for me, that was the book that crystallized me.  It didn't so much change me, it just crystallized things for me.  And that was the beginning of the rest of my life.
Story_ID: 10400
Speaker 1: You were talking about--?
Speaker 2: Reading Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: Reading of Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: The book.
Speaker 1: And I wanted to know why that changed, what about that changed your life.
Speaker 2: The book was just great.  It's the best book--it's still, after all the books I've read, it's the best book I've ever read.  It was just a powerful saga of, of this black man.  He introduced me to a world that I didn't know anything about.  And that was African and African American history, didn't know any history at all.  Those three books, 'Malcolm X Speaks,' 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' and 'Malcolm X on Afro-American History,' which is a little seventy-seven page book, just, just, just flung open this door for me.  I mean I didn't know anything.  I mean, I, I mean, you know, I, I had all this other education, but I was totally bereft of any education and knowledge about myself.  And reading that book sort of put into perspective what, all, everything else that was going on around me.  And so then also it put in perspective what had happened to me at Loyola [High School, Los Angeles, California], what was happening at USF [University of San Fransisco, San Francisco, California], you know, with all these other things.  And so my, I, I went from this quiet little college student that sort of, just floating through college, probably figuring that I was gonna get a degree and then make all of this money and move up in the hills to this--it gave me a purpose, a real purpose, a real social purpose, a real commitment, a real consciousness, and I just--and I became literally, the campus militant.  I mean (chuckle) I went from this quiet guy who didn't say anything and never fought back, I don't I mean physically fought, but just took everything, to the campus militant.  And I founded the BSU [Black Student Union] at my school.  I remember just engaging in all of these sort of town halls on the campus, staging protests.  I remember one of the early things we did--this is even before we founded the Black Student Union, was we did, the black students and I--cause it was a small group of blacks in the school, we got together and staged this, this sort of mock skit on, on, on the homecoming queen at the school.  And we did in the, in the student commons.  And, and our whole thing was to, was we're here, we're here, you know.  In a way, it was a lot like the invisible man.  We were just invisible at that school.  You know, we had nothing.  I mean we didn't even have any--we were just faceless, nameless people, sort of floating through this institution.  And suddenly we were, you know, we realized, hey, you know, we're here.  This is our home, you know, we're not getting educated in a lot of things that we think we need to have.  We don't have any black professors at the school.  We don't have any black courses at the school.  We don't have anything.  So my quest became to make USF, I guess maybe to "blackenize" USF (laughter), right; to make USF fulfill our needs.  And it started with founding the Black Student Union.  Then I said, we got to have some ethnic studies.  We'll have some courses, we need some instructors, we need some food (laughter), we need food; we need some music in the juke box.  And for the next few years, that's what I did.  That's what I did.  I brought Eldridge Cleaver to the school (laughter).  I brought Huey [P. Newton]--I brought, I brought, I brought Muhammad Ali to the school.  I brought Angela Davis to the school.  I created a, a budget so that we could bring every--you know all of these, these forums to the school.  I went out and found professors, just changed it complete--eventually studies--had an ethnic studies department at the school.  That became my, my quest, and that was the legacy I wanted to leave at USF.  And it happened, it worked.  I mean we just completely changed the face of that institution.
Story_ID: 10401
Speaker 1: Had our [University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] little riot (laughter).  When I, I always characterized myself--you, did you see the movie, "Do the Right Thing"?  I was the [character] 'Mookie', I was the guy that was holding everybody else back, but when Mookie, he's the one that started a fire.  Well, that was me.  I was the one--I was the level-headed, practical one, you know, I was the one, we had all these philosophical types at the school who would smoke dope and, you know, read the '[Little] Red Book [of Chairman Mao]'.  That was a big thing at the-- Mao, quote Mao Tse-tung, right.  But I was always very practical.  Let's go tutor kids.  Let's give Carnival, let's do this, let's do that, and let's--I was always very practical.  But the university, of course, resisted me greatly.  And I mean any change, they resisted change.  And I remember we brought this group called, from McClymonds High School [Oakland, California]--why are they banging on that?  (referring to off-camera noise.) That's bad, huh?
Speaker 2: It's better if they don't.
Speaker 1: That's a real problem.  I don't even know what they're doing.
Speaker 2: Who is it?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Just talk about your riot.
Speaker 1: We were making all these changes at the school, but they weren't moving fast enough for me, but, of course, the, the administration thought I was moving too fast, you know, why can't we wait, you know, as [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] says [sic, "Why We Can't Wait"].  And, and I remember we were constantly trying to bring things to the school.  And we had this group of cheerleaders from a local black high school.  And they came to perform at, you know, at halftime, at a basketball game.  And as they began to perform, I guess the crowd thought their routine was going on too long.  So they started booing them, and they started throwing stuff at them and throwing--and spitting on them and everything.  And, man, we were, cause we had invited these kids.  And these are high school girls, and we were, we were really, really upset.  And my, and, and the kids wanted to riot that night.  They did, they wanted to tear USF up, but I held them off, I held them off.  Well, the next there was this, another intramural basketball game.  It's so funny how it goes back to when I was in high school and there was an intramural basketball game, and it was the BSU [Black Student Union] versus some other team and in the end we felt we got robbed.  So at the end of that game, I couldn't take it any more.  I closed the gym, took all the basketballs, chased all the white students out.  And it was like we held--and I, I remember saying we ain't taking any more, blah, blah.  And when I broke, everybody else broke.  So then we broke the windows in the gym.  Then we went over to the, the student union, and we, we held up in the student union, and we just boiled over.  We ended up trashing the student union.  It was our little mini-riot.  We thought about taking over the administration building, but by now, you know, we was like, oh, God, we really did something, right, real serious.  So, they, eventually, they put all of us on trial.  And, but the one that was on trial first was me cause they figured if they'd get me, everybody else would follow.  So, they had trial in the law school building, the moot court building.  The place was packed.  I mean it was, like students came, cause I was pretty well known on campus.  And they, they packed this place.  And I'm saying, what am I gonna do?  I'm gonna get kicked out of school.  Now, my parents [Joseph E. Marshall Sr. and Odessa Taylor Marshall] are really worried.  I'm gonna get kicked out of school.  I'm like, oh, man.  And I was working on my teaching credentials.  I was teaching by day and taking my courses at night.  I said, I'm gonna lose my credential, I won't be able to teach.  Then a professor from the law school came and found me, and he says, I don't like what they're doing to you.  So I'm gonna defend you.  Can I be your counsel cause I had no counsel.  He says, I'll be your counsel.  So the dean of men lined up, and he came in, and they read the charges, you know, the charges against me, all the BSU students were there.  All the white students were (laughter) there.  And then this lawyer stood up and said, I want you to tell everybody what your experience at USF has been like.  So I just started talking about it, what it was like since I had been there, my sense of social isolation, the, the incident at the Texas Western [College, now University of Texas at El Paso, Texas] basketball game where they had talked about, you know, don't let those niggers win.  I just talked about what it was like being black at USF.  And everybody listened, and we went home.  And then the next day, they came back, they convened court again.  And (laughter), the dean stood up and said, all charges have been dropped (laughter).  All charges have been dropped against Joe Marshall and all the rest of the students at USF who were in the riot, and the place erupted.  I mean it erupted.  So, you know, it was my twenty-third birthday, I remember that, cause then we had a big party that night.  And I was very lucky.  I was very, very fortunate that--again, it showed me that it was, it's, it's the law school people that came to my defense and my aid, and they pointed out literally what it was, what it was like being black at USF, which in many ways was just what it's like being black in America, this sense of social isolation.
Story_ID: 10402
Speaker 1: I decided to go to, I was gonna go to law school, and I missed the law school exam.  And the dean of education found out I missed the law school exam.  And he--it's funny cause I don't know how he found out, but he said, you know, Joe, I know you missed the law school exam.  Why don't you get into the teaching credential program?  So I got into the, the teacher credential program.  And when I graduated and got my BA [Bachelor of Arts degree] in math--in soci--in political science and sociology, I became a teacher.  And I didn't go to law school.  I was supposed to go to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and they came out to recruit me.  Instead I ended up being a teacher, thought I would teach for a couple of years and then go to law school, but ended up loving it, loving being a teacher.  My whole ca--I started teaching when I was twenty-two years old.  And that was my adult life.  I was a teacher and administrator after that for years.  I taught middle school, I taught high school.  I was an assistant principal.  And everything that I, I had learned at USF [University of San Francisco, California], everything I, I had taken from the [black student] movement, I was gonna take back and educate these young kids.  And I wore a dashiki.  I had an afro, I mean--and I looked younger than all the kids.  I mean I looked, when I was twenty-two, I looked like twelve.  In fact, when I started teaching, one day I was walking through--and I taught high school seniors.  That was the other thing, I taught high school.  I wasn't teaching elementary school and middle school.  I was teaching kids that were sixteen, seventeen and eighteen years old.  And I remember getting to the school and walking in, and I went in to use the, the faculty bathroom.  And a teacher came in and said, what are you doing in here and grabbed me by my neck, right, and pulled me out (laughter).  Yeah, ah, so I had to go to the principal, said (laughter) this our teacher.  This is Joe Marshall, our new teacher.  It was, I loved it.  I taught U.S. history, black history and world history my first year.  I never had a master teacher.  They threw me in there.  I taught three classes, and teachers only teach five classes.  I taught three on my own, completely, and I was like this is the greatest thing in the world.  And my kids and I were very--in fact, I was so young that there was only four years difference between me and my first group of students.  And I'm fifty-five now, almost fifty--I'm fifty-four.  My students are fifty and forty-nine years old, and they all call me Mr. Marshall.  But, but, but my relationships with my students were formed.  So, that became my adult career.  I just was a teacher for years, and everything was great.  You know, I, I was--I ended up getting my Master's in education because I was a teacher.  I was militant in my first year of teaching that I let a student walk out (laughter), at the school.  Everybody knew who was behind it.  When black history month came, I put on these plays for all the women, all the girls in the school.  I bought helium, black helium balloons for every girl in the school, gave every girl one and when school would let out, that they would let all the balloons go up into the sky.  I put on an African fest, a festival for all the entire school--I mean I was everything at that school.  And the kids loved me.  But the, the staff, man, this kid is, twenty-three year old kid is--I got to get him out of here.  So they farmed me out to the worst place in the district literally.  They sent me to this place that wasn't even a school.  It was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] building that housed, I guess you would call delinquent kids, but every kid that got kicked out of school, they sent them here.  So I started working there.  I said, okay, all right, they ain't gonna let me go back to my school.  So I'll work with these kinds.  I mean I had arsonists, pimps, dope dealers, burglars, all of these kids.  And one of the things that interested me, I ended up taking over that school and rewriting the curriculum.  And I was the youngest one there, but I organized all the staff and so on and so forth.  One of the things that really interested me was, I couldn't tell how many of these kids had real psychological problems and how much of this was normal adolescence.  That, that's what led me later to get the PhD in psychology.  I wanted to be able to tell how much of this was normal adolescent growth and how much of this was really troubled kids.  That's why I ended up getting the PhD in psychology.  So I got a--have this mixture of the PhD in psych, the Master's in education, and, you know, the, the two undergraduate degrees in, in the humanities.

Speaker 1: What led you to forming Omega [Boys Club/Street Soldiers]?
Speaker 2: Because I figured that if the kids could survive me in the classroom, they'd be okay.  I was a very, very demanding instructor.  I knew they loved me.  I loved the kids.  They used to call me Mean Mr. Marshall because I would, I was, I was really tough.  I was very, I was very old-school.  If the kids--I'd give homework assignments, and, you know, the kids would bring back their homework, their math, I taught math, and I'd take a problem off the paper and put it on the board.  And I'd send Juanita to the board, and she'd miss the problem, and I'd go berserk.  One time I tore her paper up and threw it in the trash can.  And she said, well, I did my work, why you being so mean to me?  I said, Juanita, yeah, you did it last night, but you don't know how to do it today.  I mean I was really, really tough on these kids.  I would call their homes if they weren't in class.  If I didn't see Charles, I'd go to the phone--and I'd do this in front of the kids.  I'd pick up the phone, I'd call, and I'd say, Mrs. Jones, where's Charles?  Well, Mr. Marshall, Charles isn't in school today cause we have to move, and I need him to baby-sit for me.  And I'd say, Ms. Jones, you got to move on the weekend cause I want Charles in school.  And people thought I was crazy.  And I was crazy.  I had a grading policy.  You know, every, every teacher has grading policies.  And, you know, my policy, you could be in my class every day, do all your work, turn in everything; if you couldn't pass my exams on Friday, I would flunk you.  And parents would really get upset with me cause they'd show them all the work that I'd done--they ain't gonna get credit for this work?  I said, well, but they don't know how to--they didn't pass my exam.  I had all my exams, and my whole reasoning is, look, you got to take SATs [Scholastic Aptitude Tests], you got to take high school exit exams.  It didn't really matter.  If you couldn't make it happen on the paper, then I didn't care.  So you'd figure these kids would hate me, and nobody wanted my class.  It was the opposite.  Kids, kids, look, kids would get kicked out of other classes to come to me.  My classes were so full, I used to tell my principal, don't--no more.  So I knew if these kids could survive me and get As and Bs from me, and I'm teaching pre-algebra and algebra and geometry, if they could survive me, everything is gonna be fine, right?  They can go to USF [University of San Francisco, California], UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles, California], Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], any school they wanted to.  It did not work out that way.  These same kids that I had that got As and Bs from me, in the sixth, seventh and eighth grade ended up essentially getting Fs in life.  They--I mean I would get letters from my former students, and they would be in my mailbox.  And I thought they were from colleges, and they were from prisons.  My girls used to come back to visit me, you know, and knock on the door and say, hi, Mr. Marshall, I'm so glad to see you.  And they'd have--they'd leave me at thirteen in the eighth grade and they'd come back at sixteen with, with babies, twins.  One girl brought me a stroller with twins on it, in it.  Probably the worse thing was, I would have to go to the funerals of my kids.  You know, I had to keep a tie in the trunk of my car because the kids would be--I mean really, you know, Jack would come in and say, you know, you know, Marshall, one of our kids is dead.  So, I began to realize that them being with me a 180 days a year, fifty-five minutes a day wasn't producing the results that I wanted or they wanted.  So I decided I had to extend my classroom, I had to go on--you know, being a good teacher wasn't enough.  I wanted their lives to work out, and their lives weren't working out.  Getting an A from me, and getting an F in life wasn't, wasn't cutting it.  So I started an after group program--after school program called Omega.  And what I did was I called, I put together--some of the kids that just graduated and some of my current kids, and I said, let's forget the, the math, right?  Tell me what's going on with y'all?  What, what, what's the problem?  Why aren't you guys achieving?  And then they told me.  They were just being tempted.  There were drug dealers and gang violence and my good kids--what really bothered me was the kids that weren't in it were getting ready to sell drugs.  That really got to me.  And I said, oh, no, we got to figure out a way.  We got to figure out a way to get you past what I call the hurdles and steeplechase of life, right (laughter), they were just not making it.  And that led to the formation of Omega.  The first time we met in 1987, I told all these kids that if they stayed away from drugs, stayed out of gangs, the commitment I made to them was if they wanted to go to college, I'd help 'em find colleges.  I'd help prepare 'em for colleges, and I'd help them, I'd help pay for their college education.  And I said, but we're not playing basketball.  We're not, you know, none of this recreation stuff.  We're just gonna--I, I--the essence of this will be meeting.  And we're gonna meet and we're gonna figure out a way out of this mess that you're currently in.  And I said, do you mind belonging to academic, drug-free boys' club?  And they said, nah, let's do it.  And literally, the rest is history.  I mean it, it's just grown and grown and grown since then.
Speaker 1: Why do you--now who was part of that original group when you met?
Speaker 2: The first kids?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  You, you had co-founders.
Speaker 2: Co-founded, with a guy named Jack Jacqua, who was this--you know who John Brown is?  The white guy that led the raid on Harper's Ferry [West Virginia]?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, okay, oh, yes.  I didn't know you were talking about--.
Speaker 2: Think of John Brown and you got Jack Jacqua.  He looks like John Brown, he acts like John Brown.  Jack is a '60s [1960s] revolutionary to his heart.  We're as different as night and day.  If you saw the two of us, you wouldn't think--we, we look like the odd couple, literally, but we share this common passion for kids.  And so Jack knew every kid.  He was, you know, he befriended the kids, and we ended up talking a lot about kids.  And so I enlisted him.  I don't know, one day when another kid got shot, and we just said, that's it, Jack, let's form this club.  So he and I basically did this together.  And we met in the, in the, in the basement of a, the neighborhood house, up the street from where we taught.  And we just started.  We scripted every meeting.  We never knew what we were gonna do.  We didn't have any money, but we had made this commitment to these kids.  And that was 1987.
Story_ID: 10404
Speaker 1: In 1988, I had my first group of seniors, and I said, they were ready to go to college (laughter).  And I didn't have any money, right?  But Channel 7, ABC [American Broadcasting Corporation], came in to film what we were doing.  They had heard about this, these dedicated teachers who were trying to help these inner-city kids.  And they filmed it.  They were gonna come one time, and the guy came and said, this is great.  So they filmed it for a week, and at the end of the week, they went on television and said, this is great.  If you want, if you like this, please send in money.  So they sent me $40,000 (laughter).  People just reached in their pocket, and I got forty grand.  That's how I sent my first group of kids on a tour of historical black colleges down South, and how I paid my first group of tuition.  And once word, the word got out, foundations then started coming to me.  And they said, you know, can we help?  And that's how it all happened.  I mean I never, I didn't have a five-year plan.  I didn't have any money.  I didn't have anything.  All I had--it was a lot like, you know, my grandmother [Leslie Pierce], I mean we've got a theme around here, "If you do good things, good things come to you".  So we just started doing good things, and I guess people recognized it, and good things started happening.
Speaker 2: Why do you think you were having success with the kids, though?  This is an after, it's an after-school program, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So--.
Speaker 1: No sports, no basketball, none of that stuff.
Speaker 2: So what, were you getting any resistance from the schools themselves, cause sometimes, you know, teachers have felt that organizations like yourself are stepping on their toes.  None of that?
Speaker 1: Probably.  I had tunnel vision, and I probably had a, that stuff is happening.  I mean it didn't matter, and I had the kids.  The kids were coming so any flack that I took or any, but what the kids call, player-hating (laughter), it didn't really matter to me.  And when we met on Thursday nights or we met on Tuesday nights, and we did our tutoring and, and you know, we, we had those, that's all that mattered to me.  It's all that mattered to me, all that mattered to me.  And a lot of these kids were kids, you know, I found out their stories.  They were selling drugs, you know, they were gangbanging.  There was a lot of, of, of really, really intense violence in the city at that time.  We never had Crips and Bloods, but we had neighborhood rivalries.  We had, you know, one of the area of the city would shoot somebody on sight, and somebody in another area of the city.  One of--you asked me why--I'll give an example.  There's a kid had got kicked out of high school, and his mother brought him to the club.  And this kid told me that he wanted to go to a black history course.  He was from one area of town.  The course was in another neighborhood.  And he said, he was afraid to go.  I said, what do you mean you're afraid to go.  He says, Marshall, if I go over there, they'll kill me.  I said, you want to go study at this place, and they're gonna kill you for that?  He said, yeah, so I'm not going.  I said, nah, you going.  He said, well, how I'm get there?  I said, I'm gonna take you.  He said, Marshall, they'll kill you too.  I said, well, if they kill me, they kill me.  And he was like, looked at me.  That's the kind of attitude I had.  So if you're asking me why was I successful because I was willing to put my life on the line for them.  And there were a lot of times, in those early years especially, where there were situations where my life could have been taken.  But I didn't care.  I was not gonna let these kids down.  I think early on, that really carried us.  Our, our--you understand, these kids don't have anybody that looks out for them.  They don't have any fathers because of crack cocaine.  And crack cocaine really hit the streets big when I started the club, they don't have any mothers.  We got kids that don't have anybody.  And these kids--I was willing to step in there and fill that void in any way that I could to the extent of, you know, I would protect you.  So there were oftentimes in these early years, we would have these meetings, and there would be gun shots, literally, outside the place.  But the only safe place--inside, it was gonna be safe.  There were guys who would come up to get guys, who were inside, and I'd stand at the door.  And I said, you ain't going in there.  And these guys were carrying guns, but I didn't care.  I mean these are my kids.  It was like my house. Right, you're not coming in there.  So, you know, they believed in us and we believed in them.  And eventually, we bent the way of the streets to us.  I mean it took a long time.  We changed the code--we got them to believe in what we did.  So they came to see that, don't mess with Omega [Boys Club/Street Soldiers].  Dr. Marshall or Mr. Marshall and Jack [Jacqua], they ain't letting you mess with their kids.  They're not letting you mess with those kids.  They're not letting you mess with those kids.  And when our kids would leave, they would be called names.  They were called future kids because they believed in the future.  They were called little Marshalls.  They were called Malcolms.  They were called, you know--they wore these t-shirts that say, "I don't do drugs; stop the violence".  And they would, you know, they would be teased for wearing these shirts.  They would be just--but they, they, they kept coming back.  You know, they took all this, and then when they were willing to risk ostracism, that made me even, Jack and I, even more willing to take things for them and, and to work hard and raise money for them.  And then when we sent our first group of kids to college, and they came back home for the summer, and they were off in Atlanta [Georgia], and they were off in, you know, in Delaware, at Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware], they were like, this guy is serious.  So, you know, we became this lore of the neighborhoods, and, and it just, you know, it's just, it just, it worked.
Story_ID: 10405
Speaker 1: Now, Joe, do you think this program is, what you've created here is replicable?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, and I've found ways to do that.  I mean it's so much bigger than it was now.  Then it was this little thing, but the short answer to your question is, I've never wanted to franchise Omega Boys Club, okay.  But once I learned that what we were doing there works, that there was a method to the madness--people would walk in and they, they would see these kids who were gangbanging and drug dealing, and now they were going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and they'll say, what did you do?  You must--it's magic.  And I would say, nah, I don't think it's magic.  I think, you know, I know you think this charismatic, dedicated person, which I am, you know, maybe.  But I think there's a method to the madness.  I didn't know what it was.  It took me like seven years after the club started to figure out how we did what we did.  Once I figured that out, that's what I want to replicate.  I don't want to replicate Omega Boys Club.  I'm not McDonalds.  But I want to replicate and franchise and export the prescription, the methodology.  So I have been doing that for the past six years.  I've been training people from other parts of the country, and literally around the world.  I trained this young man from South Africa who works with kids in South Africa, and if you heard him talk, you would hear him use the same prescription and methodology that we use here in San Francisco [California].  If you came and visit the club, you would see a, a place where there is no violence, and you would see a place where there's academic achievement.  The next thing was that could I transfer what's here to an entire system?  Could I make what happens at Omega Boys Club, could I make it happen at a middle school that, in Oakland [California]?  So we, we've gone from training individuals to training systems.  We now have adopted two middle schools, an elementary school is on the horizon, another middle school is on the horizon, a high school is gonna become an Omega school. They're gonna use our philosophy, our methodology, our prescription and infuse it into the school.  The one school we have been working with the longest, violence has drastically reduced at the school. See what I'm doing, I'm working through people. And the school last year had the highest improvement in test scores in the city of Oakland. So yes, it's definitely transferrable. And I'm training police officers.
Story_ID: 10406
Speaker 1: There's only two type of kids.  The first type is a kid who's doing something wrong, something destructive, and he needs to change or she needs to change.  The second type of kid, and this is the majority, is a kid who's doing well, getting good grades and listening to their parents, a good kid.  But they think there's something with being good.  They think they're a square, a sucker, a nerd, a punk, a mark, a buster.  So because they think being good is square, they then become, they change and they become, they get into destructive behaviors.  I work with both kids.  I'm into prevention, intervention and rehabilitation.  And there's a process for doing that.  Now, that I know the process, I teach others, and they use the same process wherever they are.  Oh, you want to know what the steps are (chuckle).  There's a four-step process.  And the first thing is to change the way young people think.  Young people live--people who are into destructive behavior have a certain way of thinking.  There's a code they live by.  I call it the commandments of the 'hood (laughter).  When I was a kid, they would call them rules of the street, okay, but there's a whole way, a set of rules that they follow.  They're commandments.  And I say, command because what do your kids say to you?  I just wasn't thinking, I just didn't think.  Well, if I'm your sergeant, when I tell you "Attention," do you think about what I say, or do you automatically do it?  You automatically do it because it's a commandment.  It, you, your body moves before your brain reflects, right, cause you--it's a command.  This, this set of rules that these kids live by don't allow them to think.  So they react.  And then when, when something, a minute later, they say, God, I just didn't think.  They can't think because the commandments are fixed.  I'll give you an example of a commandment.  Thou shalt not snitch.  That's a fixed commandment.  So, I ain't telling, right?  That's in there.  So when something happens, you don't reflect, you don't think, you just don't tell.  You don't think, maybe I should tell, maybe, you know, something'll happen if I don't tell.  The commandment is embedded.  The commandment is, thou shalt not be no punk.  That's a commandment.  It's there, all right.  That's the way they think.  They never think, what is a punk, you know.  Or thou shall get thy respect.  Thou shall get their money on.  There's a whole list of commandments that these kids live by.  The thinking drives the actions.  Well, the first thing we do in the prescription is we change the way young people think.  We ask them to get rid of these commandments.  Now, here's the tricky thing about these commandments: the kids aren't stupid.  They aren't just malicious, they aren't asocial.  They aren't evil, they aren't mean, they aren't "bad", quote.  They think these commandments are survival techniques, right, except these commandments--they're not helping, that, they're actually getting them killed, but they have been told by somebody all along that you have to think this way in order to survive.  So they're holding onto something, and for them to give up something, I had to show them how these things are really not in their best interest.  But believe me, these are fixed, embedded, "thou shall be down for thy homeboy, right or wrong."  It's all part of these commandments.  "Thou shall be down for thy set, a hood or thy crew."  They believe these things, okay, cause they've been told, if you believe these things, you will survive.  They don't help them survive.  So they, the first thing I do is, is get them to give up this way of thinking which we call the commandments of the hood.  The next thing I got to do is stop, get them from--they do certain things that put them at risk, okay, heart disease, I'll give you a quick example, heart disease.  In heart disease, there are risk factors, right?  Genetics is a risk factor, right, presis--predisposition to heart disease.  Heart disease in your family.  But you can exacerbate that by doing certain things, smoking, drinking, real simple.  They, kids understand that.  There's a risk factor for them which they have no, over which they have no control, that is the family that they're born into or the neighborhood they live in; environment and family, they have no control over.  But they can exacerbate that by other things, drugs, alcohol, material values, the attitude they carry.  There's a whole list of risk factors.  That's the actions.  First you have the thinking, then you have the actions, right?  We ask them to eliminate risk factors from their lives.  I mean I can't go into all of this, but essentially, what I'm saying is that, just as there are risk factors for heart disease, there are risk factors for violence.  So we ask them to eliminate the risk factors.  The third step, and this is the crucial step because without this, nothing else can be done, these kids carry a lot, around a lot of emotional residue.  They carry around a lot of anger, fear and pain.  The classic example I can give you was somebody like Tupac Shakur, who carried around a lot of anger, fear and pain.  That's why kids resonate to Tupac because he's like them.  Kids loved Tupac, they feel Tupac.  They feel Tupac's anger.  They feel Tupac's fear.  They feel Tupac's pain.  If those issues aren't dealt with, they eventually explode.  So while I'm changing their thinking, while I'm asking them to put aside certain things that put them at risk, I'm going in there and dealing with the fact that their mother was on drugs.  They're going with the fact that they were jumped when they were young.  I'm dealing with the emotional residue because what happens is they take their pain out on somebody else.  And then I give them a prescription, an antidote.  I give them new rules to live by that will inoculate them so that they will not get involved in destructive behavior again.  There's a whole set of rules around friends, around respect, around change.  It's a four-step process.  I was doing this all along, but didn't I--what I was doing.  I was, I was hitting it, and, but once I sat down, and I started analyzing, and I looked at why, why Lamel went to jail and why Jermaine was set free, I realized what had worked with him and hadn't worked with this one, and I said, ah, this is the methodology we've been using.  Once we were able to get the prescription, then I can now teach it to you.  I can teach it to anybody.  And whenever you find violence or destructive behavior, you're going to see these elements there.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes for, for black youth and, you know--?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna save them, I'm a save 'em.
Speaker 1: Save them, and--?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna save them from themselves.
Speaker 1: In San Francisco [California] or all over--?
Speaker 2: Over the world.  Oh, and actually, it's not just black youth I'm trying to save.  I'm trying to save people.  In the book, I write, I've been in Israel in 1994.  Everything that I do with these kids, I see in the Middle East conflict, exact same things, "being down for your homie, right or wrong," right, that's what that's all about.  "Being down for your set, your hood or your crew."  That's the way they think, same thing.  I see the same risk factors, everything.  What I do here could work there.  What I do can work in northern Ireland.  This is the clinic in which I'm operating right now or maybe the clinic that I'm allowed to operate in.  But we get, businesses from Japan come over here.  I participated in, in forums with the French American Foundation of our problems with French youth, French youth.  Just this past week, a visitor from Denmark came and visited here because he wants to know what we do with youth because they have similar problems in Denmark.  I went to Japan.  I've been--we get a lot of international and national--because they want to know what we do here that stops violence.  See, my kids don't have violence, problems with violence.  And they're achievers.  So right now, the clinic I'm working in is, yes, primarily in the African American community.  But what I want to do is save people--we save people, not places, okay.  Part of--that's one reason I wrote the book because I wanted people to know about what we do.  That's one reason why we did the documentary.  That's why I have a magazine.  That's why I have a radio show syndicated in forty cities.  That's why I have--I'm getting ready to do a television show, and eventually, I'm a have a movie (laughter), I'm gonna have a movie.  I may be in my lifetime only allowed, I may be relegated to saving black people.  That's fine, I mean I have no control over that.  I know I have a prescription and an antidote to violence anywhere.  I will ride that as far as people will allow me to do.

Speaker 1: I can't help but thinking about how, when, you said, when you first had your awakening, and it was reading the, not 'Autobiography [of Malcolm X]'--was it the autobiography?  No, it was the--.
Speaker 2: It was 'Malcolm X Speaks,' but the autobiography followed right after.
Speaker 1: And I, and you also said that, you know, you had no knowledge of history--?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know, your own history.  And it awakened you, and sort of put a fire in you that had not been, you know, had not been realized, and really resulted in your attaining and showing, proving yourself as a leader.  And I'm wondering how you handle your children in that sense of history or connectedness or where they fit?
Speaker 2: History is like a, a flower.  One of the things I've found out is, it's like a flower that--but you can't plant flowers on bad soil.  What I mean by that is, these kids, these kids carry so much garbage inside of them, that I only began to teach them the history once the soil has been cleaned out.  I mean I, I can't plant, I can't plant the history and culture on top of the commandment for the hood, okay.  I can't plant that on top of risk factors.  So as I'm cleaning them out, I'm preparing them for the historical flower which then will take hold and bloom.  I didn't have a lot of baggage.  So when I learned about history and culture, it took root, and it bloomed and it made sense to me.  But if these kids that believe in, you know, "thou shall do what you got to do," you know, and "thou shall get thy respect," it's difficult for me to teach them about Malcolm [X] and [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and Medgar [Evers] because to them, they're just like, they'll be people who are like, you know, those are old folks who didn't know what they were talking--and that was their time.  They can't see the connectedness.  It is a big part.  It is a logical extension because then it becomes fuel for you to--I mean you understand, these are, this is a microwave generation.  They don't believe in patience.  They don't, they don't see long-range things.  They don't have any vision.  I can't transfer that to, I can't transfer Frederick Douglass to them until they begin to look at themselves.  To them, Frederick Douglass is like a man in the moon.  So it, but it gets--but once they do that, then they can see the connections, which, which, which then allows--which then sort of slows them down, connects them with those that came in the past and will connect them with those in the future.

Speaker 1: As a person who's so involved with black youth or--I mean you can expand, but let's talk about the youth, you're primarily involved with.  What are your hopes and concerns?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very concerned because realize that the rate of black-on-black crime, or well, no, let's--let's put it like this: more black youth have killed each other in the past fifteen years, than all the lynchings that were previously done in America.  Now, what does that say?  This generation is, is, is less educated--they're undoing, I mean they're killing each other.  And what can I say, they're, in deed, in jail and prison, they're jail and prison, they're jail and jail and prison, numbers wise.  I'm not talking about every one of them.  I'm talking about--they had more opportunity than ever, and they're taking less advantage of it than ever.  They were things that they can do that I couldn't do and my grandfather [Isaiah Taylor] and even my father [Joseph E. Marshall Sr.] couldn't do.  But they're going to jail.  Now, there's this new book by Ellis Cose called "[The] Envy of the World," which talks particularly about black males, but it can generalize the black females.  Black females are the high--are the biggest rising population in the prisons.  We have a real right to be worried about the future of black youth because in, at a time when they can do more than every, they're doing less than ever.  And that, they're, they're--they have fewer--and the marketing to them.  The marketing through music, the marketing through just creating an image, which they have fewer options than ever, I mean I got a library here full of books.  They don't know anything about these books because they're not being told about them.  You know, books are square, you know.  But it--they're almost like this mindless sort of automaton generation that's being programmed by television, by videos--they're overmatched.  That's the word I use for them all the time.  They're overmatched.  They don't have a chance to find out who they are because somebody is always telling them who they are, and who they should be.  And those people who tell them that don't care about them at all.  And that can contr--they, they are the victims of bad advice, bad information, bad example and bad instruction, except it doesn't look like it's bad.  It looks like it's good.  So everything is twisted for them.  They, many times--and a lot of people don't understand that.  They have more guns, more drugs, fewer adults, nurturers.  The village that used to raise us isn't a village anymore.  I mean, now, you know, it's really, really sad.  And, fortunately for me, I understand the milieu in which they're being raised.  And let, let me give you the best example I can think of.  And this, to me, this is worse than slavery times.  And why would I say that?  Okay, with no chains, because crack cocaine has, has--is a force stronger than motherhood.  So there was never a time when black women did not want to raise their children.  There was never, never an agent that would remove the desire for them to raise their children.  In slavery times, people would, women would try and go from one plantation to the next to find their kid.  Crack cocaine, not only has taken away the fathers, but they're taking away the mothers.  I got more kids being raised by their grandmothers, more kids that don't have mothers than I ever had and has ever happened.  So the nurturers aren't there.  You know, the, the basics that are required so that kids can move in an orderly fashion, so that society can function, that the community can function, have been stripped.  And if, if you don't have mothers and fathers, it doesn't really matter what else is going on.  It doesn't matter how much opportunity you can do.  You're not getting proper guidance.  That's what these kids are facing today.  And that's worse than slavery.
Speaker 1: What are your hopes?
Speaker 2: That we can turn it around, once we know what the--once we know what we're up against, we can turn it around.  Once we know what we're up against, we can turn it around.  I think, and I think that people, and then we need to mount an offensive.  I say that they're suffering a social form of AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome].  I call it, I call it Addiction to Incarceration and Death Syndrome.  That's pretty good, huh?  I mean--and it's funny because people understand what medical AIDS is.  It's killing people.  So they mounted this offensive.  I mean they mounted a serious offensive.  They've got Elizabeth Taylor and all these people, and they're gonna raise this money, and this, and eradicate AIDS, okay.  These kids are suffering from their own form of AIDS.  They're addicted to incarceration and death, and it's a--look at the numbers that are in prison.  Over a million black men in prison.  We ain't got but a million (laughter), we got, you know.  One out of every four is in the system.  Yeah, and so, so we just have to mount an offensive, you know, to--and nobody's immune.  See, that's the thing.  People have always thought that, that, you know, well, if you live in the right place or you have two parents--the case of Kemba Niambi Smith--I'm not gonna go through that case, but this is a girl who was, the classic middle-class kid, who ended up in jail for twenty-four years after she went to Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], you know.  And she thought she was protected, and her parents thought she was protected because they had all the, the traditional protective factors.  None of these kids are safe.  So, I understand what Addiction to Incarceration and Death Syndrome is.  It's so bad for them that they would talk about, I'm not gonna live to be forty; when you got to go, you got to go.  Life ain't promised to no one.  When they want to be successful, they're naming things after death.  Look at all the rappers.  They're always naming themselves after--there's a Lynch Mob, you know, they always name it Murder Incorporated, they name everything after dying.  They even rap about dying.  They even talk about dying.  So it's incar--addiction to incarceration and death syndrome.  I understand what they're suffering from, but my hopes are that we mount an offensive to social AIDS, just as, as strong as we've mounted an offense against medical AIDS.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: "The more you know, the more you owe."  I mean, I mean, it's funny because even the year of my birth is, is, is significant.  And I was born in 1947.  That's the year Jackie Robinson broke the color line in baseball.  So if I look at myself, I'm like, wow, like you were just destined to do this (laughter), you know.  You, you're (laughter), you were born in that year, just a--you know, the exposure, the time I lived in.  Probably, I mean I believe being the investment--being a community person is, is just a great thing to do.  A lot of people don't believe in that.  I believe that probably because of the era that I lived in, which was very community oriented.  But I'll be very, very satisfied, you know, I owe [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and Malcolm [X] and Medgar [Evers] and all those who came before me everything.  And I'm fortunate enough that I realize that, and I know that, if, in fact, there aren't those who believe that and are those there to replace them and continue the, the struggle, that we can give everything away.  And I know at this point, there are very few people who, who are willing to take up that baton and run with it.  And, you know, so my legacy will definitely be "the more you know, the more you owe," just like my grandmother [Louise Pierce] told me when I was six.
