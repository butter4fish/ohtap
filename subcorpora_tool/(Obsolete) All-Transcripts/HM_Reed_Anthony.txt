Speaker 2: No there isn't (laughter).  I believe I was given the middle name Renard that was based off of my father's [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] best friend, Ray Warwick [ph.].  But other than that, it's--I don't think there are any other Anthony Reeds that were there before me.

Story_ID: 648341
Speaker 1: So, well I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to start with your mother's side of the family, then we'll talk about your father's [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] side; then put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Her full name is Jeannette Kaye Coleman, married name Reed.  Spelled J-E-A-N-N-E-T-T-E, and Kaye is K-A-Y-E, the last name is C-O-L-E-M-A-N, and Reed, R-E-E-D [Jeannette Coleman].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is February 17th, 1935 in Port Gibson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: Okay, we've been able to trace them all the way back to slavery days. The most interesting thing is my grandfather had twenty-five siblings, and it was by a wife plus two other women.  And some of the siblings were born several months apart.  So it made life somewhat interesting I guess you can say.  They (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All of these--all of these women lived in the same vicinity?
Speaker 2: Yes, they all lived in the same vicinity.  Again, this was around Port Gibson--Natchez [Mississippi] area where Alcorn University [Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] is located.  In fact, there is a road there by Alcorn that's named after my grandfather, it's Prince Coleman, Sr.  And his son--
Speaker 1: So the road is actually called--
Speaker 2: Yes, the road is actually called Prince Coleman, Sr. Road [Coleman Road].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his--
Speaker 1: Is there, well, before I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Well I just wanted to go, who Prince Coleman, Sr. was that they would name a road after him, what did he do?
Speaker 2: He had a construction company and he was very active in the community as far as building roads and providing the gravel to build roads.  So he was heavily involved in the community there.  In fact, a lot of the Colemans were involved in, that's Claiborne County, Mississippi.  So they were involved in the government there, as well as and other civic functions.
Speaker 1: Claiborne County, that's spelled C-A-L-A- C-L-A-Y?
Speaker 2: C-A-L--sorry.  C-L-A-I-B-O-R-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe that's the correct spelling of it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, there's a builder in Chicago [Illinois], believe it or not, named Claiborne Jones [ph.] who comes from Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who did construction on one of the theaters there.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: Spelled the same way.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.  In fact, the Colemans came from the Windsor plantation, which is again outside of Port Gibson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, at one point, my grandfather left Mississippi, moved to Dayton [Ohio], where he lived in Dayton for about twenty or thirty years, and then he moved back down to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather, this is Prince Coleman?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's Prince Coleman, Sr.
Speaker 1: Moved to Dayton, okay at one time.
Speaker 2: Right.  And when he moved to Dayton, his son, Prince Coleman, Jr. was a professional motorcycle rider.  And he was one of the first black professional motorcycle riders in the, I guess it's the Ohio River area.
Speaker 1: So this is Prince Coleman, Jr.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, were motorcycle races, I mean, so he participated in motorcycle races around the Ohio River--Southern Ohio region?
Speaker 2: Yes he did.  I can remember walking into his house, I was about seven or eight years old and his trophies were as tall as I was.  So it was pretty impressive.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You don't hear that, as much about motorcycle racing anymore, I mean at least I don't.  Maybe I just don't pay as much attention, but.  Would you say it was bigger than when he was racing then it is now or about the same or?
Speaker 2: Well I really don't follow it a lot, but I know within the family, his two sons, for example, have a motorcycle repair shop.  All of his sons ride motorcycles.  That was something, I didn't necessarily get into riding motorcycles, but I got into bicycle racing.
Speaker 1: Now are his sons located in Ohio or are they in Mississippi (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They're--they're in Alabama right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're in, I believe, Mobile, Alabama and Biloxi, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 648342
Speaker 1: Okay, down in the gulf, now.  Okay.  So, so, oh, you said your family could trace itself back to the Windsor plantation?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, can you tell us anything more about the Windsor plantation?
Speaker 2: No other than John Coleman was one of the overseers there at the plantation.  And he was with a lady who was a Native American, her name was Maria [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now this, John Coleman, now this is one of your relatives?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now is he black?
Speaker 2: He was white.
Speaker 1: He was white, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he was married to a Native American?
Speaker 2: Well I don't--I don't know if they were married (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, and--and I know that he was a German.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your [maternal] family's ancestry is traced just through John Coleman or through the native woman?
Speaker 2: Through John Coleman, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so John Coleman's liaison with an African woman, a black woman?
Speaker 2: With a Native American woman.  And then from there, we started getting more involved with blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I was trying to--do you see what I was trying to, I was trying to, I was asking you if you were descended from the Native American woman--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as well as John Coleman?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: His descendants, you know, have offspring with black people--women I guess, or black men--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and produced? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so, are there any stories about--so Port Gibson [Mississippi] that, that area around Port Gibson and Natchez [Mississippi] you say is that, is there any other place that your family had been before then that they talk about or is that pretty much the center of the activities as far as you know?
Speaker 2: That's pretty much the center of the activities, yes.  So that's where a lot of, of the twenty-five siblings, basically some of them stayed in that area, some of them went to Kansas, like I said Dayton, Ohio and Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay. Now, what did your--oh what about your grandmother [Inez Smith]?  Any stories about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: No my grandmother passed away when my mother [Jeannette Coleman] was about one.  So we don't hear very much at all about her.
Story_ID: 648343
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Jeannette Coleman] have a, a hard time growing up with so many brothers and sisters and no mother?
Speaker 2: Well, well my mother grew up, she was raised by her grandmother [Emma Smith].  And she didn't have any other siblings.  So my grandfather [Prince Coleman, Sr.] had the twenty-five siblings.  And he never married my grandmother [Inez Smith].  And when my grandmother passed away, my mother was raised by her--her mother's family.  So those were the Smiths.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother only had one sister and they didn't have any brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother talk about or have any stories of growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.  She talked about the struggles of growing up in a very segregated Mississippi.  And the struggles of being poor and trying to come out of--trying to come out of that environment.  When she was a teenager, she moved to St. Louis [Missouri] to live with her aunt [Beatrice Pickett].  And I think that really kind of drove my mother to try really, really hard to be successful.  So she had a lot of--a lot of energy.  And she also stressed getting a good education.
Speaker 1: Now, now so she moved to St. Louis about--around 1950 or so?  I guess that would make her--that would put her at fifteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I'm thinking, she--she graduated from high school in 1953.  So that would've meant that she probably came to St. Louis sometime around 1948, 1948 to 1949.  And she graduated from Vashon High School in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Vashon, V-A-S-H-O-N?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: George B. Vashon High School?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: My mother eventually graduated from college, but after she graduated from high school she got married [to Reed's father, Curtiss Reed, Sr.].  A year later had my brother Curtiss [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] in 1956--sorry, 1954, and then I was born in 1955.  She worked in education as a, first as a clerk and later on as a principal-secretary, all the while she was going to school part time to try to get her degree.  And she finally graduated with her bachelor's degree in 1979.  So that was a year after I received my undergraduate degree [from Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri].  She finally was able to earn hers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So one thing she did stress with both my brother and I was the importance of getting a good education, and using that as a way of getting out of the inner city.
Story_ID: 648344
Speaker 1: Well let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  His full name is Curtiss Reed, Sr. and that's C-U-R-I-T- sorry, C-U-R-T-I-S-S, and Reed of course is R-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is August 3rd, I'm trying to think of the year, I want to say 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Paducah, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: That's in western Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Now what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: They came from Yalobusha, Mississippi [Yalobusha County, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Oh how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) At first I used to, when I was doing the family history I thought it was Yellowbush, Mississippi, but it really is Yalobusha.  Y-E-L-L-A-B-U-S-H-A [sic.].
Speaker 1: Yalobusha.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  That's interesting.
Speaker 2: And that's in, I believe it's Water Valley County, Mississippi [sic. Water Valley, Yalobusha County, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Is that near the Gulf [Gulf of Mexico] or is it?
Speaker 2: That's in the northern part of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story behind the name of that town?
Speaker 2: I haven't had a chance to research it.
Speaker 1: Yalobusha.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's strange.  Okay, well, so, well what were your ancestors doing in Yalobusha?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what they were doing or what type of businesses that they were doing in Yalobusha, Mississippi.  Trying to track his family tree back has been a little bit more difficult than following my mother's [Jeannette Coleman] side.  I've learned a lot more about it from meeting with Bill Reed [ph.] who lives in--well who used to live in Dayton, Ohio.  And he was the family historian.
Speaker 1: Now, he'd be your uncle or?
Speaker 2: His father and my grandfather [Evans Reed] were brothers.  And I've never met my grandfather or grandmother [Verdie Kirkendall Reed] on my father's side. They had passed away.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he'd be a second cousin, I think, like, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe, yeah, that's--so that's Bill Reed.
Story_ID: 648345
Speaker 1: Now what is it about Dayton now?  They, they've got two sides of the family in Dayton, they're going to Dayton (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Dayton.
Speaker 1: Was there any particular thing that drew them to Dayton?
Speaker 2: I--I, you know, I really don't know.  It was--and it's kind of strange because in looking at the family tree, there were some Reeds that married Colemans.  And I haven't had the time to go back to see whether or not the Colemans that the Reeds marry were the ones that were related to my mother's [Jeannette Coleman] side of the family.  But with twenty-five siblings, I wouldn't be too surprised if--if they may have been related.  Just kind of looking at the movement, the mi- the Great Migration, since Yalobusha [Yalobusha County, Mississippi] is north of the Claiborne County [Mississippi] area, it's possible that as they started migrating north, 'cause the Colemans, like some went to Dayton, Ohio, and Chi- Dayton, Ohio, Chicago [Illinois], and Parsons, Kansas.  And the Reeds migrated from Yalobusha on up to Dayton, Ohio, Chicago, as well as the West Coast, and of course, St. Louis [Missouri].  So it's--it's possible that they may have comingled somewhere again along the Great Migration (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So the town--I mean the historian for the family is Bill Reed [ph.] who lives in Dayton.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what did he--did he have any stories about the family that you remember that stand out?
Speaker 2: He didn't have a lot of stories about the family.  I was able to visit him just once.  And then he was showing me documents of marriage records, people having served in World War I [WWI] and World War II [WWII].  But there really weren't any other stories that really stood out.
Speaker 1: So he had marriage and service records, that sort of thing to, I guess, document who actually was in the family.  But very little in terms of stories?
Speaker 2: Right.  We've--the few times, like I said we visited once, we talked over the telephone quite a few times.  He passed away in 2007.  And it was one of those things because we were corresponding by telephone and we only met once, when he passed away, the other family members there in Dayton, I think weren't aware that he and I knew each other.  And he passed away while I was in Australia running a marathon.  And I came back and was trying to get in contact with him and of course wasn't getting any answers.  And I didn't find out he passed away until several months later.  So I didn't get a chance to share with him the information that, that I had gathered and learned.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was he related to a Robert Reed [ph.] in Dayton at all?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.
Story_ID: 648346
Speaker 1: That's the one I know, but that's another one I know.  But at any rate, now is there a story about how your father [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] wound up in Paducah?  If he--the family comes from Yalobusha [Yalobusha County, Mississippi], but he ends up in Paducah?
Speaker 2: The family moved around quite a bit.  In fact, he has four or five sisters and I think all of them were born in different places.  And so he just happened to have been born in Paducah, Kentucky.  And the family evidently settled there for a period of time because he eventually graduated from high school there.  So they worked in farming as sharecroppers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so they--they worked the land.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember one story my father was telling me was when he was in high school, he kind of felt that there was more to life than high school so he dropped out.  And he spent a year working in the fields and he realized that, "There's a lot more to getting an education than I thought."  He proceeded to get back in high school and made the honor roll and everything, and graduated from high school and then went off to the Korean War.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was an MP [military police] stationed in Seoul.
Speaker 1: Okay, Seoul, Korea [Seoul, South Korea].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long did he stay in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure how long.  I think he just stayed in there 'cause he got drafted, so it may have been, what, just perhaps two years.  And then I know when he got out--
Speaker 1: This is in the early '50s [1950s], I guess right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Then he got out, went to St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have relatives in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: I don't think he had relatives in St. Louis.  I know that when he went to St. Louis he stayed with a gentleman, his family Ray War- Warwick, that's W-A-R-W-I-C-K.  And so he stayed with--stayed with his family and Ray [Ray Warwick (ph.)] and my dad are best friends to this day.
Speaker 1: So this is the person your middle name comes from?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Renard, from Renard.  That was his full name?
Speaker 2: You know, I never knew his full name, I just always knew him as Ray.  But that's--that's what I was told.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so, now where did your father work in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: He worked as a laborer.  And so he worked as a janitor.  He had his own asphalt paving business.  My father is an entrepreneur to his heart.  He eventually as a result of working in the [U.S.] military got a job with the federal government.  But one of the things about my father, he always believed in having another job on the side.  So he got involved in real estate and owned a number of properties around the St. Louis area, construction--I'm sorry, apartment buildings and even, I think, an office building at one time.  So he was entrepreneur of the family and I remember, I think, for his seventieth birthday, my cousins and all were talking about him and the--one cousin after the other as they got up and talked about what they learned from my father, they all learned to become entrepreneurs.  You know, you always needed to have that second job on the side because you just couldn't depend on basically Corporate America to keep food on the plate.  So, he was--my father's oldest brother passed away when my father was a teenager, so he ended up being the--he was both the youngest--youngest child and the only son.  And so, I think kind of because of that, he has very much of a laid back type of attitude.  Very laid back, but at the same time very focused.  So from, as I like to say from my father, I got the ability to be focused while under stress and try not to let the stress show, which is very beneficial when you're doing long distance running.  And from my mother [Jeannette Coleman], I got the, the, the determination to just really stick with something and just kind of not let go of it.
Story_ID: 648347
Speaker 1: When you think about, I mean, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would say it's an even split.  'Cause, like I said, my mother [Jeannette Coleman] was very educationally oriented--my--and while neither of them were actually involved in sports, the--the things that I got from them was sticking with it, staying with things for the long run, maintaining my--my--really just being cool while under pressure was something that I got from both of them.  They're both very focused people, very business oriented.  And I think that's where again I got pursuing degrees in--in business and in math.  My father's [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] very quantitative.  So he's very good with numbers even though he didn't get a college degree.
Speaker 1: Is there a story that you remember about how either one of them was in a stressful situation and was cool?
Speaker 2: Oh yes (laughter).  When my mother worked for the board of education for St. Louis [St. Louis Board of Education], and this was back again in the early '60s [1960s].  And I can remember her coming home talking about the stress of being, you know, the only black woman in the office and how blacks were protesting outside of the board of education for basically being able to get an equal education.  And she was saying that yeah the white women in the office were afraid to go outside, you know, to go to their cars or to catch the bus.  So she said it was like all of a sudden she became their friend and they would all be sitting in the office waiting for her business day to end and then when she would decide to go to leave is when everyone else in the office would decide to go to leave.  So that was kind of interesting.  Another time I can remember when she explained to us about racial discrimination.  When we went down to Mississippi for my great-grandfather's [James Smith] funeral, and so we're down to Port Gibson, Mississippi and because we rushed to go down there we didn't get a chance to wash our clothes, and this was back in around 1963 so I was about eight years old.  And we went to the laundromat down there and there was a wall that was dividing the laundromat in half.  And so my mother goes into one half and she starts putting the clothes in the washing machine.  I remember saying, "Mommy stop, you're doing it all wrong."  I said, "The colored clothes go on this side of the laundromat and the white clothes go on the other side of the laundromat."  Because they had whites and colored written over the two different halves.  And I remember she sat down and she explained to me that day about racial discrimination and about segregation.  And it was just one of those things I never forgot.  So it was somewhat of an eye opening moment.  With my father, my father talked about working in the government and how despite, you know, his intelligence and his ability to pass a different test, that he was being withheld from promotions and from--from managing people.  But, you know, one of the things I got from him was being analytical, being able to think through things and lay out plans and be able to execute those plans.  Now the other thing I got from him, was not being dependent on Corporate America--was that you had to have your own job, you had to have your own business; and that was one of the major things that I got from him.
Story_ID: 648348
Speaker 1: You just want to go back and maybe tell a story about your grandfather, Prince Coleman, and the motorcycle club that came to his funeral?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was my uncle Prince [Reed's maternal uncle, Prince Coleman, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Your uncle Prince, Uncle Prince.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He was--he was quite a character.  I remember when my wife [Deborah Valrie Reed] and I went down to meet him in Port Gibson, Mississippi and she had never met him and she was real nervous about it.  And I said, "Uncle Prince is the coolest person you'll ever meet."  So bear in mind he was in his sixties at that time and we met him at this little, I want to call it a little shack right outside of Alcorn, Miss- of Alcorn University [Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  And Uncle Prince gets out of the truck, he smiles and he has two gold teeth in the front of his mouth with his initials carved in the teeth, carved in the gold.  And he was--he would be telling us these stories about his motorcycle racing and I remember when I used to talk to Uncle Prince as he got older, he goes, "Tony [HistoryMaker Anthony Reed]," he says, you know, "I don't want you ever to forget your great uncle Prince."  When he passed away outside of Port Gibson, Mississippi, because he was a motorcycle racer and he helped founded the black motorcycle club in Dayton, Ohio, black motorcyclists from different parts of the country, you know, rode their motorcycles for days to come down to his funeral.  And it was a major procession I guess you can say of motorcycles at his funeral.  It--it was amazing.  But he was--like I said, he was, motorcycle racer, like I remember going to his house and there were--he had trophies as tall as I was.  And that--that thrill factor I guess you could say is one of the things that got me motivated to get into bicycle racing.  Not motorcycle racing, but bicycle racing.  And also just the adventure of going out, experiencing new things, not doing the things that people would typically expect blacks to do.  It was, you go out, you do your own thing.  You really don't care what other people are doing, but you know, have that spirit of adventure, of daring.  You know, kind of live a little bit on the edge.  And so that's one of the major things that I got from my uncle Prince.
Story_ID: 648349
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Jeannette Coleman and Curtiss Reed, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: They never really talked about how they met.  They divorced when I was about eight or nine years old.  So they've--I guess you could say when I got old enough to start asking those questions, neither of them really wanted to talk about it.  And even though they--they separated and divorced, my father was still actively involved in my life.  I'm happy to say that I would never ever classify him as what some people call a dead beat dad.  I mean he provided all the support payments, you know, we were with him every other weekend.  So they were both really active in my life while I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's one of the things that I got from him was, you know, truly being responsible and living up to your obligations.
Story_ID: 648350
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have, well with--from my bro- from my mother [Jeannette Coleman] I have one brother, Curtiss [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] who's a year older than I am.  And from my father [Curtiss Reed, Sr.], after he remarried, I have a sister Tracy [Tracy Reed].  And Tracy is a podiatrist in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your brother, Curtiss, spelled the same way as the other Curtiss, two S's?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He has a very adventuresome spirit also.  In 1978, he rode his bicycle from St. Louis, Missouri all the way up to Vancouver, Canada by himself.
Story_ID: 648351
Speaker 1: How old was he, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: In '78 [1978], he would've been twenty-four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long is that trip?
Speaker 2: That was a twelve hundred mile bicycle ride.  So he just took off that summer and decided that he wanted to go to Vancouver, Canada.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did he--okay, well I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So he rode his bicycle and stayed at different places along the way, met a lot of interesting people.  He called me when he got to Vancouver and he said, "Tony [HistoryMaker Anthony Reed], I ran out of money." (Laughter) So I ended up wiring him money so he could make his way back to St. Louis [Missouri].  I met him in Denver [Colorado] and we spent a couple of days together, then he went to St. Louis and I drove on--drove on down to Texas.  A few years later, Curtiss [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] joined the Peace Corps.  And he stayed in Tunisia for about eighteen months where he learned to speak Arabic.  Then he got out of the Peace Corps and he started getting contracts with different governmental agencies that were doing work in Africa.  And so he spent a total of eighteen years in Africa.  During that time he learned to speak, of course, Arabic, French and Portuguese, all fluently.  He lived in Tunisia, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Burundi and the last country he lived in was Mali.  And he was trapped in Burundi when they had their major problems there like they had over in Rwanda.  So he was trapped over there while all the killings were going on and the slaughtering.  We didn't hear from him for about two weeks.
Speaker 1: You know like it's depicted in the movie 'Hotel Rwanda' with the Tutsis and the Hutus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the, yes, yes, so that was the same thing that happened in Burundi and he was trapped in the country at the time.  And so that was somewhat nerve racking.
Speaker 1: Now was that in the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s] or?
Speaker 2: That was in the '80s [sic. 1990s].  I remember that was, that happened on a Thursday.  Because I was working at the Superconducting Super Collider [Texas] at that time and [U.S.] Congress was voting whether or not to continue funding the super collider.  But they had their vote that Thursday night which is when the little news clip came on about what had happened in Burundi.  And I remember when that happened, all of a sudden me losing my job as a result of Congress voting to kill the project was a little blip.  You know, I was focused more on trying to figure out what was going on with my brother over in Burundi.  So it kind of put everything in perspective.
Speaker 1: He's--what did your brother end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: He was teaching American business techniques to people in African nations.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was his job.  His job, actually, after the Peace Corps he--
Speaker 2: He continued doing that--
Speaker 1: --was a consultant to businesses doing business in Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So working with them on building wells, constructing wells and just doing as much as he could to help them from an economic perspective.  For example in cutting the middle man out, teaching them how to go about running businesses there.
Speaker 1: Did he get interested in Africa in school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the things my mother [Jeannette Coleman] got my brother and I interested in was stamp collecting.  So it was--it was kind of interesting to have two kids in the inner city collecting stamps from all around the world.  And back then you can go into a five or dime store, you can buy a bag of what three hundred or four hundred stamps for fifteen or twenty cents.  Now these were used stamps and we would spend, you know, the weekends looking these stamps from these different foreign countries, putting them in our stamp albums.  And to be doing that at, you know, eight, nine and ten years old, you start looking at these stamps, you start realizing that there was more to the world then living in the St. Louis inner city.  And so that really perked our interest for international travel.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now where did your brother go to school?
Speaker 2: We went to the same elementary schools.  We started at Madison Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri], and because we didn't own a home, we were moving just about every two years.  So we went to Madison Elementary School, we went from there to Ashland [Ashland Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], spent a couple years at Ashland, then went to Clark Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri] where we spent a couple of years.  Then from Clark we went to Enright Middle School [St. Louis, Missouri], and then my brother went to Country Day School in St. Louis [St. Louis Country Day School; Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, St. Louis, Missouri], which is a private school, and I went to John Burroughs School [Ladue, Missouri], which was again a private school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Well I just wondered--I wondered where he went to college actually (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Okay, college he went to Washington University in St. Louis [St. Louis, Missouri] where he graduated.
Story_ID: 648352
Speaker 1: Let me just ask, so, it's just the, growing up it would be you and your, your brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with your mother [Jeannette Coleman]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --primarily?  I mean your sister [Tracy Reed] was with your father [Curtiss Reed, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's by his second marriage.
Speaker 1: So a small household growing up I guess, then?
Speaker 2: Yes, a small household growing up.  I'd like to say we were one paycheck away from being kicked out.  'Cause again my mother was working as a secretary, so she was, you know, working as a secretary during the day.  She had an evening job teaching secretarial skills at the community college [St. Louis Community College].  She would also be doing income taxes during tax season.  So she was constantly working to try to support us.  And then when my brother and I got into high school, we were both constantly working.  So, going to school then working every day after school and working as a waiter on the weekends.  So it was--we definitely stayed out of trouble.
Story_ID: 648353
Speaker 1: Okay so it was a lot of moving too involved.  And one question we always ask and just considering all the places you moved in St. Louis [Missouri], just kind of tell us about some of the neighborhoods, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My first recollection of where we lived was when we lived in the Blumeyer projects in St. Louis [Arthur Blumeyer Village].
Speaker 1: That's Blue--
Speaker 2: Blumeyer.
Speaker 1: M-I-R-E?
Speaker 2: I believe it's M-Y--
Speaker 1: M-Y-E-R?
Speaker 2: --I believe it's M-Y-R-E [sic.].
Speaker 1: M-Y-R-E.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So there were two major housing projects in St. Louis, there was Pruitt Igoe and there were the Blumeyer projects.  And I can remember we had concrete floors in the projects, I think they were about twelve to fifteen stories tall.  I can remember there being fires in the trash chutes.  I can remember smelling urine in the elevator having to go up to our apartment.  It was--it was rough.  Then we moved from there to north St. Louis where we lived in a duplex, and I can remember walking to school, which was kind of interesting 'cause a lot of kids today don't walk to school.  And it would be snowing outside and they still had school.  I can remember at Ashland [Ashland Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] when it would be heavy snowfall, we'd still go outside to play and I can remember us building forts and having snowball fights between the forts in the schoolyard.  When I returned to St. Louis to run a marathon, unbeknownst to me, the course literally ran by places in St. Louis I used to live.  And I remember running by the area where the Blumeyer projects used to be at that time, and they had since torn them down and built low rise government housing there.  And I remember running by there and there were some black kids that were sitting on the curb.  And they got up and they started running along with me.  And I got real emotional 'cause I was thinking, oh my goodness, am I being an example to these kids, kind of being a role model to them, and they're sitting up there thinking, wow, you know, if this black guy can run this marathon, maybe we can run it too.  And that actually planted the seed for us organizing the National Black Marathoners' Association, was if we can be out there en masse, we can be role models for black kids to get out of their communities and to start seeing the rest of the world and realize that there was more to life than just, you know, the half square mile that they were growing up in.  So for me that was really emotional.  Other parts of St. Louis we lived in, it was--it was pleasant being there, and I guess one of the things that I say about growing up not--not having a lot is you never realize how much you don't have.  'Cause everyone around you has the same thing, everyone is experiencing the same things, but it wasn't until I went to high school, went to John Burroughs [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri] that I realized how much more was out there and got an opportunity to see how very wealthy white people lived and how--
Speaker 1: Well, before we get there, I just want to have you just describe like, you know, some more about where you grew up?
Speaker 2: Okay, because we were moving every couple of years, it was really hard to establish friends with people in the neighborhood.  It's--I can almost compare it to some people who--who are in the [U.S.] military.  You really don't want to get to know people very well because they may be dead.  So it was the same thing as we would move into a neighborhood.  We really didn't get to know a lot of people that were living around us.
Story_ID: 648354
Speaker 1: You and your brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] basically, you know, you were ba- basically best friends growing up and?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were basically best friends growing up.  We were the, the only real other people we had to associate with.  But even though we grew up in the same household, it was kind of interesting, there was people who knew us in college who never knew we were brothers.  Because we have two separate personalities, but yet we both had the same goals and objectives in life.  I don't know if it's best to say I would be more outgoing in some areas, whereas my brother would be more laid back.  But he's--we both believe in supporting and doing things in the community.  We both have a very adventuresome spirit, again as a result of collecting stamps.  It really did indeed made us curious about what was going on in the rest of the world.  I'd like to say I was, what I would call, a drive by tourist.  You know, I would go, I would be in the country for a short period of time and leave, and he was the person that would come and stay there for months or years and really get into the whole culture and the whole environment of that particular country in the region that he lived in.  We both have, I think he--he has a knack for picking up foreign languages extremely fast and I have a knack for picking up computer languages extremely fast.  So, like I said he could speak Portuguese and French and Arabic, and I could speak COBOL [Common Business Oriented Language], FORTRAN [Formula Translation] and other programming languages.  So right now he lives up in Vermont.  And I jokingly tell him, I say you went from the darkest continent to the whitest state (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah I was going to say he had maybe like a couple other black people there.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  So, when he--he said he wanted to live some place where he couldn't see his neighbors.  So when he came back from Africa, he bought about thirty-nine acres and built a house on it; and he literally could not see his neighbors.
Story_ID: 648355
Speaker 1: Well let, let me go back to growing up now.  Now you started off at Madison Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--was it kindergarten, or?
Speaker 2: Yes, started off there in kindergarten and first grade.  Then--and that's when we lived in the projects [Arthur Blumeyer Village, St. Louis, Missouri].  And then from there--
Speaker 1: Were there any good memories from Madison?  I mean any teachers that took a special interest in you or?
Speaker 2: Not really, not--not that I can recall.
Speaker 1: This is an era, we've interviewed a lot of older people who were around when the projects were first built.  And people there are surprised that they were clean and well maintained.  And you're describing the projects as most people think of them now as being in pretty bad shape, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were--well it's like--it's one of those things where you don't realize how bad it was until you go someplace else.  You know, it's like that was your level of things being normal.  So you just kind of accepted it and just kind of--you just went with it.  So like--so--
Speaker 1: This school was in the projects, it was in the neighborhood school for--that served the projects (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was in that neighborhood.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so you were there through first grade?
Speaker 2: Right.  Through first grade, then they moved and that's when I went to Clark School [Clark Elementary School] which was in north St. Louis [Missouri], and again that was a predominantly black school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you were there from second grade to?
Speaker 2: From second, right, second and third grade, part of the third grade because that's when my parents [Jeannette Coleman and Curtiss Reed, Sr.] separated and divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they split at that time.  And then you--did you move to another school afterwards?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Then we went to Clark School.
Speaker 1: Well that was Clark when they split up right?
Speaker 2: No, they split up at Ashland [Ashland Elementary School, St Louis, Missouri], I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Ashland, okay, I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Ashland.  Then you went to Clark, right?
Speaker 2: Right, then I went to Clark School.
Speaker 1: So did you actually move, your family moved?
Speaker 2: Yes, we--we moved then, again moved into some apartments that were near the school.  And at that time, there were three schools.  There was Clark School, across the street from Clark was Enright Middle School [St. Louis, Missouri], and then across the street from both of them was Soldan High School [Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri], which is where my mother worked.  And so you usually had students going from Clark to Enright to Soldan.  So, during that time period I said I went to Clark School for the--part of the third grade, the fourth and the fifth grades.  Then went to Enright for the seventh and eighth grades.
Speaker 1: Okay, seventh and eighth.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 648356
Speaker 1: Through all this, be- before you get to high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri], are there any significant teachers or experiences in school that you can tell us about?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Since my mother [Jeannette Coleman] worked at Soldan High School [Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri] and every day after school my brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] and I would go over there until she finished work, we had a lot of interaction, for example with the high school teachers.  And they inspired and encouraged my brother and I to get good grades in school and to go to--to go on to college.  In middle school [Enright Middle School, St. Louis, Missouri], I had what they called a block teacher and his name was Mr. Spain [Herbert Spain (ph.)].  And he really encouraged us to think outside of the box.  So for example, our--our block class actually had the first school's newspaper.  So we wrote the school newspaper coming out of his English class.  That helped inspire me later on in life to write articles for different publications and magazines.  While we were at the middle school, there was a couple--married couple that would come to--come to the different classrooms, and they would talk about their adventures from traveling around the world.  So they kind of hitchhiked across the U.S., caught a freighter that sailed to Japan, and they literally made their way around the world.  And that was the first time I remembered meeting someone who had traveled, you know, around the world.
Speaker 1: Now, I met the same couple when I was in grade school. They came to our school to talk to us.  And they had a slide show and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --yeah, I think they had one of those silver trailers that they took and drove it down to South America and other places, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think it's the same--I don't know who they are, but I've seen them on--there was a travel TV show. They were on that one too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They came to our school and talked.
Speaker 2: And so but between them and collecting stamps, it--it just truly whet, you know, my appetite for international travel.  And at that same time, we had an Aunt Ressie [Ressie Reed] who lived in California who would, you know, go on cruise ships and she would travel to different places around the world.  So she was my father's [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] sister.  So she would be sending us stamps and things from around the world.  So those were the things, I guess you can say in middle school that had the really big impact on the directions, I know that I took and my brother also ultimately ended up taking, that's international travel.  I was also impressed by the fact that they came back to the schools to talk about their experiences.  So that was one of the things that I'd like to do.  So I go around and talk to elementary school students to get them inspired to, again, go beyond the neighborhoods that they were growing up in and see the rest of the world.
Story_ID: 648357
Speaker 1: Now I know later on you--I think you were a math major in college and you became an accountant, but what, what was your favorite subject in school, in, in grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh.  I'd have to say my favorite subject in grade school was math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was because in elementary school in Madison [Madison Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] and Ashland [Ashland Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], I had a major stuttering problem.  And I remember having to go to speech and they would pull me out of class and take me to the speech class.  And because I had problems with verbal communication, I tended to lean towards things that required very little talking, but needed to be able to show your work.  And so for that reason I gravitated more towards math and numbers and shied away from verbal and written communications.  So that's one of the reasons I ended up in math and subsequently getting a master's in accounting and passing the CPA [certified public accountant] exam.
Speaker 1: Are there any teachers though, I know you mentioned the one--
Speaker 2: Right, Mr. Herbert E. Spain [ph.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Herbert Spain.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anybody else along the way or were your brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.]--you and brother involved in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] or anything like that or?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were involved in the Boy Scouts, but on the bigger picture, one of the things we were involved in was going to camp.  Every year from the time we were in the third grade all the way up through high school, we were involved in United Way camps.  So we started off at Camp Wyman which is in Eureka, Missouri.  Where, back then you could go to summer camp for two weeks, and because it was subsidized, you only paid about fifteen dollars for two weeks, out in the woods, out in cabins and in tents, which was a great bargain.  But that also gave us the opportunity again to see other kids.  And one of the things I learned from that is, situations are--are always relative.  Even though we may have lived in the projects [Arthur Blumeyer Village, St. Louis, Missouri] and we may have lived in apartments, we were around kids that were living at orphanages.  So to hear their stories, we realized our situation wasn't all that bad.  Our parents [Jeannette Coleman and Curtiss Reed, Sr.] were divorced, but at least we knew who our parents were, and we knew that both of them cared about us.  We outgrew Camp Wyman and then we went to Camp Sherwood Forest, which was outside of Troy, Missouri.  And there, we went through their leadership training program and we both became camp counselors.  So again, we were put in positions where we were working with inner city kids trying to inspire and motivate them again to move outside their comfort zones and to explore the rest of the world.  That also, is I believe the thing that led me to again, to distance running.  'Cause you're used to being outside, not being cooped up in a building, but just really out there and enjoying the scenery and enjoying nature.
Speaker 1: Let me just go back and get some dates here.  Now you start school, you were born in '55 [1955] right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You start school around 1960, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1960 for kindergarten.  And by, I guess, 1968, well you're, you're in high school then, but okay so you finished '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: No '68 [1968] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, kindergarten--no, '68 [1968] you're thirteen, you're only--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '68 [1968] is when I started high school [at John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Started--yeah, thirteen, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 648358
Speaker 1: Thirteen years old, 1968, and you go on a senior high school trip to Washington, D.C.; but you go as an eighth grader and your mother [Jeannette Coleman] is the principal's secretary, right that's how it is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yes, so, yes.  Since the three schools were located right next to each other, Clark School [Clark Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], Enright Middle [Enright Middle School, St. Louis, Missouri], and Soldan High School [Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri].  So my mother was the principal's secretary at Soldan High School.  But every day for almost four years, my brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] and I when we would leave elementary school and middle school, we would go over to my mother's office.  So we got to know the different teachers there at Soldan High School and of course, the principal [John Nelson] at Soldan High School.  So when the graduating class of 1968 at Soldan High School was getting ready to take their senior trip, my mother volunteered to be a chaperone on the trip and take my brother and I along with her.  So, we ended up going with them when they went to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Now your mother was a genius, this is a wonderful thing to do for your sons at that age.
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: It was a great thing to do, I just have to say that, you know, it seemed like she's really on point with this.  So, but, tell us, this is a great story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that Thursday night before we left we were in downtown St. Louis [Missouri] buying some last--last minute items for the trip.  And I remember we were in a department store, they had, of course they were selling televisions, we walked by and they cut in on the news and they said Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] has been assassinated.  And the next day, we boarded the buses to go to Washington, D.C. 'cause that was where the first leg of the trip stopped.  And I remember we pulled into Washington, D.C. and we had to go straight to the hotel.  Washington, D.C. was under lockdown as I like to call it.  I believe they said that was only the--that was the first time since the Civil War that the troops were in Washington, D.C.  And we got to see the troops driving all around.  They had a curfew so we couldn't go out at night to do anything.  When we went to the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.], 'cause we had the tickets and everything to get into the Capitol, our state representative was Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] and we went there and they refused to let us in the Capitol, even though we had all the proper documentation and everything.  But they were letting the white groups in.  So we ended up spending--spending our time going in and out of different museums there at the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.].  And, well one when we got there we didn't know whether or not they would even let us in.  But we weren't able to get into the Capitol or any of the buildings where they had the elected officials.  So, that was somewhat of an eye opening experience being there at that time.  And there were riots of things--and things going on at the same time.
Speaker 1: How did you feel?  I mean, you know, did your family have an affinity for Dr. King and what he was doing?
Speaker 2: We supported Dr. King and what he was doing.  And it was just sad that we weren't even able to get into to see the different places in Washington, D.C.  But like I said, it's one of those things that left an impression on me and it's great to see now that we have a black president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] in Washington, D.C. and surprisingly, I still have not had the opportunity to go to the places that we weren't able to go to back in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Now did you see the I Have a Dream speech on television, the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?  You would've been much younger?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, yes.  My--my mother was constantly following civil rights and so we were following and all of the things that were going on at that time.  And even today, I still like to follow and learn more about the things that were going on during the civil rights era.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you were all in D.C. there were riots in D.C., right?  In the Southeast D.C. [Southeast, Washington, D.C.] and in other portions of D.C. (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there were the riots in D.C.  And the hotel that we were staying in fortunately was not in that area.  But even then, they had a curfew.  So we had to make sure we had dinner and everything, and once we went to our hotel we couldn't leave there at night.
Speaker 1: Was there a curfew on everybody in D.C. or a curfew on black people in D.C. (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I don't know about everyone else, but I know there was a curfew on us.
Story_ID: 648359
Speaker 1: Now you were, you were talking earlier about segregation in St. Louis [Missouri] in the laundromat, colored and white side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was--yeah, that was when we went down to Mississippi --
Speaker 1: Oh, that's in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: --for my [maternal] great-grandfather's [James Smith] funeral.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's was in St. Louis but in, in--
Speaker 2: Right, so, right, so that was around 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did you go down south a lot when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes we did.  We would go down there about once every couple of years, 'cause my great-grandmother [Emma Smith] was still down there.  And so we would, you know, go down there and stay with her.  And I have fond memories of, of being down there and being around a lot of my relatives.
Story_ID: 648360
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, did you like to run?
Speaker 2: Well when I was growing up, like I--my objective from elementary school through high school was to be a professional bowler.  However, the high school I went to [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri]--
Speaker 1: Now bowling, now wait a minute, bowling is one of the least, you know, I guess it doesn't seem to be the most taxing of exercises, so.
Speaker 2: That's true, but St. Louis [Missouri] at that time was the bowling capital of the U.S.  I mean they have the national bowlers hall of fame [International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame] there.  It was also the baseball capital, again 'cause we had the St. Louis Cardinals, and of course St. Louis is known for Budweiser beer.  And Budweiser [Anheuser-Busch Companies] was supporting a lot of the professional bowling teams back then.  So I got heavily involved in bowling.  In fact, one of my first jobs was being a score keeper at a professional bowling tournament, which was, having a math background that was a good thing 'cause you couldn't afford to make a mistake.  But I invo- I got involved in bowling.  I can remember learning how to bowl at a place called Ringside bowling alley [Ringside Bowling Lanes, St. Louis, Missouri].  And my instructor was a black gentleman whose name was Mr. Chisum [ph.].  And one of the unusual things was is that I'm left handed.  And your better bowlers are actually left handed.  And a lot of people don't realize that, but people such as Dick Weber, Earl Anthony, they were all left handed.  When people bowl, since most people are right handed, of course their ball goes down the right side of the bowling alley, and it actually kind of warps the wood and the wood is a little bit worn away so it's hard to get a true curve or hook.  Whereas the left hand side of the lane, a lot of people don't use it, and left handers are able to take advantage of that and we actually have more control over our balls.  So that's bringing out the bowler in me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Now the--the high school I went to, like you said bowling isn't a sport that takes a lot of effort and energy; and I was actually overweight as a kid growing up.  But the high school I went to it was a big (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 648361
Speaker 1: This is important I think, a lot of people growing up in inner cities, if you don't have a lot of friends in the neighborhood, sometimes it's wise not to go out that much?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that the case in, case of you and your brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the case with my brother and I, so--
Speaker 1: 'Cause, did you have like gangs in the projects [Arthur Blumeyer Village, St. Louis, Missouri] and some of the neighborhoods in north St. Louis [Missouri] where you?
Speaker 2: There were in the projects.  My mother [Jeannette Coleman] did a really good job, I guess you can say, of keeping my brother and I somewhat sheltered.  So it was, you know, school, straight to home, straight home.  We didn't get out to play with a lot of kids in the neighborhood.  And again, when we went to Ashland [Ashland Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] and, sorry, when we went to Clark [Clark Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] and Enright [Enright Middle School, St. Louis, Missouri], it was the same thing.  Right after school was out, she knew we walked across the street, you know, went straight, you know, went straight into her school [Soldan High School; Soldan International Studies High School, St. Louis, Missouri] where we stayed.  So we didn't get a lot of interaction with other kids, other than we were actually there at the schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I take it you did your homework and got good grades?
Speaker 2: Yes, did the homework, got the good grades.  Got bullied as a result of that.  'Cause like I said, I wasn't--I didn't have an athletic type of build.  I didn't have my growth spurt until my sophomore year in high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay so you're an overweight kid, you stutter, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: You knew a lot about the world, but didn't get out in the neighborhood that much necessarily?
Speaker 2: Right.  I knew what was out there and knew that I didn't want to be there.  So it was safe for me to, you know, go home and get my work done and just focus on that.
Speaker 1: Now did you utilize television to take you other places?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Loved looking at television, but first I had to get the schoolwork done.  And since we didn't have cable and everything was just black and white, it really wasn't all that enticing like it is today.  But the other thing we ended up doing was spending a lot of time in libraries, and spending a lot of time reading.  So, reading took me to other parts of the country, other parts of the--into other parts of the world.  So I guess you could say I was living vicariously through the books that I was reading.

Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about music.  The relationship to music growing up was--or church, to tell the truth, I don't know, are either one of those things important?
Speaker 2: Music is definitely important.  I played the violin for a while, while I was in the, gosh, fourth and fifth grades [at Clark Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri].  Then when I went to middle school [Enright Middle School, St. Louis, Missouri], I realized you can't carry a violin in the band.  So I ended up taking up--playing the clarinet.  When, so, and I--I enjoyed playing it.  When I went to co- when I went to high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri], I had to stop playing all instruments because I couldn't afford to buy them.  And in the public schools, you know, you were using the equipment that was furnished.  But I--I loved music.  So, when we--when I was about eight, a cousin came to live with us.  One of my father's [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] nieces came to live with us and her name was Betty Jean [ph.].  So she came to live with us and she was going to high school there in St. Louis [Missouri].  And Betty loved music.  And so since my brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] and I were the only two people around, she used to try to teach us how to dance, how to do the bop and everything else.  So I really got into truly enjoying music ever since then.  And in fact, when I run, I pick a song that will keep me motivated through--through the marathons.  I don't listen to music, you know, I don't use ear plugs or anything like that, so I just have to keep the song in my head.  One of my favorite is 'Ain't No Stopping Us Now' ['Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now'] by McFadden and Whitehead.  When I would be preparing for exams or you know, getting ready for a marathon, that's one of the songs that always come to mind.  'We're a Winner' by Curtis Mayfield is another one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And The Impressions, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So those--music is a thing that really motivates me.  In the book that I wrote, 'Running Shoes are Cheaper than Insulin' ['Running Shoes are Cheaper than Insulin: Marathon Adventures on All Seven Continents,' Anthony Reed] I talk about how I assign a song to the different marathons.  And sometimes it doesn't occur until the start of the marathon.  For the Hartford Marathon, for example, it was pouring down rain and the song I kept singing to myself was 'Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop' ['Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)'] by Parliament-Funkadelic 'cause he has lyrics and it's where he talks about dancing underwater without getting wet.  And I visualized myself in this downpour and the raindrops are just parting while I'm running this twenty-six miles and I'm staying perfectly dry while everyone else around me is just drenched.  I'm a huge fan--I'm a huge fan of George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic.  So it has really keep me--kept me moving all these years.
Story_ID: 648363
Speaker 1: What about church now, was church a part of, big part of growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yes, we would go to church every Sunday.  I went to West Side Baptist Church [West Side Missionary Baptist Church] there in St. Louis [Missouri].  When I--and there I sang in the choir.  As I like to say, I--I moved my lips a lot in the choir (laughter).  I'm not sure if I'm a good singer.  But yeah, participated there and a lot of the youth activities, Sunday school.  Participated in the church bowling league, and had a lot of fun, it's, I truly enjoyed going to church.  Then when I moved here to Dallas [Texas], we went to St. Luke Community United Methodist Church and I remember we were trying to decide what church to go to, we went there and Reverend Zan Holmes [Zan Wesley Holmes, Jr.] was the pastor.  And he mentions going out for a run and as soon as he said that, I remember going, okay this is the church I want to go to.  'Cause it's not that often you find a black minister who runs.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So went there and now we go to Transforming Life Christian Fellowship church [Dallas, Texas] where my wife, Deborah [Deborah Valrie Reed], is one of the ministers there.  And so it's--it's great.  I truly enjoy going to church and also again trying to give back to the church by talking with the youth about, again my adventures around the world.
Story_ID: 648364
Speaker 1: Okay, now we'll go back to the--now you're in the eighth grade [at Enright Middle School, St. Louis, Missouri]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, now how did--how was the decision made to go to, what is it, the--
Speaker 2: John Burroughs School [Ladue, Missouri].
Speaker 1: John Burroughs, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, my brother is a year older than I am and he was able to pass the entrance exam and go to Country Day School [St. Louis Country Day School; Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, St. Louis, Missouri].  And at that time, a lot of the schools in the suburbs, especially the private schools were looking for black students that could come and help them integrate those schools.  So after my brother got accepted to go to Country Day, I took the exams to go to both Country Day and John Burroughs.  And I got into both of the schools; however, I got tired of being known as Curtiss' [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] little brother and I wanted to have my own identity.  So instead of going to Country Day, I went to John Burroughs.
Speaker 1: Now, now, kind of just--is John Burroughs in the City of St. Louis [Missouri] area?
Speaker 2: No, John Burroughs is in--is in a part of St. Louis County [Missouri] called Ladue [Missouri].  And Ladue is where you have people living in mansions, you know. They're--
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Ladue?
Speaker 2: L-A-D-U-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they got mansions and okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's when you turn sixteen you got a brand new car and--and I mean I was just totally blown away.  I hadn't seen anything like that in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did you stay on campus there or how was that done?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was commuting every day.  They--they didn't have dorms at Burroughs.  When you go there it's like you--it's almost like you're going to a college campus, except there were no dorms.  So I was having to catch the--catch the bus out there for about two years.  So catching the bus from the inner city, going all the way out to John Burroughs to go to school and then either getting a ride or catching a bus back to the community college [St. Louis Community College] where my mother [Jeannette Coleman] was taking classes in the evenings.  So when we got back to the community college, we would go to the study booths and my brother and I would do our homework there while my mother was taking her classes.  And we eventually moved out into a suburb there called Elmwood Park [Missouri] which was an unincorporated suburb in the county which was several miles from John Burroughs School.  And at that point I was riding my bicycle to and from school.  Now because Burroughs was a private school and I was there on scholarship, I also worked every day there after school cleaning up the art department in order to pay for my lunch money--in order to pay for lunches there.  And then on Fridays, Saturdays, and sometimes Sunday evenings, I was working at a place called McQuerry's Barbeque [ph.] in St. Louis as a waiter, waiter, busboy, dishwasher, kind of doing everything, except cooking.
Speaker 1: Now, John Burroughs, did they have a tracking system or was everybody going to college?
Speaker 2: Just about everyone there was going to college.  It was--it truly was a prep school.  It wasn't unusual, for example, for close to 25 to 30 percent of the graduating class to be National Merit finalists [National Merit Scholarship Program].  I jokingly said I graduated in the top 90 percent of my class.  It was very tough going there, 'cause every day I was there, I kind of felt like people were surprised that I had showed up that day.  There was a book called 'Why Are All the Blacks Sitting Together in the Cafeteria' ['Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria: And Other Conversations About Race,' Beverly Daniel Tatum] I could relate to that, to the stories that they were telling in there.  I felt that I couldn't fail going there because I would've felt like I would've been literally letting the black race down.  Out of six hundred students there at the school, there were about seven blacks and I did not want to be the one that they could point to and say, "Well he couldn't make it here, so he got kicked out."  I was the only black student there that was raised in the inner city, coming from a--a--living in a one parent family.  And my parents weren't doctors or attorneys or anything like that.  They did not let the second black kid with my type of background until I graduated.  And his name is Gerald [ph.].  And Gerald and I ended up pledging [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] together in college [Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri].  So, it--it was tough going there.  From a psychological perspective, I felt that I had to succeed.  I had to graduate.
Story_ID: 648365
Speaker 1: When you entered school were you still fat and were you still stuttering?
Speaker 2: By the time I got there I was overweight.  One of the things Burroughs [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri] did was, it was mandatory, that you participate in a sport two out of the three seasons.  And the season you didn't participate in a sport, you still had to take a PE [physical education] class.  So while I was there, I ran cross country for a couple of seasons.  I played soccer for four years while I was there and our soccer season was in the wintertime.  So you're playing there in the snow and ice and mud, and in the summer for two seasons I played baseball and then I realized I wasn't very good at hitting a slider, so I switched over and ran track.  I ended up losing a lot of weight in my freshman year and had a growth spurt between my freshman and sophomore years.  So as I like to say my height finally caught up with my weight and I became a lot more leaner.  That helped out a great deal because when I was eight, I was diagnosed with a prediabetic condition.  And the doctor said I would go on insulin by the time I was a teenager.  So at eight is when my sweet tooth basically was shut down.  I was told I couldn't have anything sweet and so I'd like to say when everyone else was developing their sweet tooth for apple pie and you know, sweet potatoes and everything else, those were things I had to avoid at that time.  But because I got into high school, got involved in sports and lost weight, I didn't have to go on insulin.  I graduated from high school, went into college [at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] and again it was mandatory that we take a PE course.  And one of the first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We don't want to get you to college yet, you're breathing too fast (unclear) pace, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I didn't have to take any insulin in high school.
Speaker 1: But at John Burroughs, who--so you ran track there and you played a little baseball you said.  And you started losing, losing weight. Was it, was it due to the running you think that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was a combination (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the growth spurt?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, due to getting actively involved in sports and due to the growth spurt.
Story_ID: 648366
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what about the speech impediment?  Now you were stuttering, now how, how did you overcome that?
Speaker 2: I overcome--overcame that about I'd say in the third or fourth grade [at Clark Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], where--
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's before (unclear) Burroughs [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, that was before Burroughs and I ended up kind of slowing down the way that I--the way that I talk and I literally think through everything or as much as I can before I actually say it.
Speaker 1: So you allowed me to think that you went to high school stuttering when it's not the case (laughter).  That's when I--'cause I just went over that a minute ago (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But all right, but we're okay.  So we're up to speed now.  You're in high school, you're running, losing weight.  Now in terms of your studies, were you concentrating on math, mathematics?
Speaker 2: I--I ended up leaning very heavily towards math because my--my writing skills were just horrible.  So ended up focusing on math, tried to get into the sciences.  Because of my stuttering, still, I always avoided really long words because I knew that if I have to say really long words I would stutter.  So when I got into--got into the sciences and they would have long names and chemicals and everything, I literally shied away from sciences because of the--the speech problem.  So I like to say being a stutterer, is like being--almost like being an alcoholic.  You know, you're always an alcoholic, you're just constantly in recovery and the same thing with the stuttering.  I still stutter every now and then, and I have to just kind of stop, catch my breath and at times try to find a shorter word that I can use versus using really long words.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's interesting.  I've, I've gone through the same thing (laughter), so I just wanted to--you're not by yourself.
Story_ID: 648367
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers at Burroughs [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri], now, I mean, or--well first of all how did the other students accept you?  There aren't that many black students first of all and the others are--have, you know, come out of this professional background, their parents are doctors and such, so how were you accepted by the students and like then who were the faculty members that took an interest you, if any, if?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The students didn't quite know how to take me because I didn't come from--we didn't have the same point of reference.  I can remember in our English classes they started incorporating black books in the English classes.  And I remember one of the books we had to read for example was 'Black Boy' by Richard Wat- by Richard Wright.  And if you could imagine, I kind of felt like they looked for me to be the expert on being black.  Another book we had to read was 'Go Tell it on the Mountain' [James Baldwin].  So I--I really felt like I was somewhat in a fish bowl at times.  I was the go-to expert about living in the hood, and I really didn't appreciate that.
Speaker 1: I can see where both of those books would be problematic for a teenage boy in a class with all white people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Those would really be.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's hard for me to read Richard Wright actually I get upset and I can't finish it.  And then to be surrounded by those who have no understanding of what he's talking about.
Speaker 2: Right.  So it was for me, it was tough--tough being there.  But at the same time, my focus was on trying to learn as much as I could while I was there, to take advantage of the opportunity of being there.  And to truly represent, I didn't want to be known as the one that they kicked out.  I didn't want to be known as the one that failed, because I truly felt if I did, I would've let down the students that graduated from Enright Middle [Enright Middle School, St. Louis, Missouri].  You know, as people would say, "Well the students that go there can't cut it, they can't make it."  And it was interesting for me to be that young and having to feel like I had that much weight on my shoulders.  Like I said, I've--it was one of those things where until I read the book, 'Why Are All the Blacks Sitting Together in the Cafeteria' ['Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria: And Other Conversations About Race,' Beverly Daniel Tatum] that I said, "Well I wasn't the only one that was feeling that."  I associated more with the blacks in the other classes then I did with the whites in my own class, because with them, I could have some type of relationship.  When I got there, the whites thought, oh well because he's black he must play football, he must play basketball, so let's, you know, try to get him involved in those sports.  And I purposely chose sports that--that were nontraditional as far as, non-black types of sports such as cross country, such as playing soccer.  Back then the only soccer player I knew that was black was Pele.  And I did not know how to play soccer at the time I started there.  By the time I graduated, I was starting on the varsity team.
Speaker 1: What position did you play in soccer?
Speaker 2: In soccer, I played left wing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I'm left handed, I'm able to control the ball better with my left foot.  And ironically the only scol- the only goals I ever scored in soccer were against my brother's school. We were rivals.
Speaker 1: You scored against Country Day [St. Louis Country Day School; Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I scored against Country Day and we--my brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] and I both participated in track and field.  He ran the 100 and 220, I ran the quarter and the half.  So we never ran directly against each other; however, we competed against each other in the field events.  And he would kick my--he would kick my butt at long jump.  In fact he went to state in long jump.  So, it was somewhat interesting when we would both end up competing against each other.
Story_ID: 648368
Speaker 1: Tell us about Bernice [Bernice Curlett]?
Speaker 2: It's when I started at John Burroughs [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri].  Like I said, I had a--had a job working there every day after school cleaning up the--cleaning up the paint room.  And Bernice was a lady, a black lady there who worked on the janitorial staff.  And so she was the one that was responsible for assigning me my work and looking over the different things that I was doing.  And Bernice was what I would call a very strong--a very strong black woman.  She basically took me under her wing.  And I can remember my--my first year there at Burroughs.  Bernice would see me walking down the hall and she would say, "Tony [HistoryMaker Anthony Reed], look up, don't look down at the ground. Don't let these people see you looking down at the ground."  I mean she put her foot squarely up my rear end and was really pushing, she was saying, 'cause she knew black history and I knew black history, and it's like, you know, you're representing, you have to do good here.  You can't let them see you sweat, you can't let them see you fail.  And so Bernice was a person who drove me for four years while I was there.  And I think without her being there, I probably would not have graduated from the school.  When I left Burroughs she was the only reason that I would go back to the school, to check up on her and to see how she's doing.  So she for me was a major inspiration while I was there at Burroughs.
Speaker 1: Now that raises another question too, was there any instructor or administrator or any--any adult at Burroughs that took any interest in you succeeding or recognized talent in you or?
Speaker 2: No.  There were some teachers there that I liked, Mrs. Ferber [ph.], Mr. Schmertz [ph.], and ironically they were both English teachers.  I think I liked them because of--with them wanting to--to read books.  I think they read more books about African Americans and I think they were able to sympathize more with my plight then the other teachers.
Speaker 1: But there's no real relationship?
Speaker 2: Right, but there wasn't any real relationship.  In fact, at Burroughs they wrote a book about the athletes there at Burroughs, 'The Athletes Through the Decades' [sic. 'Teammates for Life: A History of Burroughs Athletics, 1923-2011,' Jim Lemen and Jud Calkins] and they talked about the different football teams that they had that, for example, won state in track and all of that.  And then they talked about famous athletes who had since graduated from Burroughs and went on to--to doing other great things.  And ironically when they wrote the book, they never wrote about my--my achievements as a distance runner.  And yet they were aware of me being the first black in the world to run marathons on all seven continents, being one of the few people in the world who has run over 100 marathons, who has won trophies for running marathons.  They never wrote anything about it.  So to me that said a lot about the school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it's not much of a relationship there so, I guess.  But, now did you make the National Honor Society yourself?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  It was just--it was a struggle for me to keep up there at the school.  I made the national accounting honor society [Beta Alpha Psi] as a graduate student [at the University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, Texas], but again that was years after I left Burroughs.
Speaker 1: Okay, at Burroughs, so at the time of graduation from Burroughs, you had played soccer, you ran some track, you were taking, you know, math courses.  What were you, what was your counseling?  What did the counselor tell you at Burroughs?
Speaker 2: Not much.  They were, I think they were pleasantly surprised that I was still there.  I was like--I was in the bottom 10 percent of my class.  And so they were just, I think shocked and surprised that I made it there for four years.  And like I said, the thing I learned there was just how to fight, just how to stick in there.  You know, when other kids were able to go out and you know, have fun, I was going to school full time, working two part time jobs and studying as much as I could in order to try to keep up.  I will kind of compare it to being in a 100 yard race and I have to start 125 yards back.  So it was just struggling to stay up and catch up.  All the students there graduated and went to college.  It was like as soon as you set your foot in the door in your freshman year, you know, in high school, everyone there goes to college, it's just a given.  So when I graduated from Burroughs, I got accepted to Washington University there in St. Louis [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  And I stayed there for two and a half years before I got kicked out.
Story_ID: 648369
Speaker 1: Now how did you min- wind up choosing Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis]; and were you, were you, were you introduced to it by a counselor, or did--of course you knew it was there 'cause it was in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew it was there.  My brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] ended up going to Washington University.  So he graduated from high school [St. Louis Country Day School; Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, St. Louis, Missouri] the year before I did and he went to Washington University.
Speaker 1: So he was already there?
Speaker 2: Right, he was already there.  My preference was to go to other colleges because I did not want to stay in St. Louis.  So I got accepted at other colleges; however, my mother [Jeannette Coleman] didn't want to sign the financial aid papers for me to go to those colleges, she wanted me to stay there in St. Louis.  So I ended up going to Washington University initially with a double major in math and engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--oh go ahead.
Speaker 1: Well, okay well--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: So, I transitioned from going to a school where there were six hundred white students and seven blacks, to a university where there were thousands of white students and a couple of hundred blacks.  And so for me it was interesting, the black students were talking about how few blacks there were, and I was sitting up here going, "There were over 100." (Laughter) So, so I was kind of in hog heaven.  And after going to Burroughs [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri] for four years and not having any kind of social life to go to Washington U where there were a few hundred blacks, I just went crazy.  It's like I spent two and a half years making up for the social life that I didn't have in high school.  And ended up being put on academic suspension at Washington University.
Speaker 1: Okay so, basically because of too much social life, that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you join any fraternities or anything there?
Speaker 2: I didn't join any fraternities there until I started back up at Webster University [St. Louis, Missouri] and that's when I pledged Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Okay well I'm not, let's see, so, so you got kicked out of Wash U for academic?
Speaker 2: Right, I was given an academic suspension.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just wasn't focused on the books.  There were a lot of different things that were going on in my life at the time.  Difficulties at home, looking at financial situation, just suddenly having the freedom to do all the things that I couldn't do while I was in high school.
Story_ID: 648370
Speaker 1: One thing that is mentioned in your outline here: in 1974, a friend of your passes away from diabetes kind of slowly.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, when I was--when I started at--started in high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri], and I was working at a barbeque restaurant and there was a gentleman named Bill [ph.] who was the cook.  And over the course of, like I said five or six year period, Bill lost his eye due to glaucoma.  Then he lost his toes and his leg, ultimately his life, due to complications associated with diabetes.  That had a major impact on me, because again, doctors said I would go on insulin by the time I was a teenager.  And I was aware that those were complications associated with diabetes.  When I graduated from high school because I had lost some weight, I had slimmed down, I was fortunate and I still did not have to go on insulin at that time.  And I remember every year from the time I was about eight years old, going in and taking what's called a glucose tolerance test, where they were checking to see okay, you know now, should we start giving this guy insulin or not.  At Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] in my freshman year, we had to read a book called 'Aerobics' by Dr. Kenneth Cooper.  And in that book there was one paragraph where they stated, diabetics who are dependent on insulin were either able to go completely off of insulin or decrease their insulin intake if they maintained a fitness program.  So as I reflected back over all the different things I was doing in high school, I made it a lifetime goal to average running three miles a day.  And I felt if I could just average running three miles a day, that I can possibly avoid taking any insulin.  Since I've been keeping my running journal as far back as around 1978, I have logged over thirty-six thousand miles and have actually averaged roughly three miles a day of running.  And that has taken me now to running 123 marathons and at fifty-seven I'm still not on insulin.  That ended up kind of leading into the title of my book called 'Running Shoes are Cheaper than Insulin' ['Running Shoes are Cheaper than Insulin: Marathon Adventures on All Seven Continents,' Anthony Reed].
Story_ID: 648371
Speaker 1: Now is the running--has the effect of running been, been--you know, on your diabetes, been verified by a doctor as being the cause of your not getting full blown diabetes?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And in fact, when I first moved to Dallas [Texas] I had a doctor who worked at a hospital here in Dallas.  And he would have interns come in and actually give me a physical.  And the interns after doing the physical and looking at all the results would say, "Well he says he's not on any medication and yet we are showing these results that says he--maybe he should be on insulin."  My doctor would then talk to them about how the impact of changing your lifestyle by being physically active, how that can have an impact on whether or not a person has to take any insulin at all.  So, he basically was saying sometimes it's better to prescribe running three miles a day then it is to take insulin.
Speaker 1: The problematic I see in that would be if--say, say you got sick and couldn't run or something happened and you couldn't run, would then you have--would you have to take insulin shots?
Speaker 2: Well in the book 'Aerobics,' he [Kenneth Cooper] talks about basically assigning points to different types of physical activities.  So for example, a person could earn the points by swimming, by cycling, playing tennis, it's all about basically burning calories and maintaining certain level of--of heart rate.  So it's just about getting out there and doing things.  Even something as simple as walking.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I think I understand that, but what I'm saying is, suppose something happened to you, you could not move for a while, a period of time, so you were bedridden for two weeks or something or had a bad bout of the flu.  I mean would diabetes become stronger, you know, and cause problems or complications.  Some people have the flu for a week--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and don't do any--can't get up and do anyth- or you've, say you--you know.
Speaker 2: Well, there, there have been times for example where for about one eighteen month period I was having one injury after the other and I ran extremely few miles.  And so what I did, I transitioned from running for example to bicycling and at one point even to swimming.  So as long as I'm physically active.  If--I can lay off for example, I think the longest perhaps I've gone without running or doing any physical activity may have been a month.  And I didn't have any problems with that.  At that point, I kind of started watching my diet, started watching my weight so that I wouldn't add any additional fat.  And so the whole premise is that the more fat that I have, the more places basically the sugar has to store.  And so by trying to remain as lean as possible, then I would not have to go on insulin.  At fifty-seven, my body fat puts me in an excellent category. It's around 12 percent.  And at the same time, I'm able to like I said go out and run eighteen to twenty miles without any problems at all.  So for me maintaining low body fat is something that has helped me throughout the years.  I've kept track of my medical records dating back to the early '80s [1980s], looking at changes for example in my blood--in my, my blood work, my glucose levels, my weight and everything; and trying to keep everything stabilized throughout all those years.

Speaker 1: Now be- before we get you to Webster [Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri], now did you do any competitive or organized running in, at Wash U [Washington University in St. Louis]?
Speaker 2: No.  In high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri] in track, I like to tell people I was the fifth man on a four man relay team.  So that meant I was faster than the average person, but I wasn't going to get a track scholarship any place.  But while I was at Washington U, I just continued to run.  So I continued to run three or four miles.  Washington University is right across the street from Forest Park in St. Louis [Missouri].  So it was very easy for me to wake up, 'cause I was living in the dorms after my sophomore--after my freshman year, so I'd wake up and go running there in Forest Park.  There was a brother there at Washington University named Bobby Simms who ran track, he ran the sprints in track, he played football but he was also a distance runner.  So he would just go running just for the sheer sake and enjoyment of it.  So I would go running with him and we would go running around Forest Park which was about a five or six mile loop.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, okay, so, so you were running you say about three, at least three miles a day?
Speaker 2: Right, at least three miles a day.
Speaker 1: Sort of maintained that all your life?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, well, Webster University.  Now you, you enter Webster University and you majored in math and--
Speaker 2: Math and business.
Speaker 1: --and business, okay.
Story_ID: 648373
Speaker 1: Now here's the question again, I keep asking this question, 'cause we always want to know who people's mentors are, if they have any mentors, or any, anybody helps along the way.  Now, there was nobody at Washington U [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] that was any--gave you any guidance or special attention?
Speaker 2: Not as far as instructors.  We had a very tight knit group of black students that were there.  And the one student that impressed me the most, his name was Greg Scott [ph.].  And Greg was one of these people that, I like to say he wore the Coke bottle glasses, you know they were pretty thick glasses.  He was a graduate student there in mathematics.  But Greg was also--he knew martial arts.  He was extremely good at track.  He was the quarterback on the intramural football team.  He broke the nerd--sorry, he broke the mold of what people would typically think of as a geek and a nerd.  He was extremely athletic while at the same time he was majoring in math.  And he became, basically my role model.  I said if he can do all these things, there's no reason in the world why I can't also excel at sports and doing other things as well as majoring in math.  So Greg Scott was a major influence while I was there at Washington University.
Speaker 1: Now did you have like a black student organization?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a black student organization there at Washington University and I was involved in that--
Speaker 1: Can you remember the name of it, and was this the organization of black students or was it just an ad hoc group of students that you bonded with?
Speaker 2: No this was an organized group of black students, so they were recognized (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I want to--I just want to make the distinction between the group that you bonded with and the organized group.  Was it the same, one and the same?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were one and the same.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: It was a group that was recognized by the university, but they were also again a group that we all basically hung together.  So--
Speaker 1: What was the name of that group?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of the name of it.
Speaker 1: Sometimes black student union, BSA, a different--
Speaker 2: Black student union [Association of Black Students] is the one that immediately came to mind (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I'm going to put it down here, we'll see, if somebody in the future says, "No, that was--," (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well I can find out and get back with you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you--was there a faculty advisor for your group?
Speaker 2: I--I don't remember at that time.  I said I was--I was doing a lot of partying.
Story_ID: 648374
Speaker 1: Webster State--Webster University [St. Louis, Missouri], now, what did you do in the interim between going to Webster--being released from Washington [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] and starting up at Webster?
Speaker 2: I was able to get my first job as a computer operator and then later started as a computer programmer.  At that time, there weren't a lot of colleges or universities that had degrees in computer science.  And while I was at John Burroughs high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri], I started writing computer programs.  So it was kind of strange being a--being in a high school in 1969, that had a computer terminal.  So I actually started writing programs in high school and continued writing programs while I was at Washington University.  So when I got kicked out of Washington University, I was able to eventually get a job as a computer programmer.
Speaker 1: And now this is the age of the cards, they were using the cards then?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were using (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Using FORTRAN [Formula Translation], COBOL [Common Business Oriented Language], and--
Speaker 2: Eighty column cards and I was writing programs then in basic, FORTRAN and COBOL.  And it was just--back then it was amazing being at the, kind of the beginning of the information technology age.  So when I started Webster and the reason I got back in college, was because I was working as a computer operator and I was watching paychecks print off.  And I was looking how much money people were making.  I said, "You know what, people that have a degree really do make a lot more money than people that don't have a degree."  So I immediately got back into school and I was working full time as a computer programmer, I was going to college full time in the evening, and I also had a part time job on the weekends.  So after I got my partying out at Washington University, I developed a sense of focus and became highly goal oriented.  And one of the--one of the rules I learned was it's one thing to have a goal, it's another thing to have a date for when you want to have that goal completed.  So with that, I gave myself a deadline that I wanted to get my undergraduate degree in 1978 and because I was financially dependent, I was the one that was having to support myself while going through Webster.  So I was working full time, going to school full time in the evenings.  I think one semester I managed to take twenty-one hours while still working full time.  And I was able to graduate from Webster.
Story_ID: 648375
Speaker 1: And I can remember the last meeting that I had with my counselor at Webster [Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri].  And I remember going into the--going into the room where we were having our discussion, and I told her I says, "Well, you know, I want to go to grad school."  And she looked at me and she says, "You're not grad school material."  One of the lessons I learned from Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] was you don't depend on anyone else to lay out your plan in life.  You know, you needed to know everything that was in the student catalog inside and out.  You needed to know the requirements that it took to graduate.  So when I went to Webster, I dove into the student catalog, learned what it took to graduate, took all the proper courses.  I also knew that to get into graduate school, some grad- you could go in based off your grade point average for all four years or your GPA [grade point average] over your junior and senior years, plus of course your GMAT [Graduate Management Admission Test] and GRE [Graduate Record Examination] scores.  So I focused on getting really good grades in my junior and senior year, and ended up with about almost an A- GPA as a grad- for my junior-senior courses.  And I've got full scholarships into SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas], TCU [Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas], and UT Arlington [University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas].  In fact, at TCU, I got into their Ph.D. program in math as an undergraduate and I had to write to tell them I didn't want to major in math, I wanted to get an M.B.A. in business.  So, when I had that talk with my college counselor and I explained to her, "I got into all these graduate programs, got teaching assistantships, and I think I am grad school material."  And she got up and walked out of the room.  And it made me realize, it made me question how many of us in college were getting proper counseling and how many people are basically--I'm trying to find the right word, that aren't pushing us to succeed, that are cutting us off and really not pushing us.  So, I ended up still going to graduate school, starting graduate school at TCU and got into there and ran into financial problems.  They awarded me more money than I actually ended up getting.  In fact, once I got down there, three weeks into the semester they said, "Oh, we made a mistake and we awarded you too much money."  And by this time, having gone from working as a full time job to going to graduate school, still had some bills left for being full time employee and was counting on all this additional money coming in and they just said, "We made a mistake and we're going to take all this money away."  So after a semester there, I was forced to go back to work.  And so I ended up working there for a while full time; and then just, just left.
Story_ID: 648376
Speaker 1: That's at TCU [Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in, you were at TCU in, what 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: --seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And while I was there, I was president of the black student organization.  So that name was Unity [ph.].
Speaker 1: That, what now, the name was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the name of the black student organization at TCU was called Unity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right. And what were the--were there any faculty members that were once again involved in anything?
Speaker 2: No there weren't, no.
Speaker 1: Did you, well, okay.  Now, so, TCU did it have similar populations as Washington U [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] or Webster [Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: It--it was, yes it was very similar to what it was at Washington U and Webster.  I think for me the major exception was, at Washington University they didn't give athletic scholarships.  And St. Louis [Missouri] wasn't a really big football town.  So when I came down here, it was like everything was about football.
Speaker 1: Now TCU is (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  In fact, when I first got on campus, one of the questions everyone was asking was I on the football team.  And I said, "No, I don't play football, I'm a graduate student."  And people were stunned that we actually have a black student here majoring in business.  So there were only, I think, three of us, I think only three blacks there were grad students.  So people were just shocked and the fact that I didn't play college football as an undergrad was even more a shock.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so when you--you were at TCU for one--for a year?
Speaker 2: Yes for one year.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, so did you, that was in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Through '79 [1979] or?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was through August of '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, '79 [1979].  Then what--I know you went to Abilene Christian at some point but where did you go after TCU?
Speaker 2: After TCU, academically I didn't go--did not go to college anymore until nineteen seventy--well no, until 1980.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have you going back to Abilene--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean going to Abilene Christian University?
Speaker 2: Right.  Now Abilene Christian University had a Dallas [Texas] campus and so I was going to their Dallas campus at the same time that I was working full time.  So, once I left TCU the only way I could go back to college was to have a full time job and go to college in the evenings.
Story_ID: 648377
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so Abilene Christian brought you to Texas, right?
Speaker 2: Texas Christian University [Fort Worth, Texas].
Speaker 1: Texas Chri- I'm sorry, Texas Christ- TCU.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so did you stay in Texas after you came down to go to school at TCU?
Speaker 2: After I came down, I said, left TCU in--around August of 1979.  I went back to St. Louis [Missouri] 'cause I really wasn't sure if I wanted to live in Dallas [Texas], and after going through my final St. Louis winter, I immediately came back down here and started working at Texas Instruments [Texas Instruments Incorporated].
Speaker 1: Now had you met your wife yet?  I know you met her here, right, in Texas?
Speaker 2: Yes, I met my first wife when I came back in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.  First one, not the, not the one that's here [Deborah Valrie Reed]?
Speaker 2: Right, not her.
Speaker 1: All right, we'll keep that straight.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so you came back and you're working for Texas Instruments and now what posi- what did you do at Texas Instruments?
Speaker 2: There I was still working in computers and I was a cost center manager.  Back in those days, it was typical for a person to work at a company for anywhere from a year and a half to two years and they would move on to another company because IT [information technology] was in such demand.  In the position there in Texas Instruments, it was interesting because it was the first time that I had worked as a manager and had the opportunity, for example, to sit in on job interviews and have the hiring and firing decisions.  Now I can remember bringing candidates in to interview and it would be at times a team type of interview.  And I was, if not the highest ranking black either in IT, I've--most companies I've worked at I've either been the highest ranking black either in IT or at times even in the entire company.  Back at TI back then I remember sitting in on some interviews and after the candidates would kind of go through the process, all the hiring managers would get together and I would listen to the comments that they would make about the candidates.  So for example, they would say things like well, you know, "This one candidate here I'm not so sure about their writing skills, 'cause this job requires a lot of writing," or you know, "We need someone who can come up and you know, make presentations and I'm not so sure about this person's presentation skills."  Well they would be talking about the black candidates.  But for the white candidates, they just assumed that they know how to write, that they have the good speaking skills and at that moment, I started thinking about the things that my parents [Jeannette Coleman and Curtiss Reed, Sr.] said, "A black person has to work twice as hard to get half as far."  And so I realized that it wasn't good enough for me to say that I graduated from college [Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri] and therefore, I know how to write.  I had to go and I had to actually start getting articles written and published from a source outside of my em- workplace so that they can say, "Well okay he can write."  And then I also had to start focusing on getting speaking engagements at national conferences so that they can say, "Well, yes he can speak."  So I learned very early on that if I wanted to move up the corporate ladder, I had to take away every excuse they can have for not promoting me, and it had to be something very explicit and very obvious.  So that's the thing that drove me to go back to school and complete getting my M.B.A. from Abilene Christian University.  Once I got into management, over the next ten year period--
Story_ID: 648378
Speaker 1: I don't want to go past the M.B.A., 'cause that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --that's a important degree and it takes--I mean there's a story.  Anybody that gets an M.B.A. has really worked hard and he's got a story to tell on some level, so what is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is your story at Abilene Christian [Abilene Christian University] working on your M.B.A.?
Speaker 2: Okay, well I was working on that part time here in Dallas [Texas].  And I kept thinking about the things that my mother [Jeannette Coleman] and father [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] both focused on and that was being an entrepreneur.  So I realized that at some point in my life I was going to be put in a position in which I was going to be out the door, so to speak in Corporate America.  And I needed to have a fall back.  So I focused on getting the M.B.A. in management and at every company I worked at, I looked at every opportunity and I asked myself, "How can I eventually use this to run my own business?"  So getting the M.B.A. is the thing that kind of helped lay the foundation for okay, you know, if you want to have your own business these are the different areas I needed to focus on.  These are the things that I need--needed to be looking at.  This is how I would go about analyzing business opportunities to see whether or not they were even worth pursuing.
Speaker 1: Once again, were there any instructors or administrators at Abilene Christian that took an interest in you as a?
Speaker 2: There--there really weren't.  And a lot of the classes that I've been in, I was--a lot of them I was the--actually the only black or there may have been just two or three others.  And I dare say the teachers would look at us kind of like, "Well I know you're not going to be here at the beginning--you're not going to be here at the end of the semester, so why should I bother to take an interest in you."  So for the most part, it was doing everything on my own.  Other students had study groups, I was a study group of one.  So it was just kind of banging my head up against the wall and solving problems.
Speaker 1: Okay, would say that's basically Texas culture or the culture that you--I mean you saw it St. Louis [Missouri] too I guess?
Speaker 2: I did see it in St. Louis also.  So I--I think that is just the perception that a lot of people have, is we're not going to make it so why should I bother to take a--take an interest in you.  My cousin, Ladonia [ph.], out in California experienced the same thing when she was in a program to train to run a marathon.  They would not take an interest in her.  She was the only black in the group.  And I had to tell her, I says, "They don't think you'll finish, so they're not going to take an interest in you."  It wasn't until she told the coach, she goes, "Oh yeah I have a cousin who's run, you know, seventy-five or 100 marathons and he's been in Runner's World magazine."  It wasn't until she told him that that they took her seriously.  So I think with a lot of people, they just don't think we're going to finish, so they don't take an interest in us.
Story_ID: 648379
Speaker 1: What was the toughest part of getting your M.B.A. [from Abilene Christian University]?
Speaker 2: I think the toughest part for me, I remember the toughest course I had was philosophy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now I didn't know that was a part of a M.B.A. curriculum, but philosophy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So was it the philosophy of business or was it--what was it?
Speaker 2: I can--well the--Texas Christian University [Fort Worth, Texas] being a Christian university, one of the courses we had to take in order to graduate, even from the graduate program, had to do with a business philosophy or something.  And I remember the assignment that they gave us was--they gave us like a profile of six people and we had to decide which one of those six individuals would get like a transplanted heart or something.  And you had to be able to tell the other five people why they would not get it.  So the profiles were everything from like someone who grew up in the inner city to a business executive, you know, homemaker, all these different profiles.  And my solution was just to take a die and throw it, and whichever number came up, that's the person that got the heart.  And I explained to the professor, I said, "I don't know how anyone's future is going to turn out and I can't base giving a heart based on a person's activities in the past.  So who am I to play God?  I'll just throw the die, whatever number comes up, that's the person that gets the heart."  And the teacher did not like it.  But I said, "Can you justify to any one of those individuals why the other--why anyone else is more important?" I said, "You just can't do it."
Speaker 1: Yeah it all seems like very narrowly--you know, a value judgment, a cultural value judgment that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and were you concerned it wasn't made out of the same cultural context that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Right, and so for me it's, you know, I want to give everyone an equal--an equal chance.  And I'm not going to look at the background.  It's like who am I to play God?
Speaker 1: I guess so the arguments would be, "This guy makes more money, he has higher status, he's done you know, he should be--."
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right and that person could turn out to be a Madoff [Bernard Madoff] (laughter).  So you just--you just never know.
Speaker 1: Okay now was there any fanfare associated with getting your M.B.A.?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't.  I was just happy to get it out of the way.  As soon as I got it, I ended up getting a job again as a manager at another company.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Jeannette Coleman] and father [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] come down for the ceremony or did they?
Speaker 2: I--I know my father didn't come down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think either of them came down.  I don't remember taking pictures with either one of them so.
Speaker 1: But did you make a big deal out of it yourself?  I mean in terms of in the family?  Were you excited?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was excited that, I was excited to get it over.  I was the first member of my family known to get a graduate degree.  So that was pretty exciting.  But I was just, by then, so into working and looking and supporting a family that there wasn't a lot of fanfare.
Speaker 1: Now did you have children by this time?
Speaker 2: No, graduated from that in '82 [1982]; and my then wife and I had our son [Justin Reed] in '83 [1983].
Story_ID: 648380
Speaker 1: Okay, now, but something important happens in '82 [1982] also, you run your first marathon, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, ran my first marathon.
Speaker 1: Cowtown Marathon (laughter).
Speaker 2: Cowtown Marathon and that was--that was kind of interesting because I got to the starting line and this--
Speaker 1: Now this in, this had, this is at Fort Worth, right?
Speaker 2: Fort Worth, Texas.
Speaker 1: And now what was--prior to doing this, what was your impression of marathon running.  Did you know about--did you have any marathon heroes or were you running--were you reading Runner's World magazine?  I mean were you really--I mean what was the lead up to doing this?
Speaker 2: Okay.  When I moved--when I moved over to Dallas [Texas] in 1980, there--we have here a place called White Rock Lake and it's nine miles around and have a beautiful running trail.  So that really got me increasing my mileage from running six or seven miles to running about nine miles.  In 1981, I ran the Cowtown 10K [10 kilometer], which was the same day as the Cowtown Marathon.  Both of them were run at the same time.  And I remember going to the starting line of the marathon and I realized that people there were as big as I was.  Because up to that time, most marathoners that I read about and knew about were people that were pencil thin.  You know, you had the Kenyans, Ethiopians.  And here I am six feet tall weighing, you know, 180 pounds, I was by no means a marathoner.  But when I looked at the people in the marathon and saw they were as big as I was, I decided I was going to run the marathon that next year.  So since there weren't a lot of running clubs around or people where you can go and talk to about running marathons, I ended up reading books about running marathons.  And I put together a marathon training schedule and started training for that first marathon.  I remember watching, I believe it was the 1964 Olympics [1964 Summer Olympics, Tokyo, Japan] and 1968 Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico] where an African runner won the Olympic marathon.  But I did not know of any African Americans running or winning marathons until the 1982 Cowtown.  When I got to the starting line I looked up and there were at least five other blacks there running, whom I have never--never met or never seen.  And one of them, Ricky Cox, ended up winning the marathon.  In fact, he won, I think, three or four Cowtown Marathons.  And so I came away from the race thinking it was normal for black Americans to run marathons and to win the marathons (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 648381
Speaker 1: Now did Ricky Cox, now being African American kind of takes him out of the stereotypical marathon winner.  I mean, but did he have the build of a typical--'cause I know the famous, most famous marathoner, I think, in world history was a fellow--at a certain point was a fellow named Mamo Wolde from Ethiopia who was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a very thin fellow.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's exactly how Ricky's built.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very lean, very thin.  He could just run for days, has very, very fluid running motion.  I got a chance to meet his son [Demery Cox] last summer, and his son is the same way.
Speaker 1: Does he run too?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.  His son definitely runs.
Speaker 1: All right.  And of course in the '68 Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico], African distance runners in the 1500 meters, the steeplechase, Kip Keino [Kipchoge Keino] and Ben Jipcho I think won the steeplechase, and that was for the first time, you know, someone black was winning, you know, long distance races on a consistent basis, I mean with Mamo Wolde and then with the Kenyans, yeah, so.
Speaker 2: And interestingly enough when reading those books back then, they didn't talk about, they did not call any black marathoners by name.  But I kept reading about a gentleman named Ted Corbitt and it turns out Ted was black.  Ted was a gentleman that introduced ultramarathons, and these are running races longer than 26.2 miles, in the U.S.  And so it turns out he was a very famous black distance runner.  He belonged to the pioneer running club [New York Pioneer Club] out of New York City [New York, New York], which was founded by the son of a black mortician [Joseph Y. Yancey, Jr.].  And the pioneer running club produced, at one point, more Olympic gold medalists than any other running club in the U.S.  And in fact, the running coach for that running club, the U.S. would not let him coach the U.S. Olympic team.  He ended up coaching, oh, some of the other Olympic--coaching Olympic runners in other countries.
Speaker 1: Like the Caribbean or that's where (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  And so because he didn't coach at a college they wouldn't let him coach the Olympic team.  So I have had an opportunity to talk to Ted Corbitt's son [Gary Corbitt].  And in fact, Ted Corbitt is honored on our--the National Black Marathoners' [National Black Marathoners' Association] website as one of the trailblazers of distance running.  So for example, he was the first black in the world to run over 100 marathons, and the second person in the world to have done that.
Story_ID: 648382
Speaker 1: So did you know about Ted Corbitt in 1982 when you ran your marathon [Cowtown Marathon]?
Speaker 2: I knew about him, but I did not know he was black.  'Cause they, they did not have pictures of him in the books.  You know, and they never called him out by race as being an African American or black distance runner.
Speaker 1: Now today we're--in 2013 we're in the age of Google, you can Google the person's name and usually find a picture too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you can satisfy your curiosity, and, but then it's hard to--
Speaker 2: Yes, you just didn't know.  Unless, I think unless you lived in the New York City [New York, New York] area, which is where he ran, you would not have known he was black.  So yes, but he was out there and he was, he was running.
Speaker 1: Now he, I read that he ran in the '52 games in Helsinki [1952 Summer Olympics, Helsinki, Finland]--
Speaker 2: Helsinki, yes.
Speaker 1: --marathon, but he didn't win, he kind of finished in the middle of the pack.
Speaker 2: Yes, I've--in fact, I just finished reading his book this past week.  And he got into some of the challenges that they had back then in running.  For example, in running marathons back then, they didn't necessarily believe in drinking water.  So you know, you're out there running for twenty-six miles, and in his case he would get into ultra races where it was fifty-two miles and they're not drinking anything and it's sixty, seventy, eighty degrees outside.  So when you read it, it's--I was just totally blown away.  Things that we take for granted today were things that they just simply didn't do.  He was talking about repairing his own running shoes with inner tubes from tires, gluing them back on the shoes (laughter).  And I was just blown--I was just blown away.
Story_ID: 648383
Speaker 1: Yeah running shoes even, in those days I mean the track people used spikes for the most part.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the kind of running shoes we have today, you know, that people run on asphalt and they weren't that--I don't remember even a good model of one until the '70s [1970s] where you have like a cushion heel?
Speaker 2: Right, that's when Nike [Nike, Inc.] came out with their--with their waffle shoes.  And I remember getting my first pair of those, oh gosh back around 1978, '79 [1979], yes.  And Ted Corbitt even talked about running in boots at one point just to get used to running in the heat and putting a lot of stress on his body.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the book 'The Art of Running' [sic. 'The Complete Book of Running'] by Jim Fixx [James Fixx] had a picture of a guy running in ASICS [ASICS Corporation], yeah.  So I think ASICS became the craze for a while 'cause everybody associated with it the cover of that book--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --ASICS Tigers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, its--
Speaker 2: I've--running has gone through a lot of changes over the decades.  Even back then when I first started running, men didn't have lycra tights, so some guys used to run in pantyhose in the wintertime in order to stay warm.  We had cotton shorts, cotton shirts.  If you wanted to carry water with you--with you when you ran, you had to find some type of bottle to carry, so we were usually borrowing bottles from bicyclists and carrying those with us.  I can remember mapping out my running routes based off of where there was a water fountain at a gas station.  So things have just really changed over the years.
Story_ID: 648384
Speaker 1: So that first race, this Cowtown Marathon is won by an African American [Ricky Cox]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, now how did you do, where did you come in?
Speaker 2: All I wanted to do was finish.  Back then in the different books I was reading about marathoning, they said if you can't finish in under four hours you shouldn't even sign up for the race.  And so my whole goal was to finish in under four hours.  And I remember turning the corner, looking down at the clock ticking away and it had like 4:58:00 [sic.].  And so I just tore off in a sprint and finished the marathon in about four hours and fifty-nine minutes.  Sorry--no three hours and fifty-nine minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Just to get under that four hours?
Speaker 2: Ju- just to get under that four hours.  And so for many years, my whole goal was to finish in under four hours.  And now they have race courses open until seven and a half and eight hours for people to finish, which is now good for me 'cause I've slowed down as I've gotten older and I need as much time as I can.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is the peak time for a marathoner to run, I mean peak age I guess for a marathoner to run?  Does it, is it about like any other sport?
Speaker 2: Well for--for the average runner, their times can actually improve for the next five years--for five years after they start.  So for example, in the black marathoner's organization [National Black Marathoners' Association], we have people that started running when they were sixty-one and sixty-two years old.  And their times actually improved over the first five years before they kind of started creeping back up.  So for the average person it's five years from the time you start--you start improving.  For the elite athletes, they keep pushing the age limit higher and higher.  I believe at one year in the Olympics there was a forty year old--or thirty-nine year old who won the Olympic marathon and that same year a thirty-nine year old also won--I can't remember if it was the Tour de France or the bicycling road race in the Olympics.  So with technology and with proper dieting and everything, people just keep pushing that number up.
Speaker 1: So how did you train for your first marathon?  What was your training regimen?
Speaker 2: My training regimen for the first one was about twice a week I would try to get in a run anywhere from six to nine miles, and on the weekends I'd gradually increase that nine mile run up to about twenty miles.  So it took about, I think it was a twelve to fifteen week program of just gradually getting that mileage up.  And one of the rules of thumbs is you don't increase your weekly mileage by more than 10 percent, 'cause if you do, you risk getting injured.  And that's where a lot of people who, even today, start training for marathons find they get injured.  They start feeling really good and they'll say, "Well I'll run an extra two or three miles."  The next thing you know, they get injured.  So it's about really controlling and putting together a schedule and sticking with it.
Story_ID: 648385
Speaker 1: Now it seems to me, just watching people run distance, it takes a lot of patience, 'cause I, I give up (laughter).  I mean after a while I start saying--I start wondering, why am I doing this, and that sort of thing.  But it, but how do you stay focused?
Speaker 2: Well, when I run, it's--it gives me a chance basically to disconnect.  Because I work with computers all the time, you have the telephone, you have people interrupting, it gives me a time just to be with--with myself.  So when I run, I'll be thinking about the problems or issues I may be having that day.  I may be making plans for the future.  I may be thinking about personal challenges I may be having.  So it gives me an opportunity to just completely free my mind.  Since I don't run on treadmills, but I do all my running outside, it gives me an opportunity to enjoy the scenery and the nature, and it's just really mentally relaxing.
Speaker 1: Now, I've often wondered when people are training, do they ever see something in nature that makes them actually stop and look at it, you know what I mean?  You know, 'cause you can run past a lot of things.  I mean it's nice to be out there, but sometimes don't you want to stop and take a look or does that throw you off your regimen?
Speaker 2: No, I--I do that.  I, as they say, stop and smell the roses.  One of the things about the difference kind of between running and racing.  When you're racing, you're going at a speed that's too fast for you to really have a conversation with someone.  But when you're just running, and this is one of the major things we tell new runners, is you run at a pace where you can have a conversation.  So I run at that type of pace.  Now the pace has slowed down over the years, 'cause at one point I could easily do that at a seven minute a mile pace.  Now it takes me a little bit longer than a seven minute a mile pace.  But I'll get in marathons, and as I said, I'm not going to come in first place, so I'm not going to kill myself.  So I have other objectives in mind.  So for example when I ran the Great Wall of China marathon [Great Wall Marathon], I saw so many things along the way that I carried my camera.  I stopped and took over 100 photos during the marathon (laughter).  Still got a great workout, got a lot of fantastic photos during the process.  So, you know, when running with people and getting people to run, that's one of the most important things, is to run at a conversational pace.
Story_ID: 648386
Speaker 1: Take us through the trajectory of, I guess, to your--from whe- when you got started in '82 [1982] to when you hit your peak as a marathoner--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, and yeah, tell us?
Speaker 2: Okay, there are what I call the three phases of distance running.  The first one is when you're a jogger, and that's when you just get in it, you may run anywhere from three to five miles.  It doesn't feel all that comfortable while you're doing it.  In fact, your point, you know after five or six miles you just want to quit.  Then the next phase is the racing phase, and that's where the jogger discovers racing.  They discover signing up for races and nowadays it's all about the bling.  People want to get in the race and then get a nice looking medal, you know, a nice looking finisher's medal.  So then they get in the racing phase and that is a phase where a lot of people get disoriented, they get discouraged and they get injured 'cause they're trying to run fast every time.  It's the competitive nature that kicks in.  If they survive the racing phase, they get into the running phase.  And that's where you can just leave your watch at home, you don't care how long it takes you to run.  You're going to still get in a good workout, but you just don't need to track your mileage, you don't care about beating your last year's time or last week's time, you're just there for the pure enjoyment of it.  It's kind of like the yoga or the highest level I guess you can say of distance running.  When you're in the racing phase, that may last anywhere from three to five years.  When I was in the peak for the racing phase is when I ran my fastest marathons, won the different trophies for placing in my age group and weight divisions, and then I was doing, what for me, was a lot of heavy mileage.  So for example, to get ready for a marathon in December, from the first weekend in January all the way through Thanksgiving, I'm putting in a long run of about eighteen and a half miles.  And this is going through the Texas summers on into the--on into the cooler temps.  And I was putting in two to three nine mile runs every week on top of the eighteen miles.  And then, like I said, I reached the point where I ran my fastest races and I knew that they were my fastest races and I said, "Okay, you know, I need to just kind of chill 'cause I don't want to get injured," and that's also when I went through that major injury shortly thereafter.  And it made me kind of rethink the direction I wanted to go.  So I said well okay, I want this to be a lifestyle, I want it to be a lifetime sport.  So I'm not going to focus on speed, I'm going to focus on just running at that conversational pace and enjoying it a lot more.  And so that's basically what I do now.
Story_ID: 648387
Speaker 1: Tell us about your dream to qualify for the Boston Marathon; and, and, in this question is also implied like how--I mean, there are different levels of running the marathon, right?  I guess on one level, anybody can run in the Boston Marathon, but you're talking about running in the Boston Marathon as a contender, right?
Speaker 2: Well in order to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not anybody--she's [Reed's second wife, Deborah Valrie Reed] shaking her head (laughter) go ahead.
Speaker 2: When--I ran my--my fastest marathon is in three hours and thirty-six minutes.  And even with that--that fast time, I was still twenty minutes too slow to qualify for Boston.  As African Americans, most of us you know, when they came over from the slave ships came from the western coast of Africa where the Kenyans and all the fast runners grew up on the eastern side.
Speaker 1: The distance runners--
Speaker 2: Right, the distance runners.
Speaker 1: --the faster distance runners?
Speaker 2: Right.  So we don't have the build, so we're built more for the short fast sprints.  So when I ran my fastest marathon, they said in order for me to qualify for Boston, I would have to lose about twenty to thirty pounds, 'cause I was six feet tall, weighed 180 pounds, was moving it rather quickly, but for me to get faster I have to lose weight.  And since I didn't have a lot of body fat, I was--literally have to lose muscle, 'cause I'm built more like a running back than I am a distance runner.  So as a result of that, I said, "I'm not going to do that," and I literally gave up my dream of ever qualifying for Boston.  Winning Boston is like winning the Olympics.  To qualify for Boston would be the equivalent of qualifying for the Olympic trials, for the average American.  So it is a really, really big deal in the running community to qualify for and run the Boston Marathon.
Speaker 1: Now in Chicago [Illinois], I know, that you don't have to--I think it's at two levels.  There's a level where you qualify (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's an elite level.
Speaker 1: --but then there's a level anybody can run it and say they finished the Chicago Marathon.
Speaker 2: Right, but not with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is it the same in Boston?
Speaker 2: No, with Boston, it's--you have to run a qualifying time based off of your age group.  Now there are some people, for example, that they would get in--like get in if they raised, I don't know twenty-five hundred dollars for a charity that the Boston Marathon supports.  And then the third way is through a special invitation--invitational only.  So while I was speaking at an engagement in Lansing, Michigan last year, I happened to mention that--well one of the questions that was asked was, "Have you ever run Boston?"  And I said, "No I've never run the Boston Marathon because I'm--I don't have the physical build for it."  And the lady said--later on, she said, "Would you--do you want to run Boston?"  And I said, "Well of course," I said, "but I don't think that's going to happen," and she said, "I think I can get you in the Boston Marathon."  And so that was in November.
Speaker 1: Of this past year?
Speaker 2: Of this past year.  Two days after Christmas I got a letter in the mail and I had received a special invitation to run the Boston Marathon.  So this April, I will be toeing the line at the Boston Marathon and it's like that's something I never in my life thought would've happened.  So I am just ecstatic.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I assume there'll be other people there that are not, you know, super fast marathoners, so you won't be the last (laughter) one?
Speaker 2: Right, I won't be the last one, and in fact, I've actually changed my running program to focus more on the speed so that I can get my marathon time down even lower, even lower than I have been running them in.  'Cause again, my focus has just been on finishing the marathons versus necessarily having a fast time.  So now I'm starting focusing on getting a fast time.
Story_ID: 648388
Speaker 1: Now you had mentioned the marathon along the Great Wall of China [Great Wall Marathon], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean did, did the runners actually run along the wall?
Speaker 2: Yes, miles three through six and twenty through twenty-three are held on the Great Wall itself.  And you would run up and down some thirty-six hundred stairs while you're on the Great Wall itself.  The three marathons that I ran, it turns out were ranked as the top ten toughest marathons in the world, and the Great Wall was one of them because of the challenge of being on the wall plus the heat.  The Antarctica marathon [Antarctic Ice Marathon], just because of the sheer temperatures down there, and then--
Speaker 1: It's run in the summer though, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's run in the summer in February.  But one year, one year when they were going to have the race it was so cold the runners never got off the ship.  And so they ended up running over four hundred laps around the deck of the ship in order to get it to count as a marathon.  Then the other marathon was the Safaricom Lewa Marathon [Safaricom Marathon] in Kenya, which is held at a high altitude and it's held in a game reserve [Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Isiolo, Kenya].  So the year that I ran the race, they delayed the start of the race by fifteen minutes because there was a lion on the marathon course.  And the day before we toured the course and we saw three cheetahs on the course, a couple of rhinos and these animals were all going to be roaming free during the race.  So it was--it was a nerve racking race.
Speaker 1: I can imagine.  Now I'm sure the Kenyans or the Tanzanians won that particular race?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes (laughter).  And in fact, there was an aid station of--the Maasai warriors had an aid station with their red robes and they were out there handing out water, and that was just amazing.
Speaker 1: Now, have you gotten a chance to become friends with any of the Kenyans or Tanzanians like Kip Rono--or Keino [Kipchoge Keino] or you know?
Speaker 2: No, no I haven't.  When I finished the marathon, the Kenyan who at that time held the world record for the marathon, Paul Tergat was there at the finish line; and I got a chance to get an autographed copy of his book ['Paul Tergat: Running to the Limit,' Jurg Wirz].  But other than that, I have- haven't met any.
Story_ID: 648389
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you, one thing about the travel, you've, you've run a lot of races outside of the country.  Who finances that? Do you get sponsors or do you have to foot the bill yourself or what?
Speaker 2: That's something that I foot the bill for that myself and by myself, I mean my consulting company [Anthony R. Reed, CPA, PC] in that it is a part of my business.  I would love to have sponsors.  I have a shoe sponsor which helps me out quite a bit, that's Spira [Spira Footwear, Inc.].  So as I've done the international marathons, they've been there to support me with that.
Speaker 1: Where is Spira originated, where--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Spira is, they are a Texas based company [El Paso, Texas].  And they make the running shoes that have the coils on the inside.  And so interestingly enough, one of the problems that a lot of--I hear a lot of black distance runners say that they have, or people that want to be distance runners, are that they have problems with their knees.  And with Spira running shoes, like I said, I'm fifty-seven and I don't have the problems anymore.  So it really does depend on the type of running shoe that the person is using and how frequently they trade the running shoes out.
Speaker 1: Okay. One thing I've noticed about shoe construction.  Back in the old days in the '70s [1970s], they had something called Earth Shoes [Kalso Earth Shoes].  Where the claim was that your heel should be lower than the rest of your foot and that was the most natural way.  But most running shoes, the heel is elevated.  So is there, is there a reason for the discrepancy?
Speaker 2: Well, ironically one of the running injuries that I had had to do with my Achilles tendonitis.  And that was because it was--it was short.  And it's the same problem, for example, that women who wear high heeled shoes have is that their Achilles is compressed because their heel is so high.  So one of the things, for example, that I have to do every day is I stand on a board in which it's a slant board so my heel is lower than my toes.  So when you were talking about the Earth Shoes, yeah the Earth Shoes help stretch your Achilles.  And so I do that several times a day, just standing on that board to keep them nice and stretched and loose.  But the--the cushioning nowadays, the construction--running shoes are constructed so that they last longer than they used to in the past.  And you have a bigger, much bigger variety.  So you can say there's some shoes that have heels and then you have the minimalist shoes which are--you're practically running barefoot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So there's the whole gamut.
Speaker 1: I think there's a shoe now--well I don't know if you can call it a shoe, but it looks like a foot with the toes in it [Vibram FiveFingers] and people are running in those, have--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, have you ever tried those?
Speaker 2: I have not tried those (laughter).  I'll just--one of the things about running, I say, if it's not broke, don't fix it.  So I'm sticking with what I have; and pretty much consistent until something changes, and then I'll explore other options.
Story_ID: 648390
Speaker 1: What's the, what would you consider the highlight of your, your mar- marathoning?
Speaker 2: For me the highlight would be being the first black in the world to run marathons on all seven continents.  There are only, at that time, 225 people in the world that had accomplished that particular goal.  And when I looked at what it took for me to get there, it was a lot.  Because I would get to the starting lines of races and people would say, "You look too big to be here," or you know, people would say, "I'm surprised that there's a black in this race."  And so it, to me, kind of got all the way back to, you know, being in high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri], it's like, "Well, what are you doing here, you're not supposed to be here."  Deborah [Deborah Valrie Reed], my wife, is the one who encouraged me to go ahead and pursue finishing the marathons on all seven continents.  We met the year that I ran the marathon in China [Great Wall Marathon], and--
Speaker 1: This is when, about?
Speaker 2: This was in 2006--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is when we met.  Yeah, is when we met in 2006, and I had--she was with me.  Well, we were dating at the time that I ran the marathons in Antarctica [Antarctic Ice Marathon] and South America [Marathon Fin del Mundo].  And when I came back from South America, Deborah and I were talking and I said, "Well I don't know if I want to go ahead and run this marathon down in Antarctica in 2007."  And Deborah said, "Well you need to strike while the iron is hot because you have no idea what's going to happen next year."  So I signed up to run a marathon in Kenya [Safaricom Marathon] and ran it on June 23rd, 2007.  I became the first black in the world to run a marathon on the seven continents.  The week after I ran it I came back to the U.S. and walked into the office on my birthday, July 2nd, and my company had a one person layoff and it was me.  And the crazy thing about it was I had worked at this company, I've saved them millions of dollars.  In fact, I worked on one IT [information technology] project where they estimated it would cost $12 million to implement all these applications around the world.  I asked for a $4 million budget and I did it for $2.6 million.  It was ahead of schedule, everyone liked it and my boss tried to get me fired.  And it all kind of came back around to what my parents [Jeannette Coleman and Curtiss Reed, Sr.] were telling me and what, again, my father's thing was, you always needed to have a second job.  You can't depend on the people in Corporate America to--you know, for your livelihood.  And so, my thing was I go into work every day with the understanding as--what do they say, "Give unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar."  It's their job, it's not my job.  And so within, what a ten day period, I ended up making history by running a marathon in Kenya and then got laid off from work as soon as I got back.  And that opened up a whole lot of other doors and opportunities for me.  So when Deborah was saying, you know, "Strike while the iron is hot," that was a perfect time to go ahead and strike, so.  And so that, to me, was a very emotional time when word finally got out that I was indeed the first black to run marathons on all seven continents.  One of the most critical marathons was running the marathon down in Antarctica 'cause I felt like I was right back in high school.  I was the only black in the marathon down there and I realized that if I quit the race, everyone would know, that one black guy didn't make it.  If one of the whites didn't finish the race, it's like, so what.  So I felt like once the race started I had to represent; I had to finish regardless of what was going on, regardless of how tough the course was, I had to make it.
Story_ID: 648391
Speaker 1: Well, have you ever--were you in that position in--well the position in this particular race in Antarctica [Antarctic Ice Marathon], or have you ever been in a position where you wanted to just give up, say, "I'm," you know, "This is," you know, "I'm tired," you know, "I'm not proving anything," you know?  Have you ever felt like that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) There is--there's one marathon where I did not finish.  And that was simply because they did not have portalets along the marathon route.  That was the only one.  The worst marathon I ever had was the Walk of Fame Marathon in Lubbock, Texas.  It was already in the mid-eighties before the race even started.  So you think about the fact they shut down the Chicago Marathon because it got up to eighty degrees.  This race, it was already over eighty when it started.  It was the only marathon out of 123 where I actually walked across the finish line.  I lost weight, I should've taken an IV, I was severely dehydrated.  But it turns out because I survived and everyone else dropped out that was my age group, I ended up getting a trophy in my age group, as well as a trophy in my weight division for men over two hundred pounds.  And yet, at that time, was the slowest marathon I'd ever run.  But the lesson I got from that was to finish.  You know, to stick with it.  Other people around me will drop out, they'll fall out, same thing applies to Corporate America.  You know, you just got to stick with it.  And you know, other people around you are going to be failing, but if you're focused you can make it.
Story_ID: 648392
Speaker 1: Now, we just had, the country just experienced another doping crisis with Lance Armstrong and his whole bicycle team. I mean he's the captain of the team, he's making them all dope or either dope or get out of the, the group, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that a--is that a problem in the marathon or ultramarathon world, the problem of doping to win?  'Cause I would be surprised if it wasn't?
Speaker 2: I--I don't think it is, because with the prize money that they're offering marathoners, they've been testing marathoners for quite some time.  You know, just like with the Olympics basically, and I think they may use the same testing labs or what have you.  But, I can't remember the last time I heard of a marathoner losing a title as a result of doping.  'Cause with a lot of the--a lot of the marathoners, you know, you're looking at, you know, like the Kenyans and Ethiopians who are raised at the high altitudes where, you know, they're born running, you know.  So, and with them a lot of it is the altitude.  So they'll try to stay up at the high altitudes until two to three days before the race, which is when they'll come down so that they still have the effects of the high altitude and then they'll go ahead and they'll run the race.
Speaker 1: So they actually have an easier time down in the lower altitude because they're used to thin air?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is like a holiday (laughter) to run in thick air?
Speaker 2: Yes indeed.  And when we go from sea level to high altitude, when I did that in Kenya [at the Safaricom Marathon], I ran--I remember the first time I ran about four miles it felt like someone was standing on my chest.  I was just having just that much of a difficulty trying to breathe.  So I have the upmost respect and appreciate the things that they're able to--able to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there hasn't been any of that kind of scandal?  I remember one of the Scandinavian distance runners in the Olympics caused a little bit of controversy because he was giving himself a total blood transfusion.  That was Lasse Viren, remember him?  Distance runner, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, I--I remember--I remember what was going on then--
Speaker 1: Between events, he would run like 1500 meters [sic.] and then he ran in the marathon too or something and gave himself, he had like a complete blood transfusion the night before.
Speaker 2: Well it may have been trying to give him additional blood because the blood is what carries the oxygen.  So the more oxygen you can get in your system, of course the, I would not necessarily say the faster you can go, but the longer--the longer you can go.  So he may have been getting not necessarily blood replacement, but getting additional blood put in his system.  So they have--I think now they have testing for that, 'cause that's what they were doing at the Tour de France also.  It was--
Speaker 1: What the transfusion?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So they would take their own blood, store it and then give it back to them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, right, I think I'm sure that's what he was doing.  'Cause they would drain him completely of whatever was in there and then fill him up with (laughter) new blood.  I mean, you know, it may have been his own blood, but it was new blood, so he was like he hadn't, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so I don't know.
Story_ID: 648393
Speaker 1: What's the, what's the closest you've come to winning one, a marathon?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: I mean in your racing days?
Speaker 2: The closest I came wasn't necessarily with winning a marathon, but was with winning a--what's called a biathlon which is a combination of bicycling and running.  And with that, the highest place I've gotten on one of those was third place.  I competed in the same race for three consecutive years and each year, my time was faster than the winning time the year before, but the competition just kept getting stiffer.  The first year I ran it I came away with a very interesting lesson.  And that is, if you're going to lead, you need to know where you're going.  Now because we did about a twelve to fifteen mile bicycle leg first, followed by a three mile run, and I was one of the first ones off of my bike.  I was in the lead during the run and the other runners were about probably two to three hundred yards behind me.  So I was basically a shoe in.  I continued running and heard people yelling and screaming, and they were the runners that were trying to catch me and they made a right turn, and I didn't know the turn.  And there was a gentleman standing on the corner who was supposed to be directing the runners and even though I had a race number he let me keep going straight and didn't tell me I was supposed to turn.  And afterwards in discussions with the race director, his comment was, "Well you know if you're going to be in the lead you need to know where you're going, you need to know the lay of the land and there's nothing we can do about this."
Speaker 1: Well what was he there for, that begs the question?
Speaker 2: Well, their thing is, you know, as the runner you have the responsibility, you can't rely on anyone else to direct you during the race.  And again, that kind of goes in to life, you know, again getting back to the college counselors not telling me what to do, but I had to take the responsibility upon myself to know what it took to graduate [from Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri].  So, I learned very quickly the same thing applied to--to road races.  If you're going to be in the lead, you need to drive the course the days before; you need to run it so you know exactly where you're supposed to go, and not let anyone misguide you.

Speaker 1: Now have you had any, any really running mentors at all?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Fred Davis III [Frederick Davis III], he is the--he has run over 450 marathons and ultras.  And these people, by the way, are all members of the National Black Marathoners' Association.  Angela Ivory is a--she was the first black woman to run marathons in all fifty states.  And she had run over three hundred marathons and ultramarathons and she did this while she was undergoing chemo for breast cancer and later on she had bone cancer, which--and she ultimately passed away.  But the doctors were amazed that even with bone cancer, she was participating in fifty mile races.  So then there's also Ricky Cox, again for winning the Cowtown Marathon multiple times.  And then there is Donald Arnold who is also a black marathoner and he had run thirty seven marathons with a transplanted heart.
Speaker 1: Now that's amazing.  Well, all these are amazing stories.  A transplanted heart?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean they're all amazing people.  You know, they participated in sports, you know, up into their fifties and sixties and they make it a lifestyle.  And you know, all of us are running away from high blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes and the heart diseases that, you know, impact our families.
Speaker 1: I guess there's the aspect of achievement too--one of our HistoryMakers, Chicago [Illinois] sociologist and poet, Useni Perkins [HistoryMaker Useni Eugene Perkins], I know 'cause I knew him when he was training.  And when he finished the Chicago Marathon and he wore his medal for a year in public.  He wore it, yeah, you know.  So the marathon become--became and I guess it still is, but I know at one time it was really a symbol of achievement that you, you know, that people would proudly wear (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  It--it still is.  In the black community it's still extremely rare.  Last year there were, I believe, five hundred thousand people finished marathons in the U.S.  Black marathon finishers represent less than 1 percent of the people who actually finish marathons.  As a percentage of the overall U.S. population we represent 0.0016 percent of the entire U.S. population.  So it's very rare--
Speaker 1: That finishes--
Speaker 2: --that actually finishes a marathon.
Speaker 1: We're like 13 percent of the pop- population (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so it's extremely rare.  So, it--it's a major accomplishment and that's one of the reasons why we for- we organized the National Black Marathoners' Association.  So we're the largest organization of black distance runners in this country.
Story_ID: 648395
Speaker 1: Well tell us about how that was organized.  Were you on the ground floor of that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am one of the cofounders.  I was giving a presentation in 2005 [sic. 2001], and in fact it was in Chicago [Illinois] at the black data processing association's annual conference [Black Data Processing Associates].  And then I happened to have mentioned that I had a goal of running fifty marathons before I turned fifty, and by that time I believe I had run about forty-five marathons.  So I didn't think very much about the number of marathons I had run since I was kind of the only black I knew that was actually running them.  So I just been accumulating them over the years.  Charlotte Simmons [Charlotte Simmons-Foster] was in the audience at that time and she pulled me aside and she goes, "I've never met a black who's run as many marathons as you have."  Well, thanks to the popularity of the Internet over the next few years, Charlotte and I stayed in touch with each other.  And then we decided to form the National Black Marathoners' Association.  So Charlotte lives in Atlanta [Georgia], and of course I'm based here in Dallas [Texas].  And we now have members in over forty-three states and five countries.  And we meet once a year at a different location around the country to bring en masse as many black distance runners as we can.  And it's basically--it's a huge support network of people that are actively supporting one another and actively working in our community to train other people to get involved in distance running.  For example, we have more certified black running coaches then just about any other black running organization that may be out there.  We've done a lot, we've awarded over ten thousand dollars in scholarships to college bound high school students who have participated in distance--in distance races.  And, so again, we try to encourage people to get out there and to run or to walk.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, who today would you say is the top African American marathoner?
Speaker 2: It's funny, when you say that--I'm thinking about the people that I know that are--it may not necessarily be world class, but every time they run, they're basically setting a record.  And I would have to go with Fred Davis III [Frederick Davis III].  He is in his sixties, he is still running marathons and ultramarathons, and he still places in his age group.  Another one would be Frances Gilbert.  Frances is a lady that is in her seventies, and she still places when she runs either marathons or half marathons.
Story_ID: 648396
Speaker 1: Tell us about your, your, your business [Anthony R. Reed, CPA, PC], so just kind of bring us up to date on that, and?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I have a consulting business and also a professional speaking business, though both kind of go hand in hand.  With all the years of experience I have in being a business executive and managing information technology applications around the world, combined with being a CPA [certified public accountant] and also with distance running, I realized over the years that I was borrowing a lot of things I learned from distance running and was applying those to managing projects.  So now I basically travel around the world and talk to businesses and professional organizations about how to go about motivating and encouraging their staff to clearly move outside of their comfort zone and to reach new heights.  So in distance running we always talk about hitting the wall.  And that is when basically your body is telling your mind that it wants to quit, and your mind is screaming at your body to keep moving when it's completely tired.  And so we teach people how to go about doing the same thing in the corporate world.  How to go about moving outside their comfort zones, adopting new technology, new changes that are going on in the business world.  And also how they should kind of prepare themselves for the inevitable and that is that one day they may walk into the office and find out that they don't have a job.  So they need to be thinking about their livelihood and how they're going to move ahead individually.  So we've been to speaking engagements down in South America, over in Europe, as well as throughout the U.S.  The past two years we've had well over 100 speaking engagements.  And also going and--again still giving back to the community.  So we like to go and talk to elementary and high school students, as well as at historical black colleges and universities [HBCUs], kind of letting the students know what life is like in the real world, and how they need to better prepare themselves for it.
Story_ID: 648397
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you published your book in 2008, 'Running'--
Speaker 2: 'Running Shoes are Cheaper than Insulin.'
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's 'Running Shoes are Cheaper than Insulin: Marathon Adventures on All Seven Continents' [Anthony Reed].  Yes, we published that because one, we wanted people to understand the impact, the long term impact of maintaining a good fitness program that they can have on them for the rest of their lives.  As a business executive I have been, at times, turned down for jobs initially because part of the package was that I had to get a physical.  And in going through the physical their doctor would turn around and say, "Well you can't hire this gentleman because he has these--these different medical problems."  Well my personal physician, on more than one occasion, has written letters either to the company or to their insurance company, where he would state, "This gentleman has run X number of marathons.  You know, he swims, he bikes, he's healthier than probably 99 percent of the people there at your company."  And as a result of those letters, I've been able to get the lower rates on insurance policies and I have indeed gotten those executive positions.  So, for me there has been a direct correlation between being fit and seeking employment, and also having a much better quality of life (background noise).  I did not want to be one of the fifty year olds who, they say, "You turn fifty, you get big and you just can't go any place and do anything."  I wanted to be able to have that second childhood and go off and have a lot of fun.  So at fifty-five years old, my wife [Deborah Valrie Reed] and I were taking surfing lessons in Hawaii, because it's something we always wanted to do, and I said the kids were grown and out the house, so we said, "Let's go for it."
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it's, it's been great.
Story_ID: 648398
Speaker 1: All right, well what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  My--I guess it's--it's on two fronts.  One of them is the physical side.  I'm--I have major concerns because a high percentage of African Americans are overweight.  And subsequently, we have to go on a lot of medication and at the same time, that impacts us from an economical perspective.  The money we spend on medications is money that could be spent on other things, mainly for example our education.  So I would like for us to become more healthy and more conscious about what we do, and what foods we put in our--what foods we put in our systems.  Also on the academic front, I'm really concerned about the--what I call the dumb me down effects.  I've met black youth, for example, who are very intelligent, but they want to become rappers or they want to become people in the entertainment industry.  And they don't see where they can both be smart and also pursue other interests such as music.  And I want them to understand that the two go hand in hand.  It's called the entertainment industry and they remember the entertainment, but they forget the industry word that--that follows it.  So I really want the youth to become more involved in education and truly to pursue that.  Because without that, they say they can make all the money in the world, but they'll end up losing it, too.  So for me, it's the academics and it's the sports that I want people to become more actively involved in.
Story_ID: 648399
Speaker 1: Is there a (background noise) age when youth should start running distance, or is there any, any limit on--I mean is there any starting--recommended starting point?
Speaker 2: Well, by distance, I would--I see that most youth should easily be able to run two to three miles.  I personally would not recommend them even attempting a marathon until they are at least out of high school.  Because by then their bones have stopped growing and it's not going to have a potential negative effect.  They're still doing studies to try to figure out if there is indeed an impact.  But like I said, the average person should be able to run about three miles and be at thirty minutes or forty-five minutes.  And if they can do that, I think they could be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle their entire life, again without going on all the different medication.
Story_ID: 648400
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: That--that's a real interesting question to ask, because when I run, I think about my past and I ask myself, "If I had done this one thing differently what would be the repercussion on the rest of my life?"  It's like the--one of my favorite movies is 'The Butterfly Effect,' where--I don't know, have you seen the movie?  Okay, 'The Butterfly Effect' is about a gentleman who is able to go back in the past and make changes to the things that were going on in his life.  So he's sitting here, for example, today, looking at his personal relationships and he says, "Well let me go back in the past and let me make this one little change."  And then it fast forwards into the future and because he made that one change it had repercussions elsewhere in his life.  And when I run, I've truly thought about well what if I did this one little tweak.  What would have happened if I had not gotten kicked out of Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], if I had focused harder then.  And, the more I think about those things, the more I say, "You know what, I have no idea what the final impact would've been of me making that one little--one little change because all of my past failures, as well as successes put me here today."  And I'm happy with where I am today, and I'm looking forward to a brighter future, so I can't think of any one thing that I would've changed.  'Cause I don't know what affect it would've had years later.  I never would've met my wife Deborah [Deborah Valrie Reed], for example.  So I'm happy with the way things are.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's, there's nothing I can see changing.
Story_ID: 648401
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on everything, what today would you consider to be your major accomplishments, or your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would think it would be--when you say legacy I think about one of the things Bill Reed [ph.], our family historian said, is when he and I met, he said, "You know, you're the first person in the family that's ever run a marathon."  And so from the family tradit- from the family's side of the legacy, they would say, "This is, this is the marathon runner and the guy that ended up getting four degrees after getting kicked out of school [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri]."  For everyone else outside of my family, I think the legacy would be being the first black in the world to run marathons on all seven continents, being one of a handful of blacks who's run over 100 marathons, and fin- and founding or cofounding the National Black Marathoners' Association.  Because the association will live on, hopefully long after I pass away.  And one of the things we started doing within the organization is starting to acknowledge the achievements of black distance runners which is something that no other organization had been doing.  So we've now started acknowledging those achievements of people who have run Boston Marathon, who have run marathons in all fifty states.  I think that will be my legacy kind of to the rest of the world and to my family.  We've gotten a lot of family members now involved in distance running.  So with, Deborah [Reed's second wife, Deborah Valrie Reed] took up distance running at fifty-five and subsequently she encouraged her daughters, so now her three daughters run distance and one of them went over to France with us and ran the French Riviera Marathon.  So now she's looking at running marathons on all seven continents and that--that's Jaulik [Jaulik Watkins] who's looking at doing that.  And the other daughter, Jasmin [Jasmin Logan], ran track for FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  So she ran the sprints and made it to the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival].  Now she's looking at running marathons.  And then the other daughter, Janell [Janell Wells], has taken up distance running also.  So it's great when all of us get together and we're all able to go out for nine mile runs (laughter), which is great on Thanksgiving morning 'cause everyone would've worked up a nice appetite.
Story_ID: 648402
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed (laughter).  Okay, well tell--well, yeah, so that, now you have, you talk about your wife's daughters, I mean your--those are yours too, but now, but you have other children?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a son and daughter from my first marriage and they live here in the Dallas [Texas] area, that's Justin [Justin Reed] and Kristy [Kristen Reed].  And then Deborah [Deborah Valrie Reed] also has a son, Jordan [Jordan Foster], who is not a distance runner, for matter of fact, those three [Jaulik Watkins, Jasmin Logan and Janell Wells] are not distance runners.  I think with my kids, you know, they saw me getting up and running, I guess they say, "Ah that's dad's thing, we're not even going to try it."  So, but yeah so we have fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: And that's right, I have, yes I forgot all about our grandkids.  We have five grandchildren.  So hopefully they'll, maybe distance running will skip a generation and maybe they'll take it up next.
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Other than, is there anything you can think of--looking over here at my wife?
Speaker 1: (DEBORAH VALRIE REED):  There are the other books you've written.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (DEBORAH VALRIE REED):  (Unclear) project management (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of the, one of the books that I wrote that focused on business management is called 'Running to Leadership: What Finishing 100+ Marathons on All Seven Continents Teaches Us About Success' [Anthony Reed].  That's a book that I wrote where I talk about using the marathon running techniques and racing techniques in order to manage projects.  So that gets into again moving people outside of their comfort zone, motivating people, as well as how to go about managing people so that they will do outs- outstanding work.
Story_ID: 648403
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess I'd like to be remembered as a person who gave back to the community.  As a person who cares.  At my Aunt Ressie's [Ressie Reed] funeral, my father [Curtiss Reed, Sr.] remembered, the day before, he said he wanted me to speak for the family at her funeral.  And it gave me an opportunity to really reflect back on the conversations that Aunt Ressie and I had.  'Cause Aunt Ressie was the international traveler.  And I remember she always asked me three questions during our phone conversations, she wanted to know where I've been, what I was doing, and what I was going to give back to the community.  And it dawned on me that with her it's, it's about taking your experiences and using those experiences to encourage other people, to move outside of their communities and to grow.  And that's the--that's the legacy that she left behind.  And that's the same type of legacy that I'd like to leave behind, that I cared and that I tried to get people to move to a better place.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Story_ID: 648404
Speaker 1: Okay this is the photo from my very first marathon--this was the Cowtown Marathon on February 27th, 1982, and we are sprinting for the finish line.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay this photo was taken while I was a senior in college.  I had pledged the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity (background noise).  So this was, I was attending Webster University [St. Louis, Missouri] at the time and this is with the St. Louis City chapter [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: So which one is--you are?
Speaker 1: I'm down here.
Speaker 2: Right here?
Speaker 1: Yes that's me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is the logo for the National Black Marathoners' Association.  We made it in the form of a race number and the number 1865 is significant because that was the year of the--the 13th Amendment was adopted and slaves were free.  And as we like to say, after 1865 we were free to run (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's interesting, I like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is the graduation ceremony at John Burroughs high school [John Burroughs School, Ladue, Missouri].
Speaker 2: This is a photo in my senior yearbook, so that was taken when I was seventeen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is from my graduating class from Enright Middle School [St. Louis, Missouri] and I'm in the upper left hand corner.  And in the picture also is my teacher, Herbert E. Spain [Herbert Spain (ph.)] who is there on the left.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's Mr. Spain?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay this is my brother [Curtiss Reed, Jr.] and I.  My brother is the one in the Cub Scout uniform and this was taken in 1963 and this is when we started stamp collecting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Again, this is my brother and I.  I was around eighteen months old, my brother is the one holding the ball.
Speaker 2: This is my lovely wife Deborah [Deborah Valrie Reed] and I in Nice, France in 2011.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a photo of my father and his three sisters.  The, my father is Curtiss Reed, Sr.  The lady holding the handkerchief sitting next to him is my Aunt Ressie [Ressie Reed].  She was the family international traveler who inspired me.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a photo of me in the mid-'80s [1980s], mid to late '80s [1980s] and this was when I was participating in bicycling and running events.
Speaker 1: This is when I received my graduate degree, master's of science degree in accounting from University of Texas at Dallas [Dallas, Texas].  And I was also on the national accounting honor society [Beta Alpha Psi].
Speaker 2: This is the photo of me running the marathon in Australia on my fiftieth birthday in 2005.
Speaker 1: This is one of the group photos of the National Black Marathoners' Association up in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 2: This is a photo of me participating in the Great Wall of China marathon [Great Wall Marathon].
Speaker 1: This is a photo of me down in Antarctica in February 2007.
Speaker 2: This is me, I'm a--in a photo at the conclusion of the Fin del Mundo marathon [Marathon Fin del Mundo] down in Ushuaia, Argentina.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, stands for end of the world.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of the starting line at the Safaricom Lewa Marathon [Safaricom Marathon] in Kenya.  So all those students were going to be running the race.
Speaker 2: And this is a photo of me at the starting line of the marathon in Kenya.  And the artifacts, by the way, the running shirt that I'm wearing and other artifacts are with the Smithsonian institute [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Did those students actually run in the marathon, the ones on the picture?
Speaker 2: I believe they, they may have run the half marathon there.
Speaker 1: This is a family photo.  This was taken this past Thanksgiving.  So these are my wife--
Speaker 2: From left to right?
Speaker 1: --going from left to right, this is from starting on the left that is Jasmin Logan, that's Deborah's daughter and my bonus daughter.  Next to her is Janell--
Speaker 2: (DEBORAH VALRIE REED):  Wells.
Speaker 1: Janell Wells, that's Deborah's other daughter and her husband Walter Wells [ph.] who is in the [U.S.] military stationed there in Louisiana.  Then in the pink is my lovely wife Deborah, and then that's--I'm standing next to Deborah with the green NBMA jersey, and her daughter Jaulik who is also a marathoner and ran a marathon in France with us.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) for a second.  They curl so fast.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my mother [Jeannette Coleman] with her two brothers, from left to right with the large Afro, that's my Uncle Prince [Prince Coleman, Jr.], he was the motorcycle racer in the family.  Next to him is Uncle Herman [Herman Coleman], then my mother, and then my grandfather, Prince Coleman, Sr.
Speaker 2: Have to ask about them, or (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a--we like to say it's a historic photo of black distance runners.  From left to right with the blue jacket on is Rudy Smith.  He became the second black in the world to run marathons on all seven continents.  Then there is Charlotte Simmons-Foster who is the cofounder of the National Black Marathoners' Association.  Then there is Frederick Davis III who has run over 450 marathons and ultramarathons around the U.S.  Then the gentleman in the blue jacket behind him is Donald Arnold who's run thirty-seven marathons with a transplanted heart.  Then Angela Ivory who has run 303 marathons.  She was the--and ultra.  She was the first black woman to run marathons in all fifty states.  She also ran those marathons and ultras while she was undergoing chemo for breast cancer and later bone cancer which she ultimately died of.  And then of course, I'm standing next to Angela.  So between the six people in that photo, we've run over one thousand marathons.
Speaker 2: Now in this photo from left to right is Jaulik Watkins, then Deb- Jaulik Watkins is Deborah's daughter, then Deborah and myself, and this was at the conclusion of the French Riviera Marathon.  So Jaulik has decided that she wants to run marathons on all seven continents.  And we said if she does it, we'll go along with her for the ride.
Speaker 1: And, last one, the shadow box here.
Speaker 2: Okay, this shadow box has a copy of the certificate that I received for running marathons on all seven continents and the seven continents finisher's medal.  So there were only, at that time, 225 people in the world who had run marathons on all seven continents.
