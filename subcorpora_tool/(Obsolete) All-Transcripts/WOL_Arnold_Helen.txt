Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Today is January 9, 2008. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re conducting an oral  history project called    Women of the Oklahoma Legislature.    Today  I   m with Mrs. Helen Arnold in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She served in the  House from 1976 to 1982.  Right.  Thank you for joining me. Now let   s start by having you tell a little bit  about your childhood, where you were born, and then we   ll work our  way forward.  All right. I was born in Marysville, Kansas, which is a small town. We  always said it   s a small town south of Lincoln, Nebraska because it   s  just ten miles from the Nebraska line. My mother was born just right  outside Marysville. My grandfather homesteaded in that part of Kansas,  and so my mother was born there. My father was born in St. Joseph,  Missouri, but his grandfather and aunts   a couple of aunts lived in  Marysville also   so my mother met my father there. I am the oldest of  three children. I have two brothers younger than I am.  A little town   Marysville was about 3,500 people, so it   s a very small  town. I had a lot of freedom that a lot of people do not understand in  this day and age. Even in small towns they don   t have as much freedom,  I don   t think. We grew up doing the things that we liked to do, and we  never were told you can   t go out in the street or whatever. My  grandparents lived across the street from us most of the time, and they  had a vacant lot. We used to use that, the street and the vacant lot across  the street, to play ball or football or whatever we were up to as children.  I went to Lincoln School and that was built, I think, probably about ten  years before I went there. In the small town, we had two grade schools  5  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  and then we had a mixed eighth grade which was the grade when the  kids from the seventh grade of Lincoln School and the seventh grade of  Central School went to the eighth grade. They had three classrooms and  we had three or four teachers that kind of went   we didn   t move   we  stayed in the same classroom.  How many students would that have been?  My class was always eighteen girls and six boys.  Probably felt out-numbered?  They were, and that was what it was. We had people who would come in  and leave but not very many. This is during the    30   s and the  Depression. People would   if they had a job   stayed there, and if they  didn   t have a job, they   re probably staying there with relatives who   d  help them out. But anyway, I think that eighth grade ended up that we  had probably about twenty in the classroom.  Did the Dust Bowl reach that far up?  No, no. It was dry. They didn   t have as much rain as they usually had,  but the Dust Bowl didn   t come up. I remember when I was, I think,  about eleven   that would have been 1938, I think   why we were sent  home from school one day because they looked out and they saw this  greeny-red sky and they couldn   t figure out what was going on. Of  course, communication wasn   t anything like it is today and the sun was  kind of greeny and red around it, and all the air was like that. They sent  everybody home from school, and then we found out the next day that it  was a dust storm. So when I later lived in west Texas, I thought they  didn   t know what dust storms were. (Laughs) But anyway, it was small,  and my graduating class was   we had one-hundred-and-one seniors in  my graduating class from Marysville High School.  That   s a pretty good size.  And that, of course, included all the children who lived on farms around  within the school district, so we had ten or fifteen children that came in  to our high school. Then I grew up in a family that was like what I  would consider sort of political. There was always discussion at the  table. Now it didn   t include the kids, but there was always discussion  about who was doing what in Washington, D.C. or in Topeka or in  Marysville. I think that grew out of my father being very interested in  politics   was not a politician, to go out but my mother was. My  grandfather on my mother   s side was the mayor of our small town at one  time, and I had great-uncles that were in the county   like county  6  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  treasurer and county assessor. And so I was always around talking about  what should be done. I grew up and I   ve always had an interest in  government and in history.  Were those your favorite subjects in high school?  That and I loved math, but I never had anyone really explain math to me  until after I got out of college, you know what I mean? I could memorize  all these things, but they never told me what I was supposed to reason  the math. But, yes, my favorite subjects were history and government.  Were you in the Girl Scouts?  No. We had Girl Scouts, but my father was not much in favor of Girl  Scouts.  Where did you go to college?  I went to Kansas State University, which was fifty miles from home and  so their daughter was down there close. I had relatives that lived in  Manhattan so I couldn   t get in too much trouble. (Laughs)  Were you the first in the family to go to college?  Actually, my grandmother on my mother   s side of the family had gone  down to Friends University in Wichita. Her father was a Christian  church minister, and he moved down there with her so that she could get  two years of normal training so she could teach school if she wanted to.  Then my great-uncle, her brother, graduated from Kansas State.  Education was something that was encouraged then?  Well, it was and yet my mother did not get a high school education  because she had bad eyes. They said she was going blind and she should  not strain her eyes on finishing. And my father almost died of a ruptured  appendix. He was a junior in high school and they sent him to California  to recuperate with some aunts and he never finished high school either.  On my mother   s side of the family, only my aunt finished high school.  The boys didn   t think that was necessary. I don   t know why that  happened that way. My grandfather, his parents sent him to Galena,  Illinois, I believe it was, to work for a veterinarian so that he could get  his high school education. They had eleven children, and my great-grandmother  and grandfather and my grandfather, and all these boys and  girls, came down and homesteaded sixty acres down in Kansas.  Interesting.  7  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  And they owned a whole township. (Laughs)  How did you come to pick Kansas State, because it was so close?  Yes, that was why. And my father always thought that I   d probably go to  Nebraska. He worked for Beatrice Foods, and he thought that he would  get a transfer to Lincoln and then I   d go to the University of Nebraska  but that didn   t work out, and I loved it at Kansas State.  What was your major?  My major was history and government   political science.  You finally got to do it?  Yes, yes.  So then how did you come to be in Oklahoma?  Well, I married Maurice Arnold and he is from Marysville also. He had  been in the service and he came back. We lived across the street from  each other at Kansas State. I married him and he was a geophysicist and  went to work for what is now BP-Amoco. It was then Standolind Oil and  Gas. And we moved to Mississippi and then we moved to Texas and  then we moved to Colorado and then he was sent down to the lab at what  is now OU   s Schusterman Center.  Okay.  He worked out there for twenty years.  So you   ve been in Oklahoma since     We went out for lunch today, and we were talking about that. The first  place I ate was this place we went to lunch today in Tulsa and that was  forty-seven years ago.  And what   s the name of the place? You   re welcome to say.  Oh, Brownie   s Hamburgers, and it   s on about 22nd and Harvard.  And it   s still there?  And, Mo, he had moved down here. I was teaching school in Colorado,  so I said I would finish out the school year. He   d move down here in  January. I finished out the school year there but on Spring Break, I drove  8  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  down here. He had an apartment down here and he said,    Well, come  down and we   ll go out to Brownie   s and have hamburgers for supper.     So I got down here. I was late. I had put the directions on how to get to  his apartment in the trunk of the car. (Laughs) So I stopped, and I knew  the address. I stopped up at Peoria and 21st and I saw a policeman and  asked. He said,    You   re just a mile off.    (Laughs) Or two miles, I guess  it was.  That   s pretty good. You drove yourself from Colorado     Oh, yes. My mother always said I should have been born with wheels  because I   m always wanting to go. (Laughs)  You don   t think a second about it, just get in the car and go?  Right. So we moved here. He moved in January 1961, and I moved  down in May of 1961.  And when did you get married?  Oh, we got married in 1948.  Okay.  So we will be married sixty years this year.  It   s hard to believe in some ways, isn   t it?  Yes, yes. You don   t think about it. When I was looking through this  book and I thought,    Oh, things are so different now.    (Laughs) So we  moved to Tulsa in 1961. We   d been married thirteen years, moved  thirty-three times.  Oh, gosh. (Laughter)  And only moved three of those times   once a year, but anyway     And not just across the county   across state lines?  Yes, yes.  Almost like the military.  Yes, it was just about like military. (Laughs) The companies even  treated it kind of like military. The boss   s wife was your boss. (Laughs)  9  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  So you basically consider Oklahoma your     We consider that our home now. We have a place that we spend the  summer in Colorado, but we consider Oklahoma home.  So when you moved here, what did you do? Did you work?  I had a friend who was principal of the Madeleine School, a catholic  school, here which doesn   t exist anymore. They needed a math and  spelling teacher, so she said,    Helen, could you do that?    I said,    Well,  yes.    I   d taken a course in the new math (Laughs) and I taught that one  year, half a day. But then I didn   t do anything. I didn   t have a job or  anything. I did a lot of volunteer work and that kind of thing.  The ERA  Equal Rights Amendment  was very, very   in the 70   s. I had  been President of the League of Women Voters of Oklahoma, and we  had supported that and we couldn   t get my representative to vote for it.  He said nobody wanted it, yet we saw the stacks in favor. This many  against and this many for, and so I said,    I   m gonna run against him.     (Laughter) Then he didn   t do that. There was a vacant Senate seat and  our senator was gonna run for governor, so he didn   t run and it was a  vacant seat and I ran.  Did anyone run against you? In your first     Oh, yes. Yes, yes. I had two people in the primary.  Male, female?  One of each.  One of each.  One male, one female. And the male beat me by   I mean, he had   I  don   t know, three-hundred votes more than I had? But she had a lot     you know, we were all fairly close. I came in second, and everybody  said,    That   s a good thing. You   ll go up there and get all those votes for  those people who don   t like it because he beat her.    (Laughs)  Then I won the run-off primary and then I had a democrat who was     iffy   . He didn   t know whether he really wanted to run or not. A very  nice guy, I mean, nothing wrong with him at all. But he didn   t really  know how to just get out and campaign.  How did you campaign?  10  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  I campaigned by walking. I walked the whole district   knocked on  doors before the primary. I knocked on doors of republicans or if they  weren   t republicans I talked to them right then. I had a list that said these  people are registered at this house   republicans.  How   d you get that list?  That list was available at the election board.  And you knew enough to go do that. I   m just trying to figure out  strategies     Well, I thought I should. I don   t know if this is even a law anymore, but  you could get on the ballot by petition. If you had two-hundred people  who would sign your petition, you didn   t have to pay the  200 dollars     Okay.     but they had to be registered in your party. I thought,    Well, now how  am I gonna get that?    And so we went down. I don   t think we paid very  much for it, but we could get a list of all the registered voters in the  district. It may have been even that the Republican Party had a list of  just republicans. I went down and I went around. That   s when I first  started walking, and that   s why I   d go to the republicans to get them to. I  had the two-hundred signatures and when I got over to file down in  Oklahoma City, they said,    No, we don   t accept those anymore. We will  just right now tell you there are not enough valid signatures on it.  You   ve got to pay your  200 dollars.    So I did. (Laughs)  Didn   t question it.  Well, I questioned it. I had worked on petitions before and did know  enough about that to know that people don   t always tell you the truth  when they sign something, or if you ask them to sign and then they sign  it and you   d say,    Now you   re a republican?       Oh, yes. I   m a  Republican,    and you found out they weren   t even registered to vote.  Well, yes they were republicans all right. (Laughs) That   s how they felt,  so it was a good thing that they didn   t let me go through it and then  somebody challenge it.  That   s true.  And I   d have been ineligible to run.  So you had three elections-   76,    78 and    80?  11  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Let   s see      76 and    78 and        80?        80. Right.  Did they get easier each time?  No, no. I didn   t really have an election in    78. In    78, there was a move  in the conservative wing of the Republican Party to get rid of me. So  they recruited a person to run against me. The problem was she didn   t  move into the district six months before filing and so she was ineligible  to run. And she didn   t do her homework on that. (Laughs) Of course I   ll  have to give the League of Women Voters a lot of credit. I learned about  Oklahoma government through the League of Women Voters. I mean, I  was Voter Service Chairman here in Tulsa, and then I was president, and  then I was president of the state league. We did a lot of studying of  election laws and a lot of getting out information to the voters, see, and  you learn a lot doing that. And it was not partisan but you learned a lot  about what you were expected to do in these things, or where to get the  information about them also.  Did you live there or live here when session was in?  I had an apartment in Oklahoma City that I lived in on Monday, Tuesday  and Wednesday nights. (Laughs) I just couldn   t see living in a hotel  room three nights so I had an apartment. If you had something you had  to do, why you could always, you had the apartment there. In fact, I even  let a friend or two   one friend whose daughter was over there being  treated, medical problems at Children   s Hospital over there, and she  stayed over there even, I think, when maybe we were out of session. She  stayed over there a week in the apartment. I wasn   t there.  I think it would be a long commute and it   s time you could use other  ways     Well, yes, it wasn   t that bad driving back and forth. I wouldn   t do it  every day, but I drove over on Monday morning and came back on  Thursday afternoon.  According to my notes, you   ve served with quite a few other women     Dorothy Conaghan and Cleta Deatherage Mitchell?  Oh, Cleta Deatherage.  Helen Cole, Joan Hastings, Penny Williams. What about Alene?  12  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Alene Baker. I served with Alene and there were eight of us at one time.  That was what I was thinking about   Alene and Penny and Joan.  And all three of those are from this area of the state, too, right?  Yes, they were all from   let   s see, maybe there were only six of us. I  guess there were only six, not eight.  Six women?  From Tulsa County.  From Tulsa, not from the whole state     Oh, no. But we didn   t have a lot    Hannah Atkins and Cleta Deatherage  and Dorothy Conaghan and Helen Cole   when I was there. There were  not as many from Oklahoma County as there were, but then they kind of  were in and out, too. I was trying to think of one young lady who served  one term with us, and she was from Oklahoma County.  That may have been Judy Swinton?  Yes, that   s who it was. There were other women that had served in the  legislature before we did, but     Well, in that time period was it difficult being one of the few women  serving?  I always used to laugh. There were two or three guys who just thought  women ought not to be there at all, you know. And when you   re over at  the Capitol, on one side is the House parking and on the other side is  Senate parking. You had a parking spot over here on the House side and  I would get there, I   d be coming in in the morning. And there were three  guys   and I won   t mention their names   but they just didn   t think we  ought to be there at all and I   d see them ahead of me and I   d quick get  up behind them so I   d get on the elevator with them. Then I   d say,     Good morning,    and they   d all,    Good morning.    (Laughs) And then I  thought they   ve got to learn that there   s a place for women in this House  (Laughs) and they don   t need to just be grumpy old men.  You all got elected the same.  Just like they did. (Laughs) Well, maybe not quite like they did.  (Laughs) I think men campaign differently than women do.  Really?  13  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Yes.  What do you think they do differently? Don   t knock on as many doors?  I don   t think so. No. I think they depend on their connections.  Could be.  They   ve got these friends and they   ll tell ten other men,    Vote for me.     Women, they have the connections and women will, and at the time I  was there, women thought twice before they got involved in politics  because, you know, that wasn   t just the right thing to do. Now the young  women, that was okay, but women my age   middle-aged women didn   t.  They   d never been involved in politics before. Although my connections  with my volunteer work, I did have that network of people. But I think  men do depend on just network of business people and that they will get  them elected. Women get out and work at it. (Laughs)  Wow, and from what I can gather, women had to work harder at getting  funded. Money to     Oh, yes. Yes.     campaign harder than men had to.  Yes. My experience was, with me was that once your family got  involved, then your friends got involved and then it was easier getting  money. We weren   t used to getting money in hundreds or thousands of  dollars or anything like that. My first campaign contribution I got for  Christmas, a treasure chest, a tin thing that my nieces and nephews and  their friends had bought and taken up a collection. There was  43 dollars  in it (Laughs) and I just thought that was wonderful that they would send  me that money to run for office. (Laughs)  Did you keep the chest?  Yes, I   ve still got the chest. (Laughs)  Sentimental things. Well, let   s back up.  Yes.  On election night, do you remember much about that night?  Election night? For the primary, well we had people   I was still  walking, all day on election day, walking different neighborhoods. Then  14  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  people were calling right behind me to say,    We would like for you to  go out and vote for Helen Arnold.    Then we had pizza and Coke or  Pepsi or whatever it was, something to drink, at the election  headquarters waiting for the returns. We had people who went out to all  precincts and got the election returns so we knew we had not won, but  come in second in the primary but that we had enough votes that they  had to have a run-off primary. We did the same thing when they had the  run-off primary.  And then your swearing-in day?  Yes, we took a bus (Laughs)   all my supporters   and we went over  there, kids and everybody who came with their parents down to the  headquarters and had done some little thing or went out and passed out  brochures someplace, and so we took a bus. We had forty-seven people  who went on the bus with us for the swearing-in and we had a good  time.  Sure. Well, do you remember the first time you presented a bill on the  floor?  I think that I only had one bill that I was the author of. I suppose it   s the  same way now, republicans are in charge and democrats don   t get any  rights to put their name on bills. Then democrats didn   t let republicans  have their name as the author of a bill. If they liked the bill, why  somebody else got their name on it. (Laughs)  That doesn   t seem quite fair, does it?  Oh, well, it wasn   t, but then, if you want to get something done, why  you don   t have to be the author particularly, I mean, the chief author.  Sure.  And a lot of times if you had an idea, you went to a democrat and asked  them to do it because it had a better chance of passing, if that   s what you  wanted to do. But my one bill was a nurse midwife bill. Two women  came over and started lobbying me about having nurse midwives, which  are nurses who work with doctors to have the birthing. They do most of  the dietary and all of this stuff. They even are there when the baby   s  born and doctors are off someplace else on call. (Laughs) And I met two  young women that I just admired a lot. There   s a school for nurse  midwives and you can get your degree from there, but every so many  years you have to have attended or been midwife for somebody. And  these young women went to Guatemala to get their number of births that  they needed, and they wanted to have the right to do that in Oklahoma.  15  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  There were other places, but then you had to be associated with a doctor  and you couldn   t do that in Oklahoma at the time.  So how hard was that to get passed?  Really it wasn   t very hard at all. Steve Wolfe was a senator from here,  and his wife   s sister was a nurse midwife in Florida. He was interested  in this bill so between the two of us, why we got the bill passed, and we  were both republican so it was a miracle, probably. (Laughs) I   ll tell  you what my secretary over at the Capitol used to say      Helen is the  amendment queen of the legislature.    That   s the way I found that I could  change legislation or I could get what I wanted then was just to write  amendments on the floor.  Sure.  And quite a few of those passed and so there   s always a way if there   s a  will. (Laughs)  Did you have the same assistant the entire time you were there?  Same secretary? Yes, I had the same secretary the entire time I was  there.  So your office was in the same spot the entire time?  Yes, it was, and they had a republican hallway at that time. Republicans  were down the north hallway off of the legislative chamber after the  House chamber and we were on the fourth floor. I used to laugh. When I  got my assignment for where I was gonna have my office, it said, I think  it was 405-1/2. (Laughs) I thought,    Oh, my, I   m gonna be back in a  closet someplace.    (Laughs) I don   t know why that room happened to  get a half on it. (Laughs) But anyway, I was fortunate that I had good  officemates, not that I agreed with them. One of them was from here   Tulsa  and one was from Bartlesville. We had the same secretary all the  time over there, but no assistants.  In those days you had to read as many bills as they seem to read now?  Had to read them all.  Stacks and stacks.  Yes, read them all. It takes you awhile to find out what you have to read  in them. A bill will just have a change in the bill, and I was reading the  whole bill for a long time. Then I found out well, that dark printing is all  16  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  I had to read because that   s what they   re changing in this legislation.  Nobody tells you those things.  Didn   t have someone tell you the shortcuts?  No, no, no, no, no. (Laughs) They just want the freshmen to make fools  of themselves. (Laughs)  Well, did they have a    Mouth of the House    back then, too? Whoever  talked the most as a freshman they   d call the    Mouth of the House?     Yes. I shared that honor with Cleta Deatherage.  Did you?  Yes. (Laughs)  I didn   t know that.  Right. My name   s on that plaque. (Laughs) That   s what you get for  asking questions or making amendments or doing things. I don   t know  why they had two women that year, but Cleta and I shared that.  I need to see what percentage of women, versus men, gets that award.  Yes, I don   t know. I haven   t seen it yet. Go ahead and look at that.  Just a curiosity.  I haven   t seen it for quite awhile. I just know no one over there anymore  so     When was the last time you were in the Capitol?  Oh, in the Capitol? I was over there three years ago. I went over to a  HAVA  Help America Vote Act  meeting, I think that   s what it was  called. It   s about voting   I   m trying to think of what those initials stand  for   but it   s where they were gonna buy voting machines for everybody  to have   the federal government trying to sort of, I think, equalize  voting rights, everyplace.  When I walk in the doors, I try to imagine what some of you must have  felt back in the 70   s or even earlier, what it must have been like to walk  those halls. You get goose bumps just thinking of that.  Well, it was a very exciting experience.  17  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Especially during the ERA. That was a lot of debate when you were  there. The debate was in the early 70   s, right? And you came in    76?  Yes.  It had already     Well, it was still there but everybody had changed their position. The  first debate we went over there, I remember the League went over and  testified for the ERA, and Spearman   have you heard of him? He was  from Edmond, and he was just adamantly against the ERA. After we  testified, he changed his mind. But at the same time, Jim Inhofe was for  the ERA and when they got ready for the first vote, he changed his  mind. There was no rhyme or reason. It was just sort of like somebody  got to them. I mean, some person they knew said,    Oh, this is a bad idea.  Forget it.    Or,    This is a good idea. You ought to change your mind.     (Laughs)  Politics.  It was an exciting time because the first committee assignments I got  were   they gave me Education. All women were on the Education  Committee. Then I was on Public Safety and Penal Affairs Committee,  and I was on City/County Government. I   ve forgotten what the other one  was. That way I had four committee assignments. But they put women  on the City/County Government because the guy who ran it just hated  women in that, and he was so mean to all of us. He   d never let us ask a  question at the committee meeting. He   d never let us ask if we could  amend it, you know   nothing. You just sat there. (Laughs) And I don   t  know if he ever   I never did figure out whether he ever changed his  mind about women or not, but he just did not like     Were there other chairs like that?  No, no, but like Public Safety and Penal Affairs   that one was run by  David Riggs. He was the chair of that and he was very fair and very  good to work with. I   d known him quite a while, since I   d been in  Tulsa   not known him intimately or anything, but knew who he was  and he knew who I was and that kind of thing. But what was revealing  about that was the senator who was the head of that committee, he was,     Lock them up and throw away the key.    He   d been that way for years  and years and years. He was from Sapulpa and after two years, he  decided that that was not the way. We were getting so many prisoners  and no place to put them. And so he   John Young was his name, and I  just admired him for that because he listened and heard and saw what  was going on around the country about locking up everybody who   d  18  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  done any minor infraction of any law, almost. So he changed his mind  and started working with trying to rehabilitate people.  That   s about the time the Rehabilitation Services Office was probably  started.  Yes, it was, it was. And I think that he could see why we shouldn   t just  be throwing away all these young men and women that we were  incarcerating and just lock them up and leave them there until the  sentence was through.  You didn   t get to pick your committees?  That   s right. That Speaker assigned you to them. Now I think after the  first two years, then I think you were given an opportunity to say if  you   d like to be on a committee or not   I mean, maybe not all the  committees, but one committee you   d particularly like to be on.  Rank them or something? If you could choose one, which one would it  be type of thing?  Yes, yes, yes   and then, depending on if the Speaker liked you or didn   t  like you or thought he could work with you or didn   t think he could  work with you   whether you got that assignment or not.  Well,   Mouth of the House    might have had something to say.  (Laughter)  Bill Willis was the Speaker, and then Dan  Draper , a guy from  Stillwater   he was Speaker and I think both of them were fairly fair,  you know. Bill Willis was a little more old-fashioned.  Well, one of the other was Monks?  John Monks? He was from Muskogee. Well, I don   t know what you say  about John. I think his main thing was he was a super patriot. He  belonged to the National Guard, and he went off for two weeks for the  war games. He was against the ERA even though his wife said if he  didn   t vote for it she was gonna kick him out of the house, I heard. I  heard that   that may not be true, (Laughs)  Do you recall anything specific about Alene Baker?  Alene Baker was just a wonderful woman. She was a   or a person I  guess I really should say. I shouldn   t qualify that as woman   she was a  wonderful person. She was very interested in people, and she was very  19  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  interested in libraries and education and that kind of thing. She lived in  Turley, up north here. Her husband had a garage. She had a son who was  the Fire Chief in Tulsa and, I   m not sure, I think he was in the legislature  but   no, was it city council after he retired. But Alene just did lots of  things for lots of people and she was a very, very conscientious  representative for I guess what we   d call north Tulsa, but Turley. And  she just became a friend, just right away. We had a lot in common.  She   d grown up in a little town and she was a wonderful, wonderful  woman.  When you were both out of the House, did you stay in touch some?  Oh, yes. Yes. You always would see   you   d see House members and  people you have some connection through something you   re doing,  probably always.  You don   t just forget them when you walk out the door.  Oh, no. No, no, no, no. In fact, I saw Cleta in Washington, D.C. one time  when we were all up at the Capitol. That was about thirteen, fourteen  years ago I guess, dedicating a women   s exhibit up there.  After you got out of the House, what did you do next?  Well, I got out of the House and I went down to some function  downtown and Rodger Randle was there and he looked at me and he  said,    Helen, would you like to be a tag agent?    (Laughs) And I said,     I   ll have to think about that one.    It was when there was a big scandal  over one of the state senators   maybe it was an ex-senator by then   no,  I think he was still a state senator. His wife had a tag agency, and there  was a big   about how she spent the money. She didn   t do anything  illegal, but they didn   t like it because she owned all this equipment and  all that that she could sell to the next tag agent if she wasn   t the tag  agent any longer, you know.  There   s always those people who want to make some big deal out of it.  So I thought it over and I went over to the Capitol and I said   that was  about a year and a half, I guess, after I   and so I said,    Well, Rodger  what do you expect of me?    Rodger and I had been friends for a long  time, and he said,    Well, I expect that you and I will not have a public  outing of our differences.    (Laughs) I said,    By that, you mean I won   t  say anything bad about you and you won   t say anything bad about me?     And he said,    Right.    He said,    I just don   t think we need to air any  differences we have by calling the press.    I said,    Well, that   s how I felt  about it,    so he had me appointed a tag agent and so that   s what I did.  20  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  How long?  Well, let   s see, that was 1984. Then when Henry Bellmon ran for  governor in    86, I went to him and said,    I want to be on the Tax  Commission.    After I   d been a tag agent for awhile, I said,    I want to be  on the Tax Commission.    He said,    Helen, they   ll never put a republican  on the Tax Commission,    and so I said,    Okay.    I said,    I talked to  David Riggs, he   s my,    I think he was my senator then   they changed  the district a little after that   and said that he said that he would support  my appointment, and that was the end of it, you know. After Henry  Bellmon got elected governor, I guess it was Linda  Sponsler  who  called me and said,    Helen, the Governor would like to talk to you,    and  that was in January, I guess it was the week before he was inaugurated.  So he asked me to come on his cabinet and be the Director of the Office  of Public Affairs, which is the Department of Central Services now.  You would have been in your late fifties then?  I was.  So you did that until you retired?  I was just   let   s see, the next year I was sixty, and so     And how long did you get to do that then?  Well, until he   he didn   t run the next time, and so I did that three and a  half years. It was interesting, but, whew, is it hard.  Really?  I mean, oh, it   s hard. Especially if you have a republican governor and  you have a House and Senate that are democrat, and you have all of  these bureaucrats, and I was one of them, that were always   well, I want  you to get the governor to appoint me   I mean a democrat   and I  wasn   t one of those then. (Laughs) They all are over there trying to get  appointed to better jobs and things, particularly when the Senate has to  confirm them, and so it   s really hard to know what   s going on, and that  was a big, big job.  There are lots and lots of people in the Office of Public Affairs because  they ran all the state office buildings. They ran the State Capitol. They  ran the motor pool. They ran everything so you had employees all over  the state. You didn   t know who was doing what. One reason was  because you never got to appoint anybody except just the people in the  office. Everybody else had to have their job and it was by the  21  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  legislatures. That was a very, very big job, and it   s much better if you  have republicans doing republicans and democrats doing democrats. If  you   re a democrat, get rid of all the republicans or republicans get rid of  all the democrats. Then you   ve got cohesion and people doing what you  think needs to be done.  Did you have to live in Oklahoma City when you did that?  I had an apartment in Oklahoma City. Like Mo said, he would come  over if I needed a date (Laughs) but I would go over either Sunday night  or Monday morning to Oklahoma City and spend the week there and  come back on Friday.  And you did that for three years?  I did that for three and a half years, yeah. Well, it wasn   t too bad. We  don   t have any children so we didn   t have any family conflicts. He could  come anytime and     He had to learn to cook for himself?  Yeah. (Laughs)  Open a can of beans.  Yeah. (Laughs) TV dinner. (Laughs) Sometimes I   d do some cooking on  the weekends so he could   and then he loves Colorado, and so he spent  summers in Colorado.  What did he do for his career?  Oh, geophysicist. He retired in 1980 so     Before you started     Before I went over to the Capitol, yes. So he could come over there  anytime he wanted to, and did a lot. Sometimes we   d spend the weekend  over there rather than in Tulsa.  If you had to pick out one memory of that time period, can you do it?  When you were serving in the House     When I think of serving in the legislature, I remember when Frank  Shurden kept introducing this bill to castrate all sex offenders     Okay. (Laughs)  22  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold     and so one day Hannah Atkins came to me and said,    Helen, Cleta  and I are going to present Frank Shurden a sword so he can castrate all.     So we did, on the House floor. She had this sword, all this fancy,  cardboard sword (Laughs) presented to Frank. He was good, good   I  mean, it was all done in fun.  I guess you have to have some light moments because there   s a lot of  serious ones     Yes, yes. I think also about the death by injection, and that was passed  the first session. I think David Riggs and I were the ones who voted  against it, I   m not sure. I know that Bill Wiseman and I talked about it  and I   m against the death penalty and he said,    But this would be much  more humane than the way they   re doing it now with the electric chair  and having everybody there. Families having to go through that, you  know,    but anyway, I think that I voted against that. It wasn   t because I  was for electrocuting but it was because I   m not for the death penalty,  period. I never really had to do anything about that because there was  never a bill to eliminate the death penalty in Oklahoma. (Laughs)  Some states are beginning to do that though.  Yes. Yes, because they know they   ve got a lot of innocent people on  death row. I don   t think    Project Innocence    has gotten to Oklahoma  yet. When the governors change their mind, I think, is when they find  out that people are given the death penalty for no reason, but maybe  their color or their sex or whatever.  As far as serious, I don   t think that I ever felt that we really  accomplished a great deal as far as something that really stands out in  my mind in the legislature. I mean, it   s sort of a day-to-day, you just do  this job and you read the bills and you try to find out what they really are  meaning by them and that kind of thing. But I think one of the best  things that happened while I was in the governor   s cabinet was when  they passed the education bill, 1019. They talk about it all the time now,  but it   s been fifteen years since it was passed, almost   more than that, I  guess      90, so it   s eighteen years.  Has it been amended and amended since then?  Oh, I think so, although I don   t think that the part of it that let public  school teachers be really well-qualified to teach and compensating them,  supposedly, for that. But I don   t think the part about giving them the  opportunity for in-service training and further education and that kind of  thing   I don   t think that   s been amended much.  23  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  If a woman came up to you and asked for your advice whether she  should run for public office, what would you tell her?  I   d say,    Go for it.    (Laughs) I think that women need to look at, and  I   m sure men do this   I think anybody who   s gonna run really needs to  look at where do you live? What are the demographics? What is your  party? What is your philosophy? And know your constituency before  you get into that. I mean, if you think,    Well, I   d like to be in the  legislature,    then I think you need to look, maybe two years ahead of  time, and look at where would I fit best? Who would I represent? What  area would I represent the best? And I didn   t do that, but I did know that  I was in a republican district and I was a republican. But I just think that  if more women don   t run, then we can   t change anything. I mean women  need to be part of this. They need to be at least half of this democracy  (Laughs) or this republic. There were only eleven when we were there. I  mean, that was the highest number when I was there.  The most at any one time that I have figured out was twenty-four.  There were twenty-four at one time?  And that   s nowhere near half.  Oh, no. No, no. But I just think we   ve   women have got to learn to take  more risks than they   re taking, and they need to do it with intelligence. I  mean, not that they have to be smart. I mean they need to be smart  politically. That   s why I said I think they all have to look at where they  are living. I never would have beat the guy that was the incumbent if  he   d have run. I lucked out on that (Laughs)  I don   t know if it was luck.  Sure, a lot of that is, but also you have to go at it realistically.  What are your thoughts on the term limits?  I think it   s a big, big mistake. They   ve got them other places, the term  limits, and it   s just a big error. They have no institutional memory   six  years of institutional memory of, what is it, twelve for Senate   six for  the House, is it? Or is it twelve for the House, too?  I think it   s twelve for the House, too.  I disagreed with Governor Bellmon when he proposed that or even liked  it when somebody else proposed it, and I said,    No.    I said,    You may  think that it   ll eventually   why you   ll get a lot of republicans in there,  24  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  but I don   t think they   re gonna be the republicans you would want to be  in there.     You just learn it and then you leave     That   s right. Well, you could have some good years, but then why not  use all of this   I mean, why not. Seems to me that if people want to  serve and have done well serving, then let them. Why force them out?  The voters can take care of it     That   s right   that   s what I think. I think every place but the big cities  know that. They would like to keep their representatives, big cities. So  maybe we ought to have some kind of law that says only the Tulsa and  Oklahoma City (Laughs)   only those cities of 300,000 or more  (Laughs)   well, their legislators will have term limits. (Laughs)  Any thoughts on running again?  No, no. I did run one other time for City Commission here, for the  Finance Commissioner, and I got beat by a republican in a republican  primary. Since then, I just really haven   t had any   I could not do what I  think most republicans do now, and that is absolutely,    I don   t care if  you   re the governor and you   re a crook, I will vote the way the governor  tells me to vote,    or,    I will vote the way the party tells me to vote  regardless.    I just don   t think most people are really that loyal. If they   re  smart, they aren   t. They take the best of everything they can get.  (Laughs) So I just feel I wouldn   t be comfortable with that.  Are you involved in anything that   s political at the moment?  No.  Do you do any volunteer work or     Just shout at the TV (Laughs) and all these primaries and everything that  all the people are saying and not saying. What bothers me is, see, I can   t  stand those media people who are interpreting every vote, every vote  and everything and anybody that says anything.  The exit polls are not good.  Oh, I think the people are lying to them is what I think. That   s why those  exit polls are like they are, come out of there,    Who did you vote for?        Oh, I voted for       and they think of the worst one. (Laughs)  25  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  I hadn   t thought of that.  I think that   s what they were finding out about polling people before the  election, saying,    Who are you gonna vote for?    I think that   s an error.  That   s just like,    Who did you vote for?    I mean coming out of the exit  poll.    Well, it   s not any of your business who I voted for. You   ll find  that out when I find it out (Laughs) if I won or didn   t win.    (Laughs)  Is there anything you want to add before I ask my last one?  No, I do want to say about women running that it   s a wonderful  experience. You do have to have your family   s backing. I mean, you  have to have at least them not being against you doing this thing. I think  you do, unless you   re ready to get a divorce or something. (Laughs)  There   s no experience like a political experience. I think that people just  have to just get out there and take that risk, particularly women, because  they need to. If we   ve got twenty-four women, that   s twice as many as  were in when I was in there at the highest level   and that means in the  next thirty-five years, we ought to have fifty women out of the one-hundred-  and-one. (Laughs)  We should. They   ll have to figure out child care and other things maybe  to get more women to run.  Well, that   s about like saying child care and things to get more women  to go to work. I mean, if you have to work, well you figure out a way.  And if you have the desire to be in politics, figure out a way. I mean, and  I would be for them having a school or a nursery or whatever at the  Capitol. I   m not against that (Laughs) where women could drop off their  children and     The same thing could be said about men who run     Yeah, they could drop off their children, too.  It doesn   t seem to be a deciding factor for them when it comes time to  decide to run or not.  And I think that   s   you   ll have to forgive me if I don   t think of those  things because I didn   t grow up in the era where   that men might take  that responsibility. I believe they should, but I didn   t grow up (Laughs)  in an era when they     Women   s work.  I thought by now they would have, but we   ve gone backwards as far as  26  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  Arnold  Finchum  I   m concerned.  In a lot of ways, we have.  And one thing   they   ve used women to lower men   s wages, I think.  Instead of raising them.  Instead of raising women   s wages, why they   ve used women to fill in  those jobs so they don   t have to pay men more.  Could be.  And so I think that was a backwards step (Laughs) but I don   t know how  you do any of that   reconcile any of the things that go on that cause  families not to have enough money to live, to eat and have shelter,  become homeless. You think you   ve solved it and then somebody comes  up with some other grand scheme that     Every eight years, it changes?  Well, yes. Yes, yes. Or maybe every four, (Laughs) who knows?  Okay. Well, my last question then is   when history is written about you,  what would you like for it to say?  I would like for it to say that I was a thoughtful legislator and that I did  not hesitate to ask questions.  Okay. Sounds good to me. Well, thank you very much for sharing your  story.  Yes. Thank you.  It   s been fun and a pleasure.  --- ---
