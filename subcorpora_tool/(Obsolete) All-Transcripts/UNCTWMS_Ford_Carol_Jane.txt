Evangeline Mee: Ok, this is Evangeline Mee, and I am here with Carol Ford in Clinton, Tennessee, on May 30, 2012.   Carol Ford: Hi.  EM: Hi! [Laughter]. So can we, I guess, start back to the very beginning? And can you talk about where you&#8217;re from and your childhood and things like that?  CF: I am from Kalamazoo, Michigan. But I moved from living with my folks to living with my aunt and uncle in Florida. And then back with my folks and stuff like that. So I&#8217;ve moved around all over the place since then. And Tennessee is where I have stayed the longest and doing. And what else would you like to know?  EM: Well, I guess, how long did you live in Kalamazoo, and when did you move?
CF: I was about thirteen. Thirteen when I went to live with my aunt and uncle. And that was okay with me because it was going to be warm down there. And--.   EM: Why did you go to move with them?  CF: I didn&#8217;t know what was happening to me! My older sister--. I have an older sister: one five years older, one five years younger. And the one that was five years older was in the military. And my cousin, the son of my aunt and uncle, was getting married in Mobile, Alabama. So she got me on a bus to come to be at her base in Illinois. And from there we went to Mobile. And when that was done, we went on down to Florida, to Lakeland, Florida. And I didn&#8217;t know it was all set up by other people--my aunts and my mom and my dad and my sister--for me to live with them. And I just wasn&#8217;t going home! I didn&#8217;t know I wasn&#8217;t going home!  EM: They didn&#8217;t tell you?  CF: No! It was a done deal. But it was good because my aunt taught me a lot of things. And it was very much a learning experience. Then when I went back to Michigan and my folks jobs was tough then too. So my mom and dad asked me about Florida, and I said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; [Laughter]. So we did! But we didn&#8217;t go to Lakeland; we went to Fort Lauderdale! And that&#8217;s where I grew up the rest of the way and went to high school and finished there before getting married and all that kind of stuff.   I know in some of the things we&#8217;ve done in the organization to see what made us want to do some things is like--. I didn&#8217;t have an issue so much when I joined SOCM [Save Our Cumberland Mountains], but I had been, you know, had things happen to me where I was the one kid in high school that went out and sold the most candy bars [laughter] to support the choir. And things like that. Those things somehow in the end become important. Because I wound up in finance in SOCM for a long time. I was treasurer in the finance things. And followed right after Betty Anderson who, you know, they put her in before she ever knew what she was doing, they had elected her as treasurer to the board. And then when it come around the next time, &#8220;Well, Carol, you can do it!&#8221; She said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a vote, and we&#8217;ll have a couple other people there and just a name up there.&#8221; But then the other people didn&#8217;t really do it that wanted to be on there, so they backed out and it was just me. So it just--. And it&#8217;s just one of those things where I kept watching and reading at the office what they were doing and seeing that they were good. And I went by my faith that says to do justly and have mercy and to walk tenderly with their God. And I thought, &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re doing justly and they&#8217;re not mean about anything. And they&#8217;re trying to do good. So as long as it&#8217;s not hurting anybody, I can do some things.&#8221; And I went ahead.   But even before that, I really had gone to SOCM itself because I had been in vocational school there in Jacksboro. And when I went to work on my job, there was a lot of things going on that I was not prepared for. You know, the thievery and the stuff--the mine--the illegal stuff with things. And I went back to my teacher, and I told her what was going on. And I said, &#8220;What do I do about this stuff?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Go see SOCM. And talk to them.&#8221; So I went over to their office. It was all these hippie-like kids, sprawled out all over the floor. And they were all doing different things, and I think they was even putting together their newspaper. And everybody had different things they were working on. But they were fun. And then Peggy Matthews, she says, &#8220;Well, come talk to me a minute. What do you think about this?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; And next thing I know, she&#8217;s said, &#8220;Well, okay. Let&#8217;s go do this that day.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, okay.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t see a reason to say no. Didn&#8217;t really want to say yes. But she had me out going to different businesses soliciting for fundraising. And she said, &#8220;Now this is how we do it.&#8221; She taught me by experience how to do this.   And then there was others. And it was more like I was doing what they said. &#8220;Oh, we can do this.&#8221; &#8220;Okay.&#8221; &#8220;And you can do this and this and this is how you do it.&#8221; &#8220;Okay.&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t have the sense of how it was really happening until they sent me to a workshop, and I was sponsored by CORA [Commission on Religion in Appalachia]. Do you know who that is? It was Church On Regional something. And they would give grants to different groups like ours. And help with trainings and stuff. And so they sponsored my training, and they sent me and a staff person--who would&#8217;ve just been hired by SOCM--to this training thing. And I didn&#8217;t know what that was about either. They said, &#8220;Well, Carol, you&#8217;re the only one who&#8217;s not working, so you can represent us.&#8221; And I thought, &#8220;Well, okay.&#8221; And I went for a week&#8217;s training.  And we went up there, and it was with a Midwest Academy out of Chicago. And they taught us a lot, but they gave us all the nuts and bolts. They would teach us things, and then they would give us a living--. We&#8217;d have to role-play. And that&#8217;s where I met Ron Cherry. And he&#8217;s passed by now. But he was a black man who was very insightful to people and knew their inner person more than we did ourselves. And I had never role-played in my life. Didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. And he said, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to role-play.&#8221; And he looks right at me, and he says, &#8220;You&#8217;re first!&#8221; [Laughter] I was like terrorized! He says, &#8220;What do you mean? You look at me like you know everything, but you&#8217;re a mouse!&#8221; And he had it right! But he went on, and he taught so many people that week. Their inner person and how to overcome our weaknesses and to stand up and do what was right. And I think he had chosen me because of something he saw in me, but I was just really thrilled with the whole week. And Don Barter was the staff person from SOCM who was just newly hired, and he went with me. And we just learned so many things. And we didn&#8217;t just role-play; there was some of it we really got in to. And we carried it on for the whole day. We shocked--. We wanted to keep going with the role to be the winners, but we went--. We had our times there where we just relaxed, but Ron would be talking to the different ones. And he was from Virginia Organizing Project. But he was also in this other thing with Saicon, which is another organization over small groups. I was trying to thing of the name of that but I can&#8217;t remember right now. But SOCM would know. And I met Terry Kalahar and a lot of the staff and stuff from other organizations. Terry Kalahar from up in Kentucky, for the Commonwealth it was then. And the other one who took over as a staff person after the other one left. Oh, gosh, I&#8217;m forgetting names.   EM: It&#8217;s a lot of names. Lot&#8217;s of organizations!  CF: Yes. There were different organizations from all over. I mean, there were some from Virginia, some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina, and South Carolina. It was just a marvelous thing! And I really got on a&#8211;. Working with these different groups and stuff, I got to know a lot of staff people and other members from other groups. So later on when we needed somebody to do something for us, I said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we call up Terry Kalahar from Kentucky? He likes to do that! He carries his guitar case, and he&#8217;s got all kinds of stuff in there, and he likes to sing. And he gets everybody involved.&#8221; He was fantastic, and he was always overworking himself. Working all hours. And I was always telling him, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to take time for yourself.&#8221; And his father was a judge. So he would bring--. Everybody brought something to what was happening. And I met a gal form the Tennessee Hunger Coalition, and so I was telling Maureen O&#8217;Connell -- we didn&#8217;t have what we call a director. But she was the longest staff person there, the longest. So she kind of did that role on the quiet. She didn&#8217;t want to be; it just happened. And so I tell her; I said, &#8220;You know, I met this person at Tennessee Hunger Coalition.&#8221; Then I&#8217;d tell her about the JONAH people. And, oh gosh. There&#8217;s just so many. But it was just such a wonderful experience, but it gave me the nuts and bolts of organizing. And that was important in how it wasn&#8217;t--. Not to be afraid of what you were doing; don&#8217;t be intimidated because sometimes acting like you&#8217;re a baboon or something is enough to make those people stop and listen. Some one had actually done that at some meeting somewhere. We would never really think to do something like that because that&#8217;s not a Southern thing.   EM: Did you feel like, like you said that&#8217;s not a Southern thing, did you feel like you would claim to be a Southerner since you lived in Florida or would you count Michigan--.  CF: I came to Florida when I was thirteen, and I was at the bus stop. The kids that were there they said, &#8220;Quit calling us &#8216;guys&#8217;! Quit talking like that!&#8221; She said, &#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to say &#8216;ya&#8217;ll!&#8217;&#8221; So, and I was just gradually picking up an accent anyway from living in the South. And even today, my sister says, &#8220;Well,&#8221; she says, &#8220;If I get you back with us for a while, you&#8217;d get to talking like us again. And you&#8217;d talk to one of them on the phone, and you&#8217;re right back to talking like a hillbilly!&#8221; [Laughter] I don&#8217;t think so at all.   EM: So what did your family think of you getting involved in this kind of activism when you were in college?  CF: Well, I was never in college.   EM: Oh ok, oh you went to--.   CF: Midwest Academy was a group from Chicago that taught in organizing. And we even had one on &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Money in the World?&#8221; and who has it and where does the United States stack up in that. And I was amazed to find that Shell Oil and BP were the number two, one and two, and they&#8217;re out of England. That&#8217;s where the wealth is. And it&#8217;s just like I was seeing and waking up to there&#8217;s a lot of these people who have all this money who are not into obeying the laws of a country because they have so much more than a country. And that was really evident when BP had that oil spill. They didn&#8217;t toe the mark on anything.   EM: So that kind of got the wheels turning and that&#8217;s kind of what made you start?  CF: Yeah, and I saw where--. That&#8217;s where we were looking at the banking and seeing the red line banking where people were being blocked out of getting loans and stuff. And when they&#8217;re supposed to be in the community and some of their laws or rules are that they have to do so much for the people where they are present. And they weren&#8217;t, so they would challenge them and make them do that. And that was good. That was good. But, I don&#8217;t know where to go from here for a minute.   EM: When you went to SOCM that first day, where you intending to join the group or become a part of it? Or were you just--?  CF: I went for help! Which they really didn&#8217;t help me! [Laughter]  EM: And what did you want help for?  CF: I was working for a coalmine in the office for Triple I Coal. And the men were being cheated out their pay! And I knew it because there were documents that they had to attend this training by OSM and stuff like that, but they were never paid. And because I was doing the paychecks, I knew it! So I was asking [SOCM], &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Well, you have to go to the office of surface mining,&#8221; which was up in Jellico, I was working out of Newcomb at the time, &#8220;And get copies of their rules of how that should be. And we&#8217;ll go from there.&#8221; Well, the only thing I could do when I did that was go back and show that to some of the guys who were working there. And I didn&#8217;t have very much access to doing that because the guys, most of them worked out there in the mountains at the pits, but I had the guy who was the mechanic and stuff that I knew. And I showed him. So they knew. So they didn&#8217;t ever get their money. But Triple I paid in flat tires [laughter]. And those were big tires on those trucks. And so they were about three hundred dollar tires, and they got a lot of them were just &#8211; had nails and stuff in them.   EM: And the miners would do that?    CF: The workers &#8211; yeah! They&#8217;d get back at those company! They didn&#8217;t care! They weren&#8217;t going to get their money; well, they weren&#8217;t going to keep theirs either!   EM: Did you see a lot of that kind of stuff happening? That kind of on the ground retaliation when they found out that they weren&#8217;t getting paid?  [Recorder is turned off and then back on]    EM: Ok, we were talking about how the coalminers reacted when you told them about the paychecks that they weren&#8217;t getting.   CF: They took it into their own hands in the way that they could deal with it. And they--. I had heard that the one who the secretary before I worked there--. That she got involved with helping the workers too, and that&#8217;s why she was fired. And so I had to be safe on my own side, but on theirs too. And through SOCM, I met some of the people who were &#8211; the guy who was the director of OSM. And he came and spoke for SOCM sometimes, and he talked to me because I didn&#8217;t know what I could do, and he says &#8211; or how to --. Because I had done things, or gone to the point where I could have gone to court against them. And had the proof of what they were doing. And in fact, I gave the proof to office of surface mining; I think it was, to where they was doing the wild-catting and stuff like that. And even where they was getting coal and it was documented on checks and stuff of what they were doing. And that&#8217;s the way they wanted it! And I didn&#8217;t--. They wanted it written on checks when they was dealing with somebody. So it could have gone that way, but when it came down, I knew what they would do. I&#8217;d already  heard the stories about how they&#8217;d burn out people and things like that. And so I was a little bit leery.  So there was one guy that would always come up there complaining, and he would say, &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to go tell them I&#8217;ll quit.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No,&#8221; I says, &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to do that then just go ahead let them tell you you&#8217;re fired.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because then you don&#8217;t quit. You can go and get your unemployment that way, if they fire you.&#8221; So there did come a time when they said, &#8220;Well, you can go ahead and quit!&#8221; And I says, &#8220;No, unless you fire me, I&#8217;ll be here Monday morning.&#8221; So then he called me and Sunday night he says, &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t need to bother coming back in.&#8221; [Laughter].   EM: So how did they find out that you were telling the workers?  CF: I don&#8217;t know if they did. But I knew that I had choices I had to make, and I talked with the guy from OSM. And from what I had told them and showed them and given them proof of, they went back into the office and seized a lot of their records because I told them where to look and what it was. And I was already gone. And I was told; they says, &#8220;Carol&#8217;s done this!&#8221; [Laughter]. Because it was just so laid out for them. And so when I left there, it just worked out on a personal level that it was right during the time when there was going to be the World&#8217;s Fair and stuff like that. So we were moving &#8211; we were living in one place &#8211; and the lady says, &#8220;Well, you have to leave because I have to have this house for my children. For my daughter and her family.&#8221; So I says, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So then it was just like I moved three or four times, and I think that was God protecting me, I think, from being burned out. Because didn&#8217;t nobody know where I was. And I just kept it that way.   But then SOCM always knew where I was. And they always came, and I didn&#8217;t have a ride, so they always come and picked me up and take me to meetings and everything. And &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this; let&#8217;s do that.&#8221; And maybe it was in &#8217;83, &#8217;84 when I became president. I&#8217;m not even sure anymore. But--. I was just--. We had already made a rule to let there only be two times you could be in office and then you had to turn it over. That was to keep the freshness to the thing. And then I got them to say, &#8220;Hey, well, let&#8217;s just not elect somebody, let&#8217;s put it where--.&#8221; We asked people if they would serve. And we&#8217;d go through and pick out the ones we thought would make good presidents or were available and good. Because a lot of them were really super-duper people. And really go leadership because SOCM teaches leadership. And it sure did for me. I&#8217;d never had to get up and make a speech before SOCM [laughter]. But we did.   EM: So once they asked you to become president, why did you decide to accept it?  CF: Well, I was on the personnel committee and was supposed this thing. I said, &#8220;Well, hey, this is beyond my reach!&#8221; I says, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do this by myself.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll help you, Carol.&#8221; I says, &#8220;Is that a promise?&#8221; &#8220;Yes! We&#8217;ll help you!&#8221; So it was a--. And again, I felt like it was one of those times, and everyone else was working. And Carol had a [30:30] job out there. I&#8217;m a homebody for the moment. So, I did it. And because I don&#8217;t always understand things like really well, then I got myself into the position of being on every committee that we had, which was seven at the time. Just so I would understand and know what was really happening and could be there, a part of it. Not really--. The strip-mining committee, I was never really a good person there, but I--. They had all these nice, good thinkers: Annetta Watson, Bill, and them. This was a regular thing for them. And they knew what they were doing.   And the first year that I was on SOCM&#8217;s board, I was so intimidated by these people. They&#8217;re supposed to be just average people, but here&#8217;s Raymond Weaver, the president. He&#8217;s going over there to the legislative things and telling them things, and he&#8217;s writing to these people. He&#8217;s telling stories, and &#8220;Pheww! I could never do that!&#8221; [Laughter]. But we&#8217;re all gone through things where we went because we could with the group going over to the legislature. And we would go from room to room, and we would meet with these representatives. And we would all have training, you know: &#8220;When they start looking at their watch, that means they&#8217;re wanting to get you out of there.&#8221; Just different things. But we&#8217;d also learn how to talk to them. And, boy, they would have to listen. And I saw that work with--. We had, then we had, TVEC in Knoxville that was for the energy and worked--. The Tennessee [Valley] Energy Coalition. And they worked trying to monitor TVA. And all the stuff that goes on with that. And they had gotten &#8211; they went out &#8211; and they had gotten a good eight thousand people to sign up to vote. So when I was over there at the legislative thing, and then I didn&#8217;t know who he was &#8211; just this big man. But the guy that was walking beside him, he stopped, and he said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to talk to her! She&#8217;s the one--.&#8221; Not to me, there was another gal that was then president, I think, of TVEC or a worker with them one. And he said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to talk to her; she&#8217;s from that TVEC! They&#8217;ve got eight thousand voters registered!&#8221; He stopped in his tracks, turned around, and came back and had a whole conversation with her. So that showed me the power. And getting these guys to pay attention and to work it. And when he got to be governor; that&#8217;s another thing.   But it was all these groups working together over there because it wasn&#8217;t just a day for SOCM to go for the legislative; it was all the other groups went too. Legislative day. And we all were going in to talk to different legislatives from all the different counties. And some of them were just downright crooked! And there was one lady from down in Memphis way; she says, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to vote for that! That&#8217;ll take money out of my pocket!&#8221; She says, &#8220;You can forget that!&#8221; So it was just--. They were serving their own self. And seeing who listened to what, and I knew that Campbell County because I had lived there.   And had this one guy that was a representative who was just for the coal companies. And even Randy McNalley, our senator over here that lives in Oak Ridge at the time. I went with different ones to talk to him in his home about what he represented and what to do and what our concerns were and what he could do about it. He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do anything. Get yourself a lawyer! That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re for!&#8221; Even though we had the law that was supposed to protect us, he was saying &#8220;so what.&#8221; And but the only thing he&#8217;s good for anymore is about medical stuff. He&#8217;ll stick up for that because that&#8217;s his business.   EM: Did that really give a sense of urgency to your grassroots organizing &#8211; that the politicians weren&#8217;t doing anything?  CF: Yes. And because up in Fentress County there was some kind of a turn around that they--. You know, there was one up there that was always voting against them, and they got up and they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got this many members, and we&#8217;ve got the power. You do what we say. You listen to what we say.&#8221; And it finally did with him. And there was Ray County. The people there found that their representative got them nothing. The other things other counties automatically get as gratuities for their county; he didn&#8217;t even ask for. He was just going over there and filling a seat and get the money for the job. But he was not getting anything for his people. So that stirred up that.   But during all that time too, we was fighting--. New York wanted to come in and use Dutch Valley. As a place to &#8211; there&#8217;s a beautiful valley just up there by Lake City going to Oliver Springs &#8211; they wanted to use that to dump garbage. For that to be their hub from coming from al different places to bring their garbage. And we fought it to a standstill to where they didn&#8217;t do it. But it was people having courage to stand up and say, &#8220; No, you&#8217;re not doing it.&#8221; And working together. And there were times, over there where we worked, in Roane County where they were having problems over there with a company &#8211; it&#8217;s still over there &#8211; that&#8217;s having all this pollution come down on the people. But we worked together with black people. That was our first thing in the county &#8211; or in SOCM &#8211; of having more than just white. And we really loved it. And it&#8217;s a shame it didn&#8217;t get to go on to more. Well, it did in different directions because now we have different groups that&#8217;re black.   But even going back to the legislative things; we&#8217;d have to get up an do skits for all the people there. And that was something; I had to role-play in that one [laughter]. And I did it; I learned! But we were there with JONAH, and JONAH was a primarily a black organization in Jackson, Tennessee. Over in that area they had two or three counties over there several places, but we came together with them so we could have power going in to meet these representatives and saying, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re working together. Our organizations are working together, and you better listen to us.&#8221; And I think maybe they did. In fact at one point, folks from JONAH also became part of Southern Empowerment. And while I was president, like I was saying before, we were just in--. We were going on into the third year. Facing the third year where we couldn&#8217;t find anyone to hire that was trained in how to organize &#8211; that we wouldn&#8217;t have to start from scratch. And we were too low down in staff to have them to take their time to teach somebody. We needed somebody that was on the ground running and knew what to do. So a group of the organizers from several of the organizations &#8211; TVEC was one. There were seven of them: Kentucky for the Commonwealth, SOCM, Tennessee Hunger Coalition, and something from North Carolina &#8211; over there in--. I can&#8217;t remember all of them. But they came together--. John Wiencek &#8211; you&#8217;ve probably heard that name? He was a good organizer. And they got together and decided that we needed something to where we could train our own group of people. And we hired June Roston as our director. We got in the committees and stuff, and I was in the committee that was hiring staff and the finance stuff. And we went through. There was different people; we were determined that the person who was going to be our director was going to listen to us and not try to tell us what to do. And so that&#8217;s how we got June because the other ones that applied seemed to think that they already knew what to do, and that they could tell us how it should be done. We already had staff people as advisors if we wanted them. But we knew what needed to be done. And June was just so tremendously sweet and thorough. And when it came to school, she was a drill sergeant. And we hired Walter.   EM: Could you talk about what made you want to star the Southern Empowerment fund and the story there? What ya&#8217;ll did?  CF: We were doing this, and I went to the first meeting where they invited actual members of the organizations to come and be a part of it, to see about it. And I was the only one form SOCM who--. And I was already on seven committees for my own organization. And I said, &#8220;I want to do this because this is something that has to be done.&#8221; Because I saw it because of working with finance and with -- personnel committees were my favorites. And we had started one of those groups where we wanted to look for jobs for people. Be able to employ people. So I saw the need and really realized that we had to do something. And we had Connie White. Oh, I&#8217;ve never seen anybody who could sit down and just write a whole plan of anything. But she had had some college I guess and &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t. And she was super smart, and she&#8217;d get with those people and we&#8217;d write out our ideas for what we knew we wanted as part of the curriculum. How we wanted these people to know the difference between organizing the way we wanted them organizing and organizing to be a goody two shoes. Some people do that. I don&#8217;t know the words to say. You know, someone who works for &#8211; having them be a service to other people. We were going to be a working group to work on problems, and we needed that. So we met and we interviewed every person who came to apply. We had their resumes. Not just their resumes. Then we had interviews with them. And sometimes that would weed out a lot.   That was something too. Because I can remember; we had a group of us! And I wasn&#8217;t the only person there! And this guy, he was &#8211; and I recognized him. He was really applying for SOCM, as a staff person for SOCM. But he was not--. He was a person who loved to debate. And whatever was said, he was going to take the other side no matter what. I&#8217;d already met and dealt with people like that before. And when he came to interview, and I saw what was happening, I don&#8217;t know how we got to where the person who was over the meeting--. I was not the person asking the questions or nothing. I just was sort of just--. We had that chair for the meeting, and he was sort of asking the questions for all of us, but we had already said the things that we wanted to know. So then he says, &#8220;Okay. We need to reassess for a while, and you can go out for a while so we can talk.&#8221; So when they did, I told them what I thought of him. So when he come back in, they start asking him some more pointed questions, and they could see what I was saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s you! You did this!&#8221; And he come up out of his chair and was coming over after me. And boy, they grabbed him and sat him back down [laughter]! Whoa. But they still had the training because SOC--we thought--because SOCM said, &#8220;This is our representative we want trained!&#8221; And I knew right then that he was not going to make it. But some of them, there was one sweet organizer there. She said, &#8220;Aw, he&#8217;ll make it. He&#8217;ll come out of it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nope. You&#8217;re going to have trouble with him. You watch him. You can&#8217;t start training him if you want to, but he is not going to make it. He&#8217;s in to control, and he&#8217;ll control you by different stuff!&#8221; and I marked off what they [49:21]. Within the week, June calls me and says, &#8220;He is so bad! [Laughter].&#8221; That they had to call SOCM to see what to do with him.   EM: So what do you think makes a good community organizer? What are the qualities that they needed?  CF: Oh gosh, very first thing is to listen [pause]. And someone who would teach us and encourage us and bring out the leadership within the people. But take a back seat when it comes to doing stuff that we didn&#8217;t really want them to speak up, unless we had trouble ourselves and needed somebody to articulate what we knew. But by the time it came to speak and they would know. And, I don&#8217;t know. The same things we learned when we was up there at that--. Learning the nuts and bolts ourselves is what I saw: they have to be able to take apart a community and see what&#8217;s happening in that community and how things can work together and some good things to do. And not just to do it for themselves. They can because they can start their own organization that way. But they could also be teaching the people how to do that: to see who was aligned with them, who they&#8217;re up against, and all the different steps to make it work. They&#8217;re about five different things.   EM: When you served a president of SOCM, what were some of the successes and what were some of the hard parts when you were president?  CF: Well, we was having a hard time with the coal mining--. Strip mining was bad. We were trying to protect water. Like I said before, I didn&#8217;t always work so good on the issues because I didn&#8217;t have my own issue, but I supported everybody else who had the issues. But I was into finance, so I was on the fundraising committee. I was on the finance committee. I was on the other--. Those were my &#8211; and the personnel committees. And those were three of seven that I really enjoyed and could get things dovetailed together [pause]. I forget some of the things. Throw me another question.  EM: [Laughter] Well, I guess, when I was talking to Kate Bradley yesterday, she mentioned how--. She just mentioned how strong a force the women were in SOCM.  CF: Yes.   EM: And I am just interested to hear your perspective on that and why that was.  CF: We had some great women leaders. We had Betty Anderson. She was there from the beginning, and she was &#8211; I hope she&#8217;s still alive &#8211; but she was into a nursing home because her kidneys failed. And she had to be on dialysis. And she read every piece of mail, everything, every--. We had to go through all of these reports from the staff of what they had accomplished during the quarter that we just covered and what their goals were for the next little bit. And how they had set timelines, but she was more up on that. She could remember more than I could. But she was great at--. She had been a president too. And Linda Smotherman. And then even Connie White. And Connie and Mo [Maureen O&#8217;Connell] were like this. They were just really--. They worked together well. And Mo was trying to teach her, and--.  EM: What about, I mean, what about--. Why women? Why did they stand out over the men in the organization?  CF: Mostly because we were homebodies or whatever, and we--! A wonderful friend of mine, Melissa Smitty up in Campbell County in LaFollette, she used to live up in Habersham. She was having problems: they started mining across the street from her, and she says, &#8220;These guys are carrying guns!&#8221; And she had just had a brand new well put in, and she was just going to protect that well from whatever they were doing. So she came to SOCM, and SOCM was showing her what to do. Even took her to a water school on testing the water and taught her how. First time she ever went on a bus trip. First plane trip was with SOCM. And she was just a little country gal. But she stood up. Her husband worked at a rock quarry thing and at the little school they had in Habersham. And she did what she had to do to protect her well and her family. And she backed them down. And there&#8217;s other women who&#8217;ve had to do the same thing. There&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve seen pictures where her house and her property is up on top of a mountain and the rest of the mountain is just eaten away where they strip mined it.    EM: So you think the were just trying to protect their homes?  CF: Yes! Their families, their homes, and they were the one home to do it! Very brave women. And sometimes if the men are off working, trying to do their best, that leaves you. And SOCM was there to take that and teach people what and how to do. Sometimes we had men in there too! That&#8217;s how I met Steve Schaub [pause].   Gosh. It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s what we were talking earlier about having a group, and we can tell about each other better than we can tell about our self. There was somebody that came to talk to us last--. So they had Connie White, and Russell Smitty, and me, and I could talk about both of them, and they could talk about me. Stuff that I&#8217;d already forgotten. That&#8217;s done!  EM: What was some of your favorite parts about working with SOCM?  CF: I always loved the people. There were a lot of issues, but I met a lot of people. And especially in the fundraising, when you have a little seven year-old who gets pledges from people, and he walks that ten miles so SOCM can have that money: I thought that was a very big thing. And Betty walked it to, and she could hardly walk! And they was ready to say, &#8220;Hey, Betty, we&#8217;ll con it for you, just--. We&#8217;ll even give you a ride!&#8221; She says, &#8220;No! I got to walk this!&#8221; And she did it, but I was part of the ones that had to go and ask for donations for prizes and stuff. And we had a book about what we were doing and stuff and our sponsors and stuff. And we sold pages and stuff and put the book together. But it was getting those pledges and donations and stuff from everybody.   Going with Peg Matthews. She said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well you&#8217;re going to have to show me how to do this!&#8221; Because at first, I&#8217;d be very tongue caught; I&#8217;d be frozen. I couldn&#8217;t say a word! I was so scared, intimidated. And she kept doing it, and finally I really still couldn&#8217;t do it in front of her. She says, &#8220;Boy, you&#8217;ve just got to go do it!&#8221; So I did. But it&#8217;s--. But she taught me too that the fundraising events that we would have--. And I was there for a long time, I was the chair person of that committee. Chairpersons on committees are very important. And they have the role of drawing out everybody and make sure every body speaks or has a say. And that no other person on the committee drowns out somebody else. And we were taught that when we had our yearly retreat. And those were good too. [Interruption]. Say to me again.  EM: The question I asked before?  CF: Yeah.  EM: What were some of your favorite parts of working with SOCM?  CF: Meeting the people, becoming friends with them, and seeing outside my community. Because when you&#8217;re just in your own back door, you don&#8217;t really see what&#8217;s going on. But when you get involved and you&#8217;re going to these meetings that are maybe in your community maybe they&#8217;re over in Crossville, but it&#8217;s everybody coming together. And there for a long time we had our SOCM meetings, or board meetings were in Rockwood at the library, and we met people &#8211; just that in itself was empowering because you&#8217;re meeting people outside your community, you&#8217;re hearing what their problems are, and you&#8217;re deciding how much staff you got and how much time can go to the different issues. You&#8217;re voting on which issues we really want to work on and how much time can go to that. And you have to be aware that everybody needs that time.   There was staff that worked beyond their, you know--they&#8217;re off the clock just to make something happen. Don Barger worked with the people down Bledsoe, stopping the mining and stuff. It&#8217;s the first time I knew about orange water.   EM: What was that?  CF: And the went to the--. And sometimes I could only, because I didn&#8217;t know, I would be one of the ones who would go, or was going to trial, and they was having the judge say something about something &#8211; I would be one of the ones who would go and sit and fill up the courthouse just so they would know that we had people. And I saw them bring samples, and this one came in with a whole bottle. And she poured out some glasses of orange water and set it in front of different ones on panels and set it in front of the judge. She says, &#8220;Would you like a drink? This is our water.&#8221; [Laughter] And it&#8217;s poison water because when it turns orange there&#8217;s a oxide or something that goes on in the water and it&#8217;s poisonous. And that&#8217;s all they had up on their mountain. And they needed water, and nobody was willing to give it to them. And nobody was willing to stop the coal mining that was causing the poison water. So we fought that down. That was people working together and understanding other people&#8217;s problems. And sometime because I was president then, I would go to other people&#8217;s chapters, meetings, just so I could meet the people and hear what they were working on and what they were doing. So just it wasn&#8217;t in the chapter report or staff report, it was something I could hear and knew. It was great. It was great.   EM: Why do you think that community organizing was so successful for SOCM or for the issue of coal mining?  CF: Because they worked with the people and listened to the people. And they helped them find solutions. The staff people kind of do the nitty-gritty of looking up laws or stuff like that and what can be done, and then they do the--. Sometimes the people themselves do that, but mostly staff do that. And then they work together. And it&#8217;s a good thing. I was trying to remember what we were working on here in Anderson County, but I forget.   EM: I actually I had a question &#8211; this is kind of off the track of what we were talking about &#8211; but something came up about how there was a real sense among the people that lived in the communities of it not being an environmentalist movement? Because they didn&#8217;t consider themselves environmentalists.  CF: That&#8217;s it! Maybe as a person of your own you can be an environmentalist. But coming together and working: you weren&#8217;t working as an environmentalist; you were working on a local community problem. And those things just turned out to be clean water not polluting or the coal. You know, they working on getting higher rails on the coal trucks so the coal wouldn&#8217;t fly off. We got that passed okay, but then they just fill up the trucks higher, and it didn&#8217;t solve the problem. So, gosh, it was--. Say the question again?  EM: Why were the people hesitant &#8211; they didn&#8217;t want to be called environmentalists?  CF: That&#8217;s because we didn&#8217;t always work on environmental problems. We working on what the community voted on what was the issue they wanted to see changed. And it could be a lot of things, like Melissa Smitty [laughter]. I told you about her and the coal mining across the road from her, but she also, one year--. It was a very small community and Campbell County is a very small county, and her husband was working at the school part time too, cleaning it up. But her boys were going to school there. And one year they didn&#8217;t have several teachers, and it was just the kids having to take care of themselves! And she says, &#8220;Oh, no.&#8221; And she really organized the people in her community to make sure that there was somebody in with those kids, and then she and the people went down and tackled the county commissioners and say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have teachers.&#8221; And she worked and got the people to work, encouraged them to work, until they got teachers. And I thought &#8211;see that was not environmentalist. That was down right working for a problem. And they won.   EM: Well, do you have--. That&#8217;s been a wonderful interview. Do you have anything else that you can think that I didn&#8217;t ask about that you&#8217;d want to add?  CF: That--. I also got the chance [cough] to go to Highlander. Highlander is where they have supported and helped people to learn about organizing also. And but it give them a place to meet. And they came into fame, first by Martin Luther King and were called communists because they came to that communist school, which was just teaching organizing and helping people stand up for their rights. And by getting outside my community, I was going there with SOCM. When I went there with SEP, Southern Empowerment Project, we sometimes held meetings there. And sometimes it was coming together not just statewide counties but then regional members from different organizations. And then you would even meet other people. There was one time we were there: we met a man who was there with a representative from our government to talk. But he was a part of Apartheid. And he had been brought out of Africa to save his life, and I had a really--. We sat at the same table and I had a good discussion with him. And there&#8217;s other people I met there, but--. And you had access to learn about others who had gone before. And the guy that made Highlander happen. And gosh I can&#8217;t even remember his name right this minute. But I met a lot of them and get them to come to some of SOCM&#8217;s fundraisers. And they were always really gracious to us volunteers. And very curious about who we were and what we were doing. And I was just as curious about them. Kentucky for the Commonwealth person was Joe Szakos. And he was a wonderful man. And he was one of SEP&#8217;s founders &#8211; organizers, founders. And he oversaw that things were going well.   And it was--. Highlander, it just has a special place in my heart because it reaches out and touches so many people, and they had to struggle so much through the coal mining to help other people. Do you know their history?  EM: A little bit. A little bit, yeah.   CF: Well, they struggled to take food into the people who were working in the mines up in Kentucky or wherever. To get them food for their families and stuff because some of those companies would &#8211; it&#8217;s almost like slavery. And they were trying to get that all changed, and it was a--. Sometimes it came down to fights &#8211; physical fights. And I can remember going to their 50th Anniversary and hearing the song. You know, I&#8217;ve been to hear Woody Guthrie? And I&#8217;ve gone to hear the ones that was always living out there at Highlander that played the dulcimer and the stuff. Now his son does it for the Heartland series on TV. Guy and Candy with the music. And I&#8217;ve heard some--. And I&#8217;ve gone on trips to &#8211; another Catholic organization that took us to Minnesota up there where they had a Catholic college, and they had this big churches on the front of all these cards &#8211; Christmas cards. But we all met there, and they had the native--. A woman there who had no more than a third grade education. Who came up out of the fields. Who got up and was the main spokesperson for the whole week that we were there. That to me was empowering to see somebody come from nothing and could speak so eloquently. And to meet all these different peoples who were there to learn and take back to their part of the United States what was going on and what to do. Man, it&#8217;s so empowering just to get outside and to connect. There were beautiful, beautiful people out there. And--. I guess it&#8217;s like some people go to church, well&#8212;[laughter]. That&#8217;s the way of it. Sometimes getting out and meeting these people and standing shoulder to shoulder with them is how we really met the JONAH folks from over in West Tennessee. We took our big banner quilt up to that place in Minnesota. Maureen O&#8217;Connell was taking her mother on vacation, so we were going to fly up, and she was going to meet our plane and take us to the meetings. So she told everybody that we made her drive up there, and that we flew up there. And then she just picked us up from the airport to bring us there [laughter]. It was so funny. But we had--. Everybody had something that they had of their own representing their own organization. And ours was a quilt that had SOCM and our banner. We knew that JONAH was going to be there from--. Maureen told us; she says, &#8220;They&#8217;re mostly black people,&#8221; but she says, &#8220;They&#8217;re just like us and they work on the same kind of things.&#8221; So that was enough said. And so we decided that we had to get together with them. So we went and found them, and they didn&#8217;t have a banner. So we took their--. They had their pins though for their organization, so I said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have those, some of those, and we&#8217;ll put them on our banner. And we&#8217;ll represent us both!&#8221; And that&#8217;s what we did. And that thought that was wonderful! And then we got &#8211; years later when we was there, we got mutual coming together had. And we learned about black people have this thing of &#8220;We got your back&#8221; [laughter]. And just a whole lot of stuff, and we went on to do--. We&#8217;d have a meeting a couple times a year where we&#8217;d work on projects together, and we&#8217;d meet mid-place and come up with who&#8217;s doing what and how we did. SOCM &#8211; and I guess others do too &#8211; you&#8217;d have this work plan of what you&#8217;re going to do, but then you&#8217;d have your time of evaluating what you&#8217;ve done and how you did it. And you&#8217;re very honest with it. And we&#8217;d always done that, so that&#8217;s a good way of teaching people how to do it in their own personal lives. I didn&#8217;t know anything about having plans and planning out what you were going to do! [Laughter] I was just being a momma and taking care--making sure that my kids get grown and graduated school! But I did a lot more.   [Break, recorder off. Second track.]  CF: And I was very concerned for the children and eventually we did have a youth movement to include the youth in what was happening in SOCM. And my daughter went to camp at Highlander with people from all over the Southern states. And it really helped her, and my daughter always went with me, if it could be, to the fundraising committees. And there was lots of times that she&#8217;d tell me after we got home, &#8220;Well, so-and-so could&#8217;ve done this, or you could&#8217;ve done this.&#8221; And she would really tell me. I said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak up and say these tings when we&#8217;re there?&#8221; Because she really was organized in her thoughts about what should be happening.   And one thing about all of this is that we learned is that nobody wants to go to committee meetings where things aren&#8217;t done quickly and get out of there and go home. So we really schooled ourselves in SOCM to how to have committees that were chaired, and we got the work done, had a good time, had maybe a bite to eat, and we went home. And we all--. There was Mike Hodge &#8211; Hodges from down in Bledsoe County. He was the president after me. He took up the bandwagon because I was always after, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do something for the youth.&#8221; And he got the ball rolling, &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s got to be done.&#8221; Because he had children too. And I don&#8217;t know whatever happened with all of that, but I know that we had a lot of youth involved. And we had a lot of teachers in SOCM that really worked with youth and taught a lot of stuff about how to make things happen and to pay attention to what was going on around you. My daughter is still organizing stuff where she lives. And she&#8217;s organizing Boy Scouts! [Laughter] And she&#8217;s been--as a woman--has been made an official person for the Boy Scouts [laughter]. One of their leaders. Because she takes her son there. Her youngest son. But she really does organize and gets frustrated a lot because people just don&#8217;t pay attention when they&#8217;re working. And she wants to organize everybody where she works [laughter].   But my older son, he has done that too. He worked for SOCM for a little while. Now he&#8217;s into--. He&#8217;s a safety man for radiation. And I know he does a better job because of SOCM in knowing consequences. But I worry about all that radiation too and he says, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll be okay, mom.&#8221;  EM: It&#8217;s really interesting; the Bradley&#8217;s were talking about how their kids didn&#8217;t want to have anything to do with organizing because of how they were kind of sick of it because their parents did so much.  CF: Yeah.  EM: So it&#8217;s interesting to see that your kids kind of still were interested.   CF: They went through that part. But then they come back into it because--. I think they get frustrated because they were seeing the problems, but they weren&#8217;t seeing solutions for themselves. So--. And I think that happens for a lot of people. That&#8217;s probably the best thing for getting help.   EM: Well, thank you so much. I&#8217;m going to switch this off now.
