Speaker 1: From her start as a [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham dancer to her role in numerous Broadway productions, she went on to worldwide acclaim.  She has distinguished herself in film, theater, cabaret, music and on television.  She has made an indelible mark on pop culture in the role of Catwoman in the TV hit series, 'Batman.'  The HistoryMakers, the nation's largest African American video oral history archive is proud to present 'An Evening With Eartha Kitt.'  And now to our host, veteran PBS-TV journalist, [HistoryMaker] Ms. Gwen Ifill.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: I am so excited and so thrilled to be here tonight because of the star who you are about to meet.  It is very exciting.  She is a star of Broadway.  She's a star of dance.  She's a star of movies and of television.  I mean she was born to be Catwoman, right?
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter and applause).
Speaker 1: She has a mean growl, and she is [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  Let's take a look.
Speaker 2: (Film clip of Eartha Kitt).
Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, my honor to present to you, Ms. Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: All right, everybody, settle down, especially, you, missy.  I couldn't do that so don't get excited.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you.  But I have to tell you, after watching what you just pulled walking out here, how do you do this?
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I think it's because I want to.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter and applause).
Speaker 1: You see, but there are a lot of things I want to do (laughter), and I can't quite do it the way you can.
Speaker 2: Well, you have to prepare yourself to do the things that you really want to do, as you know.  And if you want to do that kind of thing, such as keeping yourself in shape, you know.
Speaker 1: No (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: And even though I'm, I want to tell you all that I'm eighty-one years old.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: Thank you.  (Laughter) And I'm very happy to have shared every one of those years on the path that I have been on.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is what eighty-one is supposed to look like, people.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: What keeps you going?
Speaker 1: The desire to keep going.  And I think that desire gives me the strength to want to go on, and therefore, I try to keep myself as prepared as much as possible, to be able to do that, by taking exercises, eating the right kind of food and thinking the right kind of thoughts, and keeping negative people out of my life.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Story_ID: 578313
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: You did not come to this, born to the manner.  You grew up in the South.  You lived--
Speaker 1: No, I never grew up in the South.
Speaker 2: You didn't?
Speaker 1: No, I was born there, and they brought me--well, it's very complicated because it has made me feel inside that the complication was that I thought one person was my mother who gave me away, and she kept giving me away because she wanted to marry a man who had already four or five children.  He was a black man, and she--he had said to her, and I heard these words through the cracks of the wall as my so-called mother was on her knees on the floor begging him to take me.  And he said, "No, I don't want that yellow gal in my house.  She will disturb the rest of my children."  He--
Speaker 2: Just to be clear, "yellow gal" meant biracial.  That was what they--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --meant at the time.
Speaker 1: Yes, and so that's when she gave me away and started giving me away.  Well, she was giving me away before to anybody who would accept me, but this was the last time that she gave me away.  And it was because he didn't want me.
Speaker 2: Your aunt came to your rescue in New York [New York]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and sent for you?
Speaker 1: That's the confusion.  While I was living with her in New York, she eventually told me that she was my mother and therefore, I don't know (laughter) which one was which.
Speaker 2: This is Aunt Mamie [Kitt].
Speaker 1: Aunt Mamie, yes.  And it's not that she was mean, but she was, she didn't know anything about taking care of children.
Speaker 2: She was stern.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I--because I felt I was in her way.  She was a very beautiful woman, and she was about, just under six feet tall.  And when she walked down the street, everybody turned around and looked at her.  That's how gorgeous she was.  So, and she was also a very desired woman.  So I felt I was in the way, and I realized I had to get out of there somehow or the other because I never wanted to be in anybody's way.
Speaker 2: So to get out of her way, you just got out of the house?
Speaker 1: Yes, I found work wherever I could, after schools, and started to take care of myself as best I could.
Story_ID: 578314
Speaker 1: Was this when you first got interested in theater?
Speaker 2: I--and that's very funny because I don't think I ever really got interested in theater.  I was always interested in trying to communicate, to have a feeling from someone to make me feel that I was worthwhile.  So when my teacher, Mrs. Bishop--I will never forget her.  She was a beautiful, brown-skinned lady at P.S. 136 in Harlem [New York, New York], but she bought me a ticket to go to see Jose Ferrer in 'Cyrano de Bergerac.'
Speaker 1: Ah, nice way to start.
Speaker 2: And, [HistoryMaker] Gwen [Ifill], when I saw this play and saw and felt the affection that the people were giving him and the people of the cast, I had a feeling inside of myself that, maybe, that's how I can get people to want me.
Speaker 1: At some point, you kind of began to focus on dance.  And we have--we want to take a look at some of your early transition with [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham.  Let's watch.
ANNOUNCER:  New York [New York] held much promise for the young Eartha Mae [HistoryMaker Eartha Kitt].  At age eighteen, Eartha was invited to join the Katherine Dunham dance troupe [Katherine Dunham Company]. This led to a European tour with the production of 'Bal Negre,' a tour of Mexico and a tour of London [England] and Paris [France] where a whole new world opened up.  Kitt would leave Dunham to perform in the Parisian nightclub, Carroll's [Paris, France].  Orson Welles would meet her only to cast her opposite him in the role as Helen of Troy in Orson Welles' 'Faust' ['The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus,' Christopher Marlowe].  Then she performed in Le Perroquet [Paris, France] nightclub and opening night, she adlibbed a song that would become one of her hallmark songs, 'C'est Si Bon.'  In 1951, after performing two weeks in Greece 'Uska Dara,' Kitt returned to New York only to have a disappointing opening night at the nightclub, La Vie en Rose [New York, New York].  That opening would lead to a stint at the Village Gate [New York, New York] where Leonard Sillman spotted Eartha and cast her in the Broadway revue, 'New Faces of 1952' which ran on Broadway for almost a year.  It was 'New Faces' and Leonard Sillman that would jump start her career with such legendary songs as 'Bal, Petit Bal' and 'Monotonous.'
Speaker 1: (Film clip) (Applause).
Story_ID: 578315
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: You know, I watch you watching yourself, and I wonder, do you recognize yourself in those old pictures?
Speaker 1: I don't know who she is.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Whoever she was, she had great arms (laughter). Let's talk about the [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham experience.  That was very different than what you thought it was gonna be.  And it was coincidental how you happened to get into the Katherine Dunham dance troupe [Katherine Dunham Company].
Speaker 2: Yes, my girlfriend at 115th Street and Madison Avenue [New York, New York], Joyce [ph.], she dared me to go down to have an audition for Katherine Dunham because I had seen Lena Horne and the Katherine Dunham, and I think they were both in 'Stormy Weather.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were the same color I am on the screen anyway.  So I felt an affinity for them.  You know, maybe something like that could be me, too.  And that's why she dared me to go down to have the audition.  And I did.  I joined the class, and I did all of my movements like the teacher was doing and the drums were going "co cum, co-cum-cum, kong, kong." So I did it.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter and applause).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what I would do.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I won a full scholarship (laughter).
Speaker 1: It worked (laughter).
Speaker 2: And that's how I really got into show business.
Speaker 1: How did you get along with her?
Speaker 2: With Ms. Dunham?
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to say anything negative about her, but I will.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm very, very, very, very happy that she made a company like hers because it was, that we know, the first time an Afro-American ballet company--not that we were all ballet dancing, although we were taking classes from Martha Graham and also a very strong Russian ballet teacher, we had to learn from the start ballet routines.  But it went on, that photographers and people were coming in to take pictures because we were always, on Sundays having backers audition.  And there were lines and lines of people in a row, and I was always chosen to do these wonderful dance movements in front of all these people.  So the photographers got very interested in my legs.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I can't imagine why.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: So because they were picking me out all the time to take these pictures, Ms. Dunham, she was not very nice with me.  But she might have been like that with other people, but I didn't notice.  And one day (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: --and one day she said to me, "Kitty, you will never be anything because you've got too much excess baggage."
Speaker 2: Baggage?
Speaker 1: Which meant she meant that I had long hair.
Speaker 2: Ah, ah, which is a bad thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for her, it was a bad thing because it was too attractive for her.  So she made me feel very small.
Story_ID: 578316
Speaker 1: So you had to part ways [with HistoryMaker Katherine Dunham], but along the way, think of the people who you ran with during this time, [HistoryMaker] Carmen [De] Lavallade, Ethel Waters.  You were contemporaries--
Speaker 2: Oh, I have to tell you about Ethel Waters.
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: She had a boyfriend, and his name was Archie Savage.  And he was a tap dancer--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she always wanted him to be in whatever she was doing.  So, you saw--if you saw 'Cabin in the Sky,' you could see him doing this tap dancing.
Speaker 1: He was, ah.
Speaker 2: Now, here we were as hula hula dancers or whatever it was we were doing on the stage.  And we had all this sand on the stage.  And all of a sudden, Ethel Waters wanted Archie Savage to come out and do his tap dancing on the stage (laughter), on the sand.  So he was going, slipping all over the place (laughter) on his, in his--but he got the--
Speaker 1: But he got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --now, before he got it, in order to get him to do--to do that, she went to the producer.  And she used every four-letter word in the book.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Now, you would never think that, Ethel Waters would be like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well, darling, she was (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: As wonderful an entertainer she was, she did know how to use a sailor's tongue.  And she would then cuss everybody out and get those--dancers off my stage (laughter).  And she would take her little bible--
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: --and go into the wings, and she would read the Bible.  In her way, that was washing out her mouth.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You stayed friends for life?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, I don't know how short a time it was before she died.  But she knew that I had--I'd always grow my own food.  And one of the foods is collard greens.  And her manager told her that, so she wanted to come to my house in Beverly Hills [California] and for me to cook her these collard greens which were growing in my garden, which she would come out and see the collard greens.  And I would take them into the house and wash them, and I would cook them for her and put them on the table with the finery that the--you all have allowed me to live like this now--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --with my good silver and my good whatever.  And I would put the collard greens on the table, and serve her like you would serve.  She wanted to eat of the pot.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, she was real.
Speaker 1: Which was a wonderful thing for me--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because it was so spiritual.  And until this day, I know when I'm by myself, I'm eating out of the pot (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: --because it's so spiritual.  I love that--
Story_ID: 578317
Speaker 1: So there is that part of your life, eating out of the pot, and then there is Europe and Paris [France], and you got to meet Josephine Baker, didn't you?
Speaker 2: That was the first thing we did when we got to Paris with the Katherine Dunham Company.  We went right to see Josephine Baker.  And she was absolutely wonderful.  And through the years, we remained friends, and I was helping her along with people like Grace Kelly and Marlene Dietrich, we were all helping her with the children.
Speaker 1: How much of an impact did Europe make on your life?  Off and on over the years, you spent a lot of time there.
Speaker 2: Well, I think Europe probably made me realize that I should learn how to read more, get more acquainted with people who have something to say, have conversations, which is what we did in Paris.  We used to go to the Cafe de Flore [Paris, France], Les Deux Magots [Paris, France].  These are outdoor restaurants that didn't cost very much money.  And we would, maybe ten of us like James Baldwin, Jean-Paul Sartre and people like that, Rocco [ph.]--and so forth and so on would, we would have a table.  And we'd all sit around and eat out of one bowl.  And it was choucroute garnie--sauerkraut and fatback (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --which to me--
Speaker 1: Yum.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's true.  And it's very true.  When you don't have any money, honey, go for the fatback (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Even in Paris.
Speaker 2: Right, even in Paris because fatback makes you feel full, and it's very nourishing.  I wouldn't eat it so much today, but I do go eat it--
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: --do it once in a while, yes.
Speaker 1: Did Europe also just broaden your thinking about the world?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, this was in 1950-something, I think, end of 1950-something.  And at that time, you could have one ticket to go around the world.  And you can stop in all of the main cities around the world and get back on the same place up to two weeks or so and so I did that because I had about two months before I had to come back to America to do a play.  And so I did.  And traveling around the world like that, all by myself.  When you have to learn, you have to be curious, and you have to find your way in and out of circumstances, so that you don't get into trouble.  And, of course, I did get into trouble because--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I bet you did.
Speaker 2: Well--
Story_ID: 578318
Speaker 1: When I was doing this film ['The Mark of the Hawk'] with Sidney Poitier and we were in Nigeria, he was the one that dared me to go up that hill to visit a group of people who followed the bats, the Odo tribe.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Well, in my curiosity, naturally, if you tell me not to do something, I'm going to go (laughter).
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: So I went in the middle of the afternoon.  I got a photographer who was always around.  And I had also been in the papers because every day--since I didn't have anything to do in Africa, I would do my exercises every day.  And every day I'd get up in the morning because I love the sunrise.  So I was in my very, very, very, very tiny bikini, riding a bicycle.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: So eventually, I don't know why, but I would see people hanging from the trees (laughter), watching me go up and down the roads.
Speaker 1: Why ever would they do such a thing (laughter)?
Speaker 2: And I would go through the marketplaces, you know, saying, "Hello" to the people and so forth and so on in my bikini.  Well, some few days or I don't know how many days later, the headlines in the newspaper says, "[HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt is disturbing the natives."
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And I think you were (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So then, when Sidney Poitier dared me to go up that side of the mountain, I did and saw the Odo tribe and see the bats because they would hang to the trees.  You know, that's what I wanted to see, were these bats that were all so beautifully hanging to these trees, and they looked like fists on top of one another, like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, how do I prove to Sidney Poitier that this is what I did?  So I went to the chief of the tribe, with the body guards with their--what do they call those guns on the backs--hand-made guns.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And they were--
Speaker 2: Were you wearing a bikini?
Speaker 1: I was--no, I wasn't wearing a bikini this time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Just checking.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: So he said--I told him what I would like to do, and when I went to his cabin, he was playing Eartha Kitt records.  So he knew who I was.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So we went to the shrine, what they call the shrine.  It's three trees that are dug out in the center, and that's where the bats would hang out, you know, and hang onto all these branches.  So, but I wanted to see them fly away.  So you have to shoot off this ground gun is what they call it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a ground gun, and inside of this ground gun are these bullets, that when you shoot them, they spread out, and it kills these--the remnants from the bullets would kill anything that it would hit.  So naturally, I got a bat.  So now--
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: I went back to the catering rest house where we were staying.  And I had the house boy who was taking care of me in my cabin--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Not in that way.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm just listening.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: House boy, yes.
Speaker 1: I had him get me some--because it was Christmastime, so I had him get me some Christmas paper.  And I had this bat.  It was like, he was hanging out like this with his arms and his paws up like that.  His arms are up like that, and--
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: --so I wrapped this bat, one page at a time with a little bow, ten times, one page at a time, big bow.  And I took it back to the catering rest house at dinnertime.  And I called Sidney Poitier and the crew into the bar where we always had our meetings.  And I said, oh, I didn't know what to get you for Christmas.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: So I went out and I found something all by myself.  And he was going, "Aw."
Speaker 2: Aw.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: So then I have him open up the package.
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2: And he was opening it, opening up, opening up.  He was getting more furious by the second.  And when he saw the bat--and he leapt out of the window.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And he didn't talk to me for some time.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you've made up since.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we've made up since.
Speaker 1: Okay, just checking.
Story_ID: 578319
Speaker 1: So now, here is another thing that happened to you when you were abroad.  Aunt Mamie [Kitt], who we talked about earlier, she died.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You came home--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for the funeral.  And there was this collision of worlds.  There was the new [HistoryMaker] Eartha [Kitt] and the old--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Eartha Mae.
Speaker 2: When she died I came to New York [New York], took her body down south where she wanted to be buried.  And I was all dressed up in my Parisian [Paris, France] gowns--not gowns, but, you know, like looking like Vogue with my hair all coiffured while down, all dressed up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was sitting in first class.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, this was about 1950.  And this gentleman comes through, and he says, "You can't sit here."  I said, "What are you going to do?"  And you ignore him.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: So you just kept sitting there.
Speaker 1: I just kept sitting there, and he still ignored me.  And every time he came through, I pretended I didn't hear a thing.  And when I got to the other side, getting out of first class--now, if I'd had a photographer with me, you see, I could have made a big story.  But I don't think about those things.  What is wrong, is wrong.  And you correct the wrong at the moment that it happens if you possibly can, without any furor, without your fists in the air, without hatred because that's conditioning, and you have to understand that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Except it must have, it must have been shocking after having spent time in an environment where this did not happen.  To come back to the United States and to be reminded how far we had not come?
Speaker 1: Yes, but now, I think about how far we have come, and that, to me, is very, very, very important, and I'm very glad to have been a part of it.
Story_ID: 578320
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your experience with Orson Welles in the production of 'Faust' ['The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus,' Christopher Marlowe].  We saw some pictures of that.  It seems like pretty nontraditional casting, to cast you as Helen of Troy at that time, opposite him?
Speaker 2: Yes, but Orson was one of those kind of people.  And I didn't think anything of it.  I just thought he wanted me as Helen of Troy, and when he said, "Helen, make me immortal with a kiss," he took me in his arms, and the audience is there.  And as I'm leaning in his arms, and he says, "Helen, make me immortal with a kiss," he kisses me and crunch, right into my bottom lip.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, you'd be surprised at the things I read about myself.  It's hysterical and funny.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, like having an affair with Orson Welles, for instance.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: You see I was going to ask about that, but now, I'm thinking, maybe not (laughter).
Speaker 1: And one of the papers said that, when I opened in the nightclub [Carroll's, Paris, France] there, that's where he saw me.  He said, the most exciting thing that has happened to Paris [France] in twenty-five years, which was little [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: You did not exactly disagree, I'm thinking.  Somewhere along the way, you were spotted in much the same way that you were spotted by him in this nightclub for 'New Faces of 1952.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in Paris was where Leonard Sillman saw me.  And when he started doing his production of 'New Faces of '52,' I had returned to America for La Vie en Rose [New York, New York], which I was not very successful because they said I was singing in too many different languages, and what is it?  And, you know, what does she thinks she's doing?  And they were accustomed to us being so different, you know.  I guess they expected me to be singing the blues and jazz, the gospel.  So I played one week there, and they just canceled my, my contract.  And after a while, I was not working, and nobody was asking me to work.  And I wanted to go back to Paris because I knew I could work there.  I went to William Morris who had brought me back to America to ask them to lend me twenty-five dollars until they find some work for me.  "Who do you say you are?  What do you--how do you spell your name?"
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: That really hurt.
Speaker 1: That must have hurt.
Speaker 2: That really hurt.
Story_ID: 578321
Speaker 1: --So I left the office [William Morris Agency], and I'm walking up Broadway [New York, New York], so ashamed.  And I felt someone following me.  And in my shameness--I didn't want to show my face.  And I had one five cents left to take a train up to 128th Street, where I was living at the time.  And he said things like, "I don't want you to feel about opening night in the La Vie en Rose [New York, New York]."  He said, "I was there, and you're a wonderful artist.  Don't lose faith," or some words to that extent.  And as he walked away, he turned back and said, "Oh, by the way.  My name is Jose Ferrer."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And that was the first artist I had ever seen on the legitimate stage.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And that gave me courage.  And then, right after that, Max Gordon asked me to come down to the Village Vanguard [New York, New York] and start all over again.
Speaker 2: It was at Vanguard where they--where Leonard Sillman saw you, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Let's take a look, 'New Faces of 1952.'
Speaker 1: (Film clip).
ANNOUNCER: [HistoryMaker Eartha] Kitt's success with 'New Faces of 1952' led to a five-year recording contract with RCA [Records].  And she became the hottest female recording artist of the 1950s.
Speaker 1: (Eartha Kitt sings 'Santa Baby').
ANNOUNCER: Continuing to perform on stage, Kitt began to make movies including 'St. Louis Blues' with Nat King Cole and '[The] Mark of the Hawk' with Sidney Poitier.  Kitt finds herself in a love relationship with Arthur Loew [Jr.] of Loew's Theater and becomes close friends with actor James Dean.  And by 1960, she is presented with her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame [Hollywood, California].  That same year, she marries Bill McDonald [John William McDonald].  That marriage would last five years, but that union would produce her beloved daughter, Kitt [Shapiro].  Movie and TV roles would follow.  But nothing like her role of Catwoman in the TV series, 'Batman.'  It would be this role of Catwoman that would redefine Eartha Kitt and introduce her to a whole new audience.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: Now--I have to make an admission that Catwoman, for me, is the moment, of course, and 'Santa Baby,' not necessarily in that order.  Your career took off at this point.  You were--you exploded.  Did you prefer, I mean you were nominated for a Tony Award for 'Mrs. Patterson,' 1954.  Did you prefer stage, screen, television, which--
Speaker 1: I prefer live performing.  I've always said that the audience has always been my best director.  And you still are.  So thank you.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Story_ID: 578322
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Ms. [Eartha] Kitt, we have to talk about your love life.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Gwen [Ifill], you've been knowing me for a thousand years, and you still call me, Ms. Kitt.  It's time you called me Eartha.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Eartha, we still have to talk about your love life.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Tell us, who was the love of your life?
Speaker 1: The first one that really I wanted to have as father to my child was Arthur Loew, Jr.  And his mother said she would--well, she threatened to shoot him in his foot or something if he married a brown-skinned woman.  I learned that far afterwards.  So that was not possible.  And I was going with Charlie Revson [Charles Haskell Revson] at the time he was having his '[The] $64,000 Question.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he's another one that I would have loved to have as Kitt's [Kitt Shapiro] father.  But he got into trouble with his '$64,000 Question,' and you know that relationship--people were--he was afraid that his stockholders would pull out if they knew about me.  So, that was the end of that relationship.  But those were two people that I really would have loved to have Kitt as her father.
Speaker 2: And at some point, you finally did meet Kitt's father [John William McDonald].
Speaker 1: Yes, well, he was there.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in many ways, I'm very glad I married him because even though it didn't turn out the way I would love for it to have turned out, I got the best of the deal because look what came about, my wonderful, beautiful child.
Speaker 1: Who is here tonight.
Speaker 2: Who is here tonight, and she's now--
Speaker 1: Kitt Shapiro.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: Motherhood made a big difference, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ah, yes, because I felt now, I had something more to strive for, and whatever difficulties I got in at the time, my child came first.

Speaker 1: You know, you lived--it's clear to hear you tell the tale that you lived in kind of parallel worlds in some ways, black world, white world.  Did the two ever mix?
Speaker 2: I think so because I don't go through life, and never have, as a person who belongs to a race, as we call a race, a race of color, a race of yellow or brown or whatever the color you are.  I'm a person of the race of human beings.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: But, at the time that you said that, in an interview once, you got into some trouble in the black community.  They said, what is she talking about?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, because she says white isn't--how come she doesn't recognize herself as a black person?  And I feel as long as I carry myself as a black person, I'm separating myself from the rest of the world.  And, therefore, that means that I want you to treat me differently.  And I don't want to be treated differently than you would treat someone who deserves whatever kindness they're endowed with--what you should have.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You were, as much as you say you're not a, you know, you're not a race woman in the way that people define that, you were an ardent supporter of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, because he spoke the right kind of messages.  He brought us together, without hatred, and his speeches were absolutely inspiring.  And even though he said, "I have a dream," I've always said, okay.  Dreaming is wonderful, but it's up to me to do something about that dream.  I cannot sit and wait for the government to come and give me a handout, which was my case when I was a kid in New York [New York].  I, you can see me sometimes in the photograph with my relief dress on.  But in that relief dress and my one pair of shoes for the, whatever, how long they lasted, when I went to school, the kids realized that I was poor.  But when they put us all in uniforms, that situation was eradicated.  And therefore, I think everybody in schools should wear the same (laughter) uniform and all of this prejudice situation, to some extent, and hatred would be eradicated because we--politicians particularly, seem to make us feel that you're different from me, and I'm different from you, when we're all one and the same blood.  Why should we be treated differently?  What we need is a foundational, good education.  Why is it that they're constantly saying "better education, better schools, better," and ever since I was a kid, they're saying the same thing?  We haven't gotten better schools and we haven't gotten a better education.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: As you know, I spend most of my life talking to people about these issues, and no one is ever as honest as you seem to be (laughter) about this.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: No wonder you got in trouble at the White House [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: And I'll continue to be in trouble if you're asking me a question.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I--good, good.
Story_ID: 578324
Speaker 1: Tell me about what happened at the White House [Washington, D.C.] though.  That--there are different versions of what happened with you.  You upset the president's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] wife [Lady Bird Johnson].
Speaker 2: Because she asked me a question.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And the question was, "Why is there so much juvenile delinquency in the streets of America?"  Because of [the] Vietnam [War].  That's what the boys were telling me.  They came to my dressing rooms, whether it was in a hotel room or in my dressing room at the theater.  Wherever it was, whenever--wherever I was, and we would sit on the floor with a glass of champagne, of course, (laughter) and they would tell me what their feelings were, because I would ask them questions.  And so they said, "It's not that we're running away from America because we don't like America.  We happen to love our country.  But we don't want to be involved in Vietnam because we think it's a dishonorable war."  So when I was given the floor, and--first of all, I said, "I think we've missed out on something here today."  I thought the question was about what the question was about on my invitation.  The invitation said, why is there so much juvenile delinquency in the streets of America from Mrs. Johnson who was having a luncheon for those of us who they felt have done something for the community.  And they were talking about how we should put trees in the--what do you call that?
Speaker 1: Median strip.
Speaker 2: Yeah, on 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I said the first thing that people would do is burn those trees down to make fire because what they want are jobs.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: If you want to beautify America, then beautify people by giving them jobs before you beautify America with seeds.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: They didn't react particularly well to that suggestion at the White House, did they?  In the end, President Johnson had a role in this.  He wasn't happy with what you said.  He blacklisted it.  He made it difficult--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't blacklisted.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: I was whitelisted.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I like that, I like that.  We're gonna go with that.  So you were whitelisted.
Story_ID: 578325
Speaker 1: Being banished, as it were, from your ability to live your livelihood set you up, eventually, after a while, for one of the greatest, one of your many great comebacks.  Let's take a look.
Speaker 2: (Film clip).
ANNOUNCER: Invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.] for Lady Bird's [Lady Bird Johnson] 50-woman luncheon [Women Do-er luncheon], [HistoryMaker Eartha] Kitt spoke out against the Vietnam War and its injustices.  Her doing so caused Eartha to be blacklisted, forcing her to leave the United States for six years.  After her six-year exile, Kitt would return to receive a Tony Award nomination for her role in the Broadway production of 'Timbuktu!'  She would go on to pin two more autobiographies ['Alone With Me: a new autobiography,' Eartha Kitt; 'Thursday's Child,' Eartha Kitt] on her life.  Then in the 1990s, Kitt would appear in the movie 'Boomerang.'  She was also nominated for a Tony Award as the costar of the Broadway musical, 'The Wild Party.'  This lady of the stage and screen has continued to hone her craft and to entertain audiences while she did so.  There is only one Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: Only one Eartha Kitt. Now, it should be said, you now, I think appeal to about eight generations of people who know you for different things.  'Boomerang' is a completely different thing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You even did disco at one point, I believe.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My first gold record, well, my only gold record was with a song called, "I don't want to be alone.  Where is my baby?" ['Where Is My Man'].
Speaker 1: That was your only gold?
Speaker 2: My only gold.
Speaker 1: That's shocking.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: But, you, what I--I guess the point is, you've managed to reinvent yourself periodically whenever the need arose.
Speaker 1: Because when I needed work, I went (laughter) where--
Speaker 2: You went where the work was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, they do say, "Necessity is the mother of invention", and I really believe in that.  And it's not that I went off my own path.  But I would try something once in a while and find that either it worked or it didn't work.  And I've always found my way back on my own path because that's where I'm most comfortable--
Story_ID: 578326
Speaker 1: Your speaking voice is so recognizable that you did a lot of voice work.
Speaker 2: Yes, and it's, it's amazing that at the age of eighty-something, I got nominated for having the best voice in animated, daytime television.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: This is what [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder said about you.  He was interviewed for [The] HistoryMakers, and he said, "There's nobody like [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  She's a brilliant performer.  She's someone who comes from an old, wonderful school of theater and from a world where they know their craft inside out.  They're pros.  They did it the hard way, and their pure talent and their pure genius will cut you like a knife because they are all originals."
Speaker 2: Aw.
Speaker 1: Isn't that nice?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: But--very nice--but isn't it also true?
Speaker 1: It's like what Charlie Revson [Charles Haskell Revson] told me.  He said, "Do you know"--'cause he would come to my house and ask me to--he would say to me, "you know, Eartha, I'm doing this television show, that"--the one named, was a penthouse, that he would get stars to be the star of the night. And he said, you know, "I cannot find enough artists to be able to hold an audience in the palm of their hand for an hour."  And he said, "The ones that I find," he said, "six out of ten are black."  And I said, "What's wrong with that?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He said, "Well, I can't do that."  And I said, "Charlie, you are the dictator of maquillage--makeup in this country.  You are big businessman.  You're very smart.  You are a leader.  Why can't you do that?"  I said, "I know you can't use me because everybody knows about us, but you can use a very handsome guy like [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte or Lena Horne," which he did.  He opened his seasons with Harry Belafonte.
Story_ID: 578327
Speaker 1: I sometimes wonder if people weren't actually more willing to accept people like you and [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier and Lena Horne than we gave them credit for.  I was watching some old clips of Ed Sullivan with you on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' back in the '60s [1960s], boy, and he was into you. I'm telling you.  I could see it in his eyes.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I was on his show a bit more often than the other artists.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so I won't press you on that one, even though I have my own suspicions.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, well, but, you know, with Ed Sullivan, it was also very interesting times too.  And I adored Ed Sullivan, even he had no idea how to speak the English language.
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But he told me that he was--when I was on his shows, and I wore a gown, he would get letters from people who said she's too sexy.
Speaker 1: Ha.
Speaker 2: So I, he started to put me in, you know, the toreador pants that I introduced to the United States.  But he didn't have a very large Jewish audience.  And I happened to have a very large Hebrew repertoire.  So one day I came on his show, and RCA Victor wanted me to plug one of my new songs that they were going to release at any minute now.  The man sent me home because he wanted me to sing a Hebrew song because he wanted me to gather a Jewish audience for him.  So I did, and I came back, and--(singing)--and Sullivan was able to get a Jewish audience.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Through you.  What an interesting way to get a Jewish audience.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You are unique.  There is nobody I can point to on the scene who has replicated what you have replicated.  What message can you leave for those young performers who want to be you or aspire to be you?
Speaker 1: If you're looking for immediate rewards, you're only looking for the money.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And money can be very valuable--there's not much sense to it.  And I think that if you want to really be true to yourself, and do that which you know you can do best, then stick with it.  Don't follow the herds.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think you've ever done that, followed the herd, and for that, we are immensely grateful, [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 578329
Speaker 1: Here's the part.  I don't know about you, but that I've been waiting for, a real treat.  Three of [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt's biggest hits, which she will perform for you, live tonight.
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Speaker 1: Now?
Speaker 2: Now, with the help of Darrell Waters on piano and the Evergreen Trio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness.
Speaker 2: All yours.
Speaker 1: (Eartha Kitt performs 'Ain't Misbehavin').
Speaker 2: (Applause).
Story_ID: 578330
Speaker 1: (Applause).
Speaker 2: Ay Dios. Oh, I have so much fun with myself.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, this is one of the songs that [HistoryMaker] Gwen [Ifill] was talking about in my experiences in Paris [France], when I was just starting out. And when [HistoryMaker] Ms. [Katherine] Dunham dared me to leave the [Katherine Dunham] Company, and I took the dare, and started on my own. And there I was, standing on the side of the stage at the ABC Theater [Paris, France], watching them put a very tiny young lady together. She was so small, I thought she would never be able to stand on her own two feet. But when the curtain went up, and she took ahold of the microphone, she became Edith Piaf.
