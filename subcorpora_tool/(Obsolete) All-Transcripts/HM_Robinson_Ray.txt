Story_ID: 12416
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna leave anybody out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: On your mother's side, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother's full name is Wanda Lee Robinson.  That's W-A-N-D-A, initial L.  The last name is R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N.  Her maiden name was Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born on, let's see--she was born in, in--oh, my God, give me the famous--(laughs).  It's in Texas, the--
Speaker 1: Paris.
Speaker 2: Paris.  I couldn't think of it.  Paris, Texas, and she was actually born on November 19th, I guess it was 1930, I believe.
Speaker 1: Right. And can you tell us what you know about her side of the family, and how far back can you go?  Did you know your grandmother and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew my grandmother and grandfather very well.  I didn't know my great grandparents, but, but my, my, my mother comes from a very large family.  There were twenty-two of them in the family.  And my grandfather and grandmother--my grandfather was Artis Jackson, my grandmother was Bobbie Jackson--lived on a farm in, as I couldn't think of the name Paris, Paris, Texas is not like Paris, France.  It's a, it's a rural community which is where my mother was born, and, and raised.  So it was really kind of a farm community, and my grandparents, I spent time growing up in the summers with, with, with many of my uncles and aunts.  In fact, some of them were about my age.  So my, my--I have, I think it's two, two aunts that are younger than I am, and an uncle who is a month older than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did, are there any stories passed down through your family about what was going on in the 19th Century?  Can you trace your family all the way, say to, the slave era or beyond to--?
Speaker 2: No, I can't really trace it all the way back because my, my history really was just with my, my, my grandparents.  I knew that there was some--my, my grandfather, they used to tell us all the time that he had some Native American blood in his as well as, as black.  But, but I can't, you know, don't know anything really other than, than Grandmama Sally, who was my mother's grandmother.  And I don't know my, my mother's grand--my great grandfather.  I didn't know much about him.  But Mama Sally, as they called her, there was a lot of conversation about her and how she was apparently a very strong wom, strong woman, and, you know, pretty much kind of helped the, the Rucker family--my grandmother's maiden name was Rucker.  And, and the Rucker family was also a fairly large family, but--in fact, the last of the Rucker, of my, I guess it would be my great aunts, passed away just this past, about three months ago.  But I, I've heard some stories just about things that were probably true in any family, the kind of things that, that people did, the kind of things--never, never having a car, never having indoor toilets, all that kind of stuff.  But not anything that would trace the family back beyond just the immediate family that I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any interesting stories? That just--.
Speaker 2: I, I think some of the most interesting ones were the ones of some of my, some of my, I guess great uncles, who, who apparently were very physically strong men.  And they were, they were always very active, and usually about some of the skirmishes they would get into with, with quite frankly, some of the whites that they encountered at the time.  They were very proud and very strong willed, and, and quite frankly, would not back down from, from anything.  And as it turns out, they got into a few scrapes a few times.  And, and quite frankly, I think flirted with danger a lot more than, than I think anybody wants to admit.  But the stories were really more about how they would not be denied whatever they wanted to, to do.  If they wanted to, to pick, you know, peaches and, and keep them, once they picked them, and somebody wanted to take them from them, you know, there--it was always a fight.  And, and they may have lost the peaches, but they definitely did not back away from the fight.  And they lived to tell about it.  So those were the kind of stories.  It was always a story around how, in a rural community, things that you would work for, that was yours, and how some people wanted to take it.  And my, my great uncles were, were one--men that some--in fact, one had to leave Texas, in fact, because he, he got into so much trouble and, and usually along racial lines.
Story_ID: 12417
Speaker 1: In terms of your mother [Wanda Robinson], could you tell us about her?  What she was like and what she did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was probably, my mother was called Sally, which was after my, my great grandmother.  Her name is Wanda, and how you get Sally out of Wanda?  My grandfather called her Sally.  And my mother was probably one of my grandfather's favorites.  She was, I think she was the fourth oldest girl, and I think she was like number, number eight or nine in the family.  But she was apparently somewhat rambunctious, I guess.  And, and she was smaller than the other kids.  She was very small when she was born.  And my grandfather named her Sally, which was after my grandmother's mother.  And so she kind of had a special place in my grandfather's heart, I think.  She was not one that was terribly fond of working outdoors.  My mother was always the one that did the kind of indoor stuff, the cleaning and the cooking.  So she didn't really have to work in the fields a lot and some of my, my uncles and aunts would talk about how my mother used to get away with things.  She didn't have to work in the sun.  She was always inside, and she was somewhat fair skinned.  But she, she never really, really took to the outside work.  She was always inside, and, and that was always kind of a, a story about how she always got the cushy jobs, if there was a cushy job in those times.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she have a chance to get much schooling and stuff--?
Speaker 2: No, my, my mother actually only got, I think ninth grade education.  And then she, you know, she, you know, dropped out of school.  So she was--being a farming community, it wasn't a real priority placed on education.  But she was--so she only went to the, to the ninth grade.  She did not complete the ninth grade.
Story_ID: 12418
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  His full name is initials only, O. C. Robinson, R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Now, it's just O. C.  It didn't stand for anything?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't, it really is O. C. Robinson, but when he went to the service, they made him take a name, so he's, you know, on his birth certificate it's O. C., initials only.  But after he went into the military, he came back as Otis Charles.  But, but nobody taught him--it is always O. C.  That's what he's called, and that's what he's referred to.  And, but when he was in the service, he had to have some name, so they said it was--he made, I think he made it up.  It was just Otis Charles because that's not the name that my grandmother [Piccola Robinson] said she got.  She gave him O. C.
Speaker 1: And what was his birth date?
Speaker 2: His birthday was December, December 12th, 1930.
Speaker 1: All right, so your mother and father born in the same year?
Speaker 2: Same year, um-hum.  She was--he likes to say she was older than he is (laughs), by a month.
Story_ID: 12419
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell us about his family.  What do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I know quite a bit about my, my father's [O. C. Robinson] family--well, first of all, is also a very large family; not quite as large as my mother's family.  My father was one of eighteen.  The difference is, is he was the oldest.  He's the oldest of the eighteen.  And his--my grandfather, Vernon Robinson and my grandmother, Piccola Robinson were probably the two most different people you can meet.  My grandmother was just, just a sweet, charming and very quiet, soft spoken and strong in a quiet kind of way.  My grandfather was big, and he was a, and he was a character.  I mean he, he was--Vernon Robinson, as he was known.  He was a big man.  He was like six [feet] five [inches], probably 260 [pounds].  And, and in those days, I mean he was, he was an imposing figure.  My father, of course, being one of eighteen, he loves to talk about how my, my grandfather's 'rules of justice',  I guess, as he calls it.  And the story that I, my grandfather--or my father told me about my grandfather is that early on in their marriage, one of my great uncles, my, on the--my grandmother's brother, he was apparently taking meat from the smokehouse.  And my grandfather told him, he said, look--his name was Armster. He said, "Armster, if I catch you stealing from my smokehouse, I'm gonna put some hurt on you." He said, "Oh, Vernon, I wouldn't steal from you."  Well, my father said, early one morning they heard, you know, ruckus and they heard something, a loud shot.  And everybody got out of bed, and, and, of course, my grandfather believed in having--there's no sense having guns if you didn't, they weren't loaded.  And he had a lot of guns.  So he came back in, and he told--got, you know, put his gun back behind the bed, and got inside, went in and told my grandmother.  He said, "Look, I just shot your brother," (laughs).  And she said, "What?"  And so, as it turned out, my grandfather was also--he was a pretty shrewd guy.  He shot him with the shot, but, you know, he was far enough away.  It was a shotgun, but he was far enough away that he just put an awful lot of buckshot--it didn't, you know, it was nothing that would kill him, but it would definitely hurt him pretty bad.  And he--and, and the reason my father would tell me the story is Uncle Armster walked with a terrible limp.  And the limp was the, from actually getting shot in the rear end with the, with a shotgun.  And, but he waited, waited until he got just far enough away with a ham--he was taking a ham from the smokehouse.  And so my, my father tells me that that almost ruined the marriage, of course, but especially you go in and tell your wife that you just shot, you know, "I just shot your brother".  I mean it was, but my father talks about and my grandfather when he was alive, it was, it was absolutely verified.  He'd say, "Yep, I told him not to steal from me, and he was stealing from me.  And so I had to, I had to hurt him."  So that was, that was the Robinson justice.  So you can some sense of where my, my grandfather was.  He was a, he's a character.
Speaker 1: So this is Vernon Robinson?
Speaker 2: Vernon Robinson, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, did he have any stories about the 19th Century or did, could he talk about the slave era or back any further?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, he really didn't.  No, he really didn't.  In fact, he was so, he was so into the era that he was in, I mean he was--he, growing up in, you know, in Corsicana [Texas], which is where they lived when I, you know, when I used to go visit them, you know, he was kind of--it was folklore.  I mean Vernon Robinson, you know, he would, if he got stopped and they felt like he wasn't speeding or whatever, you know, you know, there was gonna be an argument, and there probably was gonna be a fight.  So he spent a fair amount of time, I think, in the slammer.  But, but he was also, but he was also well liked.  He was one of those kind of guys that people knew that if it, if he--if somebody, you know, did something wrong to him, you know, they probably deserved what they got.  But he, but he was a, he was a guy--he was a very stand-up kind of guy.  But he'd never really, I never knew anything.  In fact, I knew even less about my, my great grandmother or grandfather on my father's side than I did on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your father's people always live in Eureka, Texas or did--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eureka and Corsicana.
Story_ID: 12420
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [O. C. Robinson] because I mean we just talked about your grandfather [Vernon Robinson]. What about your father?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, my father would--by the way, he, he only went to the sixth grade.  He, he did not graduate from, from high school.  But he, he was always kind of a, what I call, he had some innate business talents.  He--the years he worked, when I was growing up, my father worked for a paper company called Pollock Paper Company [Dallas, Texas] and he also cleaned buildings at night.  And so he was not--he didn't really spend a lot of time because he was working basically six, six days a week, and it was working basically twelve hours a day.  So he didn't see much--many of the things that I was involved with, sports and those kind of activities, because he was working.  But he was always, always the entrepreneur kind of guy.  He was always the guy that was learning how to do something and to give you example, he, when he worked for Pollock Paper Company for eighteen years, and he was cleaning buildings at night, the year that I went off to college, came back and--because my father, as you can see from our ages, we--I like to say we grew up together.  My parents were very young when, when, when they got married and I was born.  The--so, when he went off to--when I went off to college and came back.  And my mother [Wanda Robinson] was doing domestic work, and my father was cleaning buildings and, and working for Pollock Paper Company as a tape machine operator.  But he, he realized that he was making more money working four hours a night, cleaning buildings than he was making working the other eight to ten hours a day, three hours now, rather, and working nine to ten hours a days working at paper, at the Pollock Paper Company six days a week.  He was making more money for those three hours.  And so he said to me, "Ray, I'm thinking about going into doing my own janitorial work."  And to give you an idea of what he was doing, he was saying, what do you mean?  He said, well, he said, "I found out that when you work in these buildings, you know, there's some things that you kind of learn.  One, that when people see you cleaning the buildings and they're happy with the work you're doing, all you got to do is find the guy who makes the decisions and just see if he's pleased with your work.  And if he's pleased with your work, and then you find out what he's paying the company that you're working for, and then you just see if you can cut a deal."  And the deal he gave me was one, he went in, and he said, you go to the guy with the big corner office, and he said, you go in and say, "Mr. Jones, are you pleased with the work that"--and by the way, we would help him at night some time, "Are you pleased with the work my family and I are doing in terms of cleaning the building?"  And he said, "I'm very pleased, O. C., you guys are doing a great job."  He said, "Can I ask you a question?"  He said, sure.  He said, how much are you paying J.B. Janitorial?  He said, I'm paying them a thousand dollars a month.  And so my father looks, and knows he's only getting $300 a month.  And so he says, "Well, how about, you know, saving yourself 200 dollars and making me 100.  And he said, what do mean?  He said, well, I'll do it for $800 a month and, you know, I can make another hundred dollars and you can save."  And I used to say, "Well, look, Dad, those numbers don't add up."  And he said--he'd always say stuff like, any time you're trying to do something with somebody, you got to make sure they feel they're getting the best part of the deal.  So if I saved him $200 and I'm making a hundred; the fact of the matter is, he was saving them 200 and he was making 500 more."  That's what--but he wasn't gonna say that because he said, well, you know, if, "Why would I do that?"  So that's what he told him.  The next we know, the guy said--he said, "My family and I are doing the work."  We'll still be doing the work, and save yourself a few bucks, and my family and I can another, another hundred on the side.  Well, as it turned out, there was a contract my Dad had signed that said that if you, if the J&B Janitorial were to lose any business, he was prohibited from going to work for that company for one year.  And so I went back to my--I was in college [University of Denver, Denver, Colorado].  And so I go to my law prof, I said, look, showed him what the contract said.  And he said, "Well, Ray, that's pretty simple."  He said, "Now who cleans the building?"  I said, "Well, my, my mother [Wanda Robinson] and my brother [Manjuel Robinson] and sister [Rhonda Robinson]," and said, "When I'm home, I help."  And he said, "Who's actually employed by this janitorial company."  I said, "My dad."  He said, "Well, it's quite simple.  Put it in your mother's name."  So my mother actually owned the company my dad ran for some twenty years which was Robinson Janitorial.  My mother was the owner of Robinson Janitorial back in 1966.  And he kept that business until such time we started a trucking company, which we, which we started the trucking company in nineteen and, they started 1988, I guess it was.  So he was in the janitorial business for about twenty, twenty, twenty-plus years.  And then we went in the trucking company in, in 1988, similar kind of deal.  But the point is, is he always had a knack for figuring out how you can make money--more money, doing something that you're already doing than, than he was making.  And that was an example of it, which is, there's something that played in my mind.
Story_ID: 12421
Speaker 1: Now, how did you parents meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, my Dad [O. C. Robinson] would say that, that they met because one of these, they call the county fair.  And, you know, he was from Eureka [Texas], and she [Wanda Robinson] was from Paris [Texas].  And they'd go a county fair that he was going to, and that's, that's how he says the met.  I don't really know, but that's, that's the story.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughs).
Story_ID: 12422
Speaker 1: So, you know, what was your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Probably the first childhood memory I had was really--I was always a very happy child, but the one I remember most is, is the, the times that I spent going up to the country when we were living with my--we'd go up and visit with all my mother's [Wanda Robinson] side, my grandparents [Artis Jackson and Bobbie Jackson] because there were so many kids.  And, and these are relatives.  And it was one of those kind of deals, it wasn't like going away to summer camp.  We were going away to pick cotton and pull corn.  It was work, and it was hot, but I just loved to go up and be around my, my uncles and aunts and my grand- --my grandmother because it was a big family.  And we were up on a--you know, you had animals and so forth.  So those are the things that probably dominate my, my first childhood memories is I, I remember that so vividly.  As I got older, I remember how, how bad it was, because all of a sudden, it, it was no longer fun when, when it wasn't really play.  You were really out there working.  You were a real hand.  So those are the things that kind of dominate.  The other things were just kind of Christmas, toys and that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 12423
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, the ones that I remember definitely would, would be the, Christmas Eve.  I mean my mother [Wanda Robinson] had, used to love to cook.  And we had some, some fantastic, you know, we, you know, I, I really did truly believe in this thing called Santa Claus.  I mean it was kind of, it was really pushed in the Robinson family, in fact, to the extreme because in some cases my, my dad [O.C. Robinson] would be assembling bicycles, you know.  And I'd, I'd be so afraid to look.  I'd hear all this noise, and, you know, and my brother [Manjuel Robinson] and I are in the same room.  And I'm saying, there's Santa Claus out there.  And my dad out there trying to put this bike together after having had too many drinks.  So I mean it was, (laughs) it was one of those kind of deals.  But I remember the, the smell, of course, was just the, the food, the cooking.  I was always--I've always loved food.  I've always liked being around good food, and, and my mother is an excellent cook.  So it was the, you know, the pies and the cakes.  And she still, to this day, she will bake the pie that, for each one of us, our favorite pie.  And those were the things that kind of stand out in terms of the, the smell.  And, of course, the--Christmas was always a special time of the year for me because that was, you know, toys, I loved--I was big into the, the toy thing.  And my parents, regardless of what we had, Christmas was always a special time.
Story_ID: 12424
Speaker 1: What did your neighborhood look like?  What did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, initially, we lived in a, in a duplex in a--south side of Dallas [Texas].  And that was early on.  That was like in the first, second grade.  After I got, moved to the second grade, my parents [O.C. Robinson and Wanda Robinson] really got their first home, which is the place that I grew up in, it was in Hamilton Park, which is on the north side of Dallas.  This was a community that was built back in the early '50s [1950s].  And it was built, it was an all-black community and it was on the north side of town. At that time, they were trying to create, and these--this is when the schools and stuff were segregated.  So they built this community out--these were frame houses that they, that they built on slabs.  But it was about five hundred homes in this community.  They built the school in the community.  And we were part of the Dallas city limits, but we were part of the Richardson [Texas] school district.  And it was at the time, we got their hand-me-down books.  We got this beautiful new school. It was all black, and the teachers were all black, of course.  And here we were in Richardson, which was always considered to be one of the, you know, very nice, suburban bedroom communities.  That was part of the Richardson school district.  We couldn't go to the Richardson school district, but we were, we were part of the Richardson school district, but living in Dallas.  So it was kind of a unique thing.  And if you're familiar with Dallas, this was about as far north as you can go in Dallas and still be in the Dallas city limits because now, that area that's called Hamilton Park, little did people know, I guess, back in the '50s [1950s], that the growth in Dallas was gonna be north because there's no way that area would have been an area that they tried to get blacks to kind of, kind of congregate at.  So that's where I grew up.  And that community was probably, in, in terms of my childhood memories, it was probably the ideal place to grow up, because we had everything that was in any other community.  We had a park.  We had a swimming pool.  We didn't--there was no issue about integrating the pools because we had our own pool.  We had a park.  It wasn't as nice as some of the others, but it was there.  It was new.  And we had a baseball field.  We had tennis courts.  We had all of those things that a community in the '50s [1950s] that was just heard--unheard of.
Story_ID: 12425
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of youngster were you?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Well, I guess I was, I was always, I guess I got it through the genes.  I was probably a child that had to--definitely, needed some structure.  I mean I, I wasn't a bad kid.  I was just, I would get into things.  I mean if, if it was something going on, I was either instigating it or very near it.  So if the, if we wanted to do something we shouldn't be doing, I was usually the guy trying to, trying to orchestrate that.  So I guess in that sense I was kind of a, of a leader, a lot of my friends--I was a very good student.  And I was very comfortable dealing with, with adults and so forth, and I guess that was because of the, the environment in which I grew up in, being in such a large family with uncles and aunts that were--I don't even call uncle and, aunt today, they're just, they were just--in fact, they kid me.  They say, "I'm your uncle," and "I'm your, I'm your aunt."  And I say, "Yeah, but you're also younger than I am too."  So it was a situation, I was somewhat of a, of a rebel, I guess.  I--not anything malicious, but, you know, if there was something going on, either good or bad, I was usually somewhere near it.  And in more cases than not, it was probably something we shouldn't have been doing.
Story_ID: 12426
Speaker 1: Was the church a big part of you all's--,
Speaker 2: Oh, the church was very big, yeah.
Speaker 1: --upbringing?
Speaker 2: That was, my father [O. C. Robinson] was one who was--which is an interesting story.  He used to tell all the time.  And one of the reasons he was, he was not really a guy that spent a lot of time, he had to work so hard, he didn't spend a lot of time in church.  He would go on occasion.  But he would always insist that we go.  I used to tell him, I said, "Hey, dad, why you--you know, you always insist that we go to church, and then you, you know"--I could hear him and my mother [Wanda Robinson] arguing all the time about church.  And his deal was that he would always remember the minister when he was growing up in, in Eureka [Texas].  The minister would always show up at my grandparents' home on Sunday.  And my, my father used to remember the, you know, there used to be a pile of chicken there.  And the, and he, he said, to this day, he just watched this minister sit there and eat, eat and eat.  And so he's got a, he's a got a real, he had a real issue with ministers of the time.  So--but he would always insist that we would go to church.  And so we were at Sunday School, BTU [Baptist Training Union], the usher--we, we did everything that was going on in the church.  And, of course, there was some act--sports activities.  And we didn't go to church in the community that we lived in.  We went to church in another part of town.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: The church I grew up in was Hopewell Baptist Church [Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Hopewell?
Speaker 2: Hopewell, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was in another part of town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in east Dallas, yeah.  It was--and because that was church, when we lived in east Dallas, one of my aunts, my mother's [Wanda Robinson's] closest sister and my uncle was, you know, he was a deacon in the church.  He was very active, and my, my mother, my aunt, that is probably my closest aunt and, and my uncle, uncle Jerry.  My mother and father, they were very--they did a lot of social stuff together.  And when we lived--at one time, we lived with them together, you know, my, my parents, when they first, you know, I guess got started, they lived in the same, in the household.  So they were very, very close.  And it was the church that they attended.  So when we left east Dallas, that's when we moved to Hamilton Park [Dallas, Texas].

Speaker 1: All right, now, what about school?  Where did you--what was the name of your school and what was school like?
Speaker 2: I went to, I went to Paul Laurence Dunbar for my first and second grade.  And then when we moved to Hamilton Park [Dallas, Texas]--Hamilton Park, as I'd mentioned, was a school that was built there in the community.  It was first through twelfth.  So I actually went to Hamilton Park Elementary, Junior High and High School [Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, what was school like for you?  How did you like school?
Speaker 2: Actually, I enjoyed school.  I, I--because I was very popular in school.  I, I was an athlete and I was a good student.  So school was not much of a challenge for me.  And, of course, I was a social kind of person, so my school days growing up were just great.  It was one of those kind of, you know, I knew the teachers really were concerned about us.  It was a segregated school, new school, used books.  But we really did have a lot of school spirit, and because the school was kind of the centerpiece for the community, the, the school, either--whether it was the football team, the basketball team, the band, everything became the rallying point for the community.  So Hamilton Park community was almost defined by the school, Hamilton Park High School.  So I thoroughly--in fact, I, I remember thinking that, that I don't think it could--I could have had a better childhood, because I really--you know, we had student council.  We didn't have a situation where you felt, you, if you're gonna have a student council, you're gonna be, there're gonna be elections.  And we had campaigns, and we did everything that you would do in any other, you know, in, in a integrated school.  The difference was, is that the people who--regardless of who won, they were gonna look like you.  And so it was situation where you were not viewed--we may have been a minority in terms of the, the school district, but in the school, it was 100 percent black.  So it was one of those unique environments that I think prepared me, as well as anything I've done, for, for moving to another phase of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember any teachers in grade school and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Mr. McKnight.  Mr. McKnight was my sixth grade teacher.  And--which was unusual because I--he was the only male teacher I remember in elementary school.  And he also is the reason that I pledged Alpha [the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity] because he was an Alpha.  And I just happened to see him when I was home for the school reunion this past year.  And he looks well, and, and he taught me when--and, and he taught everybody else in the sixth grade.  He was--because at the school, you started kind of like on, on the left end, and you kind of moved up and moved up.  And then when you went to sixth grade, that was when you--Mr. McKnight.  Then you went over past the office, and now, you were in the, in the seventh and eighth grade, where you started changing classes as opposed to having all your classes in one room.  So he was, he was a very, very influential.  He was tough.  You always thought that he was mad at you, but he was really someone that stands out in my mind.  And I don't know whether he stood out, I can't even remember what Mr. McKnight taught me in terms of a class.  I just remember that he was very--you know, anytime there was anything positive happening, he was there.  And anytime there was something that, some discipline to meted out, he was also there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about high school?  Is there anything about grade school you want to tell us or did you get--?
Speaker 2: No, just grade school, was just that I was, like I said, I, I just thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was one of those kind of experiences that, that you'd love to repeat.  I mean it was just--I just can't think of anything that was negative about it.  Oh, wait, one, one exception and that is I, I have my aversion to rice.  Today, I do not eat rice, and the reason I don't eat rice is in Ms., Mrs. Harrison, my fourth grade teacher, forced me to eat some rice without sugar on it.  And it was the worst taste and I, and I think I made a vow that if I ever got to the point where I could choose what I was going to eat, the one thing I would never eat is rice.  And to this day, I do not eat rice.
Speaker 1: You used to eat rice with sugar on it a lot?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--some people did.  And I, and I thought it would make it taste better.  I, I just knew that it--and, and I guess, my wife says, "Well, first of all, Ray, it was school rice.  And that's a little different than"--but, I don't care if it's dirty rice.  I don't care whether people say this is good, if it's rice, I don't want it.  And I will not eat it. (laughs)
Speaker 1: So the teacher made you eat it?
Speaker 2: The teacher made me eat it one day, and she said, "And you'd better not gag."  And I had to sit there and eat that.  And I remember it as the most distasteful experience.  And I said, "If I ever get out of this situation, I'll never eat another kernel of rice if I can avoid it."

Speaker 1: Did your parents like talk about the politics or the racial situation at home a lot in Dallas [Texas]?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they, they did, and they talked about it more, of course, this, of course, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was, you know, was very prevalent on the scene then.  And, of course, the stores--you know, many of the stores, H. L. Green's [Company] was the only store we could go in downtown.  The, all the stores were segregated.  But we were taught on the basis of saying, this is the way it is, not that they liked it or anything else.  My mother [Wanda Robinson] was, you know, she did domestic work.  And she worked for a, a pediatric there that, that really looked out for a lot of black kids.  He was a well-known pediatrician there in, in the Dallas area.  And his--he had kids that were kind of my age.  I didn't know them.  I just knew who they were.  But, you know, we--it was just something that we basically accepted.  The, the difference was, in, in our community, it was so self-contained.  So we never really had a desire to go to Hillcrest [white subdivision, Dallas, Texas], which is where a park was, to swim, because we could swim at Hamilton Park [black subdivision, Dallas, Texas].  We never had a desire to go to Hillcrest to play on their baseball field because we had a baseball field as well.  So it was one of those kind of things where, not that I necessarily believed in it, but it was truly separate and reasonably equal.  That's how we felt it, that's how we saw the world.  We were living in a new community, so all the homes, even though they were frame houses, not terribly, you know, expansive or anything.  They were just frame houses, you know, one bath, kind of room--you know, deal, but they were houses that the bedrooms, unlike what we'd been, you know, used to, cause I'd live in a duplex.  One car garage, and then the people who had money had two-car garages and had brick on them.  So it was one of those kind of communities that--and we had the shopping center, grocery store, all of that was right there, self-contained in the community.  So the only conversations we had about politics and race at the time was the theater.  We used to have to go up in what, you know, what's commonly called the crow's nest at the Majestic Theatre [Dallas, Texas].  You couldn't go downstairs.  You had to go upstairs.  And then shortly, as I recall growing up, I remember going over to the State Theater which was in North Dallas, which is a black theater.  That's the one that we tended to go to.  But when a--a movie was coming to town the first time, you could only up, up in the crow--and, and I remember, but it wasn't even talked about as though it was negative.  It was just like this is kind of what was accepted.  I think the, the political side of the thing, it was when I got older, in the, in the high school area, during the time, this is, you know, probably in the mid-60s [1960s], that's when we started to realize that, hey, this is, something's wrong here.  What, why are we getting these books that are, that have been used and, you know, it was, we became aware--and primarily, because I think Dr. King had come on, on the scene.  And, you know, he started pointing out some things that just weren't right.  And--but my parents were never really that active in the, in the political side.  They were, they were really more into the, let's make sure we do all we can for our family, give them what we got and, and let's make sure, and that--and they were very stickler about education.  You're gonna finish school.  That was the one thing that, that was--if there was any rule that my parents had, and that is, you will finish high school.  You will absolutely finish high school because neither of them did.  And then they wanted me to go to college.
Story_ID: 12429
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember, was music and television a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, music, more so than television.  We had television, but it was not, you know--you know, music was, was definitely part of it because that, that was all of the, the James Brown, the Apollo [Theater, Harlem, New York], you know, we--.  This was the, the, the Motown Revue.  So, yeah, music was a huge part of it.  I mean, I like to say I grew up with Stevie Wonder, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye because Motown Revue, that's during that time.  I mean these were guys, the Temptations, people look at the Temptations now and say, well, I knew when they were really, you know, really young.  I had no idea how young, that they not much older than I was.  And so we would go down to, you know, to, you know, to the auditorium to see them and, and James Brown and his, his review.  Yeah, it was such a big part of it.  That was the real entertainment and the highlight for, for entertainment was, was that.  The sports things we did at school and any time any of those big names would come to town, whether it was Stevie--I mean if you can imagine going to see Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Martha and Vandellas, the Supremes and the Four Tops--
Speaker 1: All in one show?
Speaker 2: All in one show.  It was called the Motown Revue.  And that's what they would travel.  And it was like, you know, it was unbelievable.
Story_ID: 12430
Speaker 1: Tell me about high school.  What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Hamilton Park High School [Dallas, Texas] (laughs).  Yeah, high school was, was a continuation.  Of course, the people that you started with in the first grade, you were right there with them.  And very few people kind of moved in and out.  So you kind of had long-lasting relationships from the second grade.  To this day, when we have a--we really don't have class reunions.  We have school reunions.  The classes weren't that large because we were a small school.  And you tend to know people that, that went there.  They were older than you were, but it was all part of Hamilton Park [Dallas, Texas].  So high school for me was, it was, again, it was a fun time.  I did a lot of--I mean I was active in--I was an honor student, but I was also an athlete.  And so I was able to--I was on the debate team, and I, you know, and I, and I played in the band.  I played basketball.  I played football until I broke my knee, and that ended the football stuff, which was frankly a blessing more than anything else because it forced me to kind of focus on some other things.  But, but I played baseball.  And so I did all this kind of sports things, and I also played in the band, which was a unique deal because the band traveled.  And we'd go down to Prairie View College [now Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical University of Texas, Prairie View, Texas] which is a nice trip away.  You can get away from home and spend some time, you know, on trips with your friends and so forth to the, to the state band contests.  So band, so I would say that I was probably involved in, in just about every facet from student government, sports, you know, very good student, to, to, to everything that was going on in the, in the high school.  So again, it was one of those kind of things where when I graduated from high school, I really didn't want to leave because it was that comforting to me because I was in an environment that I knew people who knew me.  And it was not a, not a very, it was not an uncomfortable life.
Story_ID: 12431
Speaker 1: Now, who were the teachers in high school or administrators that you admired or who helped you?
Speaker 2: Well, the first one was Mr. Cole, who was my, my math teacher.  He was, he was the guy that probably inspired me as much as anybody.  He taught math.  He made math easy for me, and I, and I was--again, I loved, I mean can you imagine somebody saying, I love algebra, you know. Algebra, geometry and, and--I was never that big on trig[onometry], but, but algebra and geometry I loved because I enjoyed Mr. Cole's class.  Mr. Goodlow, Mr. Goodlow was, taught history.  He was a guy that made history kind of be more than just remembering dates.  And he also, and, you know, he, he made sure that there was history that included people that looked like us.  So he was--those two people, you know, history, and then Mr. Nyland, who was our science teacher.  We, we'd go to science lab and we would do things in the science lab that, and it--you know, it was one thing to learn the formulas, but we, we liked to make things like the--we'd make stuff. I forgot what the combination was, and you'd drop it into some kind of acid, and explode.  We loved to do that kind of stuff.  I mean stink bombs, we had stink bombs.  We turned the school--we would make stuff like that all the time.  In fact, my science teacher, his daughter was involved in a serious automobile accident when we lived in New York [New York].  And it was the first time that my children had gotten a chance to sit down--and I went to get he and his wife to get them out of the city and bring them out to my home in [New] Jersey.  And, and just to kind of get them away from the scene where the daughter had this seriously bad accident.  And so my kids had a chance to say, "Mr. Nyland, what kind of student was, was Dad?"  And he would say, "Well, first of all, he was smart.  And he was mischievous.  And that's two bad combinations."  He said, "He didn't know it, but they used to call me 'Jack Nyland, the mad scientist,'" which is what we called him, we called him 'Jack'.  And he said, because he went around with the white, you know, science deal, I mean the smock on, what do they call it, the jacket.  And we used to make fun of him all the time.  And, you know, we didn't know we knew it.  But it--I did not know till that day that he knew we called him Jack.  And that was what we would always call him, and as opposed to Mr. Nyland.  Well, he would tell them about, you know, how he, he knew who it was.  We made the stink bomb, and we let the stink--and I mean it stunk up the whole school, like you wouldn't believe.  I mean just, just really foul, rancid.  And, of course, nobody could stay in the place, but they made us stay in it because we, we created it.  But he was, said, they would just do things, and not--and he would say, they wouldn't do bad things.  They'd just take what they would learn, and they would come up with some other thing to do.  We'd take the stuff that we'd go throw in the creek, where they had fish and stuff.  And it'd explode when it mixed with water.  It's like an aviation fuel.  And you threw it in the creek and it would explode.  And we'd do that to catch fish (laughs).  They said, what kind of a, what, what kind of a--where'd you guys learn this stuff, you know--had no idea, whatever that was thrown in there, it also could have been contaminating the, the--and we never even thought about that.  We just thought that, hey, you can see fish because it was clear.  And you throw this stuff in there.  And the fish think it's something they could eat, three seconds, it explodes, and the fish pop out (laughs).  And we didn't even eat the fish.
Speaker 1: So this was applied science?
Speaker 2: Applied science, I guess that's what it was.  And he would tell you, you know, he, he knew that's the kind of stuff we would do.
Story_ID: 12432
Speaker 1: So you were in a band--what did you play in the band?
Speaker 2: I played French horn.
Speaker 1: What'd you play in football?
Speaker 2: I played, I played defensive tackle.
Speaker 1: Defensive tackle?
Speaker 2: I was defensive tackle.
Speaker 1: Well, you're not that--how, I couldn't imagine you'd be that big, I mean much bigger in high school than you are now.  You don't seem like a--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) That's exactly--I played, I played defensive tackle, and I played offense, I played the end on offense.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And cause I was, I was tough--I mean I was, I considered myself a tough guy.  And, you know, and I wasn't terribly fast.  So it was one of those kind of deals where I played to the--I played tackle or defense and end--split end on offense.
Speaker 1: Okay, so on offense, you actually caught passes?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what about basketball?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a guard.  I was a starting guard.  That was my real sport.  That was my passion, it was basketball.
Story_ID: 12433
Speaker 1: How did you break your knee?
Speaker 2: Motorcycle accident, yeah.  I was--a friend of mine and I were--I had just gotten a motorcycle.  Motorcycle was the thing, a fad at the time, and we were--some guys ran me off a road, fell over in a ditch and I broke my right knee, which is, you know, it was a blessing in disguise because, one, it ended my football career which I was not gonna be a very big defensive tackle.  I mean I wasn't gonna be, do too much in football anyway.  But it also, when I broke my knee, ended the football, and that's when I basically started working for AT&T [Corporation].
Speaker 1: So did you, okay, that wasn't until after you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, after, we--after the, I was in a cast for a while.  I did that in, that would've been in 1964.  And then in '65 [1965]--
Speaker 1: You were still in high school?
Speaker 2: I was still in high school when I broke it, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 12434
Speaker 1: But I started working for AT&T [Corporation] in '65 [1965] when I was in high school also as a summer associate.
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Is this some sort of internship or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was actually the, the--there was this guy come--came out to our high school [Hamilton Park High School, Dallas, Texas] and said they were trying to get blacks to become technicians, working for this company called AT&T Long Lines [later AT&T Communications].  And my high school counselor, to show how, how little she knew about it, she said, "I think AT&T Long Lines is, is a subsidiary of Southwestern Bell [Corporation, now SBC Communications, Inc.]."  But the main thing was, is that they were paying almost two dollars an hour.  And I was making 75 cents an hour washing pots in the summers.  And these, this company is gonna pay almost two dollars an hour.  And you were gonna be installing circuits, soldering, on a soldering block and putting in circuits and, and testing to make sure that you had continuity through the office.  That sounded like a lot better than washing pots.  And secondly, it was a situation where, you know, they're gonna pay you significantly more money to do it.  So my take was, how do I sign up, and there was no time clock.  You know, if you just, you show up; you know when you're supposed to come to work, and you know when you're supposed to leave.  So I took a test, and I didn't realize they were basically trying to get blacks in the test room.  So I was really the first black to be hired as a technician in the Dallas [Texas] test room.
Story_ID: 12435
Speaker 1: Let me go back to high school for a minute.  There's something, I wanted to ask you about two things in high school and then about graduation.  But in 1963, did you remember the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, I mean that was the most--I mean I sat there and watched that on TV.  And that's when I really--I had a chance to meet Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] after that.  One of my ministers in Hamilton Park [Dallas, Texas], he came and spoke in Dallas.  And he took me to, you know, to see him.  And when I heard that speech [King's 'I Have a Dream' speech] that they had, it was just, I mean, I, yeah, I, I remember exactly where I was watching that speech.
Speaker 1: Okay, where were you on that day?
Speaker 2: I was at 12130 Galva Drive in Dallas, Texas watching it on TV.
Story_ID: 12436
Speaker 1: Now, also, a big event in Dallas [Texas] took place, it was--about a couple months later, was the assassination of [President] John F. Kennedy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's also my wife's birthday.  And so that was, that day was the day we were supposed to play--not Garland [Texas], I can't think of the city.  It was a small town outside of Garland that, that we were playing them for the district--a guy named Champ, Champion was the fullback.  We were supposed to play them for the, for the district--Greenville, Greenville, Texas.  We were gonna play them for the, for the, the Single A [high school football] championship on that Friday night.  And we were there at the school--I'm sorry, it was Saturday rather.  We were there in Dallas, the day of the assassination of President Kennedy.  Myself and three of my buddies, we basically were at home playing tunk because we said--they said that anybody that was gonna go down and see the President could be out of school that day because the President was coming to town.  Well, one, we didn't have any way of getting downtown.  Secondly, it was a time to be out of school, and we decided we'd go stay out of school and play tunk (laughs).  We got back to school.  We did not know the President had been shot until we got back.  And when we got busted,  we said, "Yeah, we saw him."  They said, where'd you see him? Said, "we saw him right down on Elm Street."  And he never made it there.  And that's when we found out.  Of course, we, you know, didn't get in trouble because they knew we were lying.  But we were definitely not there.  We just missed that morning because we didn't want to go to school.
Speaker 1: You must have really considered that bad luck, right? (Laughter)
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, right.  Yeah, you lied and said, "We were, yeah, we saw him, we saw him."
Speaker 1: And the whole world knows that--
Speaker 2: The whole world knows, and we don't even know he's been shot.  So, yeah, that was, and that also happened to be my wife's birthday,
Speaker 1: November 22nd.
Speaker 2: November 22nd.
Story_ID: 12437
Speaker 1: Now, when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, you had already started working for AT&T [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I started working for AT&T--I graduated from high school in '66 [1966].  I started working for AT&T in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you think you were gonna go on to college or continue working for AT&T?
Speaker 2: No, in fact, what I was planning on doing was I was, because I was making two dollars an hour, the war in Vietnam was raging.  I knew my parents, you know, could not afford to, to really send me to college.  They had a $500 policy, but I had applied to college and, but I had started working full time as a technician.  Vietnam was also raging at the time, and so I had gotten to know some of the guys there that were technicians and so forth.  And they were saying, you know, you can join the Air Force, come back and be a, a top-paid technician.  And at the time, I think a technician was like making $200 a week.  And, of course, I'm sitting here making two dollars an hour.  And I said, hey, and I said, "$200 a week, that's a lot of money."  I mean, and, and the top keeps going up every year.  So I figured that if I--I was working as a technician.  I already knew the work.  All I had to do was to go and, you know, work as AT&T, join the military or join the Air Force, come back, after four years, I'd be a top scale for a technician which could be four hundred bucks a week, when I got back out of the service.  And my high school counselor, by the way, was saying, "That's not a bad strategy," because at the time, you know, it wasn't a whole lot that was there.  She thought I had the capability, but, you know, if I didn't have the money to go to college.  And I had this wonderful job because everybody knew about the job, which was, you know, "Ray Robinson's working"--doing something that was unique for black folks at the time.  So my take was, I'm just go ahead and, and work.  My parents, on the other hand, as I mentioned, were adamant about me going to college.  They had this $500 policy.  So one of the guys who worked for AT&T, a guy who probably is--a white guy.  His name is Gene Rollet.  We called him Pappy.  He was a guy that, that--I worked evenings.  I worked Monday through Thursday, three hours a day, which gave me twelve hours.  And then I worked eight hours on Saturday, which gave me twenty-hour, gave me a twenty-hour work week.  Well, I was doing that from nineteen--December of 1965 until I graduated from high school in May of '66 [1966].  But since I was working the evening shift, I saw this guy, Gene Rollet and with a name like Ray Robinson, he would say, "Hey, Sugar Ray, you gonna go to college? " And I said, "Nah, Pappy, why would I go to college?  I mean I can be a top technician like you."  This guy used to wear a tie.  He was the only technician that always--I never noticed he wore a tie.  And he said, well, you know, "You don't want to go to college?"  I said, "Well, no, why?"  "Well, why would I go to college when I had a great job?"  College for me was getting a job, and since I had a job, there's no reason to go to college.  That was my logic.  And so Pappy basically said, "Sugar Ray, you see that guy over there that's my boss.  He's a supervisor?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "He doesn't know as much about this business as you do.  And he's my boss.  And he makes a lot more money than I do."  He said, "And the only difference that he has, is he went to the University of Texas [Austin, Texas], and he has a degree."  He said, "You ought to go to college if you can go.  Take a leave of absence, and if it doesn't work out, you can always come back," which is what I ended up doing.  So he was the one that suggested that I take a leave of absence.  My parents had $500.  I went to the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado].  My first quarter tuition was 450 [dollars].  So the $500 was wiped out.  I mean it couldn't even pay for me to get there and, and my first year, not to mention room and board.
Story_ID: 12438
Speaker 1: How did you choose the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Since I had broken my right knee, and I was still pretty much tied to athletics, I didn't want to go to a school that basically stressed football.  Texas, football is king.  And I wanted to just get out of Texas.  So, as it turned out, I had--my parents had visited Denver on vacation.  I did not--I'd never been there before in my life, but I had relatives in Denver.  My mother's oldest sister lived there.  So I applied to the University of Denver, and they accepted me, not knowing it was private school, and it cost $450 a quarter for tuition, another $500 a quarter for room and board, and, and God knows--I mean that's just--I mean it was gonna cost more money than my parents could ever dream of paying.  So I went out there on, on just the idea that I was gonna go there, taking Pappy's [Gene Rollet, Robinson's mentor] idea, if it didn't work out--which I figured it wouldn't, then I could just join the Air Force, come back and work for AT&T [Corporation].  I got there, did my first year--I mean my first quarter, didn't have money to go back in the second quarter, applied for a scholarship, and I ended up getting a scholarship.  And I, and so my undergraduate and--I got scholarships for my undergraduate and graduate work.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, were there any teachers at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado] that really stand out?
Speaker 2: Yes, my law prof that I'd mentioned to you earlier, Dr. Schaffer, who was my tax instructor and Dr. Walter who was my finance instructor.  Those were the three.  And that gives you an idea.  I had finance as my undergraduate [major] and with accounting as a, as a second [major], and finance.  And so I had basically enough hours to get a degree in finance, accounting or, or economics.
Speaker 1: Now, were there many black students at the University of Denver?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  That was, that was a huge a change for me.  I went to the University of Denver, and just to give you an idea, in the dormitory I was in, there were 650 students.  Of the 650 students in the dormitory, there were three blacks.  One of them was my roommate.  So we went to the University of Denver, roughly, probably 8,000 students, about, less than a hundred blacks.  So I went from an environment that was all black to an environment that was predominantly all white, which was a huge change for me.
Speaker 1: Well, how'd you adjust to it?  I mean how did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was really, it was pretty easy because also, I mean that while I was--because my roommate was black, and I went to school thinking, this is gonna be a bad deal.  My roommate was from Rome, Georgia.  His name was Ruben Hawkins Scott.  And I remember going to--my dad [O. C. Robinson] told me when he sent me off to school--they didn't take me to school, they put me on a plane.  And I was, that was it.  They couldn't afford to fly and help me out with the plane, they--plus, they'd never flown.  So I got on a plane, the first time in my life, got there.  Some of the fraternities picked us up at the deal, thinking that they were gonna pick up freshmen that considered pledging their fraternities.  They didn't realize who I was.  We got there.  They dropped us off at the dormitory.  And I remember my dad telling me, he says, this guy from Georgia, you may have to, you know, may have to tighten him up a couple of times, but after that, it'll be okay.  So I'm going here thinking this guy from Georgia probably is not gonna like me any more than I was gonna like him.  And I guess he--realize now, I'm coming from an environment where I don't know anybody--other than adults--I don't know anybody, no friend have I had that wasn't black.  So I go there thinking I got a roommate that's probably not gonna be real thrilled about this.  And so I got there, and he was in the room--the door was opened to the room when I got up there.  And I'm dragging stuff up, took a deep breath and I walked in and saw this guy leaning over.  And he said, I said, "Are you Ruben Hawkins Scott?"  And he said, "Are you Ray Robinson?"  I said, "Yeah."  And I think I may have said something like, "What kind of name is that for a brother?"  And he said, "That's the name my mother gave me."  And so he was my roommate for three years until I got married.  So that made it a lot easier for me because Ruben and I were probably the perfect roommates.  I was the social, outgoing guy.  Ruben was saying, "Aren't you gonna go and find out where the student union is and I mean, where the library is and on the tours?"  I said, "Nah, nah, nah, I know where the student union is.  I don't need to know any other things."  And, and so he got out among all the other people because the schools in Georgia had, had actually integrated before the schools in Texas.  So he had gone through the experience.  I had not.  So he was probably--he helped me a great deal, because he met a lot of people from different parts of the country.  And they would always be either in my room or, you know, in our room.  And so I got a chance to meet and socialize with people who I just had not before.  And then some were just very good friends of mine, and--like some guys from Chicago [Illinois].  A guy named Harold--Howard J. Katz from New York, parents own Katz's Delicatessen.  Tennessee Ernie Ford's grandson was there.  Averill Harriman's grandson--son was there.  Buck Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford's son was there.  Buck Ford and Averill Harriman's grandson was there.  So it was--and it was a private school.  It was a kind of a, considered to be a party school.  So I met some really neat people, and kind of found out that they were really no different than me.  That we--they flunked out as badly as I did, and they partied as hearty as I did.  And so it was a whole different kind of experience for me.
Story_ID: 12440
Speaker 1: So you, you finish the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado] in 1970?
Speaker 2: Right.  And I got my M.B.A. in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you--did you go back to AT&T [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yes, what I did is I actually--when I did my freshman year at the University of Denver, the guy--when Pappy [mentor Gene Rollet]  told me to take the leave of absence, before I went to school, I had to go in, because I had said--before they'd made me full time, after I graduated from high school [Hamilton Park High School, Dallas, Texas], they said, the guy who was my district--my, my manager, said, "Are you going to go to college?"  And I said, "No, I can't afford to go to college," which is what Pappy told me to tell him.  Well, when the summer was up, and I was getting ready to go off to college in September, I had to go back to this guy to tell him I was resigning because I was gonna go to college.  Well, my supervisor who worked for this guy was in charge.  And I thought I was gonna have to deal with my supervisor, but as it turned out, I had to go to this guy.  His name was Red Haggert.  And I said, "Look, Mr. Haggert, I'm gonna go to college."  He said, I thought you told me you weren't gonna go to college when you--when we made you full time."  And I said, "I told you I didn't have any money to go to college, and now that I worked all summer, I got money."  And so he was really mad.  And so he said, "I hope you know that leave of absence that, that you got while I was gone--," --'cause, my supervisor signed off on the paperwork--he said, "I hope you know that that does not mean you're guaranteed a job."  I said, "Yes, sir, I can understand that."  So I went off to college and when I came back that summer, I'd had, had some very good grades.  I had a, better than a three (point) six grade point average.  So when I came back I stopped by the central office and, to see the guys that I worked for.  And I, and I saw my old supervisor.  And he said--I said, "How you doing, Mr. Dukes?"  He said, "Fine".  I said, "Well, can I see some of the folks here?  He said sure.  So I ran into Red Haggert, his boss, my supervisor's boss.  And he said, "What are you doing here?"  I said, "Well, I just wanted to see some of the guys."  And he said, "Well, look, this is a place of work, you know, don't be here long."  So he was really ugly.  So I walked through and said hello to some of the guys and so forth.  And so my supervisor said, "Are you gonna come to work for us?"  And I said, "Well, Mr. Haggert said that, that there was no opening."  So Pat Dukes looked at me, like (surprised expression), no openings?  He said, you know, the district manager, Joe Hammond, has always asked about, you know, you ought to just stop by the office and see him.  He's downtown on Hammond Street, just, just say hello.  So I said, okay.  So I went down out where it was.  It was not in the same building.  So I stopped by to see Joe Hammond, who was the District Manager and went in and said--told him--he said--who I was, "Oh, yeah, Sugar Ray, how you--," 'cause Sugar Ray was the name they all called me, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to avoid that, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it really is.  (Laughter)  I used to say, "My name is Ray Robinson and no I'm not."  But he said, he said, "What are you gonna do, Sugar Ray, this summer?"  I said, "Well, I'm gonna see if I can get on with Texas Instruments or something, see if  my--."  So he said, "You don't want to work for the phone factory anymore, huh?"  And so I said, "Mr. Haggert told me that, you know, there was no jobs."  And he looked, and he looked--I didn't notice it the time, but, you know, he said hmm.  Well, it took about twenty minutes for me to drive from downtown to my home in North Dallas [Texas].  And when I got there, my mother [Wanda Robinson] said, "Some guy by the name of Red Haggert called and said, be at work tomorrow morning and don't be late."  Now, that was the worst summer job I've ever had in my life, but I had a job because this guy was mad.  He thought I went down and--you know, I didn't do anything but what Pat Dukes had told me to do.  But apparently, they did have some openings.  And they said, "Why are we gonna--," you know, "this guy knows the work.  He's done, he's done well in school," and Joe Hammond-- so from that point on, every summer, between my coming back from college and going off, I was hired as a technician to work in the Dallas office.  So that's how I got all of the time that I got to retire at age fifty-five with thirty-five years, 'cause they gave me credit for all that time I worked.  So I worked every summer between 1966 and 1971, AT&T hired me to work.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what, what kind of work were you doing basically?
Speaker 2: I was a tech--I was installing, testing long-distance circuits.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you'd go into like a--what you'd have to go to a business or a home or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was a technical school.  They sent you out, they did the--they trained us internally.  They sent you to Kansas City [Missouri] to training and so forth.  So, you know, you learned how to use ohmmeters and all that kind of stuff--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --how to solder circuits.  It was really very basically--I mean it was considered the lowest level of technician work, but as far as I was concerned, it was--you were inside, it was air-conditioned and you didn't have to wash pots.
Story_ID: 12441
Speaker 1: After you got your M.B.A. [University of Denver, Denver, Colorado]--are there any stories around the M.B.A. that we need to know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably one of the best stories--between my--I got married [to Arlane Robinson] in my junior year in college.  And, I got--applied for a scholarship.  There was a scholarship that was being offered by a guy, a guy by the name of John King, the guy that owned King Resources [Inc.].  John King is the guy who used to have the King [Mountain] Ranch [Granby, Colorado].  He was the one that bought the gun that was used by Lee Harvey Oswald to kill [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy.  And he, he had a foundation-- it's called King Resources.  It was a company that he ran.  And they basically did oil exploration.  Big oil guy in, in Denver.  He had contacted the University of Denver looking for giving scholarships away to black students that were majoring in finance because he wanted to try and get more people into the area of finance, and that's what he was gonna do with this foundation.  As it turned out, I applied for that, job.  Now, I was a junior.  So I didn't fit the freshman, but I applied and they said okay, they said, "Okay, would you consider--if we gave you the scholarship would you consider going on to graduate school?"  Well, all I was trying to do was get out, 'cause I knew I was gonna get married that summer.  And I knew my parents [O.C. Robinson and Wanda Robinson] were gonna be livid about me getting married before I got out of school.  They wanted me to graduate from school.  They thought I was going--if I got married, I wouldn't graduate from school.  As it turned out, I--not only did I graduate, I was going--went on and got my masters.  So I got a scholarship on top of the, the--my scholarship at Texas, I got a scholarship to pay for my room, board, tuition and travel through the King Resources Foundation.  So I went back and I kept working that summer.  Came back, my wife and I got married.  And so then I, I graduated, well, my daughter [Christy Rae Robinson] came along in 1970, the year of my, my senior year.  And that was at the time when Vietnam was really raging.  And during that period of time, you could be drafted out of college unless you sign this thing saying that you, you know, you waive your, I mean, you, you basically--they wouldn't touch you in college, but once you got out of college, you had to, you had to go to the service.  Well, I signed it.  It was an SS104.  I was in the first lottery that they had for, you know, just selecting people to go.  I got a low lottery number.  I had a child and I thought well, since I have a child, I'm not gonna have to go in the service.  They reminded me that I waived my right to any future deferment when they gave me the opportunity to finish school.  The guy, John King, of King Resources suggested that I join the Colorado National Guard.  And I said, "How can I get on-- they've got a waiting list?"  And he said, "Just go down and apply."  Well, obviously, he pulled some strings.  So I got into the Colorado National Guard, which is how--between my undergraduate and graduate work I went to basic training and came back to Colorado.  Then I went to, I did my graduate work.  So the big story there was that John King of King Resources essentially paid for my undergraduate and graduate work and was also responsible for me getting into the Colorado National Guard, which is how I fulfilled my military obligation.
Story_ID: 12442
Speaker 1: After graduate school [MBA at University of Denver, Denver, Colorado], you, I mean you're--did your position--did you qualify for a higher position at AT&T [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, what happened is, after graduate school I interviewed, with a banking kind of background, I was interviewed by Bank of America, Security Pacific National Bank, a lot of banks, and First National of Denver, General Motors.  So I had a job offer from every one of those companies.  But the best job offer I got was from AT&T because I'd worked for them, and they made me an offer that was going to pay me more.  And I could work in either Dallas [Texas] or Denver [Colorado].  Denver was where I went to school.  Dallas was the only--'cause I'd only lived in two places in my life, and I liked both of them.  But, the cities that were in the, what they called the Midwestern Region were Dallas, Houston [Texas], St. Louis [Missouri], Kansas City [Missouri], Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  The cities in the Western Region were Denver, Phoenix [Arizona], Los Angeles [California], San Francisco [California], Seattle [Washington].  I--and since I was gonna have to move around, I chose the Western Region.  So I went to work for AT&T, running the personnel functions in the district office in 1971, August 16th, 1971, in fact.
Speaker 1: Well, how was that?  I mean were you like a groundbreaking employee or--?
Speaker 2: No, it was, it was--they, no, AT&T had a program.  It was called the Fast Track program, where they would hire you, if you were in the top 10 percent of your class, you would be hired out of college, put into some--on a fast track program.  And you were expected to progress rapidly to district level in anywhere from four to seven years.  I happened to make it in five.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But there other black, employees that came in with you?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, there were, not very many.  Not, but it was, there was, it was a program really for just people who were, did exceptionally well in, in school.  And they were just hiring, they hired a very few.  But if you didn't, if they didn't think you had the potential to make it after the first year, you would be--you were asked to resign.
Story_ID: 12443
Speaker 1: With all the talk about affirmative action these days, were there white employees on the job that felt that you were only there because of affirmative action?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure, absolutely.  And, and that, in fact, many of them felt that way.  Now, unlike with most of these kids coming out of college, most of them did not work for AT&T [Corporation] prior.  So I came in with a little bit of an advantage in that I--not only did I know the work, I had actually done the kind of work that AT&T was doing.  So they could only go so far with saying that I'm not qualified.  I did have the grades.  I had the undergraduate.  I had the graduate degree [MBA, 1971, University of Denver, Denver, Colorado].  So I had a little more than some 'cause all you needed was an undergraduate degree.  So I had the undergraduate, the graduate degree [University of Denver], and I'd worked as a technician.  Now, in my opinion, I think I was as qualified--better qualified than most.  Some thought that I got it because I was black, I'm sure.  And I would say that because of affirmative action, I got the job as a high school student because of affirmative action.  And I think it also probably had something to do with me getting hired as a, as a, as a, what they called MDip manager, the, this Fast Track program.  I'm sure that had a lot to do with it.
Story_ID: 12444
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the highlights of or interesting stories about your involvement with AT&T [Corporation]?  I mean, over-- 'cause you were with AT&T for a long time.
Speaker 2: Thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, thirty-five years.
Speaker 2: I guess probably the biggest one would be when I left AT&T in Denver [Colorado] and that district office job, here I was a, at the time it would be 1971, '72 [1972].  In 1972, which is, what's that?  Thirty, thirty-one years ago--.
Speaker 1: Then you were like twenty-four.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four.  AT&T named me the Operations Manager responsible for NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado].  Now if you understand NORAD, NORAD is where they have the, the secret in the mountain kind of facility.  And it's the--it's designed to tell us anytime there was a nuclear war.  [General Daniel] 'Chappy' James was the four-star general in charge of NORAD.  And so you had a black, four-star general in charge of it.  NORAD's only function--you had SAC, which was the Strategic Air Command at Offutt [Air Force Base, Nebraska] which would scramble the jets if we got into a nuclear war.  And you had NORAD which would be the group that would tell you why you should scramble.  So the, so the key thing that NORAD had was communications.  AT&T provided all those communications.  AT&T in 1972 made me responsible for that mountain [Cheyenne Mountain].  And here I was, twenty-four years of age.  I'm in the Colorado National Guard as a buck sergeant, E5, I'm in the Colorado National Guard, a supply sergeant, but my civilian job was a full bird colonel equivalency responsible for all of the communications inside of NORAD.  I thought that was the most awesome responsibility I could have.  And that was something. That was my second job.  I didn't know whether I was being set up or whether I was really being tested.  But it was, it was a job that, that had some challenges, but I came out of it.  To this day, my kids to this day--my son [Shane Robinson] was born in Colorado Springs so he doesn't remember, but my daughter [Christy Rae Robinson] does, that it was the most unique job in the world.
Story_ID: 12445
Speaker 1: During that same time is when we--you've heard of the infamous DEFCON status, where you, if we go on the DEFCON four [sic], you know, it means we're preparing for a nuclear war.  We went into a DEFCON four [sic, DEFCON III, a more heightened alert than DEFCON IV] status while I was there, which means I got buttoned up inside that mountain with a bunch of technicians for about two days.
Speaker 2: Now, what caused that DEFCON status?
Speaker 1: That's when, when [U.S. President Richard M.] Nixon was trying to hang on to his presidency, and he tried to have a diversion off of the Watergate stuff by saying, "I've warned the, the Russians if they get involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we will, we will get involved."  And so they created, it was--I shouldn't say this that way, but it, but some people felt that it was a, it was a political alert and not really a major alert because we--the Arab-Israeli conflict had been going on for years and for him to send out that, that deal, it was trying to divert some of the heat off of Watergate.  But regardless of that, they still buttoned us up inside that mountain.  And our families were outside, and here we are inside the mountain, which meant--there were two schools of thought, that that place could hit by a nuclear bomb and everything around would be destroyed and we'd inside there.  So.
Speaker 2: What mountain was it?
Speaker 1: Cheyenne Mountain.
Speaker 2: Cheyenne Mountain?
Speaker 1: Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's where NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] is headquartered, even to this day.
Speaker 2: That's beautiful territory out there.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if you drove out and you saw this mountain range, you'd say, you mean they have buildings inside that mountain?  And they got big steel blast doors that they close and, and to, to--in the event of a nuclear war, that's where they would basically conduct the war from, one of the sites anyway.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Story_ID: 12446
Speaker 1: And again, when you think about it, the only thing you could do from that site [NORAD, North American Aerospace Defense Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado] is communicate.  And that--so AT&T's [Corporation] role there was critical.  And, and I was the person responsible for that, at twenty-four years of age, an E5, buck sergeant and, and, in fact, the two-star general used to say, "Ray, what kind of unit do you have?"  He thought I, when I said I had to go to summer camp, two weeks summer camp, he thought I was taking one of--a unit, because I was a [Colorado National Guard] reservist.  He thought I was taking a unit off to summer camp.  He said, "What kind of unit do you have?"  I said, "It's, it's a, it's a signal unit, 140 Signal Battalion.  He said, "Oh?"  He thought I was the battalion commander.  He said, "Boy, you're awfully young for a battalion--."  I said, "I'm not a battalion commander.  I'm a Supply Sergeant."  He said, "Wait a minute.  The guy who's responsible for all the technology inside of this mountain is a supply sergeant in the army?"  They just made him think the army was, you know, was crazy.
Speaker 2: It is strange.  I mean it is, just to think of it, for anybody to think about that, you know, really, it's strange.
Speaker 1: But when, if you think about how I got in.  Remember, I got into the reserves simply because I was trying to fulfill my military obligation.  They could have made me a truck driver.  It really didn't matter.  All I wanted to do was fulfill my military obligation without having to go to Canada (laughter).  So I was in a supp--I was in a signal unit, which was still part of communications.  But my job in it was a supply sergeant.  So I wasn't even an officer.
Speaker 2: Really, it's strange the way things work.
Speaker 1: It really was.
Story_ID: 12447
Speaker 1: So how long did you serve in that capacity [at NORAD, North American Aerospace Defense Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: I was there for about, I was there for two years.  And then I moved from there to San Francisco [California] where I was Sales Manager for San Francisco, East Bay [California] and Hawaii.  And I was there until I became the National Account Manager in United Airlines in Chicago [Illinois].  Then I went back and became the District Sales Manager in Portland, Oregon.  Then I became the District Operations Manager in Albuquerque [New Mexico].  And then from there, I became a Market Manager in New Jersey, and, and just--and then from Jersey to, to International Settlements Manager in Belgium, back to New Jersey where I did personnel.  Then to Atlanta [Georgia], New Jersey, Atlanta, New Jersey, Atlanta, New Jersey, Atlanta.  So it's thirteen moves I had in total.
Speaker 1: So you had to relocate each time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, mh-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that disruptive to your home life?
Speaker 2: It was, but since my wife [Arlane Robinson] and I were, you know, we got married when I was a junior in high school [Hamilton Park High School, Dallas, Texas], and we--the only place we'd ever lived was Dallas.  And so we were in Denver [Colorado].  We moved to Colorado Springs and San Francisco.  So it was one of those kind of deals that we just, you know, we were moving.  And at that time, you know, they made a, you know, you could make money on moves because you could buy a house, and they would buy your house from you.  It's not like it is today where you, you know, you could get stuck.  The company would pay for your house and pay for the moves.  But my, and my family was so young then, the, the kids, it didn't bother them that much.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, now, what was the highest position you attained at AT&T [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: The President of AT&T, Southern Region, which is a job I had until April 30th of this year.
Speaker 1: And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there from 1966 until 2003, seven years.
Speaker 1: Oh, from '96 [1996] to 2003?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  I was president of the region.  I came in, and that was the nine states here in the Southeastern Region, which, forty-two thousand employees, five and a half billion dollars and nine states.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a lot.
Speaker 2: So that was, that was--so I went from technician to president of a region, which is--never thought I'd go that far.  In fact, I, I sometimes wish Pappy [Gene Rollet] were still alive because I'm sure he probably thought, well, he may have thought I would have gone that far.  But I certainly never thought that.
Story_ID: 12448
Speaker 1: Did you ever have a crisis at AT&T [Corporation]--,
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you thought you were, you'd have to resign or something or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I had a crisis of, I had a--early on in my career, back when I was in Colorado Springs [Colorado], the job I had mentioned I left, when I left that job, the guy that replaced me, I thought was a friend.  And he actually tried to get me fired because he, he wanted to get into sales.  Sales was a, was a booming area.  I was in sales.  And he asked if I could help him, and I sent him a copy of a, of a test that I thought was no longer being used.  And he took the test and sent it into AT&T security.  AT&T Security came and approached me about it and said this test was still being--one of the tests I gave him was still being used.  And they wanted to know why I sent it.  And I told them that he asked me to help him.  And I said, "Why did he give it to you?"  And they said, "He said he did not want to get ahead that way."  But he called me and asked me to do it.  So I offered to resign at the time.  I said, "Look, I would--you know, if I've done something wrong, I don't want this to get out that I've done something wrong.  I'll just resign."  And the guy who was the security investigator, which is ironic, the guy who was the security, security investigator, this came--this happened to me when I was in Illinois, Chicago, became my head of security when I, when I became president of the region down here.  He was an investigator at the time and asked that I--he said, "Well, nobody wants you to resign.  They want to know are there any more of these copies out there." And they thought it was a big conspiracy.  I just said, "Look, I worked on the staff of the guy who was head of sales, and I could have access to it.  I made a copy, and I sent it to him."  It was just that simple.  And--but as it turned out, but poetic justice, and this is a long story, but just to make a long story short, the guy who, who did this to me, replaced me in Colorado Springs.  When I was promoted to District Operations Manager back in Albuquerque [New Mexico], I was back in the operations side, he was still in Colorado Springs.  We had a big division-wide meeting in Denver [Colorado].  Some of the guys said let's go out and play some basketball, and he was there with those guys.  He went out to play basketball with us.  As we were playing basketball on the, in Castle Rock, Colorado, we were running up and down the court.  This guy falls over, had a heart attack.  And I tried to revive him, and I say tried because he died.  The guy who was his boss, who happened to be a peer of mine was giving him mouth-to-mouth, and I was, you know, him the heart massage.  We got him to Castle Rock Medical Center.  He was still alive then.  And since he replaced me, the guy who was one of his supervisors that--I called him, told him to call this guy's wife and come to Castle Rock because Castle Rock is midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, come to Castle Rock because this guy had, had had a heart attack.  We thought, we didn't know he was dead.  I said, "Don't tell his wife, just come up."  Well, anyway, we were sitting there.  The guy comes in with a little bag, and we thought it was the, you know, a doctor, and it would be turn out to be the coroner.  He came out and told us about ten minutes after he'd gotten there, he said, "Guys, I got some bad news for you."  Your friend--I'm the county, you know, the county coroner, we just pronounced your friend dead.  And he said, "I understand his wife is on the way," and as soon as he said that, I saw this guy's wife walking through the door.  And I said, he said, "We need to figure out who's gonna tell her what and so forth."  I said, "Boy, we'd better figure fast cause she just walked in the door."  She came in, and she walked over to the doctor, obviously, and she said, "How's he doing?"  And he put his arm around her.  And his daughter was with her, so I went over and consoled his daughter.  But he died there in Colorado Springs, which is, was just a--so yeah, I almost resigned.  They could have fired me if they wanted to, but they chose not to.  The guy who said, "Ray, I don't want anybody in this company to think that they can get ahead the way this guy did you," he said, "because, frankly, I don't want that kind of person around me."  And he said, he thought he was gonna get ahead, but he will spend the rest of his career in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Now, this happened to me when I was in Chicago.  I moved back to Portland.  I was in Chicago nine months.  I moved my family for nine months, moved to Portland, Oregon; moved from Portland, Oregon to Albuquerque.  This happened, let's see, he, he did this to me in 1977.  And he died in 1981.  So four years after he did this, he died in the same job he had, he followed me in, three assignments ago.  I'd gotten promoted several times, and he had never gotten promoted.  So that was probably the most dramatic thing that I, that happened.  And I, and I've often, probably over years, I've often--I mean I've often thought about quitting, but that was probably the one time that I was really serious.  I was ready to resign because I just felt like, so how could somebody do me this way?

Speaker 1: Now, what's the most rewarding thing that happened when you were at AT&T [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: I think the most rewarding thing from a professional point of view is that AT&T had a very bad incident back in 1993.  You may have heard about it.  There was an incident where they portrayed the African Americans as a monkey.  They had these--AT&T was advertising its Global Reach.  And they had people in China with the little, you know, Chinese hat on talking on the phone.  They had people in Japan with the Japan smock talking on the phone.  They had people in Germany with their German, you know, Dutch Boy kind of suit, and they showed the continent of Africa.  And they had a person on the phone, and it was a monkey.
Speaker 1: It was not a person, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Not a person, it was a monkey.  And that came out in an interhouse publication.  And I mean the top blew off the whole thing.  Everybody just went bananas.  NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] got mad and everybody got mad.  I was here in Atlanta [Georgia], but I was serving as the President and Chief Exec--I mean was the President and CEO of a subsidiary of AT&T called AT[&]T Tritium.  Well, they got into so much hot water with the black community, they decided they, they were gonna bring someone in, in public relations at an officer level, which is when I got promoted to officer in 1994.  And they called, and they wanted to get someone black because they needed to somehow restore our image in the black community.  And they contacted me, and I said, I didn't want to leave Atlanta, never wanted to--I said, I'm gonna stay here.  I love the place.  My kids are here, and I'm just not gonna leave.  And the chairman of AT&T called and said, "Ray, we need you to do something."  And I said, "Can I do it from Atlanta?" 'cause I didn't want to turn down the promotion, but I sure didn't want to move.  He said, no, this job has to be here.  It has to report to me.  So it has to be in appearance, and--both in appearance as well as in reality.  It has to be in New Jersey.  And so I said okay.  But he said, we promise you we'll get you back into, to Atlanta.  Well, I went into this job, and my job was to restore AT&T's image in the black community as well as, in my opinion, and I expanded.  I said, "I'm not gonna take a job that deals with just the black community.  I want a job that deals with the total community."  So there's programs out now called AT[&]T Cares, where our employees go out in the community, and they volunteer and they, they're paid to give their time to the community efforts.  That program called AT[&]T Cares started under me.  And the restoring our image with the black community, if you'll look at 'Black Enterprise Magazine' that they're gonna be featuring a story, a story about this, I guess, probably this month.  But I started--that's when I got--I met, had a chance to meet people like [businessman] Earl Graves and other folks because I was working very, very hard to try and rehabilitate our image.  The NAACP, [Executive Director] Ben Chavis was there.  I was working with him, and [Rev.] Benjamin Hooks had just stepped down.  So we had problems all over because everybody thought that, how can a company like AT&T say to the world that we consider the continent of Africa, if you're African descent, you're a monkey, that's what it basically said.  So that was--the most rewarding part of that is I was able to help restore our image in the black community.

Speaker 1: Tell us how you became the CEO of this, of the--the president--.
Speaker 2: Where I am now [East Lake Golf Club, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I actually as, you know, as I mentioned, probably if you'd asked me what's the most rewarding thing that happened to me in my, my career outside of my professional career was when I became, you know, involved in golf.  And I became a member of Augusta National Golf Club.  I'm an avid golfer.  I love golf.  I--AT&T [Corporation] was the sixth corporate sponsor to join the East Lake Golf Club, which is a golf club out on the east part of town here that basically revitalized this community, which was a run-down, terribly, terribly bad community.  It was, it was called Little Vietnam.  It was a housing project that was just terrible.  Well, that now has been replaced with mixed-income housing, townhouses, condos, duplexes and apartment buildings, Olympic-sized swimming pool, a public golf course.  And it's a, it's a mixed-income community that you would not believe.  That, when I got involved in that with AT&T, the gentleman that's responsible for that effort, I went to see him one day to ask him about what I should do once I retire from AT&T since I was ready to retire.  And he asked if I would be willing to help turn the East Lake Golf Club and THE TOUR Championship, which is a tournament that's held there into a fifth major.  And I told him I'd, I'd be honored to do it, and that's how I got, got here.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, how do you turn a--how do you create a major golf tournament? How do you--.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you got to create, you got to have someone willing to have the tournament there.  So THE TOUR Championship is gonna be held at East Lake.  And then you have to basically market it in such a way that people understand that it's more than just Tiger Woods and some of his friends out there playing for a bunch of money.  THE TOUR Championship, unlike any other tournament, people are invited to play.  Tiger Woods does not have to play in tournament.  But THE TOUR Championship, because it's the season-ending tournament, and it has all the people who won money, it's the top thirty.  You say, who's the top money winner, and who's the thirtieth money winner on the tour?  And those are the only ones that play.  So you don't go there and make the cut or miss the cut.  By virtue of the fact that you had a good year, you play.  So you got a tournament with a lot of big names and then you just have to market it, and, you know, the marketing and promotions to make sure people see it for what it's doing, which is gener--I mean generating funds to support that community.  So that's what the--my charge is to, is to make sure that the, the story gets out as to what East Lake Golf Club is all about and what THE TOUR Championship is intended to do, which is to generate funds to help other communities solve the problem of mixed-income housing, which is something that I think we, we, you know, we need.

Speaker 1: What is the attraction of golf?  Many, for the--people in the black community for the most part, you know, golf is, is a distance or an (unclear).  In Chicago [Illinois], where we're from, there are two golf courses in close proximity on the South Side of Chicago, Jackson Park [Golf Course] and the South Side Cultural Center [Nine Hole Golf Course], and neither one of them is really filled with golfers, you know.  It's still not as popular sometimes as you think it should be.
Speaker 2: Well, I think what's happening is things are changing.  Golf used to be an all-white sport.  I mean it was a sport of kind of the elitist.  The, the only thing that blacks did in the, in the golf world was caddy.  What's happened though, is as we've had more success in business and so forth, you're seeing more and more people realize that--when I first moved to Atlanta [Georgia], one of my friends says, hey, you're gonna be the--I came here as the vice president, he said, "You're gonna be the vice president of Access Management.  The guys you're gonna be dealing with that, that are paying AT&T [Corporation] a lot of money, you're not gonna be able to go out and say, 'Hey, let's go play some basketball or let's go play some baseball.'  They'd look at you like you were a fool."  He said, "What they're gonna say, is, 'Do you play golf?'  And if you, if the answer to that is no, then you're gonna be, you're gonna be minimized."  So what's happened is, for me, I did not--I couldn't stand the game initially because I didn't play it well.  I didn't think it was much of a sport.  It didn't end in 'ball' because as far as I was concerned, if you played a sport, it had to end in 'ball.'  If it didn't have 'ball' in it, it wasn't a sport.  Therefore, golf wasn't a sport, but when I got into it, and I didn't take it very seriously early on, because I wasn't very good at it.  But then again, I went out and just tried to hit balls and have people tell me how to do it, you know, give me their pointers.  All they were doing was teaching me all their bad habits.  But then the more I got into it, and I started to take lessons and so forth, and then I found out that this game is really--and, of course, let's face it, Tiger [Woods]'s popularity has transformed a whole bunch of things, because all of a sudden I realized that the guys that I looked up to, I mean the guys who, who, you know, way back in time, back long before I was born, Joe Louis, avid golfer, 'Sugar' Ray Robinson, avid.  All, why was it that all these sports guys loved golf?  And then I started to realize there's Michael Jordan, you know, Harry Carson, who I play golf with a lot, you know.  The, it was like George Gervin, 'Dr. J.' [Julius Erving], I started going to these celebrity golf events.  And I said, man, these guys--and, and they didn't just play it because they were asked to.  They loved playing it.  So I realized that there must be something to this that's more athletic than I realize.  And what I found out is, it's really a--it's a mental game.  It's about as mental as you can become, and it has a physical attribute to it.  So I think it's a way, and it's, what it allows you to do, it allows you to play against yourself.  Not many sports allow you to do that.  And that's why the attraction.  And when you go out, if you play a bad round today, you know that you can play a good round tomorrow.  Unfortunately, you have more bad rounds than you do good rounds.
Story_ID: 12452
Speaker 1: East Lake Golf Club [Atlanta, Georgia] is a, seems to be, just from somebody hearing this for the first time, you know, it seems kind of a unique, I guess, in a sense, it's a not-for-profit effort?  It has a not-for-profit--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah, well, let me tell you what, first of all the East Lake--there's a East Lake Golf Club, and I'll give you the history of that.  The East Lake Golf Club is a golf club that Bobby Jones, who was a premier amateur golfer in the world, Bobby Jones learned to play golf at the East Lake Golf Club.  And that was a club that was, it used to be called the Atlanta Athletic Club at East Lake.  And it was a kind of considered--even though it's only ten minutes outside of the City of Atlanta, it was kind of considered to be the rural area back in those days.  But that's where he learned to play golf.  The gentleman that I work for was the one that was responsible for revitalizing that golf club.  What had happened is, back in the 60's [1960s], the Atlanta Athletic Club of East Lake decided they were going to build a new golf course out on the north side of town.  They sold the old golf club.  And it was two 18-hole courses.  They sold it to the City of Atlanta.  The City of Atlanta tore down one of the golf courses and put a housing project there called East Lake Meadows.  And again, the East Lake Meadows housing project became--it was, it could, it would be comparable to what Cabrini-Green [Homes housing project] is in Chicago [Illinois].  It was that, it was terrible.  They had drive-by shootings and all kinds of things happening there.  And it was built over the golf course.  The old, the, the clubhouse, where the clubhouse was and the private golf, it was still there.  So my boss, the guy that I work for, decided he wanted to do something to restore the legacy of Bobby Jones.  He wanted to restore a place that he had fond memories of growing up himself because he learned to play golf there, and thirdly, he wanted to do something to, to somehow solve the--break the circle of poverty that you see resonant in all these housing projects.  And he's a developer.  So what he did is he used his own money, he went out and bought the, the golf course, with the promise he was going to revitalize that community.  Well, revitalizing the community meant tearing down what was there, and rebuilding it.  But it wasn't just bricks and mortar.  He was also talking about rebuilding the lives of the kids and the people in the community.  So what he did is we have 642, 642 [sic, 542] housing units [called Villages of East Lake] there.  And it's not like unit number A is, is market based and unit B is subsidized.  It's unit number A, apartment one, is market, apartment two is subsidized.  So you, you have people living in a community that if you saw it, you would say, this community is as nice as any apartment complex in the country.  It's built around a public golf course.  They rebuilt the golf course, and they put a housing project around it.  But they don't look like the typical housing projects.  You have an Olympic-sized swimming pool.  You have the landscaping.  You have gates, gated community, not, not razor wire.  You have people who are living there that are paying from 800 to 1,400 dollars a month, living next door to people who are paying nothing.  But the community is now a community.  They now have the first new public shopping center in that community, new development is coming into there.  The crime rate has dropped 97 percent, okay.  The property values have improved 40 percent.  30 percent of the kids that went to the school, not only did he do this, he built a new school, Charles Drew.  It used to be the Charles Drew Elementary School.  They kept--he kept the same name.  He felt, he felt that the name Charles Drew meant something in the black community.  So it's now the Charles Drew Charter School [Atlanta, Georgia], I mean that, you know, Charles Drew discovered the blood transfusion.  They also build a state-of-the-art [East Lake Family] YMCA [Young Mens Christian Association].  So now you have a community that has a school that is, you know, the kids there--only 30 percent of the kids were at reading at the capacity of the Georgia requirements tests for the kids of that age level.  It is now above 65 percent.  The school has been there for three years.  It's a school that requires--kids wear uniforms.  So you don't have all the disciplinary problems with kids fighting about whose tennis shoes are nicer.  And you have a junior golf academy [First Tee at East Lake].  The kids in the neighborhood are learning to play golf and the game of golf.  You have a caddy program, a scholar program.  We're giving out scholarships to kids in that community who have gone through the caddy, caddy program.  There's a holistic aspect.  We have even a, a spiritual center there that kind of helps in people reconnecting with their spirituality.  So it is truly a community, and the only thing left from the old East Lake Meadows was the senior citizens home.  Everything else in it was torn down and rebuilt.  But it's not just the bricks and mortar.  Now, when you take--and there's a public golf course, and, and if you can imagine, living in a, in an apartment building, and sitting on the eighth hole, that's something that people--I mean it's close in to the city where people work.  And they have people there who are feeling responsible for each other and, and making sure that the community stays exactly what it is.  Tom Cousins has a phrase that I like to quote him on, "Being poor doesn't make you a criminal."  And so, therefore, what we're proving by the East Lake experience, is that people of mixed income can, in fact, live together and thrive together.  And that's what that community is all about.  The reason that the golf course is there and the reason that the tournament [THE TOUR Championship], we, we're making, trying to get permanent there, is we're trying to make sure that that tournament--we get 50 percent of the profit for that tournament goes to that East Lake community.  And while that community is far from being totally what we want it to be, we're also trying to take that as a blueprint to take around to other communities.  So that's what, that's the East Lake story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's quite a story.
Story_ID: 12453
Speaker 1: Now what's the name of the tournament that you--?
Speaker 2: THE TOUR Championship.
Speaker 1: TOUR Championship.
Speaker 2: THE TOUR Championship is the top thirty money winners at the end of the season, always in the latter part of October.  That's the last of the, of the official season.  It's over after that.  That's the tournament where the people are being rewarded, the guys who played well.  So if you won--Tiger's, right now, Tiger [Woods] leads the money list.  So he's always there.  If you are in the top thirty money winners, which means, usually, you won about a million and a half on the [Professional Golfers' Association, PGA] TOUR that year, then you're invited in that tournament, and that tournament plays--pays the winner $1,100,000.  But everybody, unlike most of the other tournaments, where if you don't make the cut, you don't get paid.  This tournament, all thirty players get a, you know, $90,000 or something like that.  So you, in other words, your expenses are paid, you--it's like going to [Las] Vegas [Nevada] and somebody giving you money to go play the slot machines to try and win a million.  Somebody--one of those thirty guys is gonna win $1,100,000.  And the second guy will probably win 800,000 and so forth.  But no one will walk away without some money.  That's the--so, so it's a, it's a tournament that the guys like to play.  It's a shot at the last $1,100,000 for the year.
Speaker 1: And I can see why.
Speaker 2: So it's a very popular, popular tournament from the players' point of view.  And they love to play at East Lake [Golf Club, Atlanta, Georgia] because it's a great golf course.  And it's tradition.  It's where Bobby Jones, you know, kind of the guy who kind of popularized golf.
Speaker 1: Right, he was the biggest golf celebrity of--
Speaker 2: Prior to Tiger, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the '30s [1930s], I guess, Bobby Jones.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he was, Bobby Jones.  That's why you got the Bobby Jones shirts, Bobby Jones, everything is Bobby Jones.
Speaker 1: Now, the earliest black golf celebrity that I can think of is Calvin Peete.
Speaker 2: Calvin Peete.  Actually, Lee Elder before Calvin--
Speaker 1: Lee Elder, right, that's right, Lee Elder.
Speaker 2: He played in The Masters [Tournament].
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 12454
Speaker 1: Do you get much support from the black golfers that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh, yeah, in fact, I've, I've had--since I've taken on this position, I've had the 100 Black Men [of America, Inc.] and many of the black golfers have come to me and said, "Ray, when that tournament [THE TOUR Championship] is here, I want to volunteer to do anything you want me to do."  So--because, you know, you get a chance to walk with the players.  And it's a tournament that is, like in all the other tournaments, you know, when you're inside the ropes, you got a very special deal.  Volunteers basically make tournaments happen.  So I've had tremendous support from the 100 Black Men and just all of the golfers that I know that are, that are African American, who are saying, "Put me down for anything you want me to do for you."
Speaker 1: There's a growing group of African Americans who are interested in golf too.  I know in Chicago [Illinois], at one of the community colleges, there's a golf program for youth in the summer.  They teach golfing to youth, and they even teach them how to play the golf video games (laughs)--
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: -- which is interesting, you know, you wouldn't think that would be super exciting, but when the kids get involved in it, they seem to really, really like it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, it's a, the world is changing in terms of that.  One of our HistoryMakers was Julian [sic, Julius] Richardson, who's a golf instructor.  He used to be in the Army.  He's in his eighties, and he's a, he's a sought-after golf instructor even now.  People fly him to various places to teach, you know.
Story_ID: 12455
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're able to raise money for this project via the tournament [THE TOUR Championship]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the tournament, the tournament is actually, the tournament--whatever proceeds we get from the tournament that, our share of it, goes to our Foundation, the East Lake Community Foundation, which I'm vice chair of.  So my job is to, you know, as, as the president of the club [East Lake Golf Club, Atlanta, Georgia] is to get the tournament here, permanent ties that market it, sell a bunch of tickets, sell a bunch of merchandise, see what the profits are and give the profits to the East Lake Community Foundation.
Speaker 1: Is it fun too?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's more fun than anything I've ever done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 12456
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?  We always ask people that question.
Speaker 2: My, my hope and concern is we don't stop.  We don't plateau, that we continue to take full advantage, you know, progress comes so slowly it seems like that I just hope that the generation that, that follows me, and I think that guys like the Ken[neth] Chenaults of the world, I consider myself--I never thought at fifty-five I'd be calling myself a pioneer, but I've kind of, I, I was in the corporate world a long time, and I did reasonably well.  But I think the guys that are following me like the Chenaults, the [Richard] Parsons, they're going to do even better things because they're sitting at the very top seat.  I did not quite make it there myself, but I'm satisfied with where I did go.  And I think that I, I think I could look back and say that I, I blazed the trail for some, some of the other people coming along.  So my hope is, is that we don't let ourselves plateau.  We're going to be fired, and we're going to be dismissed in the same relative proportion to everyone else, at least we should.  Therefore, if a, if a, if a black does not succeed, that's no reason to feel that you should never hire another one because, you know, one of the things I hope we don't get into the, what I call the Major League Baseball syndrome that the only people you think can manage are the people who've been fired from other jobs because if that's the case, we'll never get the, the ring.  So I'm hoping that as, as we continue to prepare ourselves as a, as a race to do and take on bigger challenges, that, that the opportunities are there.
Story_ID: 12457
Speaker 1: What do you plan to do next?  Do you plan--you think this will be your last actual position?
Speaker 2: I honestly think it will.  This is so much fun, and it's such a big opportunity because when you think about, you know, success at East Lake [Community Foundation], my vision is if we can take what we've learned about mixed-income housing in East Lake [Villages of East Lake, Atlanta, Georgia], and you think about all the cities that we have, whether it's Chicago [Illinois], Houston [Texas], Dallas [Texas], Los Angeles [California], Memphis [Tennessee], all these places we have housing authorities, and we have projects, and we have kids that have no hope.  And if we can somehow replicate what we've done in East Lake throughout the country, Ray Robinson will feel very satisfied with what he's done to help further, you know, the, the, the efforts of our inner cities.
Speaker 1: Are there other communities that are trying something similar to this?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  In fact, I just got a note from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where I've asked to, to help support us here.  And I've just been informed that--obviously, I met Bill Gates through my association with, with golf--that they are doing something, a $40 million project to help with inner-city housing in Seattle [Washington].  I'm anxious to go find out what they're doing because I want to be able to help share what we were able to learn, 'cause you don't really need a golf course to make it happen.  You just need to build things that don't look like--I mean, you know, what I would call warehousing people, you know.  If you build a people-friendly building that has an environment that is appealing to the masses, then people who are mixed income, all they want to know is that, you know, you don't care whether your neighbor is paying this, you know, you could care less what they're paying.  You want to make sure that they're keeping up their--their property as well as you keeping up yours.  And again, I, I firmly believe that being poor does not make you a criminal and nor does it make you a bad neighbor.
Speaker 1: No, but there is a developmental aspect to changing culture and knowing project culture all over the country, and it is a culture of, it's pretty much--it sounds like a blanket statement, it is of throwing bottles in the street and boxes of chicken, hanging out and, you know, and pretty much hardly anybody has any real income.  So they really, they really can't learn much from each other in terms of how to make income.
Speaker 2: Well, but that's part of, see, that's where the holistic part of--see, that's why the, the East Lake experience really addresses that.  I mean this, there's probably a subset of people of that you may never be able to do anything with.  But if you think about, at least, from the, where I grew up, the community I told you about [Hamilton Park, Dallas], it was a mixed-income community.  We had people with the, with the frame houses that were made out of wood, one-car garage.  And we had people with brick homes.  They lived in the same community.  And yet, what happened is, is that, and some of them were slobs.  The ones who were slobs, they were pretty soon out of there because it's, it's a situation where people-as long as, you know, people understand that there's a value, that what you have, because in these apartments now, these are, these are not owned units.  These are apartments, but you got swimming pools, and you--if you got a management company that says that we're gonna manage this like we do any other host property, I believe you can make sure that those things, you know, happen.  And we would love to get people--you know, if you take it to its extreme, I'd love to get people off the welfare rolls.  We may never be able to do that, but I can certainly make sure people are treated with dignity and respect, that deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.  And those that are not willing to, to share in making their communities better, I'm not sure there's much you can do about it.  But I can show you video here when, when I--when you see it, you will, you will be shocked as to what the transformation was from what was there, and what's there now.
Speaker 1: You know, the management aspect--there's a cultural, there's a cultural challenge there too, but I think as you said, in--there's a certain group compulsion, and if you have people doing certain things that create a cultural that other people fall into, like if the neighborhood is mixed?
Speaker 2: Right, if the neighborhood is mixed, it's a, that's, it's called pattern.  You know, you'll pattern after what you, you're used to seeing.  If you see the pattern is, is this is what everyone does, then everyone does that.  If the pattern is everyone keeps up their property, and you don't throw stuff in the streets, you don't break--you know, people don't come up and say, "I'm going to do something to mess up my community."  That's generally not the thing they do.
Speaker 1: And the management aspect of it, one of the critiques of public housing in most of the major cities is that the management slipped, look, it started at a higher level, and then it slipped as political, I hate to say corruption, but graft of the community to be done with block grants; said, they'd hit a city, and the money is used, is carved off of it for other things and not--it doesn't go into public housing the way it ought to.  And I know that's one of the criticism from Chicago and Detroit [Michigan] and other places where public housing started to fail, when it started out as a promising kind of a thing.  So your management, I mean, they were to manage these properties and--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right, it's a, it's a whole--that's why we say, we think we have a great blueprint to be followed by any other--like I said, this appro, this, you know, we didn't take the best of the housing.  We took the absolute worst housing project in the City of Atlanta, the absolute worst.  And like I say, if you saw it now, you wouldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful thing.

Speaker 1: Tell me, at this juncture, and you're still young, I mean, you know, well, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, if, I feel, if I haven't had one yet, and I don't think I have, I think the legacy is what I'm working on now [East Lake Community Foundation].  I think this is something that I would like to, to be associated with.  The reason I'm here is because I wanted to be associated with a guy that had the kind of vision that Tom Cousins had, and I wanted to be able to be a part of, of implementing that legacy. That somehow, I made a difference in what we were able to do with this whole notion of community.  I mean, when you think about it, for me, full circle is, I grew up in a community [Hamilton Park, Dallas, Texas].  I told you I loved it.  We were not, it was not a community--it was an all-black community.  But I never felt that I was cheated or didn't have anything I wanted.  So that community is kind of what drives me now.
Speaker 1: Okay, trying to recreate Hamilton on some level?
Speaker 2: I'd like to create Hamilton Park in a mixed-income and a mixed ethnic environment as well, 'cause I think that's the world we live in.  I learned, I grew up in a, in a, in a segregated environment.  I went to school in a, in an extreme--almost the same segregated, just the other way.  And I think, from both of those worlds, I came out of it with probably the best of both.  And that's what I think I would like to leave for my grandchild, and that is, a world that says that, you know, you can actually live in, in harmony, and you--and some can have this, and some can have this.  And the ones that have this don't have to hit this one in the head to get it.  I mean it's a mindset that I, I'd like to say, people can, in fact, learn from.

Speaker 1: The last question we have, we ask everybody, it's slightly different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a person who started with humble beginnings, worked hard and was able to raise a successful family and family, I mean in the sense of not necessarily replicating what I did, but a family that is capable of taking care of themselves.  I wanted to be able to say that I gave my son and my daughter and my wife a sense of family and what it should be, and that they, in turn, have given to theirs, a sense of family and what it should be.  So, if, if--that's how I would like to--that, that I was the person who was kind of a, I would say the co-architect of that, of that, of that family body.  I mean family is very important to me, and that's, that's the thing that I'd like to be remembered for.
