Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewing today for The HistoryMaker's archive.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Dori J. Maynard.  That's D-O-R-I, J, obviously, M-A-Y-N-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what does the J stand for?
Speaker 2: Judith.
Speaker 1: And what is--
Speaker 2: Although I have a much better story that I tell sometimes.
Speaker 1: What now?
Speaker 2: I have a much more interesting story that I tell sometimes about my middle name.
Speaker 1: Well, tell it.  This is the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, if this is the time.  When I was born in 1958 there were newspapers--white-owned newspapers weren't hiring journalists at all.  And my father [Robert Clive Maynard], all he wanted to be was a journalist.  And so I used to tell people that when I was born, the J was for journalist because he said, "Even if I don't make it, my daughter will."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he sent out 200 resumes and got his first job.  So clearly he did just fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that's a good story.  And, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Five four fifty-eight [May 4, 1958] in New York City.
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Journalist.  I run a nonprofit that works with increasing the number of diverse journalists and also making sure that the content is accurately and fairly reflects our, our very complex society.  And we want that to be across not only race, but class, gender, generation, and geography.
Speaker 1: And that's the Maynard--
Speaker 2: And that's the Maynard Institute, thank you, the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education founded in 1977.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Is that a trick question?
Speaker 1: No, it's not supposed to be, but--
Speaker 2: I, I think it's March 10, 2011 [March 9, 2011].
Speaker 1: And where are we at this present time?
Speaker 2: Oakland, California.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It's actually the 9th.
Speaker 2: In my office at the [Robert C.] Maynard Institute [for Journalism Education].
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, it's actually the 9th.  I'm sorry we just got a note from our independent research staff that (laughter) it's the 9th.
Speaker 2: It's March 9th.
Speaker 1: March 9, 2011.
Speaker 2: 2011.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39247
Speaker 1: And, all right, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight 'People Magazine'-ish type questions that we are compelled by management to ask of everyone, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is:  Do you have a favorite food and what is it?
Speaker 2: Sashimi.  I love sashimi, particularly, ika, which is the squid.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red, blue, both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Diversity, I'm into diversity.  I can't just pick one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.  I think I love the fall from the back east.  It--you know, the fall's not as exciting in California, but back East with the colors, and it's a time to nest and all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation?
Speaker 1: Destination, yeah, vacation--
Speaker 2: What is vacation?
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Probably--let's see, a favorite vacation destination.  Well, I have a lot of ones that would be a favorite if I got there.  I love to go to the Caribbean. (Pause) And then sometimes just staying home is nice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the last one is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think I love my father's [Robert Clive Maynard]--he had a phrase, "Nothing to it but to do it."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39248
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Rosen, Elizabeth, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Rosen, R-O-S-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in New York City, [New York] May 25, 1937.
Speaker 1: And now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: On my mother's, on my grandmother's side I can trace 'em back to my great grandmother, great grandparents, the Borgenichts.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, the what?
Speaker 2: B, Borgenicht, B-O-R, B-O-R-G-E-N-I-C-H-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they came over from Eastern Europe and had a push cart, and they sold children's dresses.  And then they went on to develop that business into a multi-million dollar business and were very prominent in Brooklyn [New York].  And my grandmother was I think the youngest girl, and she rebelled.  And this is way back in the day, and they were Orthodox Jews.  And she rebelled--
Speaker 1: So this is back--how far would you say it was?  Turn of the century or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably around then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is your grandmother--
Speaker 2: This is my grandmother's family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then my grandmother rebelled as a young child, or a young adult, and she fell in love with an Irish Catholic man, which was absolutely against, you know, the religious doctrine.  And she--so, she was forbidden to marry him by everybody, even if he converted.  And so what she eventually did was she told her family that she moved to California.  And she married my grandfather, Patrick Flynn.  And according to her--so she said--well, according to family lore, she had twelve brothers and sisters and they all lived in, in Brooklyn [New York] or Manhattan [New York City, New York].  And so she would sort of slowly bump into them.  And eventually they all figured out that she hadn't moved.  But her parents never knew.  She would have friends send letters from California and then she would take off her wedding ring and go into, go to their home and visit them allegedly from California.  And my mother never met--my mother or my, or my aunt ever met their grandparents, their maternal grandparents, 'cause she simply never told her family that she'd gotten married, or her parents that she'd gotten married.  My grandfather went on to become the editor of the 'New York Post.'
Speaker 1: So what was his name?
Speaker 2: Patrick Flynn.
Speaker 1: Patrick Flynn, okay.
Speaker 2: And at that point, according to my grandmother, some of her siblings said, oh, you should tell papa--he'd be so proud.  But she thought that, that it would probably kill 'em to find out (chuckle) that, you know, she'd been married and had two children.  So she never did tell her parents.
Speaker 1: And that's just really a strange story.  But she, she never really--but she would visit her parents.
Speaker 2: She would visit her parents.
Speaker 1: But she never told them--
Speaker 2: She never told 'em that she had gotten married or, and had children.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they never met their grandchildren.
Speaker 2: They never met my, my mother or my aunt.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that's why--and, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, was she from a Jewish family in Eastern Europe, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're a Orthodox Jewish family.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And married a Irish Catholic man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's where the, the problem--that was the rub.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what was the business that they, her, her parents had that grew?  What was it called?
Speaker 2: It was a clothing business.  It's actually--Malcolm Gladwell, the wri--do you know Malcolm Gladwell here?  He wrote a book called 'Outliers'.  And he's a '[The] New Yorker' writer.  He writes for the 'The New Yorker,' and he wrote a book called 'Outliers'.  And actually my grandparents' story of their business is in 'Outliers'--not, not the story about my grandmother, my great grandparents, I'm sorry.  Their story is in 'Outliers'.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'Outliers'.  Okay, and the name of the business, again--was it like a wholesale business or a retail--
Speaker 2: You know, I honestly--I don't know.  It, it--I mean, it was right before my time.  And then some of his sons and I think son-in-laws also went into children's dresses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But those businesses aren't in business anymore, any longer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your mother grew up in New York--
Speaker 2: She grew up in New York.  And unfortunately her father died when she was nine.  So she grew up with my grandmother and her, and my aunt.
Speaker 1: So Patrick Flynn died when she was nine years old.
Speaker 2: When my mother was nine, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And before, okay, well, any, any stories about her--about your mother growing up and did she talk about what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: She did.  She lo-, I mean, she, she loved his stories about being in journalism.  And, actually, that's the reason that she met my father [Robert Clive Maynard] because she went on to become a copy person at the 'New York Post' and that's where she met my father.
Story_ID: 39249
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she [Maynard's mother, Elizabeth Rosen]--where did she go to school?  I mean, did she have any stories about going to school and--I imagine they were doing pretty well--
Speaker 2: Oh, actually, well, my grandmother--well, you know, my grandfather died so--and my grandmother also, not only--well, anyway, she, she goes (unclear) became a Communist.  So, she sent my mother and my aunt to a school for, a boarding school for a couple of years called Manument [Pennsylvania] that was sort of for workers or--
Speaker 1: Can you spell it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, Manu--
Speaker 2: Manument.
Speaker 1: Manument, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I've heard of it before.
Speaker 2: They just recently--I think they went there for junior high or something like that.  And they just recently started a, started finding their fellow Manument students, including my mother's first boyfriend.  And now they have reunions and they, they, they're reconnected and, you know, my mother's first boyfriend and his wife are now good friends with my mother and my aunt.  And it's a very nice story actually.  But that's about the only story I know of hers from going to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's significant, you know, (unclear) that's a whole culture of (unclear) (simultaneously) the left there--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  They were very--my grandmother tells a story--or she told me a story--she's, she's passed away.  But they were very, very leftist about how when my grandfather [Patrick Flynn], --she and my grandfather, when they would go to, I think it's, it's either, I think it must have been '21' [Club]--anyway, it was back in the day, but one of those restaurants.  And, you know, my grandfather would go from table to table meeting people and then--you know, greeting them and talking to them.  And then once he became editor of the 'New York Post,' of course, people would come to his table.  And my grandmother tells that story with gr-, told it with great disapproval because, you know, he wasn't 'of the people' at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of lost the common touch or--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you know, he was the editor of the 'New York Post' (chuckle) so--.
Story_ID: 39250
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, let's go to your father's side.  And can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Robert Clive Maynard.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 17, 1937 and also New York, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your father's side of the family?  Tell us--
Speaker 2: They came from Barbados.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And both my grandparents came from Barbados.  And they came to New York, and my grandfather was a moving man.  My father, he--I grew up hearing that my grandfather was the best moving man in Brooklyn [New York].  And they had six children--three girls and three boys.  So--and my father was the youngest of, of the six and very, very, very intellectually rigorous family.  You know, when you came home from--or around the dinner table they all had to talk about what they learned in school that day.  They were also a very religious family, Fundamentalist, called--from a religion called Plymouth Brethren.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was such a strict religion, you know, they--I think they went to church at least seven times a week, possibly more.
Speaker 1: Now is this a sect from Barbados or did--was it a New York sect?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was English and then came to Barbados via, you know, occupation.  And then they brought it to Brooklyn [New York].  I, I don't know how thriving it is because you also could not talk to anybody outside the church.  Not only couldn't you talk to anybody outside the church, but the churches were all unmarked.  So like for my grandmother's funeral we drove around the block a few times to figure out, you know--we literally couldn't figure out where the church was.  So, as I said, it was a very intellectually rigorous family and very religious family.  And those things for my father collided.  Because from a very young age he realized he wanted to be a journalist, but to be a journalist was to consort with the outside world.
Speaker 1: Do you know what inspired him to become a journalist as such?  I mean--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I'm sure I could find the story.  I don't know it off the top of my head.  But it was, it was just--he knew that that was his calling from a very young age.  And that wasn't allowed.  And as I said he was the youngest of six.  And so he really also felt that he got a lot of his education sitting at the, at the, at the dining room table.  So when he was sixteen he actually left home and moved to the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York] and began his writing career, which also meant a break with this family because he became part of the outside world.  And so I didn't--one--his oldest brother, who he was very close to--I met him when I was three.  And that, that was sort of a secret meeting, do you know what I mean.  I met him and his wi--
Speaker 1: Is he still one of the [Plymouth] Brethren?
Speaker 2: No, actually, the only person who is left in this religion is my oldest aunt, Marjorie, who I've never met.  She helped raise my father.  It, it broke his heart to the day he died that, that he could not have any contact with her.  When he was dying, she did send some people from the religion to the house.  I, I, I don't know--to help, perhaps, bring him back or something, you know, bring him back into the fold.  But--so she's the only one left.  My uncle left when we were, I was about, my cousin and I were about ten.  And then when I was fifteen there was a, a break in the religion where there was--it became a more liberal, you know, a--
Speaker 1: Set of practices--
Speaker 2: Right.  And so that's when I met my grandmother and two of my aunts and their, and their children.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  Now, is this an integrated sect, Plymouth Brethren, or--
Speaker 2: I don't, well, I don't think it was integrated back in the, in the fifties [1950s] or the forties [1940s].
Speaker 1: It would be unusual if it was, but--
Speaker 2: I mean my father--
Speaker 1: --how when you said that it, it's a group, it's a group that started in England, I was wondering how they--well, but all these religions are (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, my father--I don't think it could have been cause my father told a story about some English people coming into the church and seeing the, the children drinking milk and they used a, a, a racial slur, oh, look at the--they're drinking, you know, we would have thought they'd be drinking chocolate milk.  So, I don't get the impression there was a lot of intermingling.
Speaker 1: Okay, so even though they're same denomination, you had--the congregation is like most American congregations--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where it's segregated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 39251
Speaker 1: Okay, so now why did--is there a story about why your father [Robert Clive Maynard] ran away to Greenwich Village [New York, New York] of all places to go?
Speaker 2: Because that's where the writers were.  That's where the, that's where the next set of learning was.  You know, he's a kid in Brooklyn [New York], and he knows that the sort of intellectuals are congregating in the [Greenwich] Village.  He, you know, he met James Baldwin.  And, and that's where I think he saw a sort of freedom, an intellectual freedom, but also social freedom, you know.  He was a kid who grew up in, in such a strict religion.  I mean, there's was no dancing, no Christmas, no, no Easter, no, as I said, consorting with, with people outside your religion.  And in the [Greenwich] Village in the fifties [1950s] there was, you know, all kinds of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the, the beatnik movement--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and all the jazz and other--
Speaker 2: Jazz, exactly.
Speaker 1: So it was about 1955 or '6 [1956] or so?
Speaker 2: It must have been.  I was born in '58 [1958].  So--and my grandfather died, which is probably in '56 [1956] or '57 [1957].  So--and my father was already out of the house.  So, yeah, must have been 1955-ish.
Speaker 1: Okay, so his father died shortly after he left.
Speaker 2: After, after--
Speaker 1: After your father left home--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --his father died.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father absolutely--they all loved, loved their father.   And it was very, very traumatic.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so he's in Greenwich Village, Greenwich Village, rather.
Speaker 2: Greenwich, no, it's Greenwich Village.
Speaker 1: Greenwich Village, okay, all right, we're in--okay (chuckle).  Got it mixed up with that--we got something to think on Greenwich Village, so (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know, I know.  Well, it's like in New York you say Houston and in, in, in--everywhere else it's pronounced Houston.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But if you say Houston Street even though that's how it's spelled, everyone knows you're not from New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now did he have a job in--what did he do for a living--now he ran away, but he must have been--known at least what he was going to, I guess--
Speaker 2: Well, he was going to, toward journalism, is what he was going to.  He was going to a life of writing.  But as I said earlier, you know, there were no jobs for black journalists.  So, my birth certificate lists him as a manager of a zipper factory.  I think he also worked in the post office.  I know he worked briefly for--well this is after he, I was born, he worked--one of my mother's relatives started a public relations firm that was quite successful called Ritter and Finn, and he worked there for a while.
Speaker 1: Now he had--had he finished school at this point?  So he runs away when he's sixteen, right, from home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Village was his school.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he had--did he finish high school in Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he never completed--
Speaker 1: And do you know the neighborhood he lived in, in Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: But--he grew up in Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York].  He went to Boy's High [School], which was an excellent school.  But, no, he never, he never completed high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, even after he got, you know, was away for a long time, he never went back?
Speaker 2: Un-un.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he, he had a fellowship to Harvard [University] for a year, but he was, he was an autodidact-, auto-, he was autodidactic, a self-teacher.  I mean, he--these are a mere portion of his books.  And unlike a lot of people he actually read the books.  And he, he loved the life of the intellect.  Yeah, and I was just-, I'm reading a book called 'The Medici Effect,' and in it somebody argues actually that some of the most intellectually able people are people who don't have a formal education because they're also not being taught to think in a certain way--, manner.  And so they're allowed to sort of explore a variety of fields and a variety of forms of learning and a variety way of looking at things.  And that was very much my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that--there was a--but it's also coming from a Caribbean background.  There's so many writers that had a Caribbean background and one is, I guess, prone to think that, that education in the Caribbean was better.  So, I mean, his, his father, though he was in a religion, you said was a very intellectual person--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And remember, as I said, he was the youngest of six, so, I mean, he sat there at the table and absorbed all of their lessons.  And then it was a very intellectually vigorous family.  My, my uncle has, I believe, two PhDs.  So, I think my, as I said, my father absorbed a lot of that.
Story_ID: 39252
Speaker 1: Okay, now let's get 'em together here.  Now how did your parents [Elizabeth Rosen and Robert Clive Maynard] meet?
Speaker 2: At the 'New York Post'.  They were copy people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, met at the 'New York Post'.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And did your mother live in the [Greenwich] Village, too, at this point?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure (chuckle).  I'm laughing because I'm not sure if she lived in the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York].  Eventually, they ended up living in the [Greenwich] Village together.  Yes, and then eventually married.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother didn't stay in journalism.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what did she do?
Speaker 2: She went on in her forties--I'm pretty sure it was her forties, late thirties, forties--to become--forties.  She went back to school and became, and became a CPA [Certified Public Accountant].  And when she retired she was the CFO [Chief Financial Officer] at the Morgan Library in New York.
Story_ID: 39253
Speaker 1: All right, now when you consider your parents' [Elizabeth Rosen and Robert Clive Maynard] talents and gifts and dispositions and inclinations, looks, and all those things, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, they say I look most like my--well, I think I look like my father--but they also say I look a lot like my mother's sister.  And, let's see, you know, they both had a real passion for justice, which I think I inherited, as did my grandmother.  Journalism--my father, but my grandfather [Patrick Flynn] was also in journalism.  And in writing--my father.  So a little, you know, like most children a mix of both, I suspect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39254
Speaker 1: So, now, kind of walk us through your father's career, you know, 'cause it, I think it leads directly to the [Robert C.] Maynard Institute [for Journalism Education] (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It does lead directly to the Maynard Institute, absolutely.  So he, as I said, wanted to be a journalist.  And he did some writing when--and, for local papers, you know, like the Brooklyn--oh, I can't remember the name of the, you know, like the, the 'Brooklyn Weekly.'  He worked at the Afro-American, and, and he just sent, he literally sent out two hundred resumes before he got his first job at the York 'Gazette and Daily,' which was a small paper in York, Pennsylvania.  And he worked there for a couple of years.  And then he applied to, to the Nieman Fellowship, and he got the Nieman in '65 [1965], '66 [1966], I can tell you because I have--we--and that was, that was just an amazing journey for him.  And then he went back to York for a year.  And from, from there he went to 'The Washington Post,' and he got to 'The Washington Post' just as the country was, you know, in--exploding Vietnam [Vietnam War], the Civil Rights Movement.  And there--he had, he had this voice.  When he was a young child as I mentioned he was the youngest of six, and so he, I guess, really absorbed the West Indian accent.  And then he also had a slight speech impediment.  And so when he got to school, no one could understand him.  And he went into speech therapy.  And I think they used recordings of Winston Churchill, a tape recorder, and a mirror to--.  And as a result, like a lot of people with speech impediments, he became an amazing speaker.  People have said, you know, I mean, they still remember his voice.  They, some refer to it as he had the voice of God.  I mean, it was just deep, rich, beautiful voice.  And there's a story that they tell about him where he's out--because, of course, they sent the black reporters out to cover the riots.  The white reporters stayed back and wrote the stories from the dispatches.  And there's a story about him being out and he would report in with a, with a tape recorder, not a tape recorder, but he would, he would report in with like a little hand radio or something, and they would all sit around the city desk, many of them would sit around the city desk listening to his reports.  And I actually heard this from a reporter that I worked with in Detroit [Michigan] who had worked, who had been there.  And I think Ben Bradlee has it in his book.  But in any case, so he's reporting in this voice and he's describing what's happening and--
Speaker 1: Like a dictaphone or something or--is that what--?
Speaker 2: You know, I'll, I'll look it up.  I'm sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, more than likely it was attached to a phone line, you know.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --eventually, you know, whatever he recorded, it probably was broadcast on (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they could, they could hear it as it, as he was--you know, as he was speaking they could hear it in the, in the newsroom.  And, and so--and you know the action's getting closer and closer and closer and finally he says, you know, now gentlemen I will be going under the car to continue this report.  And so he had the meteoric rise at the, at 'The Washington Post.'  And just--I remember him just zigzagging around the country.  And then he took a year off in seventy--probably '71 [1971].  He had so much overtime that he, he took a year off and he came out actually to California and spent a year living in a commune up in Hopland [California], in the mountains of Hopland, which as a fourteen-year-old girl from Brooklyn [New York], I was kind of like, really?
Speaker 1: What now?
Speaker 2: Well, as a fourteen-year-old girl from Brooklyn, I was kind of like--or, no, I wasn't fourteen, I was twelve, because I moved in with him when I was fifteen.
Story_ID: 39255
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well I take that--did your parents [Elizabeth Rosen and Robert Clive Maynard] split up or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they, they split up very early.  When my father moved to Pennsylvania for his first job--I think I was about three [years old] when they split up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you basically with your, your mother's family or you were with your mother most of the time or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I lived with my mother, but I was very--I, I saw my father.  I mean, we were--he was--we were very close.  So--and I would go see him in Pennsylvania and he would come to New York.  And then I would go see him in Washington [District of Columbia] and, again, he would come to New York, so--.  And then he--we would go, you know, various vacations together.  When I was ten [years old] he was covering--
Speaker 1: So they had a good relationship even though they split up.  It wasn't like, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't like they, they--
Speaker 1: --so we'll use the children--lot of the times--
Speaker 2: No, they didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No, in fact, my father--we, you know, when I was a rebellious teenager I remember I was out until he would remind me like, you know it's your mother's birthday today (chuckle), oh, and I'd actually forgotten.  So, they, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea why they split up or no?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't--I mean, I think they were very different.  So--and I, I know my father really wanted to pursue journalism, which meant leaving New York.  I don't know why--I was three [years old] at the time so I'm not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --entirely clear, but, yeah.
Story_ID: 39256
Speaker 1: Okay, we were like kind of outlining your father's [Robert Clive Maynard]. career.  And so he's--
Speaker 2: Oh, good--
Speaker 1: --you talked about him working with the Brooklyn paper, the York 'Gazette'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that the one (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The York--no, no, the York 'Gazette' was in, was in York, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, York, Pennsylvania, okay.  And he covered the Civil Rights Movement for York 'Gazette.'  And then he's with the--
Speaker 2: 'Washington Post'.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  And then he, he got the Nieman Fellowship when he was with the York 'Gazette.'
Speaker 2: York 'Gazette,' uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, exactly.
Speaker 1: 'Washington Post'--he, he met Ben Bradley in '66 [1966], then joined staff for '[Washington] Post.'  And think we had him up to, 'cause we had him up to--
Speaker 2: Right, well then he--
Speaker 1: --somewhere in the Civil Rights Movement (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, and is covering that.  And then he went to Hopland [California].  And then when he came back, he was--
Speaker 1: Oh, the commune.  Yeah, well, what was that a--do you understand what that was about now?  I mean, with, you know, you say you were fourteen at the time.
Speaker 2: Twelve, I think it was twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve, okay.  Do you, do you understand what he was doing now?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he was just getting away from it all.  I mean, it wasn't--it was so--the way it work at the commune was ev-, every--it was on this mountain.  And then everybody had their own house.  And then they kind of shared meals and grew vegetables and, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he just took--I mean that--well he's at the 'Washington Post' at the time--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, and then he, he, and he would go back and forth to, to California.  And, you know, his best friend, Earl Caldwell, was, was based out here.  And there was a lot to cover out here.  You know they had the Black Panthers.  You know he was here during the Angela Davis trial [1970-1971].  That's, that's when he was--whatever year that was.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think that's in the--but he, he wasn't, he wasn't out here when the [Black] Panthers were (unclear).
Speaker 2: No.  No, I mean, he would come out and cover it but that was Earl [Caldwell] who was out here covering the [Black] Panthers.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, okay.  So he, he's in the commune in nineteen--well, do you know the year?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I could figure it out.  I think it was 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he went back to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] when he was mi-, ombudsman for the 'Washington Post.'  He loved that job.  And he wrote a lot about technology.  He was really very forward thinking about technology.  I mean, I just had lunch with somebody who said that they remember my father giving a speech telling people--this was in the late eighties [1980s]--that, you know, one day they'd be getting their news on computers and everyone looking at him like he was crazy, so--.  And so you say--went back to, as, as ombudsman, and he had that job for a couple years.  And then he became an editorial writer, the 'Washington Post.'
Speaker 1: Now this is '72 [1972], the associate editor of the 'Washington Post'?
Speaker 2: Ombudsman, not social editor, ombudsman.
Speaker 1: No, I've heard that he was associate editor of the 'Washington Post.'  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Oh, right, that was, that was the ombudsman job, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the ombudsman job, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, ombudsman is someone you write to solve or help you solve a problem (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It's a liaison between the people, the readers and the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, and he's--
Speaker 2: And the '[Washington] Post' is one of the few people-, first newspapers to have an ombudsman.  'The New York Times' just created that position probably about, well, within the last decade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--.  Okay, so it's a liaison between the people and the paper.  And he also began working with 'Encore [Magazine]', right?  Is that, that true at this point--'Encore Magazine'?
Speaker 2: He did a lot of freelancing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says here he was a senior editor of the new black monthly magazine 'Encore [Magazine].'
Speaker 2: That is entirely possible.
Speaker 1: Okay (chuckle).
Speaker 2: You know, I was a teenager.  While I--we were very close, but I was also as most, you know, teenagers, so--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Encore [Magazine]' was quite a magazine.  I remember it very well, but--
Speaker 2: And I know he worked for 'Black Enterprise'.
Story_ID: 39257
Speaker 1: Okay, now did he [Robert Clive Maynard] talk about the Watergate break-in?  This is like '72 [1972] as well.
Speaker 2: Of course he talked about the Watergate--
Speaker 1: And what did he have to say about that?  And what was his role at the 'Washington Post' when this Watergate (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, Watergate happened on his birthday, so--.  And by that time, by the time of the Watergate hearings I was living with my dad in Washington [District of Columbia].  And, oh, we were both--I mean that's, that's--I, I just remember, I mean, the whole city or, you know, the journalists and politicians were just riveted by that story.  I mean, it was just, you know, going--I remember my father's reaction.  We were in the elevator at the 'Washington Post' and he saw a reporter carrying a book on impeachment.  And it was just like, wow, it's come to that, you know.  And this was early, months before the hearings.  But, I mean, just the growing realization of what was taking place before our very eyes was--it--I mean, to say it was all-encompassing and spellbinding would be just an understatement.  I remember being home during the Saturday, the Saturday night massacre, you know, when the attorney general was ordered to fire somebody and he resigned.  And the next person--I mean it was just--or he was fired 'cause he didn't do it--I mean it was just--and I--it was just, you know, that's just all you ate, lived, slept, and breathed was Watergate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have an opinion of [Bob] Woodward and [Carl] Bernstein or did that ever--
Speaker 2: Did he have an opinion (pause).
Speaker 1: Well did he know--did he work them as he was getting himself familiar with those two guys?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, of course, of course.  And Carl Bernstein was a friend of his.  You, you know, he came to my father's funeral and I saw him recently.  So, I mean I, I think he had an opi--you know, he had an opinion of the journalism, too.  I mean that, that, that the 'Washington Post' was doing great journalism.  And I think that vindicated him-, in, in his mind his decision to go to the 'Washington Post' rather than 'The New York Times.'  Because when he looked at those two papers, he realized that the '[Washington] Post' being a smaller paper he would have many more opportunities to do many more things than he would if he went into a large paper like the--you know, 'cause, remember, Watergate's really what put the '[Washington] Post' on, on the map.  And I remember going to see my father when he first start working at the 'Washington Post' and it was a relatively small newsroom.  I mean, if you see the place now--it was actually in a, in a building that they then now are attached to, you know, so--.  So I think being at the 'Washington Post' during Watergate was just--and, and watching the paper growing, the journalism growing, and that, you know, democracy worked.  My father was a great believer in that.  So, you know, and that Woodward and Bernstein were two scrappy young reporters who stayed on a story and pursued it to the--and they had the support of management.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, Ben Bradley was--
Speaker 2: Ben Bradley and, and Catherine Graham.
Story_ID: 39258
Speaker 1: So the '[Washington] Post' won the Pulitzer Prize in '73 [1973] for their Watergate coverage, and [Richard] Nixon resigned in '74 [1974], and in '75 [1975] your father [Robert Clive Maynard] remarries.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was Nancy Hicks Maynard.  Now, tell us a little bit something about her, you know, and that she was--now--
Speaker 2: Well, she was a journalist at 'The New York Times'.  I think she was one of the youngest women, youngest black woman to join and one of the first black women to join the '[New York] Times'.  There's a great story about her.  So she joins the, she joins the '[New York] Times' and, oh, I think it was H. Rap Brown, somebody like that--he was getting out of jail and so everyone's, all the reporters are clamoring around.  And somehow she manages to get into the car with him and, and him and Bill Kunstler.  I think Kunstler just assumes it's one of his girlfriends.  And, you know, like people like Earl Caldwell and senior journalists are standing there.  And she's just like, okay, I'm in the car.  See you.  And she had a great career at the time.  She covered health.  And Charlene Hunter-Gault said that she was one of the journalists who sort of, one of the black journalists at the time just who really demonstrated that you could both be black and not have to cover black issues.  And so she was a health and science reporter.  And then when she and my father got together, she became--she then was transferred to the Washington bureau of 'The New York Times'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they got married.  And she had a son, my brother David, who was three [years old] at the time.  And that was just--I, I loved--he was my fir-, very first sibling.  And he was three and I was sixteen and our parents were obviously were newlywed and wanted to spend time together.  So every Saturday I would take David off to the, off to the zoo or off to a movie.  And years later we both discovered that we hated the zoo and we only went there for the other one.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  That's a interesting story.
Speaker 2: And then they had another child, my, my youngest brother, Alex, Alex Caldwell Maynard, who's also a fabulous person.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got two siblings on--and you have some siblings on the other side, too, don't you on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she has a, a, a daughter, Sarah Ann, my sister Sarah Ann.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that makes four, right?
Speaker 2: Four of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Four, four, okay.
Story_ID: 39259
Speaker 1: Okay, so in '77 [1977] your, your father [Robert Clive Maynard] along with six others founded the Institute for Journalism Education, right?
Speaker 2: Well, actually it was my father--it was--there were nine cofounders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they had started--they'd gotten involved with the Summer Program for Minority Journalists back, I believe, in 1972 when my father and Earl were the first directors of it.  They, they--and it was an eleven week program to train journalists of color to, to work in, in both print and broadcast.  My father and Earl ran the print, print side.  And they just loved this program and became so enamored of it that they got their friends involved in the program.  And then in '74 [1974], yeah, Columbia [University] announced that it would no, or that the Ford Foundation--I think it was get-, being funded by the Ford Foundation--announced it would no longer fund the program.  And so my father and--
Speaker 1: This is the, the summer institute for--
Speaker 2: The Summer Program for Minority Journalists.
Speaker 1: --for minority journalists at Columbia [University].
Speaker 2: Right.  So my father and his colleagues got together and decided that they would keep the program going.  And they went on to raise the money.  And they incorporated it.  And they brought out to University of California, Berkeley, and incorporated it in 1977.  The other founders were Earl Caldwell, Dorothy Gilliam, John Dotson, Steve Montiel, well, Nancy [Hicks-Maynard], my father, Walter Stovall, Frank Sotomayor.  Is that nine?
Speaker 1: Is that--I'm not sure (chuckle), but that's pretty good.
Speaker 2: Oh!  Roy Aarons--how could I forget Roy Aarons.  And Roy Aarons then went on to also found, years later, decades later, he went on to--or was it decades later?  Well, anyway, he went on to, to found the National S-, NLGJ, the--
Speaker 1: I think it's '97 [1997], I think--
Speaker 2: For Roy?
Speaker 1: You're talking about the National Lesbian and Gay Journalism--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Journalists Association.
Speaker 2: So '97 [1997].  So it was decades later.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, it couldn't have been '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--'cause my father died in '93 [1993], so it would have been--
Speaker 1: Oh, '89 [1989], maybe--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that makes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Yeah, this is written, I'm sorry--and now, now did your father have anything to do with the founding of, of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], which was '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: I, I--you know what, I'm not sure about that.
Speaker 1: It's the National Association of Black Journalists--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know what, I know what NABJ is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just saying it for those who are really--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --watching this that don't know.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: We just said something that--it's our code like so I don't know what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah, a good point.
Speaker 1: National, yeah, National Association of Black Journalists founded in '75 [1975].  I'm not sure--you know, I wasn't sure (unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't think he was--he's not--I don't think he played an active role in the founding.
Speaker 1: But he was a member.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's why--okay.  But he and Earl Caldwell try to keep the summer institute going.  So the, the, so these meetings would be in the summer, the institute would meet in the summer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --out here?
Speaker 2: Eleven weeks in the summer.  And, and, and actually so the initial institute was really in our guest room--well, not in our guestroom, but in an office in the house--I don't think it was the guestroom.  But anyway, anyway it was in, in a room in our house.  And then they had an office and space in Washington, D.C.  And then came out here.
Story_ID: 39260
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Robert Clive Maynard]. came out to Oakland [California] to become the editor of the 'Oakland Tribune'--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --which was owned by Gannette [Co. Inc.].
Speaker 2: Gannette at the time, yes.  So the--so Nancy [Hicks-Maynard] was running the summer program in '76 [1976]--must have been '76 [1976] (pause), yeah, the summer of '76 [1976], 'cause my father came out in '77 [1977], right?  No, no, no, sorry, '77 [1977] they quit their jobs.  So she was running it in, I think, '78 [1978].  She was out here in '78 [1978] running the summer program.  She was co-director.  And my father was writing.  And he would run around--he would jog around Lake Merritt--Lake Merritt is a lake in the middle of Oak-, downtown Oakland--and look up at the Tribune Tower and think, you know what, I want that newspaper.  And then he'd go home and he'd do his yoga and his meditation.  And at the end of the summer they went back to Washington [D.C.] where they lived.  And one of their good friends who was I think a vice president, he--a very senior man in Gannette--called him up and said, you know, just on the QT, Gannette's thinking about buying the 'Oakland Tribune.'  Can you give us a list of people you think would be a good editor?  And he had a list of one--that was him.  And so he went out and became editor of the '[Oakland] Tribune,' which at the time was said to be the second worst newspaper in, in, in the country.  No one ever said what the first worst newspaper was.  But they said the '[Oakland] Tribune' was the second worst newspaper.  So, anyway, he obviously turned it around and then was named publisher and brought out Roy Aarons as editor.  And then Gannette decided that they wanted to by KRON and you couldn't own, you can't own a newspaper and a television station in the same market.  And so they decided they were going to sell the '[Oakland] Tribune.'  And at that point my father said that he wanted to buy it.  And so the rest is history.  He bought it in 1983 and owned it until shortly before his death in '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Now this is historical in the sense that--
Speaker 2: Well, he--yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is the first--
Speaker 2: He was the first African American to own a major metropolitan newspaper.  Also, the first family to do a leveraged buyout of a newspaper.  So both of those things were, were historical.  And, you know, he created a very diverse staff that really covered Oakland [California] as Oakland [California] is.  I mean, he--and he loved the city.  And the city loved him and loved the paper.  There was a really--he really created a strong bond between the newspaper and the city.  It went on to win countless awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for the Loma Prieta earthquake.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 39261
Speaker 1: And I still tease the police reporter because, you know, he was taking my father [Robert Clive Maynard] out, you know, to look at the freeway and go tour all these really quite unsafe places.  But, you know, that was my father.  He was one to be out in the middle of it.  The same for the fire that, you know, Oakland [California]--there was--in '91 [1991]?  And there was a fire that, what they call a firestorm, and it--one spark after a drought just devastated neighborhoods, killed twenty-five people, just absolutely devastated neighborhoods.  In fact, well, our neighborhood--my father was interviewed on CNN and it started--it started just as I said.  There was, there was a tiny spark started a fire.  It was just a quiet Sunday.  I, I, I was living in Detroit [Michigan] at the time.  And our housekeeper's son works for the fire department and started telling my father there's, you know, there're s a problem.  And nobody--and my father called the then editor of the newspaper, Eric Newton, and said, you know, we got a problem.  And it's this beautiful day and Eric's like, no, we don't have a problem.  My father's like, no, we have a problem.  You need to get, you need to get to the paper and get people there.  And Eric was sort of resisting and, and--but you could only resist, I mean, you know, he--it was--my father was the boss and, sure enough, they--that fire just went on for--I mean, it just, it came out of nowhere.  And then it came into our neighborhood.  The cops came and told my parents what to do.  You know, we were gonna act like burglars.  Just put the sheet on the bed and dump whatever you want in there.  And he took something--I remember he took something that reminded him of each child.  And CNN [Cable News Network] came around.  Oh, see, he also--he was--father was a, was a avid photographer.  And the other thing he did was he got on the roof of the house and started taking pictures of the fire as it was coming toward the house.  And CNN [Cable News Network] was there, and they interviewed my father.  And, you know, I've actually didn't see this interview but my father recounted it to me.  They said, you know, "Mr. Maynard, what do you think is gonna happen?" (chuckle), you know.  My father said, "Watching this destruction," he said, "I think my house is gonna burn down."  And the reporter said, "Well, don't you have any faith?"  And he said, "Yes, I do.  I have faith that my family is safe, our animals are safe, and that we can withstand any material loss."  Now we were incredibly lucky because the fire actually stopped in the backyard.  You, you could see--there was scaffolding all around the house, which also made it more dangerous.  They were painting, in the process of painting the house.  And you could see the, where the fire had actually licked the house--burned down the, the whole backyard but thankfully not the house.
Speaker 2: So this was 1991 and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: What was it that--did the fire have a name, I mean, did they call, they call it something or did--
Speaker 1: Firestorm.
Speaker 2: Firestorm, okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was, it was all over the news.
Story_ID: 39262
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm going to pick your father's [Robert Clive Maynard] story back up in the context of yours, but I think we have a sense, a kind of outline of, of why the Maynard Institute's important and that sort of thing.  And we'll--I'll, I'll, I'm going to go back to your childhood and we'll bring it back up to--
Speaker 2: Okay, well, the [Robert C.] Maynard Institute [for Journalism Education], we haven't quite gotten to why it's so important, but we will.
Speaker 1: All right, well, you can, if you want to (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, why is it important is--it's important because we have to be able to tell stories that accurately and fairly reflect all of us.  That we need--we learn about each other from the media and what the [Robert C.] Maynard Institute [for Journalism Education] does is it trains multi-cultural managers and leaders to lead news organizations that can more accurately and fairly depict all of us.  And--because as I said we get our information--because we still live in fairly segregated communities--so we get our information about each other from the media.  And that's how we make our decisions about public policies.  And there are studies that show, particularly around the depiction of boys and men of color, which despite Obama [President Barack Obama, U.S. President 2009- ]--well, what [President Barack] Obama has done--the [President Barack] Obama effect has meant that boys and men of color are either portrayed as supermen, you know, you grow up to become a president or a Eric Holder [U.S. Attorney General 2009- ] or super predators, and the primary coverage is super predators.  What that means in terms of public policy--that's, that has a large part of why we find people who are so much more inclined to vote for public policies that support the death penalty or English-only ordinances because we've 'otherized' people and we've demonized people.  And, and that's why people are less supportive of school reform.  'Cause we've talked in the media that people, that, that people of color are, you know, the problems there are intractable.  And that's not true, you know.  So that's why the [Robert C.] Maynard Institute [for Journalism Education] is so important because we have to give people the truth a-, about each other and stop demonizing each other and begin to humanize each other.
Story_ID: 39263
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have early--I don't know what my earliest would be--probably, maybe when they took away my crib, maybe?  When I painted on the walls--I don't think they were happy about that.  I remember when my mother [Elizabeth Rosen] was trying to t-, tell me the story of the ugly duckling.  And I, I apparently I was always a very empathetic child.  And I was so horrified at what they were doing to the little ugly duckling that I (chuckle), I ran out of the apartment.  And, you know, she had to, she had to chase me down and tell me, no, no, it has a happy ending.  So those are early--oh, and I remember sitting with my dad [Robert Clive Maynard]. in Brooklyn [New York] when I was younger, when I was--until I was ten we lived in Brooklyn Heights [New York, New York] and there's something called the Promenade and it overlooks the river in New York.  And I remember sitting there looking at the Empire State [Building] light blinking on--but it was very peaceful.
Story_ID: 39264
Speaker 1: Now can you describe now what neighborhood you grew up in and--
Speaker 2: Well, first I grew up in Brooklyn Heights [New York, New York] until I was ten [years old] and that's, you know, a very upscale neighborhood.  And then when I was ten my mother [Elizabeth Rosen] had the opportunity to buy a house and so we moved to--my mother had remarried by this time.  And so we moved to Fort Greene [New York, New York], which was not an upscale neighborhood, but, but she got a house for $21,000, which was a great--and it was a, a brownstone.  And, and it was just--it--interesting, it was a interesting neighborhood to grow up in because it was changing.  And she was doing a lot to--you know, she was working with the neighbors--they had a very close neighborhood association and so they were, you know, working to get rid of some of the prostitution and get a healthy police involvement.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, similar to what community policing is now?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, right, but as opposed to an unhealthy police involvement, which we have in many of our communities.
Story_ID: 39265
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was New York City in the '60 [1960s], my goodness.  I mean, it was, it was a great place to grow up.  I mean there was just so much to see and so much to do.  The sights--I think that New York is a--in, in, in terms of beauty is underrated.  The brownstones--I used to love walking through both Fort Greene and Brooklyn Heights--the detail on them, on the houses.  I, I married an architect--I remember taking him back.  He--I, I was surprised that he was not as impressed as I thought he would be.  But it was also February and he was from Los Angeles [California] and it was freezing so--.  But it was a beautiful, beautiful place to grow up.  You know, you had all kinds of smells--I mean, all the amazing food.  You know, Atlantic Avenue, you had Jamaican meat patties and you had Middle Eastern food, you had incredible Chinese food and Japanese food.  And, you know, I mean, you just--and, and you had so many different people, you know.  I remember when I moved--when I was fifteen I moved in with my dad in [Washington] D.C.  It, it was--the, the difference was so stark.  You know, there were back, back in the mid-seventies [1970s], you know, I was used to Puerto Ricans and Filipinos and, you know, just--you had great Chinatown in New York, you had little Italy.  It was just a fascinating place to grow up.  And I think it's--I think it explains a lot of why I am so passionate about respecting different cultures and not allowing people to use, you know, racial slurs or, or other dehumanizing terms for other people because I did grow up seeing so much diversity around me.  And, you know, was fascinated by--so how people will live out their lives differently although they really have the same values.  So I, I--and New York had lights and, you know, and, and it was 24/7.
Story_ID: 39266
Speaker 1: Now did you have, I guess, favorite activities in New York when you were a little kid?  I mean, what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Really, I liked to read.  I just loved to read.  I mean, I was a little bookworm child--biographies and I read the entire Nancy Drew--it was--they kept writing, but I mean I read I think the entire Nancy Drew series by the time I was in third grade.  I was one of those kids with a book in her, you know, her nose in a book all the time.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite television show or radio show?
Speaker 2: I think I liked 'Bewitched.'  I wanted to move my nose and make things happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if you remember that show, but she would go--and then she'd just make things pop up and, yeah.
Speaker 1: Invisible wires would pick things up--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Invisible wires would pick things up and they'd move around her.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly!  I loved that show.  I think that was my favorite.
Story_ID: 39267
Speaker 1: So were you aware of news programs and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --when you were a little kid and--
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.  In fact, for my ninth birthday my father [Robert Clive Maynard] took me to go see the Walter Cronkite show being taped or broadcast.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was very much aware of news.
Speaker 1: Now, this is your ninth birthday and you go to see the Walter Cronkite show being taped.  And this is a big treat then or--
Speaker 2: Well, it was--
Speaker 1: Did you, did you consider it a treat then or--I mean--
Speaker 2: I, I guess I did.  Yeah, I mean, well, I got to do all kinds of things like that.  You know, I got to go to the White House and met President [Lyndon] Johnson [U.S. President 1963-1969] and I flew on Air Force One because me and my dad was covering the White House.  And, yeah, I was aware--I mean, the news back then--you couldn't not be aware of the news.
Speaker 1: So, this is--you're telling us something here that, that we, you know, that's significant--that your dad would actually take you to work.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and take you to these news-making events.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I--you know, until I was, well, until I was sixteen I was his only child.  And, you know, as I mentioned he had the breach with his family so I was his only family.  And we were very close.  But also, you know, I mentioned that he was the youngest and he had three older sisters.  And he watched them not able to reach what he considered their intellectual potential because they all had to be married off.  And so that was not what he had in mind for his daughter.  And so, yeah, he exposed me to all kinds of things as a child.  And we went to--I mean, we went to like, you know, we'd go to the World's Fair in Canada and he'd show, you know, the habitat.  Then he took me to California, and he was always in the, in the newsroom at the 'Washington Post.'  So, yeah, I went to the White House a couple times just because he was on assignment.  And then I remember he did this really interesting series at the 'Washington Post'--sort of what was going on in, in, in black America.  And I would--they had carbon paper back--it wasn't really carbon paper but it was like carbon paper--and I would, you know, tear apart the pages for him and help set them out and--.  So, yeah, I was definitely aware of the news.  And, of course, the news back then was, you know, Martin Luther King [Jr.] being assassinated.  And it was, well, I  mean--but earlier it was Meg--
Speaker 1: You were ten when that happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was ten when that happened, but there was Medgar Evers.  I was (pause) five?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And I remember my grandmother went down and--to the South--and taught for a summer.  When I wrote to [President Lyndon] Johnson I was very nervous about that--so I wrote to President [Lyndon] Johnson, you know, saying make it safe down there.  You know, my grandma's going down there.  So, I mean--oh, and then of course there was Birmingham (Alabama) and the children being bombed.  So, yeah, I mean the news was everywhere.  Interestingly, we do this--sometimes we do an exercise when we go into newspapers and we ask people what was the big news event when you were ten.  And what's interesting in--is that's what we're getting at is sort of how your, your race, your class, your gender, your generation shape your perceptions, and your geography.  And it's interesting--I was listening to people go around in one session and I was so struck by how for me somebody, you know, in '68 [1968] it was Martin Luther King [Jr.] and for others it was the Vietnam War.  You know, people who came from a small, small town, and they were watching their brothers and their brothers' friends go off to war.  But, anyway, the news was everywhere.  There were yippies and hippies and, of course, like you know you're in New York and going to Washington, D.C., you're--that's what you're seeing.  You know, with the marches, I mean the great protests--it was, yeah, I mean, I--it was all I knew as a childhood.  But I, I, I guess childhood news is a little less intense sometimes these days.
Speaker 1: Who else did you meet besides Lyndon Johnson with your father that you remember that was a newsmaker?
Speaker 2: That was a newsmaker--well, Walter Cronkite.
Speaker 1: Did you actually meet him (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think so, maybe so.  I met more journalists--Catherine Graham.  My father was so--in fact, I came back from the White House and Catherine Graham was in the elevator at the 'Washington Post.'  My father said it was my president's day.  And I think he was very proud to introduce me to people like Catherine Graham so I can see some women in leadership positions.  And I met people of, you know, of less--well, I'm trying to think--I'm sure it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But this is a rich kind of a, sounds like a rich way to grow up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was, it was, it was endlessly interesting.  And the conversations were always--you know, we, we talked a lot about what was going on in the country and in the world.  Yeah, it was fascinating.
Story_ID: 39268
Speaker 1: What was your first school?  What was the name of the school you started--
Speaker 2: Downtown Community School [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You mean like first grade?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I, I did go to preschool.  You know my mother [Elizabeth Rosen] worked so I went to preschool, but I have no idea what it was called.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to Downtown Community School.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  It was a private school on the, in the, sort of in the [Greenwich] Village [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now did you like it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--but I read a lot.  I liked it 'cause it had a nice library.  I read all--oh, that was the other thing--I read all the 'Wizard of Oz' books.  I think that's why I hate that movie.
Speaker 1: It doesn't depict it--
Speaker 2: There the books were really interesting and the movie was--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And it was interesting going to school in the 'Greenwich' Village [New York, New York].  I mean, particularly back then where it was not at all gentrified.  And, again, so you would sometimes walk over people that were, you know, perhaps inebriated.  But I think, again, it helped me have more respect for people.  I mean, even though it doesn't sound very respectful walking over them, but, you know, you knew you didn't call 'em--I hate it when people--I, I prefer if it, you know, I hate when people, call 'em disparaging names--they're people with, with problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, did you have a favorite teacher in school at Downtown--
Speaker 2: Maybe my first grade teacher.  I remember her name, at least--I think Mrs. Gallway.  So, yeah.  But nobody really, you know--I wasn't--I, I was, I was such a little bookworm that I wasn't really a favorite teacher kind of person, do you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, way that you would describe yourself then that's how you'd describe yourself as a book--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Kind of a person that's--did you have a lot of friends or did you--
Speaker 2: I had some friends.  But I wasn't, I was not the queen bee kind of person.  You know, I had a couple of friends and--also that school was in Manhattan [New York City] and I lived in Brooklyn [New York] so then there was going back and forth.  And one of--a, a guy that I grew up--my--grew up with also went to that school.  So, he--and he lived in Brooklyn [New York] so we would go back and forth.  And our parents were, we were very close.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it a long commute?  I mean, did you have to, I mean--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) It wasn't that bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I mean, it was--it wasn't that bad.
Speaker 1: So did you finish all of grade school at Downtown [Community School]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and then I went to seventh and eighth at Woodward and then I went to ninth at Saint Ann's.  And then I moved in with my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, school--I was a, I was a bookworm.  But I wouldn't say that I was a big school person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you--so you went to middle school in New York--
Speaker 2: Right.  And then I moved in with my dad.
Speaker 1: In [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you, you were like, what?
Speaker 2: Fifteen [years old].
Speaker 1: Fifteen.
Story_ID: 39269
Speaker 1: All right, and you said you didn't like--I mean, there was a big contrast between--
Speaker 2: Oh my God, I remem--yeah, it was huge.  It's like I thought we'd, I thought I had moved to the smallest city in the universe.  I just--and it, and it was very much also a one industry town back then.  It, it, Washington [D.C.] was actually pretty interesting in retrospect back in the '70's [1970s]--very segregated.  A lot of people that you know didn't live there.  Like all the government workers and people would empty out on the weekends.  So you'd have the feeling that you want--you had the city to yourself.  Everything closed early, you know.  And there was one restaurant--I just went by and they, they've, they've just closed--Anna Maria's on Connecticut Avenue.  It was Italian restaurant, and I think they stayed open past nine o'clock, which, I mean, really.  From New York, you're kind of like, seriously, you close at nine?  I--and then I remember when the Metro [Washington Metro Rail] came to D.C., a friend of mine was visiting from New York and he couldn't believe that we were actually going to stand on line for an hour to, to ride this subway that went, you know, two miles.  And then it didn't even work.  We stood on line and then, like, the whole thing didn't work and we had to go home.  But it was a huge contrast.  And then, of course, as I mentioned you didn't have the diversity I was used to.  You know, there was no Little Italy, there was no Chinatown, there was n-, you know, I don't--
Speaker 1: Did your father [Robert Clive Maynard] live in a black community or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, initially we lived (pause), yeah, in a--yeah, it just didn't work out well.  Initially we, we lived in this little house in--I guess it was--well, we were there so it had to be mixed, maybe predominantly white, but maybe not, but fairly white.  But more important than any of the complexion of the people living there--it was very, you know, one of those places that people like a lot.  You know, they don't really have sidewalks.  They have a lot of trees.  We had a front yard and a back yard and--
Speaker 1: So were you out in the suburbs sort of--
Speaker 2: No, we were in, we were in Washington [D.C.].  Yeah, so it had all of that.  Finally, one of the neighbors knocked on the door and asked if we wanted to borrow their lawnmower.  My (chuckle) father at that point said--he be--prior to that, prior to my moving in with him and his--before he had gone to California, he had lived in Adams Morgan [Northwest Washington, D.C.], which is, which was very similar in many ways to Fort Greene [New York, New York].  And he was quite sure that we were going back to Adams Morgan.  And he said, you know, when we get a house in Adams Morgan I am going to cement over the backyard.  And when we got a house in Adams Morgan a big dump truck arrived one day and it poured little gravel in the backyard.  And he announced that we now had a Japanese rock garden.  And that was that for mowing, mowing the lawn.  But anyway so initially (chuckle) we lived in, we lived in, on Albemarle Street [Northwest] with, with, with, you know--I mean, here I am from New York, my, my, my father's from New York.  He's been living in Adams Morgan.  And they, they don't even have sidewalks.  Now, I know people love those neighborhoods--all these trees.  I mean it was a beautiful neighborhood, but we were more urban oriented.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And it--
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Well, go ahead.  What were you going to--
Speaker 2: I mean, because, you know, I, I mean, and I understand why--I, we both liked the mix of people and, you know, when you walk down the street and you, you know, you walk past stores.  And you're always sort of visually excited by, you know--and intellectually stimulated by what you see.  And y-, I mean, I still prefer urban areas.  In fact, even today I live in a, a neighborhood very similar to, to the neighborhoods in which I grew up in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39270
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to school in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: I--first, I went to Georgetown Day [School] and then I, I went to Woodrow Wilson High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so now did you--what kind of a student were you in these days--
Speaker 2: Hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you a--
Speaker 2: We have nothing to talk about really.  Student--not so much.  I was creating my own path, I guess, is a nice way of putting it.
Speaker 1: So you didn't pay that much attention to grades and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, not so much.
Speaker 1: So what were some of your activities in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school?  Again, reading--I was fascinated by Watergate.  I was really fascinated by Watergate.  'Cause that was my high school years, so, I mean, I w-, watched all the hearings and I read all the books and, oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: So that was the year you gradated was the year that Watergate was--
Speaker 2: When that--that was over, which was good.  Then it was the fascination about, you know, Ford [President Gerald Ford, 1974-1977] and what kind of president he was in taking over.  And then [Vice President] Nelson Rockefeller [1974-1977], as you may recall, who had been the governor of New York [1957-1973], who put in the Rockefeller drug laws--he was the first vice president.  He was [President Gerald] Ford's vice president.  He was the first vice president to get his own house, which was relatively close to where we lived on Albemarle Street [Northwest].  So I would walk by there.  So I guess I was, I was really, I guess you'd have to say sort of fascinated by the politics.  And, of course, living in [Washington] D.C. everyone lived, breathed politics, you know.  Then [Gerald] Ford went on to pardon Nixon [President Richard Nixon, 1969-1974] and that was the end of his political career.
Story_ID: 39271
Speaker 1: Now when you graduated from high school [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, District of Columbia], now were you--was, was--
Speaker 2: No, me graduated, really?  Maybe left high school.
Speaker 1: Did you just leave?
Speaker 2: No, but, I mean, I didn't just leave.  I finished the year, but I failed jewelry making.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us--what--tell us about that.  What--
Speaker 2: So I failed jewelry making partly because I was reading the autobiography of Mal-, yeah, 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X', which I found to be more interesting than jewelry making.  I think I was a somewhat stubborn little girl.  I can imagine that my teachers didn't always find me--
Speaker 1: So they didn't let you graduate as a, with the rest of the students in high school?
Speaker 2: No, and I was supposed to take driver's ed to make up for it.  And my father [Robert Clive Maynard] was not necessarily all that excited.  So he and Nancy [Hicks-Maynard; Maynard's setpmother] came out--they went out to California.  They left me in the house and said that, you know, when they got back I would probably want to move--and by the way Boston [Massachusetts] was a nice city.  But, you know, as long as a--I wasn't going to school, didn't know what I was doing, I was on my own.  And so I was working at Roy Rogers and--which was a little--
Speaker 1: Like a steakhouse, right, or--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a steakhouse.  It was like, it was a, it was a decent fast food place.  It had chicken and--but you had to wear this little outfit and--like a little cowgirl skirt and a little hat and a little like cowgirl top.  And then you had to say, "Howdy, partner, you gonna eat it here at the, at the ranch or are you gonna hit the trail."  And then when people left you had to say, "Happy trails now!"  Anyway, one of my friends who was going off to college, she worked at a sandwich place, upscale sandwich place called Booeymongers.  And when she was getting ready to go, I interviewed for a job there, and then realized I was on the sandwich track.  And so I went home from that interview and called TWA Airlines and got some guy in the middle of the night and told him that I wanted to go to (I wonder who that is)--anyway, told him I wanted to go to Algeria.  And I wanted to go to Algeria because--first of all, I knew if I, I, if I didn't do something dramatic, I was not gonna get to college.  And if I didn't get to college, I wasn't gonna get out of the sandwich track.  So I figured I'd go to Algeria because both Edridge Cleaver and Timothy Leary had gone there.  So that had to be okay.  Any--and so--anyway, so I get this guy--this is back in '76 [1976] when airlines had real staff.  And he just-, he was, he just took so much time with me.  And he was quite clear that I really didn't want to go to Algeria.  I mean, I guess he could figure out from my voice that I was pretty young.  And so he talked to me and said, you know, Algeria's not a good place to go and--.  So he convinced me to go to Morocco.  And my father was coming back from D.C., from the Bay Area [California] for a week or so.  So I asked if we could have lunch.  And I told him I wanted to go to Africa.  And his first response was, you know, he was, as I said, not all that excited about the non-high school diploma situation.  So his response was, you know, what does Africa want with a high school dropout?  But then we went to lunch and--so when I used to go to lunch with him and meet him at the 'Washington Post' he'd take me to like the Madison Hotel--it was across the street where you could get clams on the half shell and, you know.  And this, at this point in my life I was like taken about ten blocks away to some tiny little barbecue joint, you know.  I think my--but anyway over lunch-
Speaker 1: You think he was trying to send you a message or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so (chuckle).  I think my stature had dropped a little bit.  So over lunch he got--and he [Robert Clive Maynard] actually got really excited by it.
Story_ID: 39272
Speaker 1: And so I had my, my Roy Rogers money and off I went [to Africa].  Well, it took a while, but that was the summer.  And then I went to say--I was--so I went back to New York--
Speaker 2: I mean, so, did you go to Morocco?
Speaker 1: No, I went to, I went to, I went all over.  I went to--I flew into Nigeria and then I stayed there for a while.  And then I went to Kenya, and I stayed in Kenya for a while.  And then I traveled from Kenya to--well, I flew to Rwanda 'cause, you know, Idi Amin [Dada] was in Uganda.  It was hard to get into Uganda.
Speaker 2: Well, you were trying to get in?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was, it was--
Speaker 2: Were you by yourself?
Speaker 1: I was by myself.  And then I, I met a guy.  And so we traveled--I met a Canadian guy and we got together and so then we traveled to--from Rwanda to--through Zaire and Central African Empire--what was then Central African Empire--Togo, Ghana.  And then we ran out of money.  And in, in an interim my father [Robert Clive Maynard] had quit his job.  Oh, and the other thing I did was I wrote my college application to Middlebury [College] from Nigeria.  So I figured that was about the only shot I had of getting into college, saying, okay, I messed up but here I am.  I took my money, I'm in Nigeria.  And so I got into college while I was traveling.
Story_ID: 39273
Speaker 1: 'Cause they didn't--so you never got a high school diploma at all.
Speaker 2: No.  So I got into college and then, and then I told my father [Robert Clive Maynard] by the way I applied, and he was very happy about that.  But then I decided I wasn't actually gonna go that year.
Speaker 1: Now Middlebury College is, it's important to note that the first black college graduate graduated from Middlebury [College].  Do you know that story?
Speaker 2: It was Twilight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Alexander Twilight--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which I think is a joke name, but I don't know.  But that's, this is, yeah, back in the 1800s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Ron Brown went to Middlebury [College].
Speaker 1: Ron Brown?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Former Secretary of Commerce.
Speaker 2: That Ron Brown, yeah.
Speaker 1: The one that died in the plan crash.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yep, I don't--I mean it was a very difficult--I can't imagine--I mean I had, I didn't find it all that warm and inviting.  And I can't even imagine how he had it at, at, at--when he was there.  But anyways--
Speaker 1: Well, how did you choose Middlebury [College]?  I mean, what was the--
Speaker 2: Good question.  Well, I had gone to a lot of high schools.  And I, I, I'd gone to very, you know--you had--they had--all the high schools I went to there was a certain standard of college you would go to.  And I wanted a fresh start and I thought, well, I don't know anybody who's gone to Middlebury, so I'll go to Middlebury [College].  Now I didn't think, hmm, I don't know anybody who'd gone to Middlebury [College] (chuckle)--I wonder what that's about.  So that's how I picked Middlebury [College].  But anyway so when I was in Africa and I took a--so I, I, I decided not--I deferred a year and then, and then I ran out of money.  And my boyfriend was having money wired and it got--it wasn't coming.  And so, you know, I was eighteen--had my birthday so I was nineteen, so I was thinking like a nineteen-year-old.  It's like, well, no point in worrying my parents, so I just won't tell them anything because I didn't want to worry them.  And I think that my father had sent me some money and in my mind it indicated he would not be sending any more.  Now, one thing I would do, though, is everywhere I went I would go meet the, the--I'd go to the American Embassy.  So, now we're out of money and there's no money, there's no money, there's no money, no money.  And then I didn't--and then my boyfriend got malaria and now I didn't realize it, but I also had malaria.  And I just realized I, I, I can't do this, and I'm gonna have to be repatriated.  And so I went back to the Embassy and I walk in and they're all like where have you been?  'Cause, apparently, at this point my father had just become quite hysterical and he had gone to his friends at the State Department and they had the State Department looking for me at all the embassies (chuckle) across West Africa.  'Cause that's all he knew was the last time he'd heard of me was in West Africa.  And so he wanted me to come home immediately.  And I still wanted to go through the Sahara.  So, we had days of wrangling over it, but eventually he, he acquiesced and I went to the Sahara and into- and came home.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did you go in the Sahara?
Speaker 2: Algeria, Mali, Algeria, and, finally, Morocco.  It was beautiful.  It was absolutely gorgeous.  We'd be on these trucks, you know, and just the sand dunes and--it was really, it was, it was just amazing.  And then we'd eat the--you know, the way you ate was you would, you'd put the food in the sand and they make a fire over it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this is in 1973 or--
Speaker 2: '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: No, no, yeah, '77 [1977].  I missed all of '77 [1977], yeah.  I left at the end of '76 [1976], missed all of '77 [1977].  And so I came home in early '78 [1978]?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That, okay.
Speaker 2: And then I started college in '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 39274
Speaker 1: So you started at Middlebury [College].  How, how did you like Middlebury [College]?
Speaker 2: I got out in far, in four years--in, out, and done--never been back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  Well, first of all, I'm from New York.  I mean, so, my boyfriend drives me to, to college and I fell, I fell asleep, let's say, in New Jersey.  And then I woke up in Vermont.  And it was just like there were no houses (laughter).  So, what have I done?  I mean it just went on and on and on and on.  It was like trees.  And you'd go down this road--you know, you're down, driving down these roads and be like maybe one road but there's nothing there, you know.  It's like where are the people.  There were no people, nobody, nothing.  Oh my.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a--Vermont, Maine probably are places where you don't find a lot of black people in this country, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, let me just stop at--first thing, you don't find people--and then you don't find a lot of black people.  Yeah, no, it was quite, I mean it was just mystifying.  And I wanted to leave and--but I think my father [Robert Clive Maynard] liked having me tucked away in, in Vermont.  So, you know, I would say I want to transfer.  And then he would, finally he would end by saying, "For my money, you can just as easily go to CCNY [City College of New York]."  And seeing as it was his money that was paying for it, I got the message.
Speaker 1: That's a city college in New York--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what were your aspirations in terms of a career?  Did you have any--
Speaker 2: Well, at that point I wanted to become a journalist.  Initially I had not wanted to become a journalist.  But I wanted become a journalist because when I was in Africa is, well, it was the first time I saw the disparity between the depiction and what I considered the reality.  You know, I knew that what people were hearing about Africa was just about the violence and the danger.  And, you know, I was seeing a beautiful place, a calm place with people who where interesting, engaged.  It was not war-torn.  It was not, you know--it was, it was not the deep, dark Africa.  And I realized that we needed more people who were able to see things through different prisms and different lenses and give a different--and give people a different story than that which they were hearing.  And so--and that, I mean, that really, really was what set me on my path.
Story_ID: 39275
Speaker 1: But it does seem like a, a theme in what you write, write about.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, what I read about you that the--you're concerned that people really see things through other people's lenses--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and don't--and the media can color what we see.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we're all human.  And so, I mean if, if you, if you were to set me in the middle of a suburb and ask me to cover it, my coverage would be very different because of my experience and my distrust of the suburbs, you know.  But, but I also understand and I have that.  Now, if you set me in the suburbs and told me to cover it and didn't--and I wasn't so self-aware of my views of the suburbs, I wouldn't be able to factor in for that and so that would always seep into my coverage.  And that's what happens, you know.  I mean now when I look at the way my neighborhood's covered--I live in a poor black neighborhood.  And when I first moved there, you know, there were times when, when I would hear gunshots.  So, admittedly, yes, there is violence there.  There's also, you know, a lot of great people, caring people.  You know, the guy down the street from me who is alternatively housed--I can't say he's homeless 'cause he's found a place--but he lives in a, in a vacant house.  You know, he--when my husband was sick and dying he was always there to make sure that I had locked the door in the middle of the night when the ambulances would come.  And, there were a lot of times when I, you know, I didn't lock my car.  I mean, I was pretty frazzled 'cause I was, you know, the only caregiver.  I left the keys in the door overnight.  And people in neighborhood were quite aware of what was happening.  And so if the neighborhood was as depicted in the media, then I would have been killed, and I was not.  Instead people left flowers when my husband died.  And we don't give people--oftentimes we don't display people's humanity when it comes to poor people, people of color.  We only talk about them as problems.  You know, I was talking to somebody the other day about the need for more accurate depiction in digital space.  And so this person said, oh, well, maybe this online news organization can get a grant from an African American donor and can cover the African American community--you know, can write about problems with mental health and, you know, healthcare issues.  It's like, you know what, that's--no, that's fine but I also want to be seen as not a problem.  You can't only portray people as problems because we are much more complex than that.  And I'm not a problem.  And it, and, and yet because of this portrayal, in effect--as you know, I mean, it, it, it has consequences--all of us on our everyday life.  You know, I was in Washington [D.C.].  I was meeting a funder at a hotel and I talked to somebody and the manager for whatever reason--I still don't know what happened--but he kicked me out of the hotel because there is no space where we see middle-aged, middle class, average black women.  You know, we don't--then we're not depicted in the media unless we have a problem--you know, we can't find a husband or we have some horrible disease or, you know, we have a net worth of less than a dollar.  You know, the--we do need to talk about the problems that we all have, but we also need to see ourselves whole and not only as the problems.  We need to see us--I mean, you know, Christmas shopping--

Speaker 1: Middlebury College--what was the--were there very many other black students or minority students--
Speaker 2: Even--it's interesting because our class was a very interesting class--not me, but the rest--'cause I had deferred a year.  But the rest of the class of people of color--we had Puerto Rican, mostly black, but we had some Latinos.  But they, my fellow students, were the first class that was like solely picked for their great grades.  And as a result of that, what was very interesting is that people walked in with a sense of entitlement.  And I think previously people were so grateful to be there.  Now they're like well of course I'm at Middlebury [College] and they're like A students.  So that set off a little friction with the administration.  I don't think they'd had a class like ours before.  And they were not very supportive.  And so I think we started with thirty, let's say.  And by the time our class graduated there were maybe eight.  I used to know the numbers completely.  And what was very interesting to me was that for whatever reason the people that actually graduated were the people that couldn't go home and say I flunked out.  You know, if I, if I had flunked out of college (chuckle) after high school, it would have been, it just would not have been a pretty picture.  And it was, it was interesting to see the role that the family played in, in, in keeping us all there.  So, so anyway, we, we were left with about eight.  And, you know, it took me a long time to appreciate it, but in the end of--I am glad I went to Middlebury [College].  I learned a lot.  My college roommate is still one of my closest friends.  I was there when Ronald Reagan [U.S. President, 1981-1989] was elected.  And--
Speaker 1: Nineteen-eighty [1980], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the girls in my dorm were so happy that they erupted into cheers and celebrated with having a popcorn party.  So, first, we're excited that Ronald Reagan was elected, which is the first thing that was kind of like--seriously.  And then the second was--and the way we celebrate is with a popcorn party--really?  So, you know--and I met a lot of Republicans.  My college roommate married a Republican.  So that gave--that, that again humanized people.  You know, I mean, when I, when we--at the [Maynard] Institute when I talk about really humanizing people, I, I really do mean across all the different fault lines.  We can't demonize rich people either.  We can't demonize Republicans.  And so, you know--and I--and because I went to Middlebury [College] I got to meet a lot of, you know, I mean, you know, not just sort of kind of wealthy people, but--and, you know, going to some of the private schools I went to in D.C., I'd met a lot of wealthy people, but they were more of the liberal, ar-, artistic leaning.  This was, you know, Rockefellers and what not.  And, you know, I think it made me a much more--it was a much--I'm much the richer for having been there.
Story_ID: 39277
Speaker 1: Now was your major journalism [at Middlebury College]?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, history.
Speaker 1: History, okay.  All right, did they have a journalism program at Middlebury [College]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what, what history did you concentrate on?
Speaker 2: American history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you said what--would you then describe--you were talking about the Republicans there and the people being so excited about [Ronald] Reagan [U.S. President, 1981-1989] being elected.  Was it primarily a conservative--kind of a Republican campus?
Speaker 2: I think it was.  I mean--and maybe that's just be--it was certainly not the sort of artistic leftie environment that I had been used to.  And that, I think, was really, as I said, was really good for me.  I mean it, it, it started me on this sort of journey of learning what life was outside that northeast corridor.  So, I don't--I, I thought of it as conservative.  Was it in retrospect?  I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that--maybe not.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher or was there a mentor or someone that you looked up to at, at Middlebury [College]?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean there were some--there was a couple teachers that I li--younger, some of the younger teachers.  And I--but not, not really.  No.  I think I, I was so like a fish out of water out there kind of looking around like what the heck is going on around here (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Did you kind of rattle them a little bit?  I would think with your background and your ideas on things, your views being so different--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--so, the interesting thing is when I started, when I started my parents were unemployed.  And I don't know if I rattled them but it was sort of--and, and like so my college roommate, who comes from a, a very wealthy family, her father--you know she arrived in a Bentley and it was only one of her father's, you know, great cars and Newport [Rhode Island] mansion and all of that.  And I greeted her with great suspicion.  And within thirty-six hours we were the best of friends and remain the best of friends to this day.  But people would say to her, you know, how can you live with her?  You know, like, your family is so and her family is--.  Well then by the sophomore year my father [Robert Clive Maynard] was the editor of the '[Oakland] Tribune.'  And by the time I graduated, publisher.  So it was sort of interesting watching the evolution of people's views on us as a family.  And then, of course, my father was--I think he'd started to get some of his television appearances by then.
Story_ID: 39278
Speaker 1: Did he appear on show like 'Meet the Press' or--
Speaker 2: Well, what he [Robert Clive Maynard] eventually appeared on was a, as a regular was 'This Week with David Brinkley.'  And there was a time when he was on that almost monthly.  And that was something, that was like the thing that we did together.  I, I was kind--well, I was sort of a preparation coach.  We would go there, and I would get there usually before him.  And we'd get a suite at the Jefferson Hotel, which is a very nice hotel.  And, and nobody else in the family really wanted to do it because what we would do is we would go and we would start, you know, figuring out what the subjects were gonna be--he was on the round table--what the subjects would be.  And then we would get the newspapers and we'd do all the kinds of research and sometimes we wouldn't even go out for dinner the night before.  And then we--he would, he would work with another presentation coach and sort of get his lines together.  We'd get the lines together and then--oh, we'd get up early and we'd practice some more.  And then he'd go do the show and then leave, come back, and we'd watch the show and analyze it.  It was great.  I mean, I loved it.  But I don't (chuckle), you know, and we'd call 'em our Brinkley weekends.  My youngest brother came once.  And except for the time--he must have been, well, he was thirteen when dad died, so he must have been seven or eight.  And it was, except for the time where we lost him, it was a nice trip.  But we did momentarily misplace him while we were walking around.
Speaker 1: Where were you at when you misplaced him (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We were near the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  And we were so engrossed in our conversation that we momentarily lost him.  I've never been so glad to see my little brother in my life (chuckle).
Speaker 1: There were no cell phones in those days.
Speaker 2: No, there were no cell phones.
Speaker 1: Did you just happen to find him again or--
Speaker 2: Well, we were looking (laughter).  We were actively searching (chuckle).  And he had the sense to stand on a corner.  Oh, good lord, that was horrible.  He didn't come back.  But anyway those were great, great weekends.  We, we had a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 39279
Speaker 1: Well, it just sounds like you had an incredible--
Speaker 2: Oh, I met Colin Powell.  I think I met [Vice President] Dick Cheney [2001-2009].  I met Bob Dole a couple of times.  In fact, Bob Dole--so I was there--because I, I was there so often--and, and, and it would be--well, there'd--.  One of the things I was talking about the coaching--and so the important thing about that for people I think is that when my father [Robert Clive Maynard] started doing television--he was not very good.  I mean, he was terrible.  He's, he would talk about like these really long trips back from, you know, Washington to the Bay area just realizing how, ooh, how bad the job was.  But he kept at.  And then when I started joining him, he got, you know, just that concentrated effort.  So it's a--to me it's a great lesson in how you can start off being really bad at something and, and become really good at it.  And, so, as we were, I was there so much, Will, George Will, had a daughter who was the same age as my youngest brother and I'm by now very used to being a big sister.  And she was a little bit of a handful.  But I would just be like, you know what, just do that, do that.  And so a lot of times when I would come, the staff would just like leave her in my care.  And so one day we're sitting in the green room, which had, they had this great spread.  But the guy behind the--you know, who--I can't remember his name--was a really nice guy who--the server.  But anyway he wasn't in the room.  It was just me and Victoria Will.  And I'm sitting there telling her, "You will drink your orange juice."  And so this guy walks in, white guy walks in, and he looks at me and he says, "I'd like a club soda."  And I said, "Oh, okay.  Would you like a twist?"  "No, straight."  And so I hand him his club soda.  And a little while later the executive, the booker, and Bob Dole walks in.  And she had this long spiel that she would give, you know--This is Bob Maynard's daughter.  He's on the ray-, roundtable, blah, blah, and Dori's a journalist in her own right.  And she starts to go into that and Bob Dole's like, oh, Dori and I are old friends.  And now this other guy had to sit there for--he was also a guest on the show for the next hour with me.  We never discussed what had happened.  And, interestingly about that was that he was, he was actually a Democrat.  He had been in [President Jimmy] Carter's administration [1977-1981].
Speaker 1: Well, who was it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Stuart Eisendrath, Stuart Eisen--
Speaker 1: --drath--yeah, I remember that name (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: There--you know, [President] Jimmy Carter, as well liked as he is by the black community--he had Earl, he had hired Earl Butz.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Remember Earl Butz?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And then, and then the point being--but I say that just to say, what I was saying earlier, is that we will always, you know, we'll say the Republicans are the--you know, and the Democrats--well.  You know Bob Dole actually came through for me there.  And he--I actually thought Bob Dole was a very--
Speaker 1: So, so how old are you at this point?  Are you still in college?
Speaker 2: No, now I'm--
Speaker 1: So, you're out of college.
Speaker 2: --I'm, well, I'm late twenties.
Speaker 1: Well, was there a significant story about college graduation?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except I was done (laughter).  And I graduated.
Speaker 1: Did you have a actual graduation this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I graduated.  I have a diploma.  I don't know where it is.  But I graduated.  I actually graduated, yes.
Speaker 1: Did your father come and your mother come?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother came.  My father had a speaking engagement, which I was not exactly happy about.
Story_ID: 39280
Speaker 1: All right, so--but immediately after graduation, what did you do?  Did you have a job lined up (unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: No, I went to New York for a while.  And then I came out here.  And then I got a job, my first job in '83 [1983]--I graduated in '82 [1982]--was in Bakersfield, California, which was also fascinating.
Speaker 1: What were you doing?
Speaker 2: I was a reporter at the 'Californian.'  And it was, I mean, you know, further away from my New York roots, to say the least--
Speaker 1: Now, let--I'm trying to--now, you knew enough about reporting, I guess, we haven't got there--you knew enough about being a journalist that you didn't need to go back to school and do anything in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, back then--
Speaker 1: --'cause you were a history major and--
Speaker 2: Right, well I got summer internships.  But this is also before--it was right on the cusp when people had to go to graduate school for journalism.  You know, journalists, you'd just learn on the job.  So--and I was sort of on the cusp for when that was changing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  And--I guess, before I leave school, what did you focus on in school as a capstone paper for history?
Speaker 2: Oh, George Washington Williams, who was the first African American historian.  And there are actually--oh, John Hope Franklin was also writing a book about him.  And he came to Middlebury [College] to speak.  And I tried to get him to talk to me about him, but he really wouldn't.
Speaker 1: He wouldn't talk about George Washington--
Speaker 2: A little bit, but not much, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you finally--were you--did you--I, I suppose you've read his book about history.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I surely did, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was an interesting guy--George Washington Williams--very interesting.  So that's what I, that was what I did.  My junior thesis was on American Indian Movement and then George Washington Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 39281
Speaker 1: So alright. So now you're, you're at the Oak-, the, you're here in the Bay Area [California] and you're working for the--
Speaker 2: No, I'm in Bakersfield [California].
Speaker 1: Bakersfield [California], okay.
Speaker 2: --which is in Central California, Kern County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, I was just--I, I only stayed a year and a half or a little over a year.  But it was fa-, you know, it, it was in retrospect fascinating.  At the time I was fascinated but also very uncomfortable.  You know, there were not a lot of black people.  It was not, it was far from the East Coast sensibility.  But it was awfully interesting.  It was where I met women--I, I remember my landlord once who was, I don't know, maybe in her thirties explaining to me that, that she had told her husband it was time for her to stop working.  And I mean I just couldn't even conceive of--you, you just stop--I mean, like--but, but she was still in that sort of women don't work mode.  I--everybody initially couldn't believe I had never shot a gun, you know, because they did target prac--.  It, it, it fundamentally changed my understanding of the gun control debate because everybody there went hunting or did target practice.  And, and, and really they just put, I mean, they would constantly like, like tease me for having never shot a gun.  And so finally I turned to them and said I can't believe you've never been on a subway.  And then that sort of ended it, you know.  I was able to find a parallel experience that I found to be universal but they hadn't experienced.  And so that, that sort of helped them see that we had, that we both had, you know, very different ideas of what was an everyday experience.  So that was fascinating.  And then, you know, this was back in the day when Woody Allen was so popular in New York.  And I remember there was a Woody Allen movie that came out--I can't remember what it was.  And I went, and I was one of four people in the audience.  And then I drove, I was driving home and I was passing this Bakersfield Civic Center and I thought, oh, there's this guy there I've never heard of.  And I'd never even, I never even heard of the kind of thing.  It was like some kind of like, I don't know, televangelist or something.  And I said, well, I'll go see what this is.  And I go, you know, I go running up there and, and, oh, the guy's name was Oral Roberts.  And I'll be darned if it was not sta--I could not get in there.  It was standing room only.  It was packed.  And much to my amazement, he wasn't even, even there!  They, there was some, you know, he was being videoed in!  So there was nobody (chuckle), nobody at Woody Allen.  The whole town was at this Oral Roberts guy.  I mean, it was just, it was--everyday was like that where you just were like, wow, my world is being turned upside down.  The big star, one of the big stars who lived there--I think he may have been the big star.  It was like Buck Henry from 'Hee Haw'.  Who the heck watched Hee Haw--I mean, really, Hee Haw?  But, there he was.  And, you know, you began to have an understanding of this whole culture.  Not everybody woke up on Sunday and read 'The New York Times' book review.  And it was, it was, it was really fascinating.  And I left after a little over a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what kind of stories did you report on?
Speaker 2: Transportation.  I was on--I did the transportation beat.  And that was also interesting.  I mean, you know, they got a, air-, airplane--when United [Airlines] came to town--I think United [Airlines] eventually left.  Amtrak station opened.  I mean, it was just all these things that I took for granted were suddenly, you know, coming up in Bakersfield [California].
Story_ID: 39282
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so where did you go after Bakersfield [California]?
Speaker 2: I went to 'The Patriot Ledger' in Quincy, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a, an interesting place, too.  That was--well first of all, I lived in Boston [Massachusetts], which I understand is, is better.  But back then it was still Boston [Massachusetts].  You know who I met?  Did you remember seeing that picture of the, during bussing, the guy who was being chased out of the Civic Center, a black guy being chased out the Civic Center with--and people chasing him with the American flag?
Speaker 1: Ted Landsmark.
Speaker 2: I met him.
Speaker 1: Ted Landsmark.
Speaker 2: And he stayed in Boston [Massachusetts], at least he was back there in the eighties [1980s].
Speaker 1: Did he, did he tell you what happened to him at all?  Did he--did you ask him?
Speaker 2: I did, but I don't remember.  I was just--I'm more like why are you still here, my goodness.
Speaker 1: He's in charge of the Boston Architectural Foundation now.
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's kind of funny--with that name.  So anyway it was interesting being in Boston [Massachusetts] because--or--and I was covering the South Shore, which is where people went for white flight after the, after the bussing decision.  So that was interesting.  There I was a general assignment reporter.  But I became really interested in issues around prison, yeah, and, you know, prison reform.
Speaker 1: Now, why prison reform at that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was just trying to remember why I got so interested in, in--and I thought there should be a prison beat.  And I can't remember what first sparked my interest in it.  But it was ac-, you know, they were--well, there was a interesting time because people had been trying things like giving, giving inmates a college education.  And there was some school of thought that said that for every year of education you got, the recidivism rate dropped.  And--but this was also the beginning of push back from people saying why should I spend, you know, $30,000 a year to send my child to Boston College and these inmates are getting that education for free.  So that sort of friction between how we view prison rehabilitation, punishment, it was, it was--and I think we're now coming back because we built such a big prison industrial complex we can't really afford it anymore.  And, yeah, it's interesting to watch people rolling or talking about rolling back some of the laws that sent so many African Americans to prison--like, you know, the--trying to--decriminalizing marijuana, which, you know, would seem to me to be a no-brainer--'cause it's the drug laws that got us to where we are.
Speaker 1: And crack cocaine possession, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's still--
Speaker 2: Oh, it is.  I mean, you see the disparity.  You see even the disparity about the way we talk about it.  It's interesting--I was watching the 'Today' show this morning and, you know, everyone has been covering the Charlie Sheen story.  And with--so now the 'Today' show was covering Charlie Sheen and, you know, this would drive me crazy because if Charlie Sheen were poor and black, his outcome would have been significantly different.  And we wouldn't have all these sort of--you know I watched the reporter after, after Charlie Sheen's children were taken out of his custody, I watched the reporter who had covered him for the 'Today Show' talk about well, you know, when I was in his house, it was almost boring.  There're really the porn stars aren't taking care of him, the nannies are, you know--almost defending Charlie Sheen.  Now Charlie Sheen's lost his job and now for the first time they're really starting to talk about does Charlie Sheen have a mental illness, you know.  And so as long as Charlie Sheen (chuckle) was working and bringing in--and, and I don't think that this is conscious.  You know, I don't think that the producers of the 'Today Show' even understand how in their mind it sort of, thing sort of shifted that, well, while he's working--I mean, I mean, he sounded insane, from my perception.  Oh, he was certainly mentally troubled from day one.  Yeah, and now, you know, now that he, he's lost his job, it's sort of like now, now we're starting to question it.  So, it's interesting just to see how we view mental illness and crime through the prism of class.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And that's what I got interested in back in, in, in 'The Patriot Ledger.'
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 39283
Speaker 1: So, now, let's see, you were at 'The Patriot Ledger' until--well, how, how long were you there?
Speaker 2: How much research do you guys do?  Till eighty--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, we do, we have it here.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: We do have it here--in--
Speaker 2: Oh, I gave it to you?  '85 [1985] to '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: '89, that's right, 1989.
Speaker 2: Oh I, oh I guess I did, didn't I?
Speaker 1: Yes.  But, now your father [Robert Clive Maynard] was diagnosed with cancer, pancreatic cancer in '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Prostate cancer.
Speaker 1: Prostrate cancer, okay.  They have it wrong here, prostrate.
Speaker 2: I think actually it was '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did you--okay, so he's basically ill but he's--
Speaker 2: Doing okay.
Speaker 1: --he's still functioning (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39284
Speaker 1: And you go to the 'Detroit Free Press'--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --in 1989--
Speaker 2: But I will say, okay, so I go to 'Detroit Free Press' and, yeah, my father [Robert Clive Maynard] is diagnosed in '87 [1987] and it was inoperable, which is not what you want to hear.  And--but he's the owner of the 'Oakland Tribune', his wife [Nancy Hicks Maynard] is on the board of Kaiser, and he lived for six years, which my guess is, he outlived probably the initial prognosis because he had money and he had stature and he had a lot of good care.  And then I was in Detroit [Michigan] and I just remember looking at people, realizing that had they had the same diagnosis, they would not have had the same outcome--and the inequity in our medical system.  I mean, you know--well, I remember my father would, would fly me home always, very frequently.  But once he got sick, it was even more frequently and, you know, I, I was running a lot of errands.  I just remember being tired and cranky and on line to get his medicine and feeling sorry for myself--why do I have to do this?  And looking across at the line, looking at the line ac-, you know, parallel to me and seeing an older woman clearly ill on line getting her own medicine and realizing, you know, that the energy that she was expending to get her own medicine was the energy she couldn't expend to get better to help herself heal and that my father's resources gave him such a leg up on that. (Pause) So, anyway, so then I was in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 39285
Speaker 1: So how did you like Detroit [Michigan]?  Had you ever been in the Midwest before?
Speaker 2: No!
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I had never been in the Midwest before.  I--you know, Detroit [Michigan], again, fascinating.  I don't think I'd do--I am not--I'm a coastal person is one of the things I discovered from both Kern County [California] and from--'cause Kern County's sort of Central California and Detroit [Michigan], Midwest.  No, I, I'm not a Midwesterner.  I'm a coastal person.  I don't--now having said that, Detroit [Michigan], again, was a fascinating place.  The racial politics--somebody when, where my--I, I left, I got a Nieman Fellowship, so my father [Robert Clive Maynard] and I were the first father/daughter to ever get Nieman Fellowship.  And one of the questions during my interview was what's the difference between races and between Quincy [Massachusetts] and Detroit [Michigan]?  And the difference was that in Quincy [Massachusetts], you know, or in the South Shore, people have said, okay, we're just, you know, we're just starting a new life over here and whatever.  And they were perfectly happy.  In Detroit [Michigan] people felt--I--it seemed to me that the, the people who left felt as if something had been taken away from them.  And the division--I'd never lived somewhere where there was that kind of stark divide between a suburb and a city.  I mean it was stark in terms of race and it was stark in terms of attitude.  I would, I, as I think I mentioned, I'm not a big--the suburbs don't really work for me.  I'm a, I am an urban person--in part because of the politics.  The, you know, the suburbs were created in White flight.  But I don't feel--I mean I really like the excitement of, you know, things.  As I've talked about cultures meeting and, you know, the surprises that you can see in the ci-, in the city.  And suburbs just don't--I don't like suburbs.  In Detroit [Michigan] there were no places to shop in the city.  There were very few places to eat in the city.  I would come back to Oakland [California] to do my shopping 'cause I also wasn't gonna then give people my suburban, you know, I wasn't giving my tax dollars for discriminating and not having stores in the city.  But, I am a shopper, so I would still go out and explore the suburbs.  So one day I had gone, had taken the freeway, gone out to the suburbs and then had meandered through a couple of different adjoining, you know, suburbs and I ended up I knew closer to Detroit [Michigan].  And I was in Border's Books and I just wanted to get back--I didn't want to have to go back and then come--you know what I mean?  I didn't want to have to retrace my steps.  So I start asking people how do I get to Detroit [Michigan].  They didn't know.  And finally they all kept telling me to ask someone named Camilla.  And so I'm (unclear) hunting down poor Camilla, 'cause Camilla can tell me how to get to Detroit [Michigan].  And I finally find Camilla.  And I ask her how do I get to Detroit [Michigan].  And she's like--see, everybody told you, told me that you can tell me.  And she looks at me like--me, I don't even know how to drive.  Why'd they ask you to--tell me to ask me!  And I wanted to say, well, Camilla, take a look at the mirror.  I mean, she was of indeterminate racial ethnicity, but she was definitely, you know, had some, well, she was definitely of color.  Anyway, I, so I retraced my steps.  And some time later I'm out on assignment with somebody and for some reason we're at this Border's Books or at the shopping mall where the Border Book--and it turned out that if I had literally left the parking lot and turned left--that's it.  Turned left.  Within a few blocks, I would have been on the freeway to Detroit [Michigan].  One left turn and like four or five blocks--and not one person in that store could tell me how to get to Detroit [Michigan].  It was just amazing.  And then in Detroit [Michigan] the level of pride for people who were there was also very high and really interesting to be observing.  I mean, one of the things I noticed that when people got the, the newspaper, the people who were shocked by the state of Detroit [Michigan] and said disparaging things were put in one category by some people, and what I would do, is just listen.
Story_ID: 39286
Speaker 1: And I also, cause I keep talking about how I like the city, I also made the decision to live in Detroit [Michigan], which I'm--was--I mean, I, I loved my place in Detroit [Michigan].  It was a great place to live.  But, you know, if you sat there and you listened, you got a sense of why people were proud of Detroit [Michigan].  Because [Mayor] Coleman Young really made people feel as if they owned their city, you know.  And that's a, a different feel than, than they had had before.  And it's a different feel than a lot of other people have.  So, Detroit [Michigan] was I thought a really interesting place.  And I covered a Republican senatorial candidate--he lost.  But I remember--this gets back to Middlebury [College], they would say, oh, he must be liberal, blah, blah, blah, and I was like, really, I went to Middlebury [College], so maybe not.  So it, it actually worked to my favor later in on my career in a unexpected way.
Speaker 2: You, you could do Middlebury [College] as a stalking horse for (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  So how--you can't, you can't, you can't really prejudge me because--you can't categorize me because--.  So that was kind of interesting.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm trying to think of some of the things that were going on in Detroit [Michigan].  I mean, they were losing jobs, losing a lot of things--
Speaker 1: Oh, losing jobs--the car industry was falling apart.  The school system wasn't doing so well.  You know, it's interesting 'cause I was back there in June and they've done some, some pretty decent development.  Oh, of course, Coleman Young was the big story.
Speaker 2: He was.  There were some--we met some people on the 'Detroit Free Press'.  Did you know Luther Keith?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, yeah, okay.  I don't think Angelo Henderson was there (unclear).
Speaker 1: Don't think I know him.
Speaker 2: Betty DeRamus (unclear)--
Speaker 1: She wasn't there--no, maybe--I can't remember.
Speaker 2: She might have been there (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you know the people over at the 'Michigan Citizen'?
Speaker 1: No, not really.
Story_ID: 39287
Speaker 1: '89 [1989] to '92 [1992] [Maynard's job at the 'Detroit Free Press']--
Speaker 2: '89 [1989] to '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: --and then I went to get my Nieman Fellowship.
Speaker 2: Now did--what stories did you write in Detroit [Michigan]?  Now, this is an interesting place so, so what did--the kind of stories you would write--
Speaker 1: Well, I covered the sen-, the Republican senatorial candidate that I was telling you about, and I covered the mayor's race.  And I covered--one of the first stories that I did that I really liked was e--when I was younger and my father would take me places, he would always make me identify what neighborhood I was in, you know, by just the cues.  And so when I was in Detroit [Michigan], I, I was sent to a shooting.  It was an utter tragedy--the drive-by shooting where they inadvertently killed a little six-year-old.  And what fascinated me about it was that everybody saw this neighborhood as a very poor neighborhood.  And when I looked at--and in a very, you know, with all the things with poverty, right--poor and dysfunctional and violent and--.  And, and as I was reporting the story I saw all these really neatly mowed lawns and--you know.  And I went back and did a, a profile of the neighborhood.  It would--it seemed what had happened was for the things that we attribute to middle class, it was a middle class neighborhood that was mired in poverty because the jobs had gone, you know.  And so you had the ability to, to write those kinds of stories as well as I said the politics.  I covered the mayor's race.  I did a story--they also liked looking at sort of two different neighborhoods and why they were voting for the different candidates and sort of the complexion of the neighborhood.  It was a fascinating place to live.
Speaker 2: Now, you were there when Nelson Mandela came through--
Speaker 1: I was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was there when Man--
Speaker 2: Tell us about that.  I hear, I've heard about it over and over again, but what did you think?
Speaker 1: About Nelson--well, you know, I covered him--actually I went to Boston [Massachusetts] to cover that, when he came to Boston [Massachusetts].  I mean it was electrifying.  I mean, out--and then I did see him also in Detroit [Michigan].  It was amazing!  Well, I mean, the whole (pause)--to see [Nelson] Mandela out of prison--.  You know, all the things that you think can't happen--and I think, I think actually as a, as a world we have to stop believing in 'it is the way it is and therefore it will always be that way.'  Between Nelson Mandela [South African President, 1994-1995] and Barack Obama [U.S. President, 2009- ], you know, we're constantly being reminded that the absolute impossible is possible.  But we're also--their stories are also instructional is that it doesn't just happen, you know, that they have strategies and a certain temperament, you know, and--.  It's like why is Nelson Mandela Nelson Mandela?  Why, why was it Nelson Mandela and not somebody else?  Why was it Malcolm X and not somebody else?  You know you--the, the--but anyway it was, it was, it was quite something to be there at Tiger Stadium [Detroit, Michigan] and also in Boston [Massachusetts].  I mean it--and just seeing people's reaction.  I mean there's your reaction, there's, there's--his words, and then just watching the crowds.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, oh, we were talking about that earthquake before.  But did you come, you come out here at all during the earthquake?
Speaker 1: Well, I did--well did I?  I'm sure I did 'cause I mean I was always coming home.  I think coming out after the fire was more dramatic, partly 'cause it was our neighborhood that burned down.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so I guess we're in the early nineties [1990s] now, I guess.  Anything else about Detroit [Michigan] that--you were there until nineteen ninety--
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 2: --two.
Speaker 1: So I was there for three years.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 39288
Speaker 1: And then I went back to Boston [Massachusetts] for my Nieman Fellowship.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I came out here.
Speaker 2: How was the Nieman Fellowship experience?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was fabulous!  I mean it wa--you know--and, and what was so interesting about the Nieman Fellowship was that--so I'm in Bos-, in Detroit [Michigan] and I really wanted to sort of cover issues of poverty.  Oh, another story I did was on compassion fatigue when I was in Detroit [Michigan] because one of my colleagues asked me what I wanted to write about--and she was a writing coach.  And I said well I'd really like to address issues of poverty.  And she's like I am so tired of poverty.  I know.  My first thought was, oh, why don't you move.  And then my second thought was, well, okay, but are there other people like her, you know?  And so I did the story about that--because I thought, well, we all want to see ourselves in the newspaper.  And if I do stories about people who are sick of poverty and they see themselves--and they're sick of, you know, compassion, they're just sick of issues--and they see themselves in the newspaper, well that then made them more inclined to read stories about other people.  And so I did a story on compassion fatigue.  Then I get to Harvard [University] and what I found--
Speaker 2: What was the story--what was the name of the story?  It was about what?
Speaker 1: Compassion fatigue.
Speaker 2: Oh, compassion fatigue.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, you said it fast.  I wasn't sure that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Compassion fatigue.
Speaker 1: And so then when I get to--
Speaker 2: How did that--I mean, how was that received--story about compassion fatigue?
Speaker 1: It was received--well, it was a hard story to do initially because people don't want to admit that we--I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to do the story in a way where people didn't end up feeling judged or they didn't think in my reporting that I was judging them.  And I wasn't judging them actually.  I just wanted to get sort of to the heart of it.  So, so then what was interesting about being at Harvard [University] was the disconnect between the people who are creating the policy and the people who will live under that policy, you know, to see you have people who have very nice lives in Cambridge [Massachusetts] coming up with policy for people on welfare.  And then we wonder why they don't always work out well, you know.  I mean--so anyway that's, and that's I think--when I was there, that's--my father [Robert Clive Maynard] was beginning to develop the Fault Lines framework.  And I was really--you know, all my life and my experiences had sort of prepared me for thinking about the fault lines and the parallel universes that we live in.  But I also think that being in Cambridge [Massachusetts] right after, being at the [Harvard University] Kennedy School right after living in Detroit [Michigan] really sort of brought that home for me.  So it was fascinating.  So I did a lot on, on, on public policy and poverty and--yeah, it was really, it was, it was very interesting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 39289
Speaker 1: Now in '93 [1993] Robert Maynard [Maynard's father] passes away.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: August 17th.  Now you were out here at this (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'd come home for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation in between my Nieman [Fellowship] and my going back to the '[Detroit] Free Press'.  But the day I was supposed to leave, my father was operated on--emergency operation--and became paralyzed.  And so I obviously stayed.  And then when he died I had a thirteen-year-old brother that I, you know, I stayed to help take care of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's 1993.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: They renamed the Institute for Journalism Education--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --after him.  And they had already, now they had already sold the 'Oakland Tribune'--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you know, to--
Speaker 2: Dean Singleton.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 39290
Speaker 1: Tell us about Fault Lines.
Speaker 2: Well, Fault Lines is the framework, it's our diversity framework that the, my father as I said developed that looks at diversity across race, class, gender, generation, and geography.  And what I like about it is that it, it really gives people permission to have the views they have.  It's, it's perfectly natural that these five fault lines shape our perceptions of ourselves, each other, events that--you know, two people with different fault line perceptions, they're gonna look at one event and see something completely different.  And we see it happening all the time, you know.  And, and I like the fact that it included geography way before we had the red state/blue state debate, you know.  And it's true.  I mean, people--that's it--people in Bakersfield [California] view gun control so much differently than you do in, you know, Oakland, California.  And that's within the same state.  So--but--so it, it says that, okay, it's absolutely natural that we have these, these different perceptions. Now the key thing is is how we restructure our conversations--not to have conversations where we're gonna agree with each other because, you know, a lot, a lot of times we're not going to agree with each other.  More important, we have conversations where we understand why we hold the pe-, points of view that we hold.  You know, no one is ever going to talk me into the fact that an AK-47 shouldn't be under some gun control.  You just--I--you're not gonna talk me into that.  But I am interested in really understanding, not your rhetoric, not your--but, but why, why in your heart you believe it should, it, it should be uncontrolled.  You know, those are the conversations that are gonna help us make sense of not only ourselves but when we're fashioning public policy.  And that's what we're trying to help journalists do--have those conversations both in their newsrooms and with their sources so that when they're reporting to us, they're giving us a much more nuance picture of the world.  So they're not just re--you know, I do not want one more person to refer to my neighborhood as a warzone.  It is not a warzone.  But I would like to show you what it's like to live there, you know.  I don't expect you to want to live there.  You know, when I go to people's houses in the suburbs and I think--I could never live here.  But then I have to also remember that a lot of the people who live there think I'm insane for where I live.  And so the Fault Lines framework just helps us have those conversations without using the word insane.  And it also, you know, allows us to make mistakes.  It reminds us that we have blind spots, areas where we simply don't see something.  So, sometimes what we take to be racist or sexist is, is a blind spot.  And it gives us another language, you know, so that you--when we give people the total Fault Lines training instead of--you know, they can then approach a colleague who they may think has a very narrow or slanted view of something and, instead of saying that, say I think we have a fault line issue there.  And so that's saying, you know, I don't necessarily agree with you, but I'm gonna respect, I have enough respect for you to say I think here's what's causing this, this schism.  And so it, it, it just--we stop finger-pointing and start probing more.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, how does it, how does it work on the ground?  You recruit participants--
Speaker 2: Well, we go into news organizations or we go into--there a variety of places.  We've done it in news organizations.  We've done it at NBC.  We've done it at universities.  And we lay out the framework and then we break them into groups so that they actually use it and they see how you can look at one issue through--and it looks very differently if you look at it across race or across class.  The other thing we do is, you know, if we're looking at a issue across class, because we are, we tend to skew middle class and feel like, oh, we, we've got to figure out, well, well, what does this look like from poor people.  And then I also try to gently remind them that we also include the rich people in this conversation.  You know, we forget who we're, we're trying to get in who we--we're not trying to get in--we don't always see those things.  So it helps you see, you know, who you're leaving out of a conversation as well and where your blind spots are.
Speaker 1: So do you try to bring all the representatives of all these different--
Speaker 2: I try to get people to think about how they would report a story across all of those points of view, yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And sometimes we don't know 'cause we do have blind spots.  So we sent some people once to a neighborhood that had a lot of immigrants in it.  And we asked them, we asked the reporters to ask community members how can people better cover you.  And the community members said, well, you can stop looking at us from your middle class point of view because--and, and stop calling us poor.  And you're calling us poor because you see two families living in one house and sharing a car.  And so you think that's poor.  And we say (chuckle) we have a house, we have a car.  We're not poor.  But, you know, unless you go and sort of explore things through different prisms and through different fa-, across the fault lines, your blind spots aren't gonna allow you to see all of that.
Story_ID: 39291
Speaker 1: So, so the [Maynard] Institute gets contracts to go in--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --universities, news--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --organizations--
Speaker 2: Other organizations that are grappling with diversity.  And, and we--
Speaker 1: Okay, they don't have to be journalistic--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --organizations.  Okay, that's not true.  Okay, so--and--all right--
Speaker 2: Wait, 'cause we trying--but, but, you know, for journalists we're just trying to help people give more nuance reporting as I, I, I know I keep saying that.  But, you know, to get people out of the problem boxes or to look at problems.  You know, we spent so much time in this country looking at crack and looking at drugs in urban areas that we're completely missing--somebody pointed this out to me--we're completely missing like the methamphetamine that's going on in the suburbs.  And by missing that, we're also not creating policies that will help people who are struggling with those, with those drugs and that disease.  So, I mean, there, there are important public policies and things that are skewed because of the way we conduct our journalism.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what, what are some of the fault lines that are typical for black journalists?
Speaker 2: You mean what fault line--
Speaker 1: Or what they, you know, what, what are some of their misconceptions about the broader world?  Or is it--
Speaker 2: You mean what, what misconceptions do African American journalists have about the broader world?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) [like you?], yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a really good question.  And from my fault line perspective (chuckle) it's kind of hard for me to--first of all, no one's ever asked me.  And then I realize as a black journalist--
Speaker 1: I know it's easier to answer the other one 'cause I can, I can--
Speaker 2: I know, exactly.
Speaker 1: --I can talk about that part, you know, but, yeah--
Speaker 2: But that's a great question.  That's a great example of how, you know, why Fault Lines is such a effective tool because it forces us to question our own assumptions.  I would tell you that black journalists are better versed than anybody because we're always crossing fault lines.  So that might be the first problem that I've, I've identified.
Speaker 1: We think we know every--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.  Good, good question.  I, I'll be thinking about that for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's never come up?  Nobody--
Speaker 2: No one has ever asked that question.
Speaker 1: Leave it to a contrarian to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a (pause)--and I guess, I mean, the answer would be similar to the answer of what's, what are some of the problems of, of any of us is that we do look at things so much from our, from our point of view and maybe are not as open to challenging that point of view.
Speaker 1: Oh, I think many of us have, you know--it's something like Bakersfield [California], the way you describe it, how the people cramming in to see Oral Roberts and the, the election of George Bush [U.S. President, 2001-2009] twice, you know, it just baffles.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), you know, what, what is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we're probably as guilty of dehumanizing, well, we are as guilty of dehumanizing other people as we are dehumanized.  Yeah, we're absolutely as guilty of that, which to me is surprising 'cause you would think that we would know better than that.
Speaker 1: On the things that are very hard to understand, but now to the easy question:  What are some of the common, you know, fault line problems with the majority press?
Speaker 2: Well, dehumanizing.  But I talked a little about the always seeing people as a problem.  Not, not sort of being logical.  So, you know, asking questions like can black people cover other black people--and never saying, no, can we cover other white people, you know.  And are we sometimes--the coverage of John McCain.  I thought they gave him a big pass at the end of the election because people knew him.  And, oh, he can't be, you know, they didn't look at what, from my perception, was real race-baiting.  It's the same with George [H.W.] Bush [U.S. President, 1989-1993] number one.  Now, [President] George [W.] Bush number two interestingly I don't think engaged in the same race-baiting as his father did.  But, in any case, so not, not asking--they're always looking at can the other person--the other person's the problem and not looking at, you know, what assumptions am I bringing and seeing sort of whiteness as the norm and, and not questioning enough about that, not questioning that prism enough.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, okay, now, now I don't want to jump all over the place, but, so, so, Fault Lines and--is just one of the--
Speaker 2: Is one of our programs.
Speaker 1: --programs--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at the Maynard Institute.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39292
Speaker 1: Yeah, we [Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism] also have--we teach leadership and we have a multi-media editing program.  Our goal is to help, you know, journalists of color not only succeed in the industry, but lead the industry.  'Cause we do--we think you've got to have a multitude of voices at the table when you're making decisions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and crafting and creating the coverage.  You need someone who, you know, people who will say, I don't see it that way.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now what's the Cross-media Program?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's now our Multi-media Editing Program.  It used to be Cross-Media when, you know, very early when we were learning about digital, exploring the digital space, but now that we're pretty sure that everyone's in the digital space, we call it the multi-media editing program.  And it teaches people to--exactly what it, what it says.
Speaker 2: That seems like that--more and more of that seems to be the future for our news--
Speaker 1: Um-hum, absolutely.  I think my father was right.  People will be getting their news--oh well, wait a minute, they are getting their news on computers.
Speaker 2: Now, what do you think about the recent upheavals in the Middle East and the turnovers in government in Tunisia and Egypt and now Libya?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you mean in the use--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of social networking?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, I just think it is absolutely amazing that you--and I, I, you know--and everyone's trying to shut it down but you can't really shut it down.  And people now have this instant way of communicating and mobilizing.  It, it--I mean, people talk a lot about this younger generation is not having a real activism.  And this--it's not that they don't have an activism.  I think what, what's happening at least is showing us that the tools of activism have changed--and may be somewhat more effective as a result.  So, I mean it's just--and it's not just happening there.  I mean, people, you know, in this country are, are using--not with the same dramatic effect obviously.
Story_ID: 39293
Speaker 1: So you see the new media movement as something that's, well, that's a threat to journalism or, or a change in--
Speaker 2: It's a change.  And, and it's here.  And we have to embrace it.  And it gives us opportunities.  I mean, one of the things that we're doing as a result of it is we're training people in poor neighborhoods of color to contribute to their local newspapers.  And they can do that now via not just traditional storytelling, but, you know, they're tweeting and texting.  And also, you know, for some stuff that the local newspaper may think is too raw, you can create websites.  But, but readers who didn't previously have access to information about those communities now have a--we have a way of giving them access.  And hopefully you can also--this, this technology also allows us to have conversations, as opposed to just, you know, the newspaper's going to tell you what, what's there and then maybe you'll write a letter to the editor.  But you can have real, in the comment section, you can have live conversations in real time.
Speaker 1: And have instant news, too, from people who are witnessing things.
Speaker 2: Ab-, yeah, exactly.  Well, Oscar Grant is an incredible example of that and how that, you know, the technology has allowed people more and more insight into what happens.  So when I was in Bakersfield [California] in 1983 the cops pulled over a guy, dragged him out of his car, threw him to the ground, put the guns to his head, all of that.  He was a police commissioner.  And so he went public with what happened.  And people in the newspaper were a little suspicious.  Did it really happen?  You know, does this kind of thing really happen?  They were two black reporters.  And we kept saying yeah, uh-huh, it does.  And as a matter of fact, one of them didn't have a car.  Well, the advent of a bulky camcorder began to open that up with Rodney King.  A guy sitting on his, you know, on his terrace and sees that and then he's got, you know--and he, he was wealthy.  Because to afford a camcorder back then--or he was, I don't know if he was wealthy, but he had some means to buy a camcorder back then.  It was not an everyday item.  And that began the conversation.  Well, with Oscar Grant, cell phones, cell phones, people just--which now are everyday appliances that people have--people just started filming as the police took these young African Americans off of the BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit] train and threw 'em to ground, People just st-, took out their cell phones and started recording it and recorded the cop shooting Oscar Grant face down on the ground in the back and killing him.  And for the first time in Alameda County's history, a law enforcement agent went to jail.  Now he may not have gotten the, the sentence that we think he should have gotten, but he went to jail.  So, yes, the technology has made a huge difference because people be--what, what, what people were able not to see before in 1983 able not to see the police prosecution, persecution of African Americans is now why we recognize as happening because the way the technology has enabled us to capture, record it, and present it to the public.
Story_ID: 39294
Speaker 1: Let me talk about some of your, your writing.  And said? They're kind of scattered around here but, but you've written a number of articles and you've got a book.
Speaker 2: Oh, I did--it's a book of my father's columns that I've--I edited and wrote introduction, introductory essays to every chapter and a prologue.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's--well, we'll talk about that first.  But you have a book, too, 'Mega Media'--isn't that a book?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: That's an article?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  That, that's Nancy's book.
Speaker 1: Oh, Nancy's, oh, okay.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry--it does say that here (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, well.
Speaker 1: We got so many, too many pages, I guess.  But, talk about your father's book.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, he--I had a, a syndicated column and he had a contract to compile his columns into a book.  And before he died he asked me to take over that project for him.  And he would have done a much different book.  I turned it into a memoir.  In, in essence I tried to put, group it thematically and do it in a way that it sort of was much more a memoir of his life.  And by adding the essays, the introductory essays that I wrote to each column, to each chapter, I think that helped sort of create the, the spine of the book in a way.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the book's called, 'Letters to My Children.'
Speaker 2: 'Letters to My Children' 'cause it really--in part it also encapsulated the values and morals that he wanted to leave his children with.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was published in '95 [1995], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And how was the book received?
Speaker 2: It got very good reviews.  It--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about 'Facing the Truth'?  Here's an article you wrote about 150 killings which occurred in a two-year span in a White neighborhood--White people killing each other.  Is this true?  I mean, does that sound familiar (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Huh.
Speaker 1: With all this is an outline, I don't know.  (Laughter)  No, it says here that you wrote about 150 killings which occurred in a two-year span.  They were committed by young middle class white men in predominantly white communities.  And you wrote that the media continues to characterize these killings as anomalies.
Speaker 2: Oh, this was back, this was back, oh, probably twelve years ago.  Do--
Speaker 1: It's '99 [1999], yeah.
Speaker 2: --do you remember when there were a lot of killings where white men would suddenly go into these areas and just start shooting people?  And I wrote that after a guy, a day trader in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia] did that.  And I just--because people kept saying, in a most unlikely place; it couldn't happen here.  It's like, well, this is the only (chuckle) place it's happening.  So, yes, it could happen here.  And that we need to stop--again, you know, it's--we, we con-, we need to get outside of our fault line perception that, you know, in the suburbs and in white communities life is safe and reasonable and predictable and in black neighborhoods and in poor neighborhoods life is reckless, violent, unpredictable, chaotic.  And we need to see that there are commonalities across those, those communities.  You know, I, I wouldn't live in my neighborhood if I thought it was reckless, violent, and, you know, unpredictable.  I'm trying to make a life, not make a point, you know.  So--and, and the fact is that I see people walking down the street in my neighborhood all the time and, you know, who are perfectly safe.  And so that was the point of that column--and yet in, in some of these suburban communities, there is a lot of violence and there is reason, if you knew about it, there would be reason to be fearful.  And so that was the point of that column was to say, you know, we need to stop taking what, we need to get out-, outside of our perception and, and look at things with a little more reality and a little less (unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: It maybe in the sense of--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: --what happened with this, these, these cases where these white males go, go berserk, go postal when under certain--
Speaker 2: No, we don't want to inf--you know, we, we, I--
Speaker 1: Well, we don't want to characterize the post office as--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I mean postmen don't go around as a rule shooting people.
Speaker 1: That's a term they use (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I know people use it, but it's like--
Speaker 1: I understand, but the--I guess what the point--like, well, I don't know what point the media's trying to make, but in a lot of black communities you hear gunfire, you know, every, everyday.  I live in one and you hear it, you know, every now and then.  And you--people tend not to even get that excited about it 'cause you hear it so much--or, you take note of it but you--
Speaker 2: Well, you do take note of it.
Speaker 1: --you don't feel like you're, you're under siege.
Speaker 2: No, I, I personally do not.  And when--because, also, be--and there's part of the problem with the reporting is that--okay, my husband passed away a few years ago making it a lot, lot less likely that I will be a homicide victim.  'Cause most people who are homicide victims, their spouse kills them.  Now, I don't think Charles would have killed me (chuckle), but you know what I'm saying.  I mean, if we, we were to cover it that way--oh my God, somebody just got married.  Their chances of being a homicide victim just went up exponentially.  We don't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39295
Speaker 1: Oh, the Chauncey Bailey Project.  Well, one thing, it speaks to the depth and breadth of the [Maynard] Institute in a, in a very odd way.  Chauncey Bailey was actually one of our graduates.  And Martin Reynolds, who's the editor of the 'Oakland Tribune' and one of the leaders of the Chauncey Bailey Project, is also one of our graduates.  So it was interesting to have one of our graduates reporting on the senseless murder of another one of our graduates.  Chauncey Bailey was, at the time of his, his death, excuse me, was working for the 'Oakland Post' and was working on--well, we didn't know what he was working on.  He was murdered one morning in August [2007], and we suspected it would have something to do with what he was working on.  And so journalists really from across the country, came together, and said we have to do something and we have to, we have to investigate this.  And so it's one of the--locally, journalists from the '[Oakland] Tribune,' other newspapers--not 'The San Francisco Examiner'--they chose not to join our collaboration.  But radio stations, television stations, and then some nonprofits like the Maynard Institute, New American Media, which--and the George Washington Williams Fellowship--we all worked together and created a collaboration where we investigated the murder of Chauncey Bailey.  And I think if this project hadn't--I know if this project hadn't taken place, the people responsible, ultimately responsible for his murder, would have not faced any charges for that murder.  Now they're about to go on trial.  They--the trial starts I think in a couple of weeks.  There's some pretrial hearings that have started already.  And the, the three core journalists was a reporter from (unclear), from the '[Oakland] Tribune', a freelance radio reporter who--he had been working for KCBS and was laid off--who taught himself investigative reporting, and a retired investigative reporter from Santa Rosa [California].  I, I refer to them as the modern day Mod Squad.  You had one black, one white, and one grandmother.  And they broke open the case.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this was, well, he was killed because of the investigation of a Muslim bakery (unclear).
Speaker 1: He was doing an investigation of an organization called Your Black Muslim Bakery, a splinter group from the Nation of Islam, but really, I mean, it's sort of like--comparing the two is like talking about David Koresh, you know, being a part of the Catholic Church.  I mean it really was a splinter group.  And he, yeah, he was doing an inve-, he was investigating them and, and they, you know, Yusuf Bey IV, who's young, immortal, larger, you know, thought he could--bigger than the law--and thought he could do, you know, he thought he could silence Chauncey [Bailey].
Speaker 2: So, they suspect it was a contract murder of Chauncey [Bailey] by (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, one, one of the, one of his disciples in the Your Black Muslim Bakery actually was, you know--confessed to the murder.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is collaborative in--so instead of letting Chauncey Bailey's death--
Speaker 1: Go unnoted.
Speaker 2: Yeah, even though he was--
Speaker 1: Right.  Now--and I, and I have to say that I do believe that it would have because he--and, again, the coverage--because we skew our coverage--so when it comes to African, the African American community, it was, it was not--didn't get the kind of attention that I think if a white reporter working for a white newspaper in a White part of town had gotten shot.  I think that would have been nonstop coverage.  This was sort of like, well, he's a black reporter working for a black paper in Oakland [California], which is perceived to be a black town, huh.
Speaker 2: Well this is important because I, I mean, I know reporters from black papers have been threatened.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I think it's because they know they don't have a powerful organization--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --behind them.  And yet the issues that they're dealing with are so--
Speaker 1: Important.
Speaker 2: --important.
Speaker 1: Well, hopefully, this will stand as a lesson.  I mean, that's what we all said.  If you, you cannot--we must make a point that you cannot silence a journalist and, and that cannot go unnoted.  I mean that's an assault against democracy.
Story_ID: 39296
Speaker 1: Now you had a, sort of a rough time when your mother died in same year that your husband died, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yeah.  That was--my stepmother goes [Nancy Hicks-Maynard], fell ill two months after my husband died, yeah.  And it was a, it was a difficult two years because she, she died two years and three weeks after my husband was first diagnosed with a brain tumor.  And so it was a two years of just sort of nonstop medical emergencies.  You know, people at that time stopped (chuckle), literally stopped saying 'How are you?'
Speaker 1: Yeah, sounds like a rough period of time.
Story_ID: 39297
Speaker 1: So there are many articles cited--well, there's--is there any particular article you want to, or article you've written you want to talk about before--
Speaker 2: They're all brilliant.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah, the latest one we have here is--it's called 'Hours Before'--okay, this, this is the title of it--'Hours Before a Rally to Restore Sanity a Moment Less Than Sane'?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the ti-, that's actually not the last one I wrote.  The last one I wrote was on Gabrielle Giffords, but that's the, that's about when I was in the Hampton Inn in, I guess it was October 31 [2010].  It was the, the day of the Rally to Restore Sanity.  I was in Washington, D.C., attending the Online News Association Conference.  And there was a funder there that I was gonna meet to have breakfast with.  And he was having--he was staying at the Hampton Inn and wanted to, wanted to meet there because he could then go quickly to the airport and also because they had a free breakfast bar.  So, I tend to run late so I actually put in that we were meeting at 8:00 when in fact we were meeting at 8:15.  I got there early and, you know, this was right around--it was a lot of coverage at this time about the Tea Party.  And in the very same way that white people absorb coverage about African Americans and become fearful, I was absorbing the coverage about the Tea Party and what I perceived as being very racist attacks and, and really, really scared about where this was going.  I was, I was beside myself about where this was going.  I was constantly lecturing my thirty-year-old brother about being careful.  And so I--when I got to the Hampton Inn, two things I did immediately:  One is I saw the breakfast bar and I was trying to figure out how I was going to get out of eating it--'cause in the Bay area [California] we're incredibly picky about our food.  You know, you need to know where the cow went to college before you eat it.  And I saw some, out of the corner of my eye, some colors not known in nature.  So that was one thing.  I was like, oh my.  And then the other thing that I was--so I was trying to figure out where to sit so I would see my funder when I, when he got off the elevator.  And so I was looking around and then finally settled in a seat and the guy in front of me--it was an older white guy in front of me and he was wearing an Eracism tee-shirt.  And because I had been so hysterical about what was going on with the Tea Party, I was really, really, really touched to see this in a way that I don't think I would have ordinarily.
Speaker 1: Now that's Lou Gossett's organization.  I don't know whe-, well, that' one that he's--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --he's (unclear).
Speaker 2: I mean, I--but I can, I wasn't doing a re-, and so I just went over to the guy to say, you know, how touched I was to see him wear the shirt and that--.  And so we talked a little bit.  He was there for the Rally to Restore Sanity and we talked about it a little bit.  The conversation ran its course and I turned to go back to my seat and there was a guy standing there who intercepted me and asked if I was a registered guest of the hotel.  And I said no, but I was meeting somebody.  And he just said, ma'am, you'll have to leave the hotel.  And I was like, what?  And he just kept repeating, ma'am, you'll have to leave the lobby.  Ma'am, you'll have to leave the hotel.  And that's all he--and so then I (grew?) angry and I said well then you call my, you call the guest and tell him I can't meet him in the hotel lobby because I'm being escorted out.  And so actually a, the receptionist or whatever, you know at the lobby, I saw her pick up the phone and so she did something to that effect.  And then I--at that point it was like it's clear I'm meeting somebody so like why are, you know, why is he doing this to me?  And he said, ma'am, we have to protect our other guests, so I have to leave the hotel.  And so then I did this thing that usually works, which is, you know, what is your name?  And so he handed me his card and then said, ma'am, you'll have to leave the hotel--and then just threw me out of the hotel.  And I guess we always do what--it's interesting how your background and training kicks in, you know.  So I do what I did, which is, well, I--first thing I did was I wrote to him and said, you know, this is how we met and it's obviously disturbing and the, the work I do is to help people understand acr-, you know, each other across differences.  So, I would like to sit down and talk with you.  And I got no response.  And so I did the other thing I know how to do, which is to write about it.  And so I wrote the column about it.  It's interesting 'cause, you know, I was thinking, well, if I had grown up in a family of lawyers, I probably would have called the, an attorney, and if I had done something else, I--but I know how to write and so that's, that's what I did.
Story_ID: 39298
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--.  Okay.  That--so what--was there any--what was the feedback from that?  Did the hotel make any [overtures] (unclear) to you?
Speaker 2: Well, we're still trying--I'm, I finally, I, I, I tried very hard to reach the hotel and I didn't get any response until a few days after the, the piece.  But by that time I had emailed Charles Ogletree [also a HistoryMaker] to ask his advice and he put me in touch with an attorney.  I did talk to them--I talked to somebody from the hotel and they, they explained how upset the general manager was and how he had wanted to reach out to me personally.  But I said, well, you know, he didn't actually respond to my letter.  And then the guy said he didn't know anything about a letter.  And then he called, he called the general manager and then he called me back and said the general manager never received any letter.  So I gave him the tracking number of the FedEx.  And then they called back to say that while FedEx claimed the letter had been delivered, they hadn't received it.  They claimed it had been delivered, an associate had re-, signed for it, they'd never received it and, you know, I could FedEx it, I could, I could scan it or email it to them.  And I have to say I'm, I was insulted by that because--I mean, further insulted by that because, really, to me the response, look, we will track down the letter and we apologize that we didn't get it--not you can now take up more time of your day and get it to me and then I'll respond.  It was like--so we're working, I'm working through attorneys with that.
Speaker 1: So we're not in post-racial American yet that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, we were never in post-racial America.  Now what's interesting is that the general manager may or may not have been Latino.  I'm not sure what--somebody had said, said that the name suggests that and the general manager said that he was a first-generation immigrant.  And I, I think that that's one of the ways that the use of 'people of color' has distorted, perhaps, other people's images because just because I'm African American, that doesn't give me any more insight or sensitivity into the Chinese or the Latino or any, you know, communities other than my own.  We have a lot of issues amongst ourselves that are--so that's not really a great defense.  I do also think though that in, that this man--I mean, we talk about the effects of media images.  And one of them is that, you know, Joseph Galvin had no other place to put me other than a problem.  So I do hold him personally responsible for his actions and I think that the media images of, of African Americans played a huge role in, in what happened.  He didn't just see a woman getting up to talk to another person.  He saw something else.  Now what he saw, I don't know.
Story_ID: 39299
Speaker 1: Tell us about 'America's Wire'.
Speaker 2: Oh, 'America's Wire'.  So we're very interested in issues of structural racism and structural inequity and to make sure they are covered in a more complete way.  And so we've started our own wire service to examine issues of structural racism.  And it goes out twice a week.  And Associated Press has just become one of our partners and so we're very excited about that.  And we hope that it will help give a broader understanding of, of the structural inequities that still plague this country to this day.
Speaker 1: So, can--
Speaker 2: You can get it online.  And then it'll also be available to newspapers through the Associated Press.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 39300
Speaker 1: We always ask this question:  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I, my hope is that we get better coverage and better coverage will lead to reforms that will help us get better schools, get more e-, more equitable treatment.  I pray we stop the over-incarceration of African Americans, particularly African American men.  I hope that we can begin to see African American men as contributors and not potential predators.  I hope that we can see African Americans in all of our complexity.  And, yeah, I go to these conferences and I look--I was at a conference on Boys and Men of Color in September and there were all these really geeky, nerdy black men there, you know--I mean like just complete policy wonks.  And they looked nerdy and geeky and they were nerdy and geeky.  And I want them to be as much the face of an African American man as Kanye West or, or Willie Horton.  I mean, I want us to be seen as who we are and not just, as I said earlier, as problems.  And I think once that happens, you would see a huge shift in policies if you saw little black children as, as children.  You know, I think we would change our attitudes about schooling and school reform and, you know, rehabilitation versus punitive actions, so--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39301
Speaker 1: Now if you--when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I don't know.  I--well, I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, I, I, I like to look forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think looking backward is, you know, if I could do something differently--but I can't.  So, what, what, what use is that, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a reasonable answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The next question is:
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Looking back, once again (laughter)--
Speaker 2: All right, looking back again, uh-huh?
Speaker 1: Now, what, what today would you consider to be your legacy, though you're still young?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  Oh, actually, by--so my husband and I were one of five people who bought abandoned houses in this West Oakland [California] neighborhood.  And we fixed 'em up and I think it's had a real stabilizing effect on the neighborhood.  And I hope by having people who come to my house who ordinarily wouldn't come to my neighborhood, I hope it's also had an effect of teaching people that it's not the scary place that people think it is.
Story_ID: 39302
Speaker 1: Now, now do you have any children?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you consider your family are your brothers and sisters--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --I guess now.
Speaker 2: And my friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is your mother [Elizabeth Rosen] still alive?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, well, what did your father [Robert Clive Maynard] think of your career when he, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was quite happy.  But because, remember, he died two months after I finished my Nieman Fellowship.  And I think that that was the thing that was most important for him to see.  He, oh, he was so excited--because we were the first father/daughter Niemans.  And so he--and I have our Nieman's diplomas framed--we each had a framed copy of both of 'em and he saw that.  So that was wonderful.  I mean, I think he would've loved to--I mean, I wish he had lived to see my brother and his wife just had a baby.  And that would have been his first grandchild.  And I wish he could have lived to see that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is your--your mother's retired now I'm assuming?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Still living in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Actually, she moved to Woodstock [New York], of all places.  But she loves it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39303
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't discussed that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think you've done a pretty thorough job.
Speaker 1: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 2: No, I really do.  I was like, my goodness.
Speaker 1: All right, well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different:  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would love to be--I hope I'm lucky enough to help people, more people, many more people begin to see each other as people in their complexity and not stock figures.  I mean, that is my driving passion.  And if in some way I can help make that happen, that would mean everything.  It would mean that, you know, all this was--I mean it's always worth it, but if, if--and, and to help journalists really, really depict people as they are and, you know, not, not as they're assumed to be.  And to get--I could go on and on--but I would like to, I would like to be able to pick up a, a newspaper, turn on the television, or go online and see news organizations where people of color are routinely portrayed in everyday life.  I'm doing a project right now where I, I looked at a bunch of websites yesterday and apparently there are no Latino or Asian people--oh no, that's not true--there was a story about Asian peo--a sex slave--saving people from the sex slave--that was illustrated with Asian faces.  Otherwise, Asian people were apparently on vacation in this country yesterday.  Latino people were on vacation in this country yesterday.  And Native American people were on vacation in this country today.  They simply did not participate in any events yesterday.  African Americans and Africans were ravaged with malaria and arm trade and--.  So if I could pick up or, or, or go online that, that, and see that we were, you know, preparing for Saint Patrick's Day parties, all of our totality--that would, that would be what I would like to be remembered for--helping make that happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.
