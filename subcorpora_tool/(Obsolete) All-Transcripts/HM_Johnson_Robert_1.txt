Speaker 1: Today is August 1, 2004.  And we're talking to Mr. Robert Johnson of Johnson Bryce Corporation.  Mr. Johnson, can you give us your full name and spell it please?
Speaker 2: Robert L. Johnson.  And that's J-O-H-N-S-O-N.  Actually by birth, I was named Junior, after my father.  I very seldom use the junior, but that's my full name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell us where we're located?
Speaker 2: We're located in Chicago, Illinois, at 1900 South Michigan.
Speaker 1: And would you tell us your mother's full name and spell it please--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Gladys H. Johnson is her married name, her maiden name was Cherry, C-H-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: And my father was Robert L. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay and today--I'm Adele Hodge, the interviewer for today, and the camera operator is Matthew Hickey.
Story_ID: 192793
Speaker 1: And we're going to ask you, Mr. Johnson, about your mom [Gladys H. Johnson].  What do you remember growing up about your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was a very gentle person, very generous, very loving.  She was very religious, she had deep faith.  And with my brother [Paul Warren Johnson] and I, she was she was the gentle side of the family.  She very concerned about our welfare, very willing to make sacrifices herself to make sure that we were comfortable and had whatever the family could provide.
Speaker 1: What stands out in your memory about your mother for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the attitude that she had toward my brother and I.  She was very hopeful that we would--that we would be able to accomplish in life those things that she aspired for us.  She had a vision that we should--that we should rise above the poverty of, which her definition of poverty would have been broader than just the lack of money, she saw in our community a poverty of spirit.  And I think she was most concerned with helping us to develop the attitudes that would overcome that kind of poverty.  She wanted us to be hopeful, she wanted us to be--she wanted us to have confidence and a view of the world that was larger than what was presented on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Your brother, is he older or younger?
Speaker 2: He's two years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And give us his full name?
Speaker 2: Paul Warren Johnson.
Speaker 1: When and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born not far from here in Saint Luke's Hospital in June 17, 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you remember your mother's birthdate?
Speaker 2: It's January 3, 1905.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your father [Robert L. Johnson]?
Speaker 2: My father's birthday is August, I can't remember the date, 1895, I think.
Speaker 1: Are they also from Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, my father was from Hope, Arkansas, he and [President] Bill Clinton.
Speaker 1: And your mom?
Speaker 2: And my mom was born in Belleville, Illinois.
Story_ID: 192794
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in the Johnson household?
Speaker 2: It was, as I look back at it, it was very interesting, because there was the outside world and there was the inside world.  The inside world was that environment in the home that was created by my parents [Robert L. Johnson and Gladys H. Johnson].  The outside world, and they made that distinction.  Behavior that was--behavior that we saw outside was not to be emulated inside in many cases, not in all cases because there was a--there was a wide mixture of people in that community.  But I was five years old in 1940 when World War II started, and we moved to 49th [Street] and Champlain [Avenue] in Chicago [Illinois] in that year.  World War II brought about significant changes in the community.  The community became much more crowded, a lot of people left various parts of the country, particularly the southern United States and came to Chicago in search of a better life and employment in the industries supporting the war effort.  That created a rather disorganized environment with a lot of (transient?), a lot of people coming in and out.  And the school became overcrowded, we had to go to school in shifts, morning shift, afternoon shift.  But through it all our mother and father were very intent that we should develop a system of values, a confidence of a sense of self-esteem that was not necessarily related to the outside community.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a little story or illustration of how she executed that philosophy and belief?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We were all the time, it was always there.  I would frequently ask to do things, you know, I want to, you know, ride my bike out to the park and--well this was later.  Let me go back to the earlier examples when we were younger, and we would say, well, we want to go down to the school yard and play, and so my mother would say, well who's going and when will you be back, and we would say well, you know, the other kids don't have to--don't have to report when they're coming back, you know, we're going down and we're gonna play and she'd say, well, you're not the other kids, you're not the other kids.  Don't even bring that up, that doesn't make a difference.  And that theme followed throughout the entire time that we were youngsters all the way throughout teenage years that--that what the other kids are doing is not a basis on which, you know, we would make decisions here.  And you will follow the rules that are established in this house.
Story_ID: 192795
Speaker 1: What kind of a child were you growing up?
Speaker 2: Well you would think with all that supervision that I would have been relatively docile and obedient.  I was actually a very mischievous child.  I did not like school, I did not like the restrictions, I used all kinds of methods to get around and do the things that I wanted to do.  I was not at all intimidated, and I thought that--I always thought that there had to be a way by which I could work my will.
Speaker 1: And how did that work out with your sibling [Paul Warren Johnson]?
Speaker 2: He was much different, so.  He thought that I was--he thought that I took a lot of unnecessary risk and that I really should be--I should be much more of a conformist.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Gladys H. Johnson] work outside the home?
Speaker 2: No.  She worked in the home.  She was a seamstress and dressmaker and she did that for, you know, for individuals.  She altered and made clothing, but never outside the home.
Story_ID: 192796
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [Robert L. Johnson], what do you remember most about him?
Speaker 2: He was very harsh.  He was very harsh and he was very--he was not really to be tampered with.  He was stern.  He worked hard, he was--but he and my mother [Gladys H. Johnson] had in common this disdain for the unruly elements in our community, they were together on that.  He was not as committed to religious idealism as she was.  They didn't really have--they didn't have outward conflicts, but as a kid, I could sense that there were, you know, philosophical differences, but in the sanctity of the home.  And the difference between home and outside, they were together on that.
Speaker 1: What did your dad [Robert L. Johnson] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a postal employee.  He worked for the post office for maybe forty years, he retired from there.
Speaker 1: Do you have any favorite stories of you and your dad and interaction between the two of you?
Speaker 2: There was actually a lot of conflict between me and my father.  He was very controlling and I was very independent.  So we had, yeah, we had a lot of opportunities to--he had a lot of opportunities to assert more forcefully his authority and his--he thought what he was doing for us was the best thing.  As I look back now I can see.  And after having reared two children of my own, I can see the--what he was attempting to accomplish and what he thought the dangers were, what he was attempting to protect us from, he was protecting us from--protect us from a system of values that, I guess today would be called the street values.  And in a community that was undergoing a kind of transition of many South Side communities during World War II there was a lot to be concerned about.  I mean there were a great--it was not a community in the sense of you know being somewhat homogeneous people who lived together, people who shared you know, a sense of values.  It had been that, I understand, as I talked to people who knew that community before the war started, but it was very much in transition during the period from 1940 till '40 [1940] to 1950.
Speaker 1: So you stayed around 49th and Champlain most of your growing up years?  How long did you stay in that community?
Speaker 2: Until 1958.  Yeah, I was in college when my parents moved from that community to 78th and Vernon.
Story_ID: 192797
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you what were some of the sights, sounds and smells of growing up that stick out for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, for one thing, during World War II [WW2] my father [Robert L. Johnson] rented rooms in the--we had the entire apartment.  Many apartments had been cut up by the landlords.  Our apartment had not been.  And there was rent control as we were paying, I think, fifty dollars a month or something like that.  And he was renting rooms for ten dollars a week.  He rented out the three bedrooms in the apartment and everybody had, you know, part of the refrigerator and part of the you know and a turn in the bathroom and all that which created a situation of you know constant dynamics with this because still there was the intense effort to have for us a home that reflected the values of my parents.  So he was very selective of you know what people were--rented rooms.  He brought many of his relatives from Arkansas.  I can think of God maybe as many as a half dozen people that left Arkansas, relatives of his that came into our home and rented a room.  He helped them find a job, helped them negotiate the public transportation and then when they became--when they got on their feet, you know, he insisted that they move and make room for somebody else.
Story_ID: 192798
Speaker 1: So that dynamic of having this constant flow of new housemates, whatever, is the sights and sounds of growing up, that dynamic, do you have anything that you want to share?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Well, it exposed you to a lot of people, exposed you to a lot of different people, and even at a young age, you began to sense that there were significant differences in people, and people's attitudes, the way they behaved toward each other, what they thought of the war, what they thought of the opportunities.  There was a constant discussion in the house of how we as Negros at that time, how we as Negros would take advantage of the opportunities that were afforded us as a result of this war because jobs were plentiful and jobs that black people had been denied were grudgingly given to them because of the shortage of labor.  Now, you could save that money, and this is a discussion that would go on, you could save that money, you could invest it, you could, you could use it for positive purposes or you could have a good time with it and drink it up and just you know play with it.  And that was a--that was big discussion, you know, who was smart about their money.  Now my father's socking all this money away cause he was renting rooms and you know at the end of--at the end of World War II, he had from various sources and I don't know all of them because I was--this happened between the time I was five to ten years old, but at the end of World War II he had saved four thousand dollars and with that he bought him-he bought an apartment building.  So he was on the side of you know take advantage of these opportunities to advance yourself.  And he was very critical of people who didn't see that opportunity and didn't see a relationship between opportunities made possible by the war and how you would advance yourself.
Story_ID: 192799
Speaker 1: Let's go back to when you were five and about to go to school, what, or if you started school at five or five or six--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Would you tell us your elementary school and tell me if you remember what it was like your first day at school?
Speaker 2: Actually I do.  It was Willard Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois].  It was on the same block where we lived.  My mother took me.  It was kindergarten, there were a lot of kids there and I didn't know any of them.  We sat on the floor in a circle, a big circle painted on the floor and everybody sat down.  Everybody was supposed to have brought a blanket and some kids had blankets, some kids didn't.  Teacher had newspaper for the kids who didn't have blankets.  And then we played with clay and the teacher seemed very nice.
Speaker 1: Were your elementary school years challenging or eventful, uneventful?
Speaker 2: They were challenging-they were challenging because for some reason, and I couldn't really conjure it up, it would probably take deeper analysis than we're gonna do here to--to get to the point.  For some reason I was resentful, and I did not--I did not put forth my best effort except under very special circumstances.  If we were gonna take a test to see whether you're ready to go to the next grade or take a test to determine what track you would be on, I would try very hard on the test.  And it wasn't that I wasn't learning, I was learning.  I always read above level.  I always read a home, I had plenty of books.  It was the conformity that I resented.  So I may not respond very well to a teacher's assignment or even a teacher's admonishment regarding behavior.  I would try to find a way to get around that.  And I was not--I remember being critical of the people we called the teacher's pets, and I still I don't understand why or from where I got these attitudes that school was not to be enjoyed.  But it followed me throughout my education.
Story_ID: 192800
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite elementary school teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I did, but they were very few.
Speaker 1: Tell us about one or two of them?
Speaker 2: Miss Harrison was my sixth grade teacher, seventh grade teacher, must have been my fifth grade teacher.  And she was-she was very strict, but she was also very nice, and she would call me up to the--she'd call me up and then she'd talk to me, you know, quietly.  And she would ask me you know why I hadn't done the assignment, and I would give her some, you know, some excuse and she'd say well you know that that's not really the reason that you didn't do it.  And so I'm asking you is why, you know, what's the real reason why you didn't do it?  And I thought that was very insightful of her to realize that we were--that I wasn't really being truthful about the reason.  She recognized that there was something there and she tried to get at it, but she really wasn't able.  My eighth grade teacher, however, she took me out--I remember several times, she took me out in the hall and told me that--that I was going to make things very difficult for myself if I carry the attitudes that I had at this point into high school, and that in high school it was going to really make a difference whether I applied myself and worked.  And you know I kind of accepted that.  It didn't do the job but you know it didn't--there was no real change in behavior when I got to high school until later, but I did appreciate her message and what she was--what she was saying.
Speaker 1: So Miss Harrison in the fifth grade and the other name, the other teacher?
Speaker 2: Miss Calvert.
Speaker 1: Miss Calvert.  And you were on your way into middle and high school, so you started to make a connection that maybe I should be listening to what these teachers are telling me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I began--yes, I did, and I acknowledged that they were probably right.  It wasn't until later in high school that I got the message.  I have my report cards.  I've showed them to my children and they are amazed cause my grades were so bad, you know, I just got--I got bad grade except in reading.
Speaker 1: So in looking back, having shown your report cards to your children, what was your level--grading level in elementary school, A-B?
Speaker 2: No.  I think we got G's for good, E for excellent, N for a failing grade.  I think--I can't remember.
Speaker 1: So you were-but you constantly were in the middle of the grading?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just about average.
Speaker 1: But you had the capacity to be at the top, but you functioned in the middle.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 192801
Speaker 1: The challenge in elementary school [at Willard Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was the conflict you had with really showing your real talent, your intellectual talent, you wanted to show a little bit of it, now you're going into high school and the teachers have made you aware that you have to change your ways.  What challenged you in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, while I had the--had the influence of Miss Calvert [sic], when I got to high school, I found it somewhat intimidating.  I went to DuSable High School [later DuSable Leadership Academy, Chicago, Illinois], large school.  It was a large school and it had--it was interesting in that it had such a rich variety of kids because it had some kids that were not at all interested in school, they were only fulfilling the obligation of staying there until they could quit.  And then it had many students who were very conscientious, and in the main, the faculty was very supportive of the conscientious kids.  They would do what they could for the kids that were not that interested in education.  They were not indifferent to them, they just felt that their efforts were probably better spent dealing with those kids that were interested, interested or at least conforming.  Now in the first two years of high school, I kind of sided with the indifferent kids, and I did very low.  You know I would listen in class and I would read the books you know in the library, I very seldom take books home.  It just wasn't making a mark on me yet.  And I've explained I don't know why.  But I met a teacher in my junior year, I started taking civics in my junior year.  Her name, she's well known in Chicago [Illinois], her name is Mary Herrick.  And if you've interviewed [HistoryMaker] Dempsey Travis or Mayor Harold Washington and many, many others, they will mention the impact that Mary Herrick had on their lives.  And one day I was in class and I was listening and a teacher was asking questions and I knew the answers to all the questions that she was asking.  It was, you know, it was stuff like, you know, what kind of city government does the City of Chicago have and you know how many alderman are there and you know and pretty soon I just got impatient, I raised my hand and told her what all the answers were.  So she asked me to stay after class.
Story_ID: 192802
Speaker 1: And she said you know you could be a great help to me.  She said we have various levels of interest in the class.  This is a required course that everyone has to take.  We have various levels of ability in the class and you could help me if you would--you would keep the class from getting stalled she said, like you did today.  Now, what I'd like you to do is when I'm not getting any response she said I'm gonna go to you, and you'll help me out with an answer.  If you don't know the answer then give me something--something to work on, she said because she said I know that you're bored in the class and I know that you have a lot more understanding than many of the students.  She said but if we work together you know it can help both of us.  I said, wow, that was really something, I couldn't believe it.  So actually she had given me a rationale for preparing for the classes, for studying.  So I started taking my civics book home.  And she was so appreciative and you know and it wasn't that the work wasn't really that hard cause I was an excellent reader and by that time I was also working in the Chicago Public Library and I was probably reading you know a book a week and I was exposed to so many books on so many subjects and I had a lot of time to read at work.  So I started working with her and it was so easy and it was so good that I began to say well why haven't you been doing this all the time.  So I said well why don't you try this in biology, and I did.  And I started, you know, I started reading my biology textbook and my science text book.  And then I met another instructor and I can't think of his name right now, hope he never sees this tape because I see him every now and then.  He was teaching World History and he gave me a similar kind of pep talk.  He said you know, you know all this, he said I only want you to answer the questions you know that I ask you, he said cause we don't want you to answer every question.  I was very fascinated with World History.  We were studying about the Abyssinians and you know ancient Babylon and that was really some interesting stuff.  So I started studying that, and pretty soon I was studying everything.  And I went from a G minus average, and I remember the courses where F was fair, I don't know what failing--D was failing, F was fair, G was good, E was excellent, S was superior.  So I was doing about a G minus, a lot of Fs and a few Gs for my first two years of high school.  And my second two years I got all Es with maybe a few Gs, I probably had a E minus, maybe a E minus average, but a lot of Ss in courses like speech, I just loved to speak.  So I understand a little bit of these dynamics because when the teachers that sort of appreciated me you know, encouraged me to show what I could do, and I responded to that.
Story_ID: 192803
Speaker 1: Tell us a little more about Miss [Mary] Herrick and would you spell her name for us?
Speaker 2: H-E-R-R-I-C-K, I think.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.
Speaker 2: Mary Herrick.
Speaker 1: What else do you remember about her?
Speaker 2: She was white and yet she had as much interest in the students at DuSable High School [later DuSable Leadership Academy, Chicago, Illinois] of any teacher.  She taught a course that was not particularly popular, civics, but she made it very, very interesting.  She related it to politics in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  I remember her saying once that, that corruption was very bad, but that corrupt governments were very efficient, that corrupt governments had decision-makers, and decision-makers could get things done.  That's something I always remembered 'cause I've seen many, many examples over the years of that.  Even the City of Chicago today is an example of it in my opinion.
Speaker 1: That's very interesting.  Did you go back later and have any conversations exchanged with Miss Herrick?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I did.  And I can remember in my yearbook, she wrote something to the effect that if you--it will be a great loss to everyone if you do not become a spoke in your community--a major spoke in your community, or something like that, which I thought was very--very encouraging.
Story_ID: 192804
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go on to your college years, was there anything between elementary [at Willard Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and high school [at DuSable High School later DuSable Leadership Academy, Chicago, Illinois], anything outstanding in your life whether good or bad, did you have any tragedies in your life that marked your early years?
Speaker 2: No.  I really didn't.  You know my parents [Robert L. Johnson and Gladys H. Johnson] remain in good health.  It was a happy childhood in many, many respects.  We were poor but we felt--we were poor but we were not a poor community, so there's no differential.  I mean you don't really sense, I mean everybody's corduroy pants had been let out four times, I mean everybody had to put tape on their shoes to keep the soles from flapping.  Everybody had a old bicycle and old roller skates.  As I look back--as I look back now, it was enjoyable.
Speaker 1: Actually, your dad [Robert L. Johnson] had a very good job working at the post office.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was an excellent job at that time.  I remember the discussions where they were paying much more in the defense plant [Dodge Chicago Plant] than he was making at the post office and he and my mother [Gladys H. Johnson] would have these discussions about you know whether he should leave the post office and go take advantage of the high salaries being paid on some of those jobs, and they decided that in the long run, the post office would be better.
Speaker 1: Was he a clerk or letter carrier?
Speaker 2: He was a mail handler.  He was a laborer in the post office until he became a watchman, and he joined, I guess, the security force much later in his career.
Speaker 1: What would you identify from birth through high school as the most joyful experience for you?
Speaker 2: There are a few.  I can't think of anything that was--that was absolutely you know so outstanding above all other experiences.  There were a few--we used to--my grandmother lived in St. Louis, Missouri.  And we used to go to St. Louis [Missouri], my brother [Paul Warren Johnson] and I, would go to St. Louis during the summer.  And even though she lived in the city, you know, she had chickens and it was still kind of rural, and we really enjoyed that, really enjoyed that.  I can remember also the experiences that were like walking in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] with my parents.  That was always you know quite a highlight.  When we got a car, it was an old car, we got it in 1949, yeah, 1949, we got a 1940 car and that was great.  We all learned to drive.  It was not a bad childhood, it was, you know, it was quite supportive and it had a lot of happy hours.  I used to always have this problem about you know what I should do, what--it was always sort of a separateness there, it was a very strong self-identity that said yeah, that's the situation, but what should my situation be, what should I be doing, that's what's expected, but you got to make an individual decision.
Story_ID: 192805
Speaker 1: Did that strong individuality give you a problem when you got to college?
Speaker 2: No.  I had an interesting experience.  I had decided by then that one needed to work and one needed to learn and that it wasn't that hard.
Speaker 1: What was your major and how did you decide, did you decide as you left high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I told my--I remember sitting down with a counselor, the high school counselor, and saying that you know, I was interesting in engineering.  And she told me that you know that black kids did not become engineers and that I should concentrate on something that I could get a job in.  So I should probably you know plan to be a social worker, something like that, which was a little bit confusing and somewhat, you know, discouraging 'cause I liked--I liked science and I thought that I would, you know, done well at that.  So when I got to college I remember sitting down with my college counselor, I went to [Theodore] Herzl Junior College [later Malcolm X College] on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And while there was a junior college on the South Side, Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College], I decided to go to Herzl because I had so many friends that were going to Wilson [Junior College], and I decided that it was time for me to take a separate tact and that if I was really gonna apply myself that I should--I should probably be a lot more independent in my selection and not follow the herd which was you know going to Wilson.  I remember that being my thinking as I think back at it, I think I probably traveled a lot of miles you know for nothing but I don't know whether that was a real advantage, but it could have been.  When I started college, I had a counselor and he sat down with me and he looked at my high school transcript which was G minus for the first two years and E minus you know for the second two years, which averaged out not very good.  And so he told me, I was working at the time, I was working for Chicago Public Library, he told me if you take a very light course, no more than nine hours and if you quit your job and if you work very hard, you might be able to make some progress in college.  And, of course, I was very insulted.  So I kept my job, took a fulltime program, fifteen hours, and made the Dean's list every semester until I got my associates degree, partially out of resentment, I guess.  He really gave me something to shoot for.  I was surprised that he had so little confidence in my ability.  But when you really look at it, the ability didn't show in the performance, so you know, he probably, I mean, pretty sound logic.  He didn't talk to me very much, we didn't, you know, we didn't discuss it.  He just looked at what I had done and told me what he thought.
Speaker 1: Did you see him anymore?
Speaker 2: Yes, I took a course from him.  My major was pre-law and I took a course from him, business mathematics and also introduction to business and I got As in both courses.
Speaker 1: Did he ever mention his recommendation?
Speaker 2: No.  No, he never did.  He never brought it up again and you know I always thought he was kind of uptight.
Story_ID: 192806
Speaker 1: When you left [Theodore] Herzl [Junior College, later, Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to the University of Illinois in Urbana [Champaign, Illinois].  And that was not a good experience.  I really--I really didn't like that.  It was the first time I had been put into a situation where the differential between rich and poor was so apparent, and I was very sensitive to it.  Now I had gone to a--I'd gone to a all-black relatively poor grade school and high school.  And Herzl Junior College was, I don't know the exact percentage, but it was largely Jewish and quite a representation of African Americans.  And you know everybody was working part-time or full time and so there wasn't that much of a school spirit, I mean, we didn't, you know, I don't recall ever going to a basketball game or anything like that you know.  So I was pretty much like everybody else.  When I got to the University of Illinois at Urbana, some people were living in big palatial frat [fraternity] houses with you know columns out front and verandas or they're sitting there with their, you know, with their jackets with their fraternity emblem on.  And a lot of my friends were working in the kitchens of you know those frat houses on meal jobs and you--there was quite a variety of students, but most of them were significantly better off than I was.
Story_ID: 192807
Speaker 1: What year was it when you entered UIC [sic, UIUC, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: '49 [1949], '51 [1951], '50 [1950], '53 [1953], no '53 [1953], '50 [1950] I graduated from high school '53 [1953], four, '55 [1955], '55 [1955], and I didn't like it there.  I had been working for the public library for two years, no four years, last two years of high school, first two years when I was in junior college, worked for the public library.  Went to the University library system and applied for a job, they gave me a job.  In the group that was being hired, I was the only person who had a working library experience.  I mean I knew the Dewey Decimal System, I knew the catalog card system, I had made catalog cards, I had circulated books, I had maintained library records and they put me in a--they gave me a job in a third level below the street level, down in what they called the stacks and gave me Saturdays and Sundays and it was just, it was the, you know, couldn't go to football games, couldn't you know, I mean, work on the weekends and it was obvious you know that it was racially motivated, at least that was my interpretation.
Speaker 1: And you were of course becoming more aware of being African American within that social context.  Like you said now you start to see some big differences.  How were you affected by that and by what was happening in society generally in '55 [1955], '56 [1956], '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: I became aware of the enormity of the problem.  I had been--my father talked about it all the time.  He was quite an activist.  I mean, he was always--you know on our walks out to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], he would always go over to, what they call Bughouse Square over on Washington Park near what was South Park, and there would be radicals and politicians and people given speeches on stumps.  He was very, very conscious of the race thing.  Now--so I was very aware of it.  But until I got out and really saw what the impact was, I didn't know what an enormous problem it was.  It became--for some reason it just became apparent to me like all the sudden.
Story_ID: 192808
Speaker 1: So your time at UIC [sic, UIUC, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] that's when, socially, it was a very active, it was starting to be the tail-end of the [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower years, going forward from there a lot of things happened socially.  And now this is your personal experience with discrimination.  You were going to let us see your view point on your responses to that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's--it's the point at which I am you know forming an opinion, not only am I acknowledging the--acknowledging the enormity of the racial situation.  And I guess then I look back at my life and I said, well, while everything that happened to me has been influenced by this color situation, I mean, the neighborhood that I was living in, the school I went to, the high school I went to, everything.  So then, and I'm also beginning to think, okay what--what should be my response to this, you know, what can you do.  Because my parents [Robert L. Johnson and Gladys H. Johnson], the consensus was, there were many points of view discussed in the house cause all this in and out of the house, I mean there are a lot of people with a lot of different points of view, so I'm hearing, you know, I'm hearing a lot.  There's the attitude that well what you need to do is prepare yourself, work hard, prepare yourself, nobody can stop you.  Our real problem is lack of preparedness, our real problem is behavior, our real problem is attitudinal, as if the problem emanates from us.  But them I'm getting some evidence that that's not true.  I was certainly prepared for a job at the library, I certainly prepared to work at the desk, I could have worked in research, you know, I could help people find books, I mean, what am I doing down here on the third level of the stacks getting book request sent down through an air tube you know where I'm crawling around finding these old dusty volumes and putting them on a lift.  I mean I could spend a day without seeing daylight.  Now that--and that's not fair, and that certainly conflicts with, you know, "prepare yourself."  How prepared do I have to be, how prepared do I have to be to get beyond this situation, what kind of preparation is it gonna take for me to not be victimized by racial attitudes, and they actually have nothing to do with my preparedness, these are fixed attitudes.  And I'm running into more and more people on the faculty at the university and then the student body at the university that are exhibiting hostile attitudes that have nothing to do with me, so how does that--how does that jive with prepare yourself, which is the attitude that my mother had suggested and my father reluctantly accepted because he really didn't have the alternative.  The alternative at that time was to scream and holler and to make people aware of what was happening to them, but that was not productive in terms of how you would get around it.
Story_ID: 192809
Speaker 1: So what did you decide to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think that I really made a--I didn't make one of those deep philosophical decisions that would say you should--you should organize your life you know in a certain manner or that you should develop certain goals in response to this.  I was kind of taken it all in and I said, "This has gotta be a factor, this has gotta be a factor in any of your future decision-making.  You cannot ignore this, this has gotta be a factor.  You gotta prepare yourself, but you also have to expect that that won't be enough."  So you've got to--you've got to have a strategy that helps you get around or over these kind of obstacles because they're gonna be there.  So I left the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois], I wasn't doing that well academically anyway, I was mad most of the time (laughs).  I was not adjusting--I was not adjusting to the environment.  I mean, I'd done very well in my first two years in college, my third year you know I was not doing that well, and I hated it.  I lived in the dormitories one semester and then I moved out to a rooming house out in town.  I mean you know the racism was institutional at [University of] Illinois [Urbana Champaign, Illinois].  Approved university housing, approved housing, as you go to the housing office and they tell you, okay, these are the addresses that are approved by the university.  They have been inspected you know they meet the university's requirements, did not have to accept black people.  I mean you could have rooms that were on the approved list that could still discriminate.  That was the personal preference of the landlord.  And you know I'm taking all this in, I mean, this is, yeah, I mean, this is not fair, this has nothing to do with preparing yourself, this is--and the university is a part of it.  So I decided to leave the University of Illinois.
Speaker 1: You only stayed there one year?
Speaker 2: Stayed there one year.
Story_ID: 192810
Speaker 1: And then you went to--
Speaker 2: Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], which was much more to my liking.  And I've--I enjoyed my time there, I remain associated with the university, subsequently became a member of the Board of Trustees at the university.  The ideals of the university were an environment in which the very subjects that I was thinking about were fermenting in that environment that was in 1956, and I was, no it was 1957.  I was there in 1957.  I graduated in 1958 from Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].  The other thing is at the university [of Illinois at Urbana Champaign], I mean, I'm down in the--third level down in the stacks, you know, working for ninety cents an hour, and I could make a lot more money, you know, in Chicago.  If I gotta work I could live at home and make more money, so it was a better deal financially.  And I think all colleges--there should be a match between the college and the individual.
Speaker 1: What were your extracurricular activities during your, let's say, your Roosevelt years?
Speaker 2: None.  I was--I didn't have any extracurricular activities at Roosevelt.  It was not, you know, I mean I spent a lot of time in the lobby debating other students, arguing about things, but I spent a lot of time working.  I was working not quite full time, but like thirty hours a week.
Story_ID: 192811
Speaker 1: Who impressed you the most of your college years, the last two years of college, who of your professors had the most effect on you and your thinking?
Speaker 2: St. Clair Drake, the anthropologist.  I took everything I could that he taught.  He was an amazing guy.  Recently he had written 'Black Metropolis.'  You know this is, I mean it's right down my alley, this is you know, I had lived 'Black Metropolis,' I mean.  And he was allowing me to read his book and think about my own experiences and explain them in an academic context.  He was very influential.  I had decided to--I decided to get a degree in sociology.  There were two or three reasons: one, I just loved the courses, I loved the courses, I knew that I could work in that field. I had become impressed that my high school counselor who said you know there weren't any black engineers you know was probably right, cause there weren't.  It doesn't mean I shouldn't have studied engineering I guess, but as a practical consideration you know she had been correct.  I liked sociology and psychology and the behavioral sciences, I liked the academic representation at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] and I had started working summers as a camp counselor and when I came back to the--from the University of Illinois [Urbana Champaign, Illinois], I got a job at the Southside Boys Club on 39th and Michigan [later the Elliott Donnelley Youth Center in Bronzeville, Chicago, Illinois], which was subsequently taken over by a Young Men's Jewish Council and formed into a group of community centers.
Story_ID: 192812
Speaker 1: Your interest in sociology really jelled with the times, late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], things were cooking then.  How did you make that a part of what you were about at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--I was attempting to you know develop sort of a cohesive attitude about this whole situation and me.
Speaker 1: Was there anything specific that helped you developed that attitude?
Speaker 2: Well, I met some very interesting people.  I took a job, after working at the community center for maybe a year, I took a job with the Institute for Juvenile Research, which is a part of the University of Illinois [UIC] [Chicago, Illinois].  And I met people that were actually doing research in community life.  And I worked for a year as a youth counselor with the Institute for Juvenile Research and conducted interviews and established relationships with youth in the neighborhood, in the same neighborhood where I had worked in the community center.  And I thought that this was, you know, I wasn't absolutely certain that is what I--what I wanted to do with it, but it was a path that was satisfying, it was a path that was possible, and I knew at some point I would have to work and there was something that I could do, it would get me out of poverty.
Story_ID: 192813
Speaker 1: How did you make the transition from sociology to business.  I mean you certainly had a grounding in business with the courses you mentioned, but how did you make that transition?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to the [U.S.] Army after I finished Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].  Yeah, one of the reasons I got a degree in sociology was that my time was running out.  This was during the time of the draft and I had used up all of my deferrals.  So I had to get a degree in something so I went to the counseling office and we counted up all of the hours that I had.  I had enough hours--I had enough hours to graduate, enough college credits to graduate.  And so we counted well what can you get a degree in and I could get a degree in sociology, I only had to take another six hours of advanced sociology courses.  So I did that.  So my last semester I only took six hours and worked for the Institute for Juvenile Research.
Speaker 1: So when you came back out of--when you came out of service, that's when you went into the business world?
Speaker 2: Well, when I left the--I graduated from Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], I went to the service, spent two years--
Speaker 1: Which branch?
Speaker 2: --At Fort Leonard Wood [Missouri] in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: [U.S] Army, and which years were those?
Speaker 2: That was 1958 to 1960.  Nothing really happened there to change my attitude, you know, I met a lot of people from different places.  This is my first time being in the South.  Everything that I was learning was leading toward this being a bigger and bigger problem, racial problem as being a bigger and bigger problem.  And by that time I pretty well, you know.  It verifies my earlier conclusion that anything you're going to do just has to be, you have to develop a strategy for getting around the racial element of it.  And that I guess that's when I concluded something I still believed that racism is woven into the fabric of the United States, that it is not imprinted upon, it is woven into, so it's gonna be there.  You'd have to unweave the cloth to get it out.  It's a part--it's a part of America and I think I formed that opinion during that period.  And since then I've always challenged myself to look for evidence that that's not true.
Story_ID: 192814
Speaker 1: When you started work, what was your first job in the world of business?
Speaker 2: When I came out of the [U.S.] Army I started working for the Chicago Housing Authority as a community attendant relations aid, which is sort of a advocate for the tenants to help them with problems and try to make good the promise of public housing which is that if--the theory of public housing is that if families are relieved of the intense pressure of finding adequate housing that their other problems can be dealt with more easily.  That was the sociological or philosophical foundation for public housing investment by the government.  So the community attendant relations aid position was to assist families in bettering themselves, solving their problems, you know, finding jobs, keeping the kids out of trouble, you know, counseling financial discipline and all that kind of thing and developing community organizations.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay in that position?
Speaker 2: Say from 1960 to 1965.  But the transition to business occurred while I was at Chicago Housing Authority because after two years as a community and tenant relations aid I got an opportunity to go into the management training program.
Story_ID: 192815
Speaker 1: And for the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority]?
Speaker 2: For the CHA, and I became, subsequently, I became assistant housing manager.  And as assistant housing manager, you begin to deal with the actual management of these developments, the rent collection as revenue and the management of the properties as the expenditures.
Speaker 1: So you had an opportunity to tie what you had been doing as an advocate to what you were doing as a manager?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that work, what did you do with that combination?
Speaker 2: Well, I discovered you know, I discovered the world of business and I discovered the--that your situation, my situation and the situation of the tenants in public housing was economic.  I mean you got serious--you got many problems, but poverty is one of them, and I began to really understand how--how poverty works on the limitation that it imposes on the individual's ability to even think about doing something.  I mean I came in contact with many, many poor people in public housing and I heard many expressions of the hopelessness that comes with that.  And I said well okay you've got the racism factor, you've got the poverty factor and the individual develops a attitude factor.  So now you've got a three-part dynamic here.  I became convinced that I wasn't gonna be able to do very much as a counselor, that that you know counseling, tell people what they should do, what they should think and in many cases they were thinking the only thing they could think, and they were rearing their kids to think the same thing.  So you might feel good you know after going home, after counseling people all day, it might have done you some good, but it really hadn't done much for them because they were still poor and discriminated against.
Speaker 1: And which housing complex was this?
Speaker 2: Henry Horner Homes, Ida B. Wells [Homes] and the what was called the ABLA [Jane Addams Homes; Robert Brooks Homes; Loomis Courts; and Grace Abbott Homes] Complex on the West Side and Cabrini-Green [Homes], I worked at all of them--those four.
Story_ID: 192816
Speaker 1: So when you left the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority], were you on burnout in a sense seeing that--
Speaker 2: No, when I left CHA, I was very hopeful.  What I had done is I had picked up a considerable interest in money, making money and the management of money.  You know because CHA was really a business.  Yeah, it had this aside, we deal with poor people and we try to make poor people's lives better, but we're really about rent, maintenance, improvement, construction, management of our assets, management of huge teams of people, I mean, that's what--I mean that's what the structure was really there for.  I mean that's what it did.  So then I started thinking, well if that's important, and if that's important to you and I was fascinated with it, I was fascinated with the budgeting and the sticking to a budget, the anticipation, the projecting yourself into the kinds of situations that a manager really faces, I thought that was--I thought that was pretty cool stuff.  And then it occurred to me well if you're, you know, if you're really gonna do that at CHA, where do you want to do that.
Speaker 1: So then you got your sea legs, so to speak, in business managing the business side of the CHA operation, and you married that with your sociological understanding of dealing with human nature and the conditions in which they function.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now when you left you went to your next position--
Story_ID: 192817
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When they built the very large developments, when they blanketed State Street [Chicago, Illinois] with these huge, huge developments that were designed in a manner that was contrary to everything that we had learned about how families prosper.  So when you build fifteen-story buildings and you fill them with forty percent four and five bedroom apartments, you obviously building them for kids, families with kids.  But you're building a structure--there was no on--you could not attempt to manage that even if you were talking about rich and middle class families, it wouldn't be manageable.  With poor families and broken families and multi-problem families, it was impossible.  And that was known--that was known when those large developments were built.
Speaker 2: But, I guess also, since you say CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] is about business, it strikes me that perhaps it was more about getting the government contract to build and then getting the contract to manage structurally rather than--
Speaker 1: The way CHA was finance--CHA was financed at the time was you could get government subsidy by the number of units you were building and you can get more units by building up, using the cube, so to speak, than you can building row houses or even single-family units.  So CHA was all about units--was all about units.  Now the excuse was we got all these people that need housing, but the construction cost was not as high as the government allocation, so you could have built, but it was more profitable--that is you're going to get the government allocation anyway.  So if they're saying you get $15,000 a unit, if you can build for $9,000 a unit then you can put $6,000 a unit in your fund.
Story_ID: 192818
Speaker 1: Okay so you left CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] in 1965 and you were going on to what?
Speaker 2: I went to Sears Roebuck [& Company] and I applied for a job--this is also coincident, this is 1965.  When I got out of the [U.S.] Army I had applied with a lot of other fellow soldiers for various jobs and even some jobs with private firms as you know management trainees, got no takers.  This is 1960, I'm sorry it was 1960 when I got out of the [U.S.] Army, no takers.  By 1965, the Civil Rights Movement had impressed the nation with the need to be more diverse in providing opportunities for black people.  It was a conscious movement, I mean, raising of the conscious of the country and it was also a forceful movement that said, you know, things will never be like they were, we will not be satisfied with this.  So in 1965 almost all major corporations opened their management trainee positions to African American, primarily African American males.  Well this was just about the time I'm ready to leave CHA, and while I could have had a good career if I had stayed there, I decided to take the risk and go with Sears [Roebuck & Company].  I applied with several other companies, a couple of insurance companies.  See I mean everybody--it's quite an opportunity for African American college graduates who had been held into government positions.  Everybody that you went to school got a job with the [U.S] Social Security Administration or the [U.S] Treasury Department or the [U.S.] Labor Department or the Chicago Housing Authority or you know, I mean, that's where the black middle class worked.  So in 1965 just like, you know, the lid was taken off and the company said that you know we're going to be more inclusive.  When I went to Sears during my interview, I had an opportunity to discuss at length this problem with the person who was interviewing me and I asked him well how many black executive trainees do you have and they said that they had two and that I would be the third.  And so I asked them if this was the result of a policy of discrimination, and he said--(laughs) he said no, it was oversight (laughs), which was kind of funny.  But I went to Sears and my experience with CHA as a--not as a community attendant relations aid, but as an assistant housing manager was what impressed them.  So then they gave us a lot of tests and you know you had to be considerably better than what they--considerably better than the average you know at that point you know to get in.  And that's where the Sears career started.
Story_ID: 192819
Speaker 1: Where were you placed initially?
Speaker 2: I went to the national headquarters at Homan [Avenue] and Arthington [Street] is where I put in my application.  I became an executive trainee for Sears [Roebuck & Company] corporate, but they suggested that--that in order to understand the business, you should know something about the stores, should know something about retail at the store level.  So they asked us to select a store and we would be assigned at that store for a year while still on payroll for the corporate, we'd be assigned to that store for a year.  And after that year we would begin a process of interviewing for jobs that became available in the national headquarters.  So I selected a store at 63rd [Street] and Halsted [Avenue], which was an interesting experience.  63rd and Halsted was at that time a mixed community, and the store was predominantly white, but the clientele was becoming increasingly black.  So there were a lot of dynamics there because you know I would say that my acceptance, particularly, as a corporate management trainee was very mixed.
Story_ID: 192820
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you run into?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a program so many weeks in various sections, so much time in customer service, so much time in receiving, time in credit, time on the sales floor and it was a guideline provided by corporate, but the store manager had some discretion in as long as you covered all the areas, he might vary the times.  My first experience on the first day when I walked into the store manager's office and announced myself and they knew that I was--they knew that I was coming.  They had been given you know word, and I was asked to sit down, the store manager would be out in a few minutes and I sat there.  There were two other young men who were also starting their first day, and they were there also to see the store manager.  So the store manager came out and he said, he said, oh, he said, this is quite a honor.  He said as I recall I've been here eleven years and this is the first time that Sixty- third [Street] and Halsted [Avenue] has ever had a corporate management trainee.  And he walked up to the two white guys and said, "Which is one it, which one of you is the trainee?"  And I said to myself, "Okay, here we go."  And I made him know that I was the--that I was the trainee.  And his expression was frozen for a while and he looked me up and down and he said, "Okay," he said, "Well tomorrow you will get started.  He said in the morning when you come to the store, I would like-"I can't remember the two guys names, but he named them and he said, "I'd like for you to report to customer service and I'd like for you to report to credit and Mr. Johnson," he said," You won't need to wear a suit, I would like for you to start in receiving." Which was--this is where the merchandise comes in on the dock and it's taken up to the receiving room where it is counted and verified that the counts are correct.  I said okay.  So I went home and told my wife about it.  She said, "It doesn't sound good to me."  I said, "Well, we'll give it, you know, we'll give it a shot," I said, "receiving is one of the activities for the training position, so he's certainly within his rights in starting me there."  And so after I'd been there about four weeks and I expected--there were only four weeks in receiving, the fifth week I should have been taken out.  So at the beginning of the fifth week I was assigned the box-burning detail, this is where all the corrugated that comes into the store is burned in an incinerator and so I came home after doing that and I talked to my wife again and she said, you know, she said, "This is crazy," she said, "you don't need to do this."  So I got on the phone, called the corporate headquarters and told them what was going on, what my concerns were.  I said, "I'm now in my sixth week, I've been in receiving for six weeks and today I was assigned to box-burning (laughs)."  And the counselor who coordinated this program told me, he said, "In the morning," he said, "wear your suit and go to the store manager's office," so I did.  His secretary was--she said, "Do you have an appointment? I said, "No I don't have an appointment, I was just told to come here, that he would see me."  She said, "I don't think so."  I said, "Well," I said, "I'll wait."  So I sat down and in a few minutes he came out of the office, he was red as a beet.  He told me he said, "You will wear a suit every day, you will spend no more time in receiving," he said, "you go to the toy department and you will be an assistant manager in the toy department.  It's a temporary toy department and you set it up--set it up as you approach Christmas," this was about the end of September, and I had started in August.  So that was my introduction to Sears [Roebuck & Company].  But the store manager actually wanted me to stay at the end of my trainee, he said, "You know," he said, "you don't have to go to corporate."  Said, "If you stay here you'll have a very good career you know in retail."  I said, "No I don't think so, I think I'll stay on the program--I think I'll stay on the program that I'm on."  But this was sort of the--this was sort of the attitude when I--at the end of my training period which was very eventful, I mean we don't have time to go through what retail was like from the inside.
Story_ID: 192821
Speaker 1: Give me the most vivid illustration you can think of at the moment?
Speaker 2: The most vivid illustration is--well this is an environment in which there's a lot of tension.  Civil Rights Movement is raging, store management is white, the store customers are increasingly black and the tension is palpable.  So I'm in the toy department and I'm working--one of my responsibilities is will call.  Now will call which is--which we're all familiar with, will call is relatively rare in retail and rare in Sears Roebuck [and Company].  But at this store where so few customers had credit, will call was a very real activity.  So I'm working will call and it's getting close to Christmas, a couple of weeks.  And I had--I'm working will call desk and a lady comes in and she said, "I want to make my last payment and I want to pick up my stuff," I said okay.  Pulled the record, she made her last payment and I went back to find her stuff and it had been--her packages, which had all been wrapped together, had been opened.  And this happened occasionally.  When commissioned salesmen who were assigned from the furniture department or some of the other departments that didn't do a lot of business at Christmas were assigned to the toy department.  They were on commission and sometimes when we ran out of the favorite toys, they would go into will call, and if they could discern from the outside that this was a Barbie Doll or you know 007 Road Race set or something like that, they might go into it.  It's very much against company policy, but they would open the package, take that out and go out and make a sale with it.  They may have intended to put it back later but anyway they hadn't.  There were only a few items left and all the stuff that she had bought early that turned out to be the very popular products were no longer available in the store.  And I had to go out and tell her that we did not have her packages, and we'd be willing to refund her money.  This was not a satisfactory explanation she told me.  Well first she started crying and she said that she had made her payments every week, that this was her kids' Christmas that we were talking about and that this was completely unacceptable.  And there were a lot of people lined up you know to make payments.  So they began to develop sort of an amen chorus, 'cause everybody could hear her 'cause she was--she was very loud, and I was attempting to keep it quiet and private, but she was preaching (laughs).  And she even--she even made some comments about the quality of service since all these black people have been--have been put in charge--have been put in charge of the operation.  So I said okay, I said you have--I said you have a hundred, I think she had one hundred and thirteen dollars.  She had a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff, one hundred and thirteen dollars of toys.  I said let's go out on the floor and you tell me what would make your kids' Christmas happy.  So I took her out on the floor and she picked out about one hundred and fifty dollars of merchandise and I wrote it up, wrote up an explanation of what happened and gave it to her.  And she was very happy, more than happy 'cause she had done very well.  And so I think the next day the store manager came down and he talked about you know what I had done and he said, "Well how'd you expect to do this?" I said, "You know, I expected that--I expected first that the company would want to make the customer happy."  He said," But what's the procedure?"  I said, "Well I thought that you would figure out you know the procedure.  There must be a procedure for doing this," I said, "I don't know what it is but that's why I wrote up the explanation and gave her the toys."  And he agreed that I had done the right thing and that there was a procedure that it was seldom used but we would, you know, we would do it.  So that was--I'll never forget that experience.
Story_ID: 192822
Speaker 1: When you started working corporate, what did you remember most about it?  How long were you--from training day to the day you left Sears [Roebuck & Company], how long were you with Sears?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Wow.  How was your corporate experience?
Speaker 2: It started pretty much the same way as my experience (laughs)--as my experience in the store.  Took a little bit longer, I had several interviews.  Finally I was accepted for a job in the refrigeration buying department, and my responsibility was the consumer literature, the promotional information, the advertising information.  I was to coordinate all that and see that it all got out to all the stores.  And there were--there were methods for doing that, there were various kinds of communications that went out periodically, and my responsibility was to pull all the information together that the stores would need to know for that period of time and to publish that.  And there was a guy there who had been on the job for a year.  It's usually a job that only lasted two years, he had been there a year and he taught me the ropes and so I did it.  And I began to travel a little bit for the company and things went, you know, relatively well.  We were still oddities.  There were so few blacks that sometimes people, white people, would stop and look at us like what are we doing wearing a suit.  It was strange, it was--you knew you were in a hostile environment.  It was a hostile environment, and most people had an attitude that the Civil Rights Movement had forced you into--wedged you into this situation where you were not particularly welcomed and where there was real doubt about your qualifications.  But we formed a little association, the black employees.  We used to meet over on Thirty-ninth [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] and exchange our, you know, experiences and information.  After two years in that position, another position opened up in the department and I expected to get it, and it was not offered, instead it was offered to the guy who had one year's experience and who I had just finished training on this job, and he was offered the position in the department as an assistant buyer.  So I went to the department manager, who was a very high level executive, managing a buy in the department at Sears was a big job.  I went to him and I asked him you know why I wasn't considered for the job, or was I considered and if I was, why I didn't get it?  And he told me that he was not accustomed to answering such questions or having his authority to make those decisions challenged.  And he threw in that he did not think the company was ready and he certainly was not ready to have his department represented in the rest of the company by a colored man.  So I asked him if I could go to personnel department and he said he didn't care where I went.  So I went to personnel and I explained to them what happened and asked them if this expression of his attitudes was shared by the company, if it was an expression of company policy, and if it wasn't, how could the company allow him to set policy by the expression of personal preference.  And they told me to go back to my office and they would get in touch with me.  And when I got back there was a phone message that said that I had an interview the next morning with the manager of another department for a promotion.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1968.
Story_ID: 192823
Speaker 1: You know later when we founded the Executive Leadership Council [Alexandria, Virginia] and I talked to a number of executives from all over the country, they all had the same experiences.
Speaker 2: Okay, share with me the experience that came to mind just as the other tape ended and then trace for me exactly how the Executive Leadership Council got started?
Speaker 1: Okay.  When Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated and the rioting occurred, there was a--there was a lot of concern for the safety of the employees at Sears Roebuck [& Company], because the rioting started and everyone was in the building over at Homan [Avenue] and Arthington [Street].  And the police and the--the police came out to escort the employees to help them get to the expressways where they can get to the western suburbs where most of them lived.  At least get out of the community because it was feared that the West Side would erupt.  The Sears complex was completely surrounded by African American neighborhoods.  And I was leaving the building and I had to walk by the policemen and a policeman stopped me and asked me to identify myself.  It occurred to me as I was leaving that I was probably the only person who could get shot by both sides, 'cause I was with them but not of them.  But the attitude of the angry people was indiscriminate.  And that was something--that was something to think about, because it was a very dangerous situation.  We could see smoke and the Sears had asked the [U.S.] National Guard to come and prevent looting cause the huge catalog order plant was on the West Side in that same complex.  And while the policemen are searching me, the expression on the faces of the people that I knew, working for Sears was decidedly hostile, like I had caused all this.  You see I was black and this was a black thing.  So you get caught--at that time you could get caught right in the middle.
Speaker 2: And now you say that you discovered from talking with fellow associates in the retailing business that Sears was not alone in this response.  Maybe Sears was a little more conservative or not, but you found that many of you had the same story to tell and that's how the Executive Leadership Council was born?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 192824
Speaker 1: Tell us that story?
Speaker 2: Well.  I'd become an officer in 1978.  I had left the refrigeration department went to the shoe department, I was a buyer for shoes, I traveled all over the world, I became a national sales manager in the shoe department and then a manager of a Sears [Roebuck & Company] buying department for men's apparel and then a vice president of the men's apparel department.  And it was--it was a long period of isolation.  I guess you're--I guess you can get accustomed to stress because at no point do you really feel you know accepted and there's--you might always wonder am I being paranoid, but there are enough examples of things that happen to other people to let you know you're not being paranoid.  In fact I used to--I've done a fair amount of public speaking about my experiences.  And sometimes to illustrate the point I described what a concept that I came up with called the gas mask concept.  And the gas mask is a protective mechanism that African Americans have to use to protect themselves from the impact of racial hostility.  And frequently, it would appear the gas mask is not absolutely necessary because the behavior that you're involved in is the same behavior that everyone else is involved in.  So why is there the need for the gas mask?  And the example goes like this, everyone who ever took theirs off is dead.  So that's why you keep yours on.  So if you think about a gas mask on a sunny day, everyone's walking down the sidewalk enjoying the environment, and you're wearing a gas mask.  I'll give you an example.  It is not uncommon, though it is against company policy, to accept gifts from people that you are associated with in carrying out Sears' business.  It is not uncommon to accept gifts, gifts are offered all the time, many of them are small, some of them are rather substantial.  It is well known that most people accept them.  Black people that accept them are shown the door, and I can give you numerous examples, almost without exception, are shown the door.  So I used to tell you know young black executives that were coming in don't take off your gas mask.  You'll never see the toxicity, you'll only see those without their mask laying on the ground.  That's sort of the environment that I was in for most of those years.  When we started the Executive Leadership Council [Alexandria, Virginia], we had our first meeting, there were fifteen of us, when we met and we started talking, most of us had never met one another, you know, before.
Story_ID: 192825
Speaker 1: Oh, really.  So how did this first meeting come about since you say you've never met each other before?
Speaker 2: There were a group of guys who got together in Texas to save a college.  Wally, Wallace [sic, Bishop College, later, Paul Quinn College, Dallas, Texas] a black college in the Dallas area, and they were not successful, the college went under.  But they decided to stay together and they came up with the idea of an African American support group for senior executives because they realized in coming together for this purpose how isolated they were, because in most cases you're not, at that time, maybe different today, you're not included in the informal networking of your fellow white business associates.  And if you're excluded from there, and then, in most cases, your problems are not easily shared with people in your community, because there are so few of you that those experiences that you're having are relatively rare.
Speaker 1: Who were the first founding members, can you name as many as you can for us?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker James] Jim Kaiser, Vaughn Clarke, [HistoryMaker] Elynor Williams, [HistoryMaker] Toni Fay.  Well that's something you should have asked me before the interview, I could have had the list.
Speaker 1: What year did it start?
Speaker 2: It started in 1985, yeah, 1985 [sic. 1986].
Speaker 1: Did any of the executives have a problem being a member of the [Executive Leadership] council as far as career because sometimes it can be seen that you're pulling yourself apart from, you know, the general population.  Was that any problem?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Many executives would not join the organization.  And some who joined would not become active.  They joined, paid their dues but never attended a meeting.  And that's a real--that's a real problem.  You isolate yourself when you do that.  So you have to make a decision, is the value you're gonna get out of this worth the risk?  My own attitude is that, that it is, that you cannot participate in a white organization and hide the fact that you're black.  Black is the first thing they see about you, sometime black is the only thing they know about you.  So you know to try to lower the profile of your blackness, I think, is quite--well, it's unlikely to happen, unlikely to be a benefit.  And I have seen enough people to see people try both approaches and see the results of both approaches, and there's no difference.
Speaker 1: It's akin to taking off the mask?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192826
Speaker 1: How many members are in the [Executive Leadership] Council [Alexandria, Virginia] today?
Speaker 2: A little over 200.
Speaker 1: The highest number ever?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What does the Council do for a member?
Speaker 2: Well, it provides an opportunity for him to meet with, socialize with and participate in programs with other people who are going through a similar experience.  It's very educational and it's very supportive.  It also raises funds through the Executive Leadership Council Foundation for the publication of information, not just for ELC [Executive Leadership Council] members, but for you know--well, not just for African Americans, for people who are interested in the issues related to diversity.  It also supports a number of programs to help what we call the next generation.  We are very involved with black students in the business schools, we have quite a program going with Howard University [Washington, D.C.], we have an essay contest, we identify potential performing, well performing students, and make them ELC scholars, provide them with additional support, summer employment scholarships.  It's very oriented under--around the idea of making sure that--that we're not the last generation.  There are more executives today, but there really aren't many more reaching the top.
Speaker 1: And speaking of the top, the very top of the large Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, most of the men and now they, thank God, women who are beginning to run these companies, they are a member or have been a member of the council, so that brings the whole African American executive to yet another level now that we have several who are actually running Fortune 500 operations that's almost another level of isolation from the rest of the group in that it's so few who reach the pinnacle.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think they still have to wear their gas mask.
Story_ID: 192827
Speaker 1: Right.  How do you see that they have to negotiate now this other level of isolation, because they certainly have to have allegiance to their job as the CEO, and that's going to probably conflict sometimes with being African American.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think so.  I think that they are African American and they've been shaped by the African American experience, but in order to be successful on their job, they're going to have to think about the interest of the company.  And I guess to give an extreme example, I think you could have an African American head of a racist organization.  If that's what's--you know, the attempt to change the organization will probably be detrimental to the person's best interest.  So if they want to be successful in that organization, they're gonna have to live with the culture of that organization, or if it needs to be changed, it's gotta be changed by a consensus.  There is no--there is no advantage in sacrificing yourself in order to make a statement about blackness or diversity or unfairness or anything else.  You're gonna have to watch the bottom line, keep a good team-like relationship with the board and do your job.
Story_ID: 192828
Speaker 1: Mr. [Richard] Parsons at AOL [America Online] Time Warner, he was known for being very good with people, very skillful, or he is known for being very skillful with people.  His position as an African American Chief Executive, for one of the largest corporations America has birthed, isn't it sometimes when it's almost like he has to forget about being African American, because you're so busy running AOL Time Warner, do you know what I'm trying to say?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  And I think you're right, yeah, I think you're right.  I think you do have to forget except that a large part of his constituency is black, a large part of his customer base is black.  So, but he has to treat them in a manner that makes them supportive of the organization of the company.  Now he may have a better understanding of what it takes to do that.  He may also be more sensitive to differences.  I think the African American experience is an experience that if one really thinks about it in order to solve the dilemmas that come out of that experience you must develop a level of sensitivity that recognizes that people are diverse, people do have common interest and people have to--people should be treated as worthy individuals.  And I think black executives may be more capable of doing that as a result of their experience than many people who haven't gone through that.
Story_ID: 192829
Speaker 1: His name escapes me but the gentleman, who was head of Ben and Jerry's [Robert Holland Jr.], that didn't last too long.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I know him, I can't think of his name either.
Speaker 1: So do you think, well I know there are some day-to-day business reasons it didn't last too long, but do you think it's any perspective or cultural differences--
Speaker 2: No, I think that--I think that--I don't think blacks get three strikes.  I think when you're there you can strike out quick, and there are a lot of examples of that, that there are always gonna be sufficiently large number of people who are really, who really don't want you to be there.  You've got enemies just because you're who you are.  You got enemies because what you're attempting to do flies in the face of what others hold and believe to be true, so you're always going to face a certain amount of resistance and there will even be some people who are willing to cut off their nose to spite their face.
Speaker 1: Because of these chief officer positions, is not that many anyway for anybody of any color.  So if you're going against the grain of national thought then you're really--it must be the ultimate stress position?
Speaker 2: Can be.  I think the answer to that it, you know, you've gotta--when you're on the job you have to do what the job requires, I mean, that's a given, don't even think about it, you have to do what the job requires.  Hopefully you will be firmly rooted in a place where you can be yourself, where others will respect you for who you are, so that if whatever corporate America allows you to borrow, you will still have the values that maintain yourself esteem once that's gone.  If you don't have that then you're gonna be quivering in your boots.  You're gonna feel a lot more stress than someone who has their family, their community, their church, where they are an individual and not a title.
Story_ID: 192830
Speaker 1: So you were able to make that transition, and I know you probably know several other men and women who were able to make that transition from top spots in corporate America into owning and operating your own company, and you apparently do it very well, award after award, after award.  Give me an idea of what was going through your mind as you made that transition from an officer at Sears [Roebuck & Company] into your own business?
Speaker 2: Well, I was looking for--I was looking for another experience.  At fifty-five years old, I had an opportunity to leave Sears under favorable conditions.  And I had made some passive investments in businesses and here was a business that--the packaging business is one that I thought would be interesting.  I didn't know exactly what to expect, I thought that it would be probably more honest than corporate business that I would--there would be less politics involved, there would be a straighter line between effort and you know take out the middle man and go directly to a point where you can be rewarded for what you can produce.  Actually I found that that's not true at all.
Story_ID: 192831
Speaker 1: We were talking about leaving corporate America and starting your own company and discovering some other things about business.
Speaker 2: Well, you discover that if you're gonna--if you're gonna be a business of any size, you're gonna deal with corporate America, and you're gonna deal with corporate America on its terms.  And the attitudes and the cultures of these companies are just factors that you're gonna have to deal with.  So you're still gonna deal with racism if racism is in the company, you've gotta deal with it.  You can't say I'm not gonna--I'm not gonna work with a racist company.  If you're not gonna work with a racist company, you're not gonna work with very many companies cause it's very much there.  So you know all the way from the old neighborhood at 49th [Street] and Champlain [Avenue] all the way to--through Sears and to now running my own business in Memphis, Tennessee, it's still there.  I hope that one day it won't be and I always have my discussions with my own children and with young people today.  I always admonish them to be particularly sensitive to the fact that I am--I'm giving you my perspective, you know, and when the racism disappears, I may not notice it.  So you gotta keep a--you gotta keep an open mind.  I'm only telling you what I've seen, what I know, what I've experienced.  And my experiences are you know not particularly dated, they're as fresh as yesterday. But I cannot project what the future is going to be like, you know, one day it's gonna get better, and it has gotten better, and it may be an evolutionary process.  And at one point you might be able to take your gas mask off, but I would suggest, just not yet.
Story_ID: 192832
Speaker 1: Okay you in running your own company even though independent business is an extension of corporate if you are of any size, what changes, for you, meaning, you know if you're inside a corporation you have to go by that culture, when you're outside, you simply have to learn to work with that culture.  Would you say that it's that sense of independence alleviates some of the stress of executive life?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes it does.  When you run your own business you make more of the decisions, and you could make them based on whatever you want.  I mean when you think about it for the average business if they do--if they do 20 million dollars in sales, they probably have 18 million dollars of cost.  And the cost, there's a lot of discretion in how those dollars are spent.  And at least in your own company you can be open, you can be completely objective, you can provide opportunities, you can do anything that doesn't cost too much, that is, you can't pay extra, okay.  You can be fair, but you cannot pay extra.  Anything, any costs that you accept that your competitors do not accept must be borne by your profits, must be taken out of profits.  So you gotta get your--for every dollar you spend, you gotta get a dollar's worth or you're not gon be in business very long.  But you can make sure that where you have discretion, you can use that discretion to favor whoever you want.
Speaker 1: Johnson Bryce [Inc.] is known for quality service as a packaging company.  Would you describe the company for us for the record?
Speaker 2: We print and laminate films.  That is, when you pick up a potato chip bag and you see the colorful graphics on the outside of it, we print those.  When you see the silver lining inside the bag, we have laminated that film.
Story_ID: 192833
Speaker 1: How did you get into that?
Speaker 2: Through some contacts.  I was on the board of a company that brought me in touch with some people who owned another company, the Bagcraft packaging company in Chicago [Illinois], and they were divesting themselves of a plant in Atlanta, Georgia that did a particular kind of packaging that was not what their main activity was.  They were primarily bag makers and this plant did roll stock, meaning that the film is shipped in roll and it's fed into a form and fill machine with makes the package.  And I got an opportunity to buy the majority interest of that plant, and the plant was small.  The Frito Lay Company provided us an opportunity to take that volume that we were doing in that plant with them to another plant or wherever we want--or build another plant, do whatever we wanted to do and we could keep the volume, and that gave us the leverage to negotiate a joint venture with the Bryce family in Memphis, Tennessee.  So we started the Johnson Bryce Plant in 1991.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your company used to be in Dallas [Texas] or you were just always working there?
Speaker 2: No.  It was not in Dallas.  Frito [Lay Company] is in Dallas and they're still our largest customer.
Story_ID: 192834
Speaker 1: When you were considering a merger with another packaging company, that was a challenging period.  Is it possible for a smaller company to really consider buying or merging with a company that's already having trouble?
Speaker 2: No.  I think mergers have to be very carefully considered, particularly if you're going to--if you're gonna to merge with someone who doesn't have a good track record then you've got to consider that you aren't--you gotta consider what are you getting?  A business makes money, a business is a money making machine.  If you're not making money, you're not really a business, okay, then you are a potential business.  So you have to look at that potential and say is there something that I can do, is there some synergy that I can bring, something that's not there now that will be there once I own this company that is going to turn it around quickly and make it a money-making activity.  If there isn't then what you're buying is just assets, that is, it's not a building and machines or not a business.  It might have the possibility of being a business one day, but if you're buying a building and you're buying machines then you should price it at that.
Speaker 1: When Frito Lay introduced you to the business they thought--
Speaker 2: To the Bryce family?
Speaker 1: --No, to the merger situation.  They thought that would work well because the two of you were--
Speaker 2: That wasn't--that wasn't Frito Lay, that was--
Speaker 1: --Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --Procter and Gamble.
Speaker 1: Procter and Gamble, that's right.
Speaker 2: That was Procter and Gamble.  Procter and Gamble was doing business with the company and suggested that that potential of the business they were doing would be greatly enhanced if we merged with them.  But that merger never took place.
Speaker 1: Because there again, of how much corporate impact independent, they were changing their business model to say we want fewer suppliers, so therefore they give fewer suppliers a bigger piece of business and they were trying to maintain, if my understanding is correct, you can help me here, they were trying to maintain the connection they had to a minority-owned firm, and they introduced the two of you to consider--
Speaker 2: That's--that's true, and the firm that they're doing business with is not particularly successful.
Speaker 1: --Right.
Speaker 2: So they wanted to continue doing business with them, but they needed a stabilization factor.  And there's a certain logic to the idea of a merger because you know small businesses have a difficult time competing with large businesses.  And the larger they are, the better possibility they have of making a--of making a better representation of themselves in the market place.  So, if we had been able to merge and there had been sufficient synergy that we could have made three out of one and one that would have been a good possibility of doing that.  But in this case business was located quite a distance away, the technologies employed in two businesses were sufficiently dissimilar to prevent very much synergy.  So we decided not to do it.
Story_ID: 192835
Speaker 1: And you haven't considered--What considerations have you given to your growth path?
Speaker 2: Yes.  What we're involved in right now is a great effort to diversify our business.  We started off with Frito Lay as our only customer and Snack Food as our only product.  We now make the labels for Slim Fast cans, we make the inner linings of the Kodak disposable camera, the film package in there, we make the pouches that hold the cartridges for the Hewlett Packard film, I'm sorry, printer cartridges, and we make a lot of the dog food, dog and cat food packaging for--that's sold in PetSmart.
Speaker 1: So, now--
Speaker 2: And we want to go broader.
Speaker 1: --Right.  And it's interesting that your background in going to all those different departments, even though it was in retail, the elements of the business involved, that's one of the things that allowed you to operate successfully.  You were bringing a strong base of experience.
Speaker 2: Well, as a buyer for Sears and Roebuck [and Company], I was bringing a lot of product, but I was buying it from a lot of small plants and I got quite an appreciation.  Small businesses is much more important in the United States than big business.  And when you see a big business, I mean, you see General Motors, all the parts of a car are made by small businesses.  They're just bringing the whole thing together and assembling it.  So that 50 billion dollars of sales that they represent is the sum total of a lot of small parts, many of which were developed and manufactured by small businesses, and I'm talking businesses under 100 million dollars.
Speaker 1: So in working with small businesses in your position at Sears, you started to really understand what's involved in bringing that service of product to market?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And the way small businesses operate, you know.  I mean small businesses deal with people, they deal with the selection, motivation and incenting and rewarding of people.  They deal with capital, it is what equipment do you need, when do you need it and how are you going to pay for it.  And then the management of how to use the labor assets and the capital assets in a manner that results in product that is more valuable than its components.  And that's--that's the issue, that's the secret.  Now big business does the same thing except a very large percentage of big business is communication.  And a lot of the distortion in big business that results in the waste and inefficiency is communication.  The politics of big business is in that communication area.
Story_ID: 192836
Speaker 1: With the terrific reputation you have for delivering on time and in order, the products and the services your company makes, what would you tell another small business person or future small business person about how to gain that kind of consistency and stability and delivery, because that's where a lot of smaller businesses have a big problem?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we have to--you have to know the business, you have to know the business that you're in.  I think sometimes there's an assumption that you can buy a business and when you buy it you also buy the talent that's running it, and you buy the customers and so now you own it and you have an opportunity then to learn it.  I think that's kind of backwards.  You should know--you should know what you're buying, and to do that you have to know the business.  And if you don't know it, you got to learn it very quickly, because no one's going to take care of it the way you are and no one's going to guide it the way it's should be guided, no one's going to take care of your customers.  You know I frequently go in restaurants and you know greeted with indifference by the you know the host or hostess and you know indifference, carelessness on the part of the wait staff and you walk around you look at the place, it's not clean.  You know the owner in most cases does not know that.  He think he's paying for somebody to clean it up, he's paying for someone to greet his customers, he's paying for a wait staff, I mean he spent some money, he doesn't get anything.  So, unless he's there and you can always tell a restaurant when the owner's there because it's just different, it's different, and he usually greets you, and he's genuinely glad to see you, and he's very interested in how you respond to what they're offering.  When he's not there, that interest may not be there.  So small business is bringing all the pieces together and putting them in a combination that has value for somebody.
Story_ID: 192837
Speaker 1: What has been your most challenging event to date within your business?
Speaker 2: I'm involved in it right now.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about it?
Speaker 2: Sure.  It is--I've already talked about it.  It's can we diversify the business and grow it fast enough to maintain a significant place in the industry.  And that's--in these particular times the last couple of years have been difficult for all businesses, so I'm not by myself in that challenge, but that--yeah, that's--I think my biggest challenges are still in front of me.
Speaker 1: And just for a hot second, technology, buying, operating, making your product or whatever, that's a big piece of the pie today, money-wise and otherwise, how has your company dealt with that technological challenge?
Speaker 2: Well, I think for a small business the key word is focus.  You have to decide what it is you're--what are you going to try to do and who are you going to try to do it for?  Technology is one component of those things that you have to assemble to allow you to be very good and hopefully the best at a narrow range of offerings, a narrow range of product.  If you're small, it's very difficult to be small and broad.  So if you're small I would suggest that you've gotta be focused, and once you focus on who is your customer and what do they need then you need to assemble the capital, the human capital, the training and in the management of those, technology will make the job easier.  The purpose of technology is to make it easier to do what you've gotta do.  Technology should help you to overcome difficulties.

Speaker 1: As you've consider, you know, where you are now, where you have been and your whole bank of experiences and your reputation and business, what do you think Robert Johnson will be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I think and I hope that I'll be remembered for being generous. Particularly with the--I've been very fortunate to have a series of experiences that were caused by the accident of timing.  Someone asked me once what was the--what is the single most important factor that contributed to what you've been able to accomplish, and I told them it was to having the forethought and the good sense to be born in 1935.  Because when you're born in 1935, you know, you saw the war as a kid, you missed Vietnam [War], you were a black college graduate in 1965, when the opportunities opened up, you, as an adult you worked during the greatest period of prosperity that the world has ever known and you are catching the benefits now of the greatest expansion in longevity that has ever occurred.  You couldn't have timed it better.  I've had the opportunity to take advantage of all those and I would like to be--I'd like to be known for my willingness to share the benefits of that experience with others.
