Story_ID: 5642
Speaker 1: Let's start with your mother.  And I'd like to have her name and what you know about her family.  Originally, was your family from Mississippi originally?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, as I said I was born September 30th, 1941 in a little town called Benoit, Mississippi in a lean-to.  You know, those little shacks that kinda lean whichever the way the wind is blowing.  And my mother and my father they were uneducated if you will.  And this was--they picked cotton. That's what people did in Mississippi.  And my mother still brags to this day that she could pick 300 pounds of cotton.  So I think that's kind of an attribute I guess.  But, you know, very poor circumstances.  Sharecropping a lot.  And my grandparents did finally manage to own their own place. And one-seater toilets, which means that they were up and coming.  Two-seaters meaning you were there.  But it was one of those environments where you didn't really know you were poor.  Not until folks told you.  And children always came to Grandma and Grandpa's for the summer.  So we played out in the dirt and all of that.  And my mother ultimately left that area, she and my father and moved to Memphis [Tennessee] where the jobs were plentiful.  And Mother has held a series of what I called menial jobs but they were jobs, one that she could do but two, that helped me to get through college. So I owe, I owe.  And I will always be eternally grateful for all that she did to make this happen for me.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary Louise Rice.
Speaker 1: Okay Mary Louise Rice.  And was her side of the family--were the Rices originally from this town in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes Benoit, Mississippi is where they all were born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did she--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Still live there.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about her growing up anything like that or did your grandparents on that side share anything with you?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  The walking to school. Actually in Benoit there was no school.  So during the school year, Mother and her sisters and brothers went to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, the all black town.  And that's where they went to school.  And when school was out, they all came back to Benoit. And that's where they stayed until it was school time again.  And they went--Mother went to the eighth grade.  And my mother is a mathematical whiz.  I mean I always look at her and I say today if she had gone to school, my mother could have been anything.  I mean she is very, very smart.  And I ask her things like, "Mother you know, you all weren't educated.  Grandma certainly wasn't.  Yet you are all articulate." That word.  And she said, "Grandma just made 'em say it right."  So I said, "What do you mean say it right?"  She said, "She heard the white folks talking.  And so she wanted her children to talk like that."  And so all of them with a limited education--her youngest sister was the only one that ever went through high school.  But with that limited education, all of them if you met them and talked to them you would never believe it.  And that was Grandma.  You know, "Say that again.  That's not right."  She--Grandma could barely read but she knew what she heard.  And my mother was always an A student.  Whatever the term--whatever they were using then.  And in this one-room schoolhouse where all the kids went.  She was a great student.  But there was just no place to go.  So like most of 'em, she got married early. I think she was seventeen.  And stayed down in Mississippi for a while and then Memphis, which is very near Greenville, Mississippi, the big town near Benoit. She and Daddy worked in Memphis.  And that's where you get--got in those days the jobs working in clubs, you know, service jobs.  And so I went to first grade.  My first grade was in Memphis.  And I was four years old.  Mother kind of told a story because otherwise she would have to have a babysitter.  And she couldn't afford it.  So she went into the schools and convinced them that I was--I think I was six.  She convinced them that I was six.  And I was smart.  Yes.  And so they let me in. And she kept saying the birth certificate had been ordered, it was on its way.  And it never got there.  So I started school at four years old in the first grade.  I did very well. So it worked out fine.  And of course once you get in, then your next grade is the second grade.  And by that time Mother had sent me back to Mississippi to live with her sister in Greenville.  Which is as I say Benoit is a suburb of Greenville.  Right.
Story_ID: 5643
Speaker 1: My father was from Starkville, Mississippi initially.  And that's called the hills.  They don't grow cotton there. They grow all kinds of other things, particularly corn and you know, the dirt is not the black dirt or the red dirt of Greenville [Mississippi] and Benoit [Mississippi].  But he and my mother [Mary Louise Rice] you know, we only had--I'm the only child.  So I don't have any siblings and he is now deceased.  But he too was a smart man.  And Daddy--you know, neither one of them wanted to stay down in the country.  So Daddy had gone up to Detroit [Michigan] when they started opening up the ironworkers' union.  And Daddy wanted to be a welder.  But, you know, in those days if you recall history, the leadership of an organization would say, "I want to integrate."  And they would put African Americans down with this--the floor supervisor.  The foreman or whatever.  And those men generally harassed you terribly.  And Daddy was harassed.  And he tried to hold his temper but he's a man who does not suffer fools gladly.  So he decked a supervisor.  And of course that's an absolute--that was an absolute no-no.  We're talking about in the '40s [1940s].  And he wound up being blacklisted.  So that meant he could not get a job in any kind of blue collar profession in Detroit.  So he and Mother went up to Minnesota where the railroad jobs were open.  But he's--and there my mother tells the story that he came home one day and said he'd been fired.  And Mother said, "Why?"  And, in essence, because he didn't pay.  He stopped paying for his job. The black men who were working then had to pay the union boss, the union supervisor to keep their jobs.  And Daddy had gotten mad and decided he wasn't gonna pay 'em any more. So he got fired.  So he came home and told mother the story and my mother was incensed.  She made him go back, pay the man, apologize so he could get his job back.  And you know, in hindsight you'd say, "Oh Ma, that was so awful.  You know, where was his pride?  Where was his integrity?"  But my mother in those days said, "Hey there's one child.  We're here in Minnesota.  You were making a lot of money." 'Cause frankly those were the professional jobs for our people back then. And you know, nowhere else could he get that kind of money.  So Daddy, you know, resisted initially.  But he finally went on and went back and put his pride in his pocket, paid and got his job back.  And from that day on, Daddy would come home.  And he would be a very evil person to put it mildly.  And I was an adult before I finally realized what was going on with him.  If you take a man--my father was tall, six [feet] three [inches].  He was probably much bigger than most of the people in front of him that were abusing--emotionally abusing him.  And yet he took it.  You know, he would talk about say a drunken white man would come in with a girlfriend.  "Hey boy come on over here."  And Daddy would have to come over "Yes sir.  Yes sir." And, you know, he'd stand there and take whatever abuse was being heaped upon him.  And that's, that's hard.  So when he came home, Daddy in my judgment--this is Lucy in the cartoon strip psychology ['Peanuts'] .  He would come home and this was the only environment he could control.  Was his home.  So he'd be yellin', "I want this and take that and give me this." I mean he was just that kind of person.  He wasn't--he was never abusive.  He was just difficult.  And I now understand that.  At the time I didn't like it.  And swore I'd never marry anybody like that.  But I now understand it.  That was a difficult job for him.  He made money.  He made as they say good tips but his pride was probably abused, you know, it was a difficult time and a difficult place.  People think you know, Minnesota.  You know, Mississippi.  Frankly there wasn't a lot of difference.  It really wasn't.  The schools were integrated but you were treated badly.  So we didn't have any black teachers. So it was like the flip side of the same coin. And I understand now how he--how he was and why he was.  But it took me a long time as an adult to understand that.  When he finally retired from the system, the railroad system, Daddy would say, "You know, this Amtrak you know, it's not like the old Great Northern [Railway] the Empire Builders." Those were--you know, that was like you know, your buttons had to be spit shined, your shoes--If you were not properly dressed, it was like in the military.  You were sent home.  Your cap, the little visor had to be polished.  I mean it was incredible.  What the requirements were then versus what they are now.  The railroad was the mode of travel for most people. So there was an elegance about it.  You know, today you just get on a train and go, you know.  But in those days, I mean it was--the men looked very dignified no matter how they were treated. And so Daddy took pride in making sure that everything was fine.  And you know, we earned a good living, had our own home.  And I was able to go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Because both parents worked.
Story_ID: 5644
Speaker 1: Was there anything about your living with your aunt and that whole experience there that you remember?  Any memories there about her or--
Speaker 2: Well my aunt had three children.  And this was mother's older sister, a year older.  And you know, we were in Mississippi. Everything was segregated. So we really didn't know anything about the folks across the railroad tracks except that my aunt worked for one.  And you know, she did the traditional housekeeping and cooking, ironing and that kind of thing.  And you know, we played--we were--again the strange thing about segregation is that you really don't know you're segregated against 'cause that's how you live. That's all you've ever known.  And I can remember we'd get together and we'd run across the railroad tracks and we'd see the white kids and we'd throw something at 'em and run back.  They'd see something and they'd throw something at us and run back.  It was that kind of, you know, give and take.  I don't know personally of violence but we would hear them talk about it.  Someone who had been beaten or someone who had disappeared.  They would never talk about being killed.  They just disappeared. And frankly you didn't know whether they had been killed or whether they snuck out and went up north some place.  A lot of that happened during those days.  The school, the initial school that I went to was the school for black children. It was bad.  I mean in very bad shape.  Water came out of the fountain like slid over the top so if you wanted water, you had to suck it out.  So what they had us all doing was bring our little cups.  And you had to--. Your cup was tied around your neck with a string.  If you forgot your cup, you ever see those little hats you make with a piece of paper?  You know you fold them and then you can kind of squeeze 'em together?  And that became your, your cup.  Those were some difficult days.  And then at some point the city fathers decided to build a school.  And we had a nice little school, Lucy L. Webb [School, Greenville, Mississippi].  I never knew any--who this woman was.  But it was an elementary school. And she was non-African American. And that's where we went.  And the school was nice looking and, you know, pretty and we thought, "Oh this is great.  This is wonderful."  But it was still a black school.  Today it is not.  But then it was.  And living with my aunt we always seemed to have plenty to eat.  I didn't realize that it wasn't you know.  Grits was a mainstay, 'cause grits were real cheap. And I can remember my aunt would always--for something to drink she would buy a soda.  And she would put soda in the pitcher and add water and sugar.  I never knew that that was not good.  It was good then. But the thought of having a Coke, you know, today diluted three or four times in some sugar added was disgusting.  But we always seemed to have food.  And my aunt had a garden. And again we all came from this Benoit [Mississippi] farm background.  So she had things growing all the time.  Tomatoes and corn and all that.  So we seemed to be alright.  Today I would say we were living in poverty.  But I--we didn't know it.  My aunt had a house.  And that was phenomenal.  She had her little house.  It was a two bedroom and it was my aunt and my three cousins all living there.  And occasionally my uncle would come back from the farm.  He'd come in for the weekend.  We managed.  It was always a space and a place for somebody.  You never knew you were overcrowded.  You never knew that there was another way. The better way.  This was the way.  There was no TV, some radio and, you know, it was a lifestyle that was healthy for us as children.  But it might not have been--it would not have been that healthy if we'd known what all the alternatives were.
Story_ID: 5645
Speaker 1: What do you think?  What were you like?  Were you mischievous?  Were you outspoken? Were you, you know, were you rambunctious?  What were--I mean what were?  Were you well-mannered?  Were you--
Speaker 2: Frankly I was well-mannered.  I don't know where this came from but I always wanted to please adults.  It wasn't to please my colleagues.  I didn't care about them.  I wanted adults to say, "Oh that's so good.  Oh isn't she nice?"  I would be the first one to raise a hand.  I wanted to memorize a speech and say it in Sunday school.  I wanted the teachers to like me. And I didn't want to be hit.  In those days the teachers would grab you in a second.  Legs, hands, whatever.  And, you know, I didn't want anybody to ever hit me.  You can say things, you can make me cry but don't touch me.  And so I was that way.  If I thought you were gonna get me, I would, I would do anything.  My cousins were kind of bad.  So if my aunt couldn't figure out who had done it, we all got it.  I would tell in a minute.  "She did it!  He did it!"  Because I didn't want to be hit.  I just "ooh!"  And (laughs) so--and I was smart.  You know, sometimes that's not the best thing to do.  But it was--to me it made sense.  And so I would want to bring home As and  Bs.  I would bring home As.  But you know, it was--school was good.  I liked getting up and going to school.  I was a little bad in that things like I had flat feet so my aunt--you know, in those days they would buy those little metal things that go in your shoes, which I thought hurt.  And so I would go out of the house with those things in my little, what do they call 'em--those little high tops.  That's what we wore in those days.  I took--as soon as I got out of the side of the house, I'd take those metal things out of my shoes.  So I had the flattest feet in the world.  I mean you can't get a dime under 'em from standing on the floor.  But I enjoyed school.  And I liked going to school.  I liked being around folks.  I was so tiny though that I kind of got picked on.  You know, they had all kinds of names for me.  I will not tell you what they are.  But you know, I was just little. And I would fight though.  If you wanted to mess with me a lot, I would definitely--I would close my eyes and just start flinging my fists.  And cried a lot 'cause people always picked on me. But I was determined to be what I wanted to be.  Not what they wanted me to be.  So I've always been a good student.  And again my mother [Mary Louise Rice] would take me--when we moved to Minnesota, she was a part of different groups.  I would always go with her.  I'd take my homework with me.  I would take whatever I needed. But I would try consistently to be such a good girl they would say, "Oh Mary your daughter is so sweet.  You know, you can always bring her."  You know, that kind of thing.  So that worked for me.
Speaker 1: You--so your cousins really probably resented you.  You were the probably the little tattletale they thought.
Speaker 2: Yes but they knew the drill. They would threaten me too.  "We gon'  hit you."  They knew that they said that I was, "What do you want me to do?"  (Laughs).  It was that.  And that's something that I have up to this day.  If you really want to fight, you know, they say if you've ever seen that movie 'The Hulk', the green thing that comes out and--I think that's me.  I think if provoked, I could be a very unnice person.  And so I don't like to see that side of me.  So people kind of leave me alone.  My ex-husband could tell you about that side of me (Laughs).
Story_ID: 5646
Speaker 1: ...Left to go to--to join your parents in St. Paul [Minnesota]. That must have been a big deal. Because here you are--did they come and pick you up?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Daddy was a driver.  He--even though he worked on the railroad and could go anywhere in the country for free that the rail--that the then Great Northern [Railway] went, he liked to drive.  And he would drive non-stop from Minnesota to Mississippi.  Sometimes he would stop and visit his sister in St. Louis [Missouri].  But generally he liked to drive straight through.  And so we--at those--in those days, you know, you have to stop and either find out where the black part of town was or you did your business out in the--in the woods.  'Cause you know, you couldn't use the bathrooms in the gas stations and you know, all those things.  You couldn't buy food.  We would always have our food in the car.  But sometimes the--when you're driving along the highway, to go and find the black part of town, sometimes took you too much off track.  So--or if you were at some place and they tell you, "Yeah you can eat but you have to go around the back and be served."  So those kinds of things Daddy just said--so we'd stop at a grocery store and maybe get a loaf of bread and some bologna and some sodas or crackers.  And that's how we would get to Mississippi. But it was a difference for me.  And when I got from--first thing--the first difference was going to school with mostly white kids.  That was kind of a shocker.  And that was another incentive.  I was determined to be smarter than everybody in that room.  Just another peculiarity that I had.  And what I also found out, however, was that I was already smarter than they were.  You know, when you look back at the educational system in the South, yes it was segregated.  But those people in front of you knew your parents, knew everybody else and would make sure that you had your work done.  If you--if it wasn't done, your parents got told.  Your grandparents got told.  Somebody got told.  And you were in trouble.  You know, there was a responsibility that went from the teachers to the family to the community.  And that you don't have now.  And you didn't have in Minnesota to that extent.  Teachers were people that were passing through from 8:00 [a.m.] to 5:00 [p.m.], or 8:00 [a.m.] to 3:00 [p.m.] or whatever it was.  And in the segregated environment, that was not true.  Those teachers, whatever level of education they had, they were a part of your life.  They were at Sunday school, at church. 'Cause it was such a limited environment that you could comfortably walk around in.  But I was always smart.  I had actually read things and done things in earlier grades than these folks had done.  So I said, "Well that added to my ego."  I knew I was smart.  I was ahead of them.  I had read this already.  And you know, I just thrived in that environment.  It was, you know, you played with the kids.  They were in your neighborhood. The neighborhoods [in St. Paul] especially for blue collar workers were integrated.  The suburbs were not.  Most jobs were still not integrated.  I mean we didn't get a black teacher in the state of Minnesota, the state of Minnesota until I had gone in '58 [1958] to go to college.  The--this woman came up from Chicago [Illinois].  And she was a certified teacher in the Chicago system. And they told her in Minnesota that she would have to be a substitute teacher.  And she sued.  And that's how we got our first teacher, first African American teacher.  I was gone then.  We had one pharmacist in St. Paul, Minnesota.  I think we had one dentist so we had that appearance of integration.  It wasn't really integrated.
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask you though--your parents show up or their--you're told that you're moving north.  Was that something that you were like--You know, 'cause you know, kids. It's a whole--It would be like a whole 'nother country in some respects.
Speaker 2: It was. But it's interesting when you're a child.  Now my parents--I'd been living with my aunt for about three or four years.  Whenever my folks came down, they came down in a Cadillac or a fairly new car.  And I thought that my parents were rich (laughs).  They would always come down with presents and clothes for everybody.  And so I was excited about going up there with my rich parents in this big car.  When I got to Minnesota, it was a room that they lived in.  But Daddy had his car.  And you know, so to that extent I was excited.  And I wasn't really in love with my cousins.  They were--they picked on me too much. And they weren't too bright. So I wanted to go with my parents to see this new environment.  And they made it sound like the land of milk and honey.  So I was excited about going. Yeah I might miss my cousins a little bit.  But I got up there and there were kids everywhere and I got to know some of them.  My mother was active in church so I got that environment as well.  And I never really regretted it 'cause I did have a better life.  Better food.  Even got to go out to a restaurant every now and then. You know.  I looked good.  My parents would always make sure on Sunday morning when we went to Sunday school and church, I'd have on my little outfits and I was spit-shined.  So to that extent I really didn't miss it.  It was a little bit of a shock just going to school with all these white kids.  That was new to me.  But again with my goal being to be the best of whatever, you know, it didn't bother me so much.  And I always thought they were not too bright anyway.  So you know, I had my own notions as a child.  You know, and sometimes those notions are false and sometimes they are right on the money.
Story_ID: 5647
Speaker 1: So what is forming you as a young person then in Minneapolis [sic, St. Paul, Minnesota]?  Because it is a different environment than the South.  You know, and you're in an integrated environment. But you--I know you're going to church.  That's a part of your life--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: But what are the other things sort of forming you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you hear a lot of people say, "Well it was my parents."  It really was.  My mother [Mary Louise Rice] was--if she had been a psychiatrist or psychologist, she'd be charging $300 an hour.  Because she is so subtle with the things that she wants you to do.  A lot of times I'd be doing what she wanted me to do not even realizing it and thinking it's my idea.  She was just--was! She is a wonderful person.  I remember I was gonna marry the church pianist.  I was sixteen.  I got out of high school at sixteen.  And that was gonna be my goal.  My mother said, "Well you know, you're sixteen.  You might just wait 'til you're eighteen so that you would, you know, have a chance to be an adult and you wouldn't have--need anybody's permission."  And I didn't know whether I needed anybody's permission or not.  I think you couldn't get married until you were twenty-one.  But she just faked me out.  And so I said, "Okay I'll go on to school."  So I went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] from Minnesota.  And within--by Christmastime, I couldn't even remember the name of the church pianist.  I saw all these wonderful young men from all over the country and they were so smart.  And he was still back there playing the piano.  So that ended that.  But I didn't realize that she had psyched me into this.  And I got to Howard and I wanted to come back. And she said, "Well, you know you got a round trip ticket. Why don't you just wait 'til Christmas."  'Cause I was ready to come home after a week.  She says, "No just wait 'til Christmas.  When you come home, if you still wanna stay here, then we'll let you.  You don't have to go back."  So I was so happy.  By Christmas, I didn't wanna go home for Christmas.  But all the--everybody else had gone home for Christmas. So then I didn't want to be there by myself in the dorm.  But my mother really had a way without any--that formal training of getting into your head and making you want to do the right thing.  And I did the right thing.  I mean to me, education wasn't something that you thought about.  It was like your name.  It's just there and you just do it.  Other than that little foray when I wanted to get married, I always knew I'd go to school and I'd get a formal education.  They didn't have it, but they wanted me to have it.
Story_ID: 5648
Speaker 1: Did you ever feel lonely as a, you know, an only child? Was--and did any of that figure in? Because you were raised during those early years as part of four [with her three cousins].
Speaker 2: Well I felt a little lonely but it seems like when I got to the point where it was getting a little bit too much, something would happen.  I mean we had moved from the original one-room [in St. Paul, Minnesota] to--my parents bought a house.  And we lived on the first floor and they rented out the second floor, and there were children up there so I--they were like there all the time.  So we played together a lot.  And whenever they rented it out, it was always to somebody with children.  And so I always had somebody to play with or babysit for.  So I wasn't really alone.  But I was lonely in that nobody seemed to want to do what I wanted to do.  I mean the notion of being smart or going to school or reading books.  I love to read.  They didn't wanna do that.  And I set a goal once to read the entire 'Encyclopedia Britannica'.  And I started with A and I think I got to C.  I just wanted to read the whole thing.  I was gonna read the whole set.  I had another goal at another age where I was gonna read the dictionary. I mean--so when my--when my daughter went home to visit my mom [Mary Louise Rice], some of my old friends, you know, they saw her and they said, "Yeah your mom is strange.  You know, she'd sit home and read the dictionary."  I mean they thought it was a joke.  But I was serious.  I wanted to be bright and I didn't--my parents didn't quite know what to do to make me that.  I mean, go to school. And the teachers frankly were not that supportive.  I mean I had gone to the counselors to say, you know, "I want to go to college."  And they said, "Well you know, you have great skills, secretarial skills."  I took the secretarial track in girls' vocational and college prep track in the high school.  I got a diploma and a certificate at the same time from the two different institutions.  And you know, they didn't seem to know what to do with me.  But because I had all those secretarial skills, even though I did well in the college track programs, they wanted--the counselors suggested that I just go ahead and get a job.  Never ever pointing me in the direction of college.  Well I didn't know what to do and how to start this process.  My parents didn't.  So the way I got to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was 'cause the girl across the street was going.  She applied.  So I said, "Oh, what did you do?"  And I got all the information and I applied.  Well--well the girl across the street did not get accepted.  So I wound up going to Howard by myself.  And boy, was I terrified.  That's why I wanted to come back home after a week. But again all these things around me didn't really change my mind or--it just sort of made me figure this thing out.  'Cause my parents wanted these things for me but they didn't know how to get them.  And again, you know, we were integrated but we weren't.  It was still a form of segregation in that system.
Story_ID: 5649
Speaker 1: What was St. Paul [Minnesota] like during those, you know, the late '40s [1940s] or early '50s [1950s]?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Again it was--on the outside it was integrated.  On the inside it was not.  When we--when we moved into the house, it was in an all-white neighborhood.  I think there was one other black family maybe six or seven blocks from where we lived. I went to the school, I was the only African American in there.  And they sort of, you know.  It was a little rough at first.  But when the grades come out, and people always respect you a little bit more 'cause I was always up there.  I was on--I was one of two African Americans in the entire state to graduate on the honor roll.  Just--there were just two of us.  Two females.  So when I was in this other school, elementary school and high school, I just always made the honor roll. I didn't know I wasn't supposed to.  And then being in a non-African American environment, the challenges were there.  I never wanted them to say I wasn't bright.  Never.  They could say anything else.  They could say I was skinny.  They could say I was funny-looking.  They never wanted me to play sports 'cause I had no agility at all.  I couldn't even dance.  Came to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and they had to teach me. But the point is I was academically somewhat gifted but I was not--I had no agility like black folks are supposed to have.  You know, two left feet. You know, if the baseball came at me wherever it came I tried to hit it.  No thought of, "Hey it's supposed to be at this level."  No if it would be up there.  I'd try to hit it.  Tennis, nah.  Not even thought about that.  So my notion was that whatever was around me, I'm not go' let that keep me down.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers--? So you had no black teachers.  Were there any teachers that were encouraging of your talent?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I always tell the story of the choir.  I sang in a church choir--no voice.  So I said, "Well I'll just go out and try for this high school choir."  And I cannot sing a lick.  I know that.  But I said, "Well I'll try anyway."  I tried to be a cheerleader and I can't even do a cartwheel.  I just--I'll try.  So I went into this choir rehearsal.  And it was--everyone had to audition.  And I auditioned and I couldn't sing a note.  I was flat.  I was everything.  And so the choir instructor said, "Oh she must be having a bad day."  So I got into the choir.  To get out of the--to get your grade--if you sang a solo, you could get an A.  You did something else you'd get a B and so on.  Well I still couldn't sing.  So I sang a solo.  This white teacher said, "Oh she's having a bad day today."  I got an A.  'Cause I tried.  But the point is that that's one of those examples where stereotypes and racisms come back and it became a positive for me.  But you know, the teacher was wherever the teacher was in his head.  But again there were some difficult moments.  Since there were no black kids in the school, in high school, the prom was an issue for me.  I mean who am I gonna go to the prom with?  So I just didn't go.  We moved to another neighborhood. Well my parents bought a single-family house.  And there that was my last two years in high school.  So that was an integrated school.  And for that particular event, I did get to have my church pianist take me to the senior prom.  But you know, there were--some kids have a great deal of difficulty dealing with all of this.  And I can thank my mother [Mary Louise Rice] 'cause I can handle it.  My mother is a very, very strong Christian.  I mean the notion of getting up out of bed and the first thing you do is say your prayers and the night before you lay down, the last thing you do is say your prayers.  That's my mother.  Church, groups--I mean she's been a trustee.  She's been everything in the church.  That's her.  And when I was there as a child, Sunday was shot.  'Cause it was all-day church.  BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union] and BTU [Baptist Training Union] and all these other things.  So all that kind of helped me to be strong.  'Cause you know, when things really get hard, you know, ooh!  You could not have mentioned the Lord's name for a month.  But when things get hard, "Oh Lord please don't let this--don't let this happen to me.  Or let this happen to me." Or whatever.  And she put that in there.  And she put it in there so deep it'll never come out.
Speaker 1: Now where were you excelling? were you gravitating to the math and sciences or were you more into you know, English and you know, history--I mean the social sciences? What were you--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in high school, when you take the college track, it's laid out for you.  And because I was in two schools at once, I had to--vocational started at 7:30 [a.m.].  So I had to be there at 7:30.  This was upstairs from the high school.  It wasn't like two different sites.  So I would go upstairs at 7:30 for the Voc[acational] Ed[ucation] Programs.  And by the time I got downstairs, I only had you know, maybe three or four courses that I could take.  And you had to take those.  So it wasn't really a choice that I had.  It was like--college--the college prep classes, you had to take you know, everything from trig[onometry] and calculus.  And you know, I took them all.  And whatever they were required, I did.  Now chemistry, that blew my mind.  I have to admit that.  I just couldn't get that one together. I took it in summer school.  And I would burn test tubes so they had to be thrown away.  You know, how you usually burn 'em a little bit and you could soak 'em?  When I burned them, they were thrown away.  I just--chemistry just didn't fit with me.  And that's part of the rationale I guess for not cooking.  I never could cook.  But (laughs) chemistry was just something that almost blew my mind.  I mean it was just--and the professor knew I studied but it just wouldn't get in there and stay.  It would just--just couldn't fit.  He knew I was trying. And he would work with me.  It just didn't happen.  So I got a C.  And that's all I needed (laughs).
Story_ID: 5650
Speaker 1: What did you think you wanted to be at this point in time?
Speaker 2: Sadly the only thing I knew to be was Della Street.  I wanted to be a Della Street to a Perry Mason.  I mean that's what I watched (chuckle). And remember in those days what you saw on TV was 'Amos and Andy'. I mean that was about it.  And so I loved 'Perry Mason'.  It never dawned on me 'til I actually got to college that I could be Perry Mason.  I had excellent secretarial skills.  The shorthand and, you know. I got the outstanding award for the highest grade in taking shorthand.  I think I might have been, I don't know. One-hundred words a minute or something.  I could type at eighty or ninety, in those days we had the manual typewriters.  We had one electric that you had to get an appointment and sign up to use.  And so I had excellent skills.  And it wasn't until I got to college that I realized that I could be something else. And remember I selected my college because the girl across the street was going.  I had no idea what courses Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] even offered. So I got there thinking I would take secretarial administration.  They had no such program (laughs).  So I got into marketing. And then found out  I fell in love with advertising.  But in those days, we weren't doing any advertising.  So I said, "Well let's see what else?  Marketing?"  And then if you majored in marketing in those days, you had to minor in economics.  Now economics I had about as much interest in as cancer and a heart attack.  It was just somethin' I just had to do.  And statistics almost forced me out of that school (laughs).  I never could get the hang of that slide rule.  I mean that--you know, it was precalculator days. Right?  That slide rule I mean I just couldn't figure that thing out.  It just--Howard humbled me.  And after my first semester of making very poor grades, I said, "Oh no. This is not gonna work."  And the next semester and thereafter, I maintained at least a three-point [3.0 grade point average] or above.  Because again this was--That first semester was not me.  It was this girl that was sixteen years old, first time really away from home and all these distractions.  And when my grades came in, I had never in life made grades like that.  And so that shocked me into reality.  And I also realized that this was a real expense.  'Cause I had no scholarships initially.  I didn't know anything about scholarships.  So I just went there, on a train, free.  And it was a challenge for me to figure out how to grow up, on a college campus by myself.  And I got through it. And I realized that I better study.  'Cause I gotta make something of myself. You know, that kind of thing.  But I loved getting away and doing those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So this was pretty exciting though. You're young. I mean you're sixteen right? So you're younger than most. I mean--
Speaker 2: When I think about it my niece is fifteen, you know. But--there were a few others that were even younger than me.
Speaker 1: And so you go there.  And so this is all, you know, there're men.
Speaker 2: Yes!
Speaker 1: (Laughs).
Speaker 2: Yes!
Speaker 1: And there were men (laughs).  There were--and this is a whole different sort of environment too.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  Absolutely.
Story_ID: 5651
Speaker 1: We were starting to talk about black society at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I didn't know anything about the brown bag test until I got there.  And you found that the leadership was primarily the students who were very fair.  The rogues tended to be those--we had a few beatniks on campus at that time.  They tended to be the darker skinned folks.  We didn't get a brown skin, not black, not even my color, but a brown-skinned homecoming queen until it was around I think it was '64 [1964]?  And that was Howard.  I mean that's the way it was then.  And one sorority attracted dark skinned individuals, another very light skinned individuals.  And that began to change as I was leaving.  But it was still very institutionalized.  It was our form of racism internally.
Story_ID: 5652
Speaker 1: So what was this whole Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--how did Howard form you and shape you?
Speaker 2: Well Howard really makes people or breaks them. That's still true from what I hear.  But if you can get through Howard, the rest of the world--in our judgment many of us as alumni talk about this--in those days, it seems as though they made everything hard.  It was--even registration was hard.  Getting to your counselors.  All those kinds of things made it very, very difficult.  So if you survived Howard, and certainly if you achieved at Howard, the rest of the world could not touch you.  They made--they used to say, "Howard made men out of you."  That included the women.  I mean, it was a little rough in some instances.  Again I didn't understand this thing about not going to class.  I mean they used to give you three cuts and, you know, you would be forced to drop the class.  Well I just thought you were supposed to go.  When I found out that you didn't have to go, whatever class there was where that three cut rule did not apply, I wouldn't go.  I mean it was--I learned things like, "Well,  just put on your housecoat"--oh no-- "Just put on your trench coat and go across campus to your class."  You still had your pajamas on underneath.  I did things there that I would never ever have done! And certainly never told my mom [Mary Louise Rice] or dad that I was doing.  It was a very different time. It made you grow up.  Because at some point you had to say, "Wait a minute.  They're doing this but I don't have to do this."  And it took a little while.  I mean at sixteen and coming out of St. Paul, Minnesota--I mean I didn't even know anything about jazz.  I mean I had heard it. But I didn't really know anything about it.  I got introduced to Ahmad Jamal at Howard.  I got introduced to drinking at Howard. And smoking at Howard.  Those days it was just cigarettes.  But it was--I learned something called French Inhale. I had no idea how--what you do with a cigarette. But you had to look poised.  And since I couldn't drink--You know, they told me to order bourbon and Coke.  That way you could keep adding the coke and people would think you're still drinking.  I mean those were the kinds of things I learned along with the academics.  As I said, the first semester was a wash.  I mean I didn't do any--I didn't learn anything productive that semester.  When I got those grades, I called my mother in tears.  Because some how I thought that even though I didn't study and didn't go to class, I still should have gotten As and Bs.  I don't know how that logic occurred.  But after that one semester, I said, "Oh no, no, no."  The second semester, every semester was a three-point [3.0 grade point average] and above.  'Cause I knew better.  But I had gotten over the shock of the reality of this first semester grade.  So I got--I managed to get through the system.  I had some wonderful friends.  And, you know, it was one of those things where again I think Howard added to that strength.  But it had to take me down a peg first.  And then I said, "Oh no."  And I became a much better person after that.
Story_ID: 5653
Speaker 1: Now with your friends are these some people that we might know today that were friends of yours then?
Speaker 2: Interestingly, very few.  You know, we sort of went our different directions. And one of the things about me which I do find annoying personally is that I don't hang on to people.  You were a part of this chapter in my life.  Now I'm on to another chapter.  So I may take one or two people from chapter to chapter but not many.  And the people that I call my friends now, I didn't know then.  Had no relationship with.  And even as I go from career change from career change.  Those people that I knew then in career one I rarely take to career two.  And I see people who they've got friends from elementary school.  That's not me.  They talk about, "Well, you know, this teacher was so and so."  I don't even hang onto those relationships.  The one individual at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] that I will always revere if you will was Dr. H. Naylor Fitzhugh.  Other than that, the rest of those folks.
Speaker 1: Now why did you revere him?
Speaker 2: Dr. Fitzhugh knew us.  We were business majors.  He knew that we were country kids released from our parents for the first time.  Often had no money.  And so he and his wife would invite us to the house for a meal.  A good home-cooked meal.  He had the patience of Job.  'Cause once we got the hang of this business stuff, we knew everything.  And this is the man who was the second African American to get a business degree from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  This man was bright.  He is--was known, he's deceased now.  He was known as "dean of black business."  Abe Venable, all those folks,  Tony Brown--they all give him credit for their careers.  It was Dr. Fitzhugh when he went to PepsiCo [Inc.] that kept Tony Brown on the air.  That was one of the things that he insisted on.  Dr. Fitzhugh cared.  He truly cared.  A lot of these folks get--you know, give that lip service.  "Oh yes children come on in. Let's talk."  He truly cared.  And he and his wife they had, I believe, three children at the time, integrated us into the family.  And so other than him, I don't remember a soul that I feel close to.  I kept in touch with him and we did a tribute to him one year. And I was a part of that.  Helped to plan it, you know, was--had a role in it, all of that.  But other than.  And that is one person up until he died that I felt really contributed to my academic life.  And, you know, when you think of those paths not taken, he offered to help me get into Harvard for the master's program. Didn't do it. The young lady who did go--she is now making so much money [laughs]!  But he was there for us.  He knew that I was smart and probably'd make it.  And he was gonna get me a scholarship.
Speaker 1: Now why do you think you did not do that?  Was it because you decided you didn't want to go into business?
Speaker 2: No, no I had a family.  I went to college for two years, dropped out for two, had a family.  And I was still married for the last two years.  It took me six years to get out of undergrad.  And--but he was always there.  And when I came back the second time, he said when I was about to graduate I was outstanding all kinds of places.  And he said, "I want you and another young lady to consider this."  Well she was also married. But her husband--they had no children at the time.  And her husband was--I believe he was in Texas. So she was also--she was already in a commuting marriage. So it was no big deal for her.  I was married to a person who was not interested in that kind of progress by his wife.  When I got my undergrad degree, he still hadn't gotten his.  And, you know, there's this--going back to my mom now and my father.  You know, you're in a marriage forever. Period.  It took me a long time--I was in law school before I figured that one out.  You got in it and you can get out of it (laughs).  And I was just in it.  And I didn't realize what was happening to me.  I would have felt, I think, guilty.  That's the personal side of me that I give a low grade to. I would have felt guilty leaving my husband and my child.  And when I ultimately decided to go to law school, that was when our marriage broke up.  Because I just had decided that I can do better than this.  And I was going to do it.  Well Fitzhugh saw that early on. But I couldn't get through that personal side that is the weaker side of me.  And so I didn't do it.  That was an opportunity that truly I lost.  Now I've done all right. But I just wish that I had done that.
Story_ID: 5654
Speaker 1: The other thing I wanna know because there's a lot of discussion about HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] versus--you know, other institutions. And there's a true sense of tradition a lot of times at HBCUs. And I'm wondering how you feel? You know, that you're a graduate of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and what that experience, you know, meant to you.  If it--
Speaker 2: Well you know, what the current president of Howard is doing, which I think is wonderful--we were also classmates back at Howard.  What Pat [H. Patrick] Swygert is doing is beginning to attract again the outstanding students from across the country.  I think Howard's student body was beginning to lose some of that.  One part--one thing about the end of segregation was that we could now go to these schools.  And these schools could often write check, virtually blank checks to attract the Rhodes Scholar.  The high school graduate who had a 4.3 on a four-point system. I mean that's what they were doing.  And Howard was losing some of that black intelligentsia if you will. So Dr. Swygert, Pat Swygert is now busy getting some of those students back to Howard.  But again Howard could make or break you.  The temptations, the fun, the parties can be very distracting if you're not focused and really grounded.  But many of the HBCUs now are falling on difficult challenging times. Because the faculty is not the same.  Remember those were the places that our intelligentsia went to teach and to study, to research.  Now those folks have options.  They're at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and Stanford [University, Stanford, California] . They're at [The University of] Oxford [Oxford, England].  They're at all these places.  And so they don't have to go to Howard or Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] or Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] or any of those schools any more.  And that difficulty, I think, that challenge is causing some of our schools to either close or be viewed as almost a junior college environment.
Story_ID: 5655
Speaker 1: Now what did your parents think of your marriage?
Speaker 2: Oh they were not happy.  But I was in love.  And in those days that was first.  Going back to my thought of being book-wise but personally foolish.  And we were married for eleven years, one child. And we ultimately divorced.  It just, you know. I was young and just thought this was the greatest thing.  He was an upperclassman.  Boy!  I mean had been born in--he was born in Miami [Florida] and was raised in New York [New York] in the big city!  Oh my! And his parents had a little money. That helped too.  But (laughs), you know, I was in love!  And that, you know, that overshadowed everything else.
Story_ID: 5656
Speaker 1: Now you graduated [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you know, in six years as you said. What was the time period between that and going to law school?
Speaker 2: Four years.  Again sometimes enlightenment comes late. And I was working at a government job.  And, you know, it just seemed like I'd look around me and I'd see all these people.  I'd say, "I'm smarter than them.  How come they're making more money than me?"  And that began to worry me.  It's like, "I know I can do better."  And I didn't know what I wanted to do. And at one point I went to work for Dr. Jeanne Sinkford at the College of Dentistry at Howard.  And some of those dentists I thought were not too bright.  I said, "I can do this!  I can do something!"  I really was gonna go to dental school.  And I decided no, no, no.  Too much blood and stuff.  And dentistry is viewed as the dirtiest profession because of all the stuff that's flying. And you're in somebody's mouth.  So I said, "Now what am I gonna do?"  I really didn't know.  I took a couple classes in social work.  I  said, "I'll be a social worker."  I didn't like that.  I took a course in education saying, "I'll be an educator."  I didn't like that.  And I really went through a process of elimination. Dental school was out, medical school was out, so what was left was law school.  And since I wanted to be Perry Mason's assistant, I had now decided that I was gonna be Perry Mason--ergo law school. And I loved it.
Story_ID: 5657
Speaker 1: I started [law school at the Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] in '68 [1968], right.  That September and I had been--Dr. [Jeanne] Sinkford who I was working for, when she realized I wanted--that I didn't want to be a dentist, she just--oh and she was another inspirational person by the way. But as an employer 'cause I was working for her.  But she had so many firsts behind her name.  I mean just first in this and first in that and--I mean big things like she was the first African American Woman to get a Ph.D. in Prosthodontics.  And all kinds of stuff.  And so she was an inspiration to me.  And when I got ready to go to law school, it was late and she called the dean.  And got me in and got me a small scholarship.  And I was absolutely enthralled but a little nervous 'cause I'm an old student now.  And all these kids in law school.  A lot of 'em were kids.  They were just out of undergrad school.  I had a husband and a child.  Many of them you know, were just starting to seriously date.  (Laughs) It was like ooh!  And the girls always looked so polished and I still had dishpan hands and chewed my nails.  And I got in there and loved it.  And once again I thought that I was you know, not gonna make this 'cause I asked too many questions.  And what I found out later was that they had the same questions but they wanted to appear to know everything.  And so once again I made great grades. I was on the law journal, which is the equivalent to the honors program at Howard in the law school.  And it just seemed like oh this is great!  I mean it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  I passed the bar.  I've done things that lawyers do even though I'm not practicing.  But it was like a profession that was waiting for me.  I never wanted to really practice anyway but to have the degree; to have the flexibility was again a professional coup for me.  My personal life was still a disaster but professionally it was fine.
Speaker 2: Right.  And you--so were you married--you got divorced during law school--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Yes I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The second year it was clear to me that if I wanted to succeed, but it was--I don't even know how to describe this, but my ex-husband agreed that I could go to law school.  As long as I got home in time for our daughter to get home from school.  So I rearranged my classes so I could be home.  But that still wasn't enough.  He wouldn't babysit.  So I had a little part-time job, which was against the rule.  You're not supposed to work.  And I would pay a babysitter while I had to go back to class or the library or whatever.  And he was not supportive.  And so my second year, I would--I had been--and I'd tell my--some of my female colleagues as the young--youngsters particularly I would get up in the middle of the night and go into the bathroom, put a towel under the door so the light didn't come out and I would study on the commode and a TV tray.  'Cause our apartment was small and where the light was on, you know, he could see it.  I was so determined to keep my marriage intact to do what a good wife should do.  That's going back to my mother [Mary Louise Rice].  Bless her heart. She gave me that feeling, that training too.  I was determined to keep this in track.  But what was happening was it was getting more and more difficult.  And I couldn't handle it all.  So I was getting stressed out.  And I had an accident.  An auto accident, when I ran into a back of a car because I had been up all night studying.  I had rushed home.  It was in the summer.  It was hot and I was rushing my daughter to get her allergy shots, which she had to have every week.  And ran into the back of this car.  I mean I don't even remember how it happened.  And that said to me that, "There was too much trauma in my life.  And I got to end some of this." And that's when I decided to begin to get ready for my divorce.  It was again traumatic for me.  Because, you know, men can sometime make you feel real small. They can question your self-esteem and make you question it.  And I was going through that.  And it wasn't 'til I really got through all of this that I decided, "Hey if I could do all this and still make those grades, still be a part of law journal, what could I do if I didn't have all this?"  And that was--that was my decision.  I'm out of this.  So it was traumatic 'cause it was against a real precept for me that you're supposed to stay married forever.
Speaker 2: Now what--who was helping you take care of your daughter then?
Speaker 1: While I was in--while I was in law school?
Speaker 2: Well she was in school.  She was--she was born in 1960 so she was in school.  And I would--you know, in Howard like most law schools, you're tracked.  You're in this track or that track.  And you take the classes as they're laid out.  Well I got permission to take a couple classes in the other track, which was almost unheard of.  Because I had to be home.  'Cause he said I had to be home.  And because he--if he didn't eat by six, he would turn into a frog.  So I had to get home, get her, do homework, get dinner ready.  While I'm in the kitchen, she's at the table doing her homework.  "And what did you do today baby?  How did it go?"  And doing all those motherly things.  Then after everybody was settled, and everybody had gone to bed, then I would study.  So this was getting to be a little much.  Being the super wife, the super mom and super student.  And I was kind of running out of space. And when I hit that car, and I have this little scar here to prove it, you know, it was like, "Ooh! I'm going to kill myself doing this."  So I said, "Oh no this has to stop."  'Cause I had--I was not suicidal.  So I had to figure out what do I have to do to make this work for me?  This was the last year in law school.  You know, law school is three years.  And so I talked to my mother about it. And my daughter went to live with my mother that last year.  And I got a divorce and I was on my own and had a law school roommate.  She finished the same time I did.  And after she left, I had the apartment so my daughter moved in with me.  And you know, it was--it was tough.  It was really tough.
Speaker 1: So now were there any teachers there that influenced you? Or any, you know, part of the law that you were attracted to, more than anything else?
Speaker 2: Well one of my teachers was--she's now deceased. But she had gotten her divorce in law school.  'Cause I was traumatized.  I didn't know. "What am I gonna do?  How am I gonna make this work?"  And so she talked to me.  And she said, "You know, I did the same thing."  And she in essence helped me out.  She had a bedroom suite in her garage that she was waiting for the Salvation Army to come and pick up.  So she said, "You can have it."  So then I had a bedroom suit.  In the living room she had these little--two little sofas with the little back cushions?  She gave me those.  And those--that was my living room stuff.  So in that sense I started with nothing.  And with the support of a lot of people, individually, she was one of those that was there, and held my hand.  'Cause again I'm going against one of my big principles.  You're supposed to be married forever.  And I wasn't.
Story_ID: 5658
Speaker 1: Now so you graduate.  So what happens at this point?
Speaker 2: 1971, I graduated. I passed the bar. I  was working at the Internal Revenue [Service] as a tax attorney.  And the reason I went into taxation was because somewhere instinctively there was this notion of helping people.  And the tax law is used to encourage or discourage behavior.  It's also used for redistribution of the income or the wealth.  And I was maybe a fledgling socialist.  I'm not sure.  But you know, I thought that this would be the way to really help black folks, poor folks.  And we're seeing a lot of that today with things like the earned income tax credit or this new [President George W.] Bush proposal to again refund some of the monies to low income tax payers.  All of that is a part of that scheme.  And people don't realize that the tax system is--a lot of it is based on individual needs.  Some lobbyists or some company said, "I need this kind of provision so I don't have to pay taxes".  And it's written in.  It encourages behavior by allowing you, for example, to deduct your interest on your home.  It encourages you to buy a house.  If you think about it, if that interest was not there and tax deductible, would you want a house and a yard and all that trouble?  It discourages behavior by raising the tax on liquor or cigarettes.  Make you smoke less.  Yes it's all income generating. But it also encourages and/or discourages behavior.  It encourages you to give to charities by allowing you to deduct your contributions from your taxes.  So a lot of that is there.  And I was gonna expand it to save my people.  I hated that job (laughs).  It was the worst job I ever had!  And so it wasn't as grandiose as I had thought. And so what I decided to do was when I got my promotion, I had my letter of resignation ready.  And when the ink dried on my promotion papers, I was out of there.  I worked there for twelve months.  And it was the thirteenth month; the beginning of the thirteenth month that I decided, "This is not the place for me."  I've never been crazy about bureaucracies.  They--they're just too slow.  And so I learned a valuable lesson.  And I went to work for a former classmate of my husband's.  My ex-husband at that time, who had his own law firm--had his own consulting firm.  So I went to work for him for about a year or two.  And then went to the [National] Urban League.
Story_ID: 5659
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got with the Urban League and this is the National Urban League Office. Right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so what was your role there?
Speaker 2: I was--I started out [in 1973] as assistant director for federal programs.  I was hired by the late Ron Brown  And I worked with Ron for seven years until he decided to leave and go work for [Senator Edward] Kennedy [in 1979].  The Kennedy campaign. And I succeeded him as vice-president.  Was appointed by Vernon Jordan [Executive Director of the National Urban League 1972-1981], from his hospital bed no less.  So it was kind of an interesting period. That was right after Vernon had been shot that this happened. He made the appointment.  But, you know, it was--Ron was a wonderful person to work for.  And he's someone when you talk about people that you'll always remember, he's one. And clearly it wasn't because of what he did at [the U.S. Department of] Commerce.  It's what I learned from him in those seven years when I worked for him directly.  But had a very interesting career.  I worked for some exciting people.
Speaker 1: But tell me--So what was the experience?  What did you like about the Urban League?
Speaker 2: One, it wasn't a bureaucracy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And this is a time--the Urban League is very vibrant at this time--Too.  Right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So tell us some of the things that you were involved in and, you know, initiatives that you were involved in there.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well working under Ron--initially I came there in my tax background.  I worked on the revenue sharing programs that [President Richard] Nixon had proposed. And I would go to different cities.  Urban League cities to talk about those programs.  Talk about the tax implication.  To talk about what people could do to get the best benefit out of the program, out of the legislation for their constituents.  I did a lot of that.  But I also got the energy issue. At that time, we were also beginning to get the--had the [gasoline] shortages.  And I was the black expert on energy for our folks.  And things like, for example, we weren't lobbying, we were educating.  When the proposals were to close government buildings at night or after a certain time, we lobbied against that.  We educated against that by letting folks know who worked at night.  It was a single mom who had four or five children.  She would get home in time to get her children to school.  And then she would go to sleep and get up when they got home and then she'd go to her night job.  A lot of those people were also using this as their second job.  To make ends meet and stay off welfare and public assistance.  So those were exciting activities. To tell decision-makers, "Look if you do this, these are the implications."  The other thing that I learned to do under Ron was to give testimony on the [Capitol] Hill [Washington, D.C.].  The thought of going up there and testifying before Congress was terrifying.  I mean Ron would just, "What's the problem?  You know, you speak before groups.  You represent the League.  Why can't you go up there and read this testimony?"  I said, "Well Ron, these are elected officials from all over the--"  "Do it."  And I did it.  And I was shaking so badly at the first time, it wasn't--No one knew it but me.  I was so terrified.  And it went over so well.  I said, "Oh!  I can do this" (laughs).  So Ron and I--I did the [U.S.] House [of Representatives] and he did the [U.S.] Senate.  It worked out well.  I learned a lot from him. And he was one of those men who--You know, if you could do this, you did it!  He didn't stand over your shoulder.  He didn't micro-manage.  And when he was gone, the world's gonna find this out now. I would just write all these letters for him and sign his name.  I was pretty good at that.  I would sign his name and send them out. And he'd come back and I'd say, "Ron this is what you did while you were gone." And I'd show him. He's fine with it.  We had a great working relationship.  And, you know, he'd just--I learned and I grew so much under him.  'Cause I knew nothing about a Washington office.  As a matter of fact, I didn't go looking for a job.  A young lady who was there, who I had known said there was a vacancy. And she said, "You wanna come over and apply?"  I said, "Well what the heck.  Okay."  Didn't have any notion of leaving where I was. At the time, that was the law firm.  And I said, "Well Ron, in order to come over here, I'll need this."  He said, "Okay." And I said, "I'll need that."  "Okay."  And everything I put on the table he said yes to, there was no reason not to come.  And so I did.  And I loved it.  He's a wonderful person to work with and for.  But those days--I mean when he left to go work for Kennedy, then I was in charge.  And I did a couple things. And Ron called me and he said, "How come you didn't do these things when you were working for me?"  I said, "Well Ron I did what I thought you wanted me to do.  And the few things I recommended we did."  I said, "But I'm in charge now. So I have all these ideas."  Anyway he was wonderful.  And a great sense of humor.  I mean have you laughs.  And he was just charismatic.  All those things that they wrote about him were true.  That is that he could get people's attention and make them do the things that he wanted them to do.
Speaker 2: Now what--do you remember any specific thing that the two of you worked on that you were particularly proud of? Or you know. It was--sort of an anecdotal story?
Speaker 1: I guess--I hate to say this 'cause it sounds so silly.  I just loved coming to work everyday.  The issues that we worked on ranged from everything from racism to economic rights and civil rights.  And when his daughter [Tracey Brown] wrote the book ['The Life and Times of Ron Brown'], she asked me the same thing.  That, "What do you remember most?"  And I couldn't remember anything that was really memorable.  It was such a wonderful time to be working with him.  He let me represent the League in so many exciting places. To speak for the League in so many exciting places.  I couldn't remember one thing that really like shot out.  I remember him working aggressively and me behind the scenes when he was trying to get the Congress to abide by the civil rights legislation that everybody else had to abide by. 'Cause they were exempt.  I remember him working on all kinds of issues with women's groups.  And we were one of the few groups initially that joined the women's groups on things like you know, choice and constitutional amendments.  All those kinds of things. We were there.  I mean everything that we did was always was new and I want to say exciting.
Story_ID: 5660
Speaker 1: You really matured professionally during that time--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Because--okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And I mention these different individuals. Every one of them helped me grow tremendously.  Ron did. Then I went to work for Marion Barry.  There was tremendous opportunity to grow there.  That was the first time I really and truly headed something at the local level.  The [National] Urban League at that time was a national.  You know, it was legislative recommendations and changes and all of that.  When I went to work for Marion Barry, there were people that I touched.  And I headed the office of Human Rights and then Office of Minority Business and then Chief of Staff.  Again lots of growth.  I mean I had an agency with a budget.  I had to go on the Hill and testify for my budget, testify before a City Council.  It was just a whole new thing for me.  But it wasn't as hard because Ron Brown had made me testify before the Congress.  And these folks were not as scary as the Congress was initially.
Speaker 1: Now when you--tell us about the Urban League at that point in time though under Vernon Jordan's leadership.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: What was--what kind of institution was it? And--
Speaker 2: Well it was not only--to me the Urban League at that time was yes, very dynamic.  No one can touch or light a candle to Vernon Jordan's charisma.  His ability to relate to folks Republicans and Democrats.  I mean that was him.  And but more important it wasn't just the Urban League, it was the country.  At that point in time, the country was interested in equal rights and equal opportunity. The visible signs of slavery, the visible signs of segregation were still there.  And so everybody wanted to kind of do well and make things change.  And so we were part of that exciting movement.  The country began to change when Vernon left frankly.  I mean he left at that point in time.  And so the willingness, the resources, the congressional support from both sides of the isle just started to dwindle.  And so the Urban League while still doing much of what it had been doing before, was doing a lot of it with a lot less.  The visibility had decreased.
Story_ID: 5661
Speaker 1: Talk about the circumstances of him [Vernon Jordan] getting shot.  What--can you tell that whole story?
Speaker 2: Well Vernon traveled to a lot of [National] Urban League cities like most presidents did.  And I--even at that time I traveled to a lot of cities.  This was a dinner in Fort Wayne [Indiana] where he was the speaker.  And afterwards--at least I have never heard anything other than this. Afterwards apparently one of the board members invited him to her home.  And she was a white female.  And unbeknownst to us, he'd been stalked by this racist [Joseph Paul Franklin].  And upon returning to the hotel, the gentleman was waiting.  And he shot Vernon with a--those dumb-dumb bullets that are supposed to explode and you're history.  And the doctor said that it didn't explode the way it should have.  Also because Vernon was in such good physical condition, he was able to ultimately pull through.  But, you know, to see him lying there with all these tubes and looking so weak, it's like, "Ooh!"  That was a hard thing for us to really take.  But it was from his hospital bed we all--a conference was coming.  A national conference. And we all were in New York, the Urban League presidents.  And our meeting with him was in the hospital auditorium.  And he came out walking slowly.  I mean the men were crying.  It was like--it's like watching a huge elm being knocked down.  It was like, "Ooh!"  And it was a moving moment.  And I had been acting vice-president.  And when Ron had gone, I had near forgot the appointment until then.  So it was like, "Wow it's time."  And that made it even more memorable to me.  But, you know the charisma, the way he responded to people.  You know, there's--I don't know if there's anybody like it in this country.
Speaker 1: Now did he--then was that sort of the end of it with him and the Urban League?  Because he got shot? Or was it--I mean was he fearful--I'm just--.
Speaker 2: Well I don't know.  I mean a lot of people have speculated.  But he had said consistently that he believes ten years is enough.  Once you go beyond ten years, the institution becomes you. And that's pure death for the institution.  Whitney [Young] had died prematurely but the word was that he was gonna leave.  'Cause it was his tenth year.  And that's how Vernon felt.  And he's gone on to different places and different times and he doesn't stay.  I mean when he left there and went to Akin Gump [Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP], that was great and he was there.  And now he's at a Wall Street [New York, New York] investment firm.  So, you know, there's some--something about him that doesn't want to stay too long.  And that he says, "Ten years is enough."
Story_ID: 5662
Speaker 1: How did you come to work for Marion Barry's administration?  And this was his third--it was his third?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was his third [term as Mayor of Washington, D.C.].  The third administration. I actually got a call.  My office at the time was across the street from the district building.  And one of--his chief of staff at the time called me and said, "You know, we want to talk to you about a position." So I said, "Well what is it?"  And he told me, "Director of the D.C. Office of Human Rights."  And I said, "Well, you know, I'm really not looking to leave.  But, you know, what is it gonna be about?"  Well the money wasn't right.  The reporting to the mayor wasn't right.  Nothing was right.  So I told him, "No."  Then I get a call from another person who--a female who was much more persuasive. And she talks about it again.  I said, "Well let me think about it."  And finally I still didn't--I wasn't rushing. And I'd gone to New Orleans [Louisiana] for the National [Urban League] Conference.  And I got a call in New Orleans from the mayor.  Now Vernon Jordan, Ron Brown and Marion Barry. They are three people who--you have "no" in your head.  But by the time you get through with them, it's a "yes".  And so after I talked to him, I said, "Well it sounds good.  I'll tell you what.  When I get back from the conference, if you and I could sit down and talk and I'll have some more questions, and then we can make a decision."  So I met with him.  And to be very honest, I asked him, I said, "You know, you're an elected official.  How serious are you about civil rights enforcement?"  And he said, "I'm very serious."  I  said, "You'll back me when I go out and, you know, one of the people that's being sued is a big supporter?"  He said, "Absolutely."  And so I said, "Okay well we'll see."  And I thought about it.  And I thought about it. And finally I said, "Yes."  'Cause I was--you know, at  the national office, you're pushing paper.  You're talking to people to try to make things work for somebody down here.  There, you're doing some of that.  But you're working with the folks right down there.  You see the defendants coming in.  You see the plaintiffs coming in.  So it was a real different environment.  I said, "Okay I'll try this."  And one of the first questions I was asked in my confirmation hearing was "Don't you think this is a step down?  To come from the national office to a local state office?"  And I explained to her just what I have said.  That is that I want to see the folks that I'm talking about.  And it was a great opportunity for me.  Another one where I was in charge of this agency.  And I had to, you know, develop the budget and defend the budget.  And I had all this staff to take care of.  And all these rules to follow.  Personnel rules.  It was very different.  Very different.  And I came in there--'cause I was brought in because the agency was in trouble.  The agency was in the newspaper all the time,  in a negative light.  When Marion Barry would go out to make a stump speech, the first question out of the press' mouth would be, "What about the backlog of human rights?  What about this complaint?"  And it was always negative.  And so my goal was to stop that. And I did.  But I was gonna do it also by getting rid of a lot of people.  I call it dead weight.  Well what I didn't know was about D.C. personnel rules.  So I walked in there with all these goals (laughs) and the personnel rules slapped me in the face.  And a lot of the folks I wanted to get rid of knew the rules, and I didn't.  So it was like, "How am I gonna really make this work?"  And I plotted through and you know, kind of wore myself into bad health trying to fix this mess.  I would go home at night with a suitcase full of cases that I was reviewing.  I'd come back in the morning and they had been reviewed.  I just--I wanted to do it all and I wanted to do it quickly.  And I made sure that I met with everybody so once I got in there, there was never another negative story about that office.  Whatever the reporters tried to make into a story, I managed to explain it or talk about the methodology for fixing it to make sure it wouldn't happen again.  So that office became literally a positive experience.  And to his word, Marion Barry allowed me--again I use those terms allowed to run that agency.  And even when I was out there suing if you will, some of his friends he just said, "What's the story?"  And I would tell him what the deal was.  And one of the big cases I had was the cornrow case.  I guess the J. W. Marriott [Hotel].  That hotel had had the highest percentage of minority participation of any structure in the city.  But they fired this girl 'cause she had cornrows.  And they weren't exaggerated, they weren't you know, the kind of thing if you even looked at twice.  It was cornrows in a little flip at the bottom.  She looked very nice.  Plus she wasn't even in front of the public.  She was in a back room working.  Bottom line was that we sued them.  And they resisted.  And then I went to the ABC [Alcohol Beverage Control] Board.  The alcohol, tobacco licenses issuing part of the city and told them what was going on.  And they sent 'em a letter saying we're gonna pull your license until this is resolved.  A hotel or a lounge without a liquor license is dead.  And so they capitulated.  And the young lady was brought back in and a nice settlement was made undisclosed.  And we had a similar case with the Hyatt [Hotel]. The hotels came back and said, "Okay we're gonna do this.  We don't want to go through what the Marriott went through."  And they stopped that.  It was just a kind of a strange thing.  Again personal appearance discrimination is against the law in the district.  And so we won those kinds of cases.  And he didn't, you know, demand that we stop.  He didn't put any pressure on me.  And he got pressured when Georgetown University [Washington, D.C.] wanted a major bond issuance.  And we had found that they were discriminating against the gay students.  And so we would not sign--I had--one of my office's responsibilities was to sign off on these bond issuances to say that this entity does not discriminate.  I couldn't sign it.  And we're talking about maybe $150 million.  And boy he got calls from [U.S.] Congress, from alumni that were famous, governors, assistants to the governors.  All these alumni.  He had so much pressure on him.  And we had a meeting and I asked, "What do you want me to do?  I mean the law is real clear.  There's a right to the bond issuance but there's no right to discriminate.  Therefore, I cannot sign this."  And it took them a while before they realized that no amount of pressure on him was gonna be put on me.  And one of the things that the university learned, there had been a meeting with me and the university folks for about an hour.  And there were only two people in the meeting other than the E.O. [Equal Opportunity] Representative.  And--Father's Day. Within an hour of that meeting, after they left, we were getting a call from the gay community saying--
Story_ID: 5663
Speaker 1: You were saying--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] The [Georgetown] University [Washington, D.C.] representatives were there.  And within an hour after they left, I got calls from the gay community thanking me and saying thank you for hanging in there and being tough and not giving in despite all this pressure.  But what that meant to me was that somebody in the meeting had left there and gone and told other members of the gay community what the meeting was about and what the outcome had been.  And so I called the university officials and said, "This is what's gonna make your job really hard.  'Cause you will never know who in that room is either gay or friends of gays or whatever.  And they're going back and telling them exactly what you're saying.  And some of the things that you're saying are being repeated and being repeated in public. So you need to be really careful.  But also know how difficult it's going to be to process this case."  I don't know what happened with that.
Speaker 1: Well you can talk about the [Thomas] 'Tip' O'Neill, was that surprising?
Speaker 2: I don't know if that's this part or the other part.  The pressure that the Mayor [Marion Barry] was receiving from Georgetown graduates was coming from all sources.  And sometimes the alumni were calling their representatives and others from across the country.  I mean we even got calls from Tip O'Neill.  "What's going on here?"  The mayor was under tremendous pressure.  But not once did Marion Barry ever tell me to back off.
Story_ID: 5664
Speaker 1: The other thing you had talked about was what you did to clean up the office.  You can just do a shortened version of that.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know, you talked about the process.
Speaker 2: When I first took over the [Washington] D.C. Office of Human Rights, it was such a disaster.  Major news stories embarrassments to the mayor every time he was out in the stump.  So my goal was to make that nothing but positive programs coming out of that agency.  And so I went about the business of just finding out where the cases were, bringing some order to that process and telling people that if they couldn't serve the public, they had to go.  And that was the bottom line.  And they realized I was serious.  And one of the things a woman told me, which I found strange, she says, "Well, you know, some of these people believe that they're part of the B Team."  I said, "What do you mean the B Team?" She says, "Well, they be here when you get here, they be here while you here and they be here when you're gone."  I said, "Really!"  And so that was the first time I had ever heard that expression.  And what that meant was one of the women said, "I've been here for four administrators.  So this is nothing new."  And I said, "This gonna be something new now or you're gonna be gone."  So I learned about the B Team from that office.  They were serious.  I got threatening letters.  I got threatening calls.  It was just--it was an awful process for a while.  And there had been fights.  I was told that two women had got into a knife fight.  You know, they were still in the agency.  I was told that there had been, you know, folks had called each other outside to fight.  Just strange things.  That--I had never even heard of this.  The notion of somebody fighting on a job that I was responsible for was just foreign to me. That was Swahili.  I was not going to have any of that.  So I started all kinds of rules and sent out memos and tiptoed behind people that were sleeping on the job and scared 'em by tapping on the shoulder, on the head or whatever.  I just did what I thought would make that job work.  And ran myself into bad health.  Wound up in the hospital for a couple days.  But I was determined to make this thing work.  And when I got through, I mean people were sending letters.  And the lawyers were sending letters.  They were proud of the process, glad to have it working.  And the mayor got only positive things after that.  If there was something that was difficult, I had a way of explaining it and what we were gonna do to change it.  So it was a real growing experience for me.  My first time really heading up a rather difficult agency.
Speaker 1: Now you talked about also--I just like the story about the woman who wrote the letter.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I got a letter that was sent with all this postage on it but they sent about twenty of 'em to different staff members.  And so when I got my letter, rather than being frightened by it, I took the letter and edited it.  Because one of the things that I had been disturbed about by my staff was their poor writing qualities. So I edited the letter with a red pen.  I mean this letter looked like it was bleeding.  And I put it upon the bulletin board. And I also put the envelope on there saying that this person didn't--spent all this money, they were not smart enough to know how much postage they should've put on the envelope.  So again I let people know I wasn't afraid of this.  I ridiculed the person.  And pointed out their shortcomings.  And it worked for me.  I never got any more of those kind of letters.
Speaker 1: Now you said then the mayor [Marion Barry] put you in charge of both.
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: You know you were--or that was your idea.
Speaker 2: Well he wanted me to take over [the Washington, D.C.] Minority Business [Opportunity Commission].  And I said to him, "I really didn't want to do that," 'cause I thought the offices were in conflict number one.  Had--minority business office had a 35 percent contracting requirement.  [Office of] Human Rights had a 25 percent requirement.  That was in conflict.  So I said that you need to bring 'em together.  You need to change that conflict.  Because I believe that both were based out of and a part of the whole affirmative action human rights process.  And he--I convinced him and he agreed.  And that's what we did.  But also the Minority Business Office was created as an executive order.  The Human Rights Act was a statute.  The statute had gone all the way up to the court of appeals because of all that it required.  And it had passed muster.  And I said to him, I said, "You know any mayor with a pen get rid of the Human--the Minority Business function."  Now of course we didn't need a pen. We got the [U.S.] Supreme Court decisions, which have said that minority or race cannot be used as a factor in these contract.  But the Human Rights Act is still standing with its minority requirements.  So I thought I was right and I convinced him. And my job was to bring the two offices together.  But before I could complete that process, he asked me to become chief of staff.
Story_ID: 5665
Speaker 1: So how did that--tell us about how that evening came--the meeting that you had.
Speaker 2: Oh that was scary.  Actually I was at the office and some staff and I had gone downstairs.  There was a restaurant in the Reeve Center [Washington, D.C.].  And we were in the restaurant.  And I get this call from--you know, a staff member comes running out.  "Marion Barry wants you!"  "Oh Lord what have I done?"  I thought maybe I'd, you know, ticked off another big supporter or something.  And so I, you know, went upstairs and took the call.  And he wanted to have dinner.  Well I had been with the mayor's office maybe seven or eight years.  I'd never had dinner with the mayor.  So I knew I was in trouble.  He was gonna take me to dinner and fire me.  I just knew this was gonna happen.  So we went to dinner and I'm sitting there trying to eat this food, which is stuck right here.  It was not going down anywhere.  And I--you know, he's just sort of chatting and--and I said, "You know, get to it! What is the issue here?  Am I fired?  Am I gonna have to go and move out of my house?"  And he says, "Well, you know, what do you plan to do next?"  I said, "Well Mr. Mayor, to be very candid, when this term is over, I really would like to go and do something else outside of the government."  And he was kind of surprised I guess.  But he says, "Well I need a chief of staff."  And again I'm--the food is still right here.  Now it's really backing up.  I said, "Okay."  You know. Waiting for--"You know, you need one so what?"  And he said, "And your name keeps coming up."  And I'm, "Who in the world is doing this to me raising my name?"  And so he said, "I wanna offer you the position."  So I couldn't think of any--I said, "Well what exactly does the position entail?"  And we talked about it.  I said, "Well let me think about it."  And I tried to get this food to go down (laughs).  And I went home.  I called my father.  He was then alive.  And I told Daddy what it was about.  And I thought my father would say no 'cause he was no fan of Marion Barry's.  He said, "You need to take it.  He needs help."  Okay?  I call my minister.  And he said well--my minister initially said, "No don't do this."  'Cause that was the time when the administrations' reputation was in the papers every day.  And my minister being closer to it than my father was saying, "Well you know, you have to be careful that this doesn't come back on you."  And then the next morning he called me.  He said, "You know, I was shaving this morning.  And this particular Bible verse kept coming to me."  And whatever it was I can't remember the time.  But to him it meant I needed to do this.  So the people that were closest to me at the time said do it.  And so I called the mayor and told him, "Okay I accept."  Then the mayor took forever to finalize the appointment.  So I called him back and said, "Look Mr. Mayor if you want me to do this, you better make the appointment.  'Cause otherwise I--you know, there won't be enough time.  And I need to move on."  So he announced the appointment and I took the job.  And again I'm a little smart.  So I figure this out.  A bad reputation in the office, bad stuff happening all the time.  So I managed to do this thing where--you know, the building--the old district building looked awful. When you walked in, it was dusty.  There were spider webs.  The chandelier, most of the light bulbs were out.  So I got some folks in there to clean up the hall. I bought some plants.  I had flags posted.  I mean--so the ['New York] Times,' the 'Washington Times' did this article on me.  And it said, "Chief of Staff cleans up City Hall."  And what it meant was I actually got somebody in there to dust, to wax, to put in light bulbs.  I cleaned it up literally. And every morning I would come in early.  And I'd say, "Wait a minute.  You know, you didn't--call maintenance.  Tell 'em to git down here."  To me that entrance was so non-indicative of a office of a mayor of a major urban center--city.  So I stayed on folks. I had to have a memo of understanding between Public Works and General Services.  Because one was responsible for dusting.  The other was responsible for light bulbs.  My thing was, "While you're up on that ladder dusting that chandelier, you can't put a light bulb in?"  Those kinds of things always boggled my mind.  I mean I tell one person to go and clean up the place and that person also puts in the light bulbs.  What is this bifurcated responsibility?  So you know, I hired somebody a minority vendor who had plants.  Her role was to come in every day and make sure these plants were pretty.  When you walked into City Hall, the floors were clean.  The courts made us turn it into a homeless shelter for women at night and that was a mess.  But I didn't care.  The next morning that cleaning staff had to be in there to clean up that hallway.  "We can't do that.  Don't you see all this?"  "That is not my issue.  This is the hallway for the City Hall.  You clean this up."  And I had little tiffs with those folks but finally they got the message I was not gonna let up.  If they wanted to keep those jobs, then they had to clean up that entrance to the building.  And I was--I wanted people to know I was there too.  And this was a way of saying that.  Something different is happening here.  I mean the floors were waxed and shiny.  And after a while, the guys got the hang of it.  I'd walk in the door.  There was a security station where you put your bags through.  They had a piece of paper taped on the security belt saying, "Place your bags flat on the surface."  I said, "You walk in here in the mayor's office and there's a piece of paper up there?  DPW [Department of Public Works] made signs.  They made license tags.  You know, got them made.  "So why can't they do a sign that says this?  "Stop.  Place bags--" Nice little pretty signs put up there.  It took a couple weeks to get 'em out of DPW, Department of Public Works.  But I did all those things to say, "This is a new day.  And people must care."  Because this is the image of the mayor, which was pretty tarnished.  But at least this part doesn't have to be tarnished.  So I did things like that. And tried to keep, you know, chin up. 'Cause the papers were giving us a really rough time.
Story_ID: 5666
Speaker 1: What were they [newspapers] saying?  That he [Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry] needed to go?  That he had gotten too--
Speaker 2: Well it was all of the above.  Anything they could think of to say.  And in every story they repeated yesterday's story.  It got to be old news repeated constantly.  It was like the Chinese water torture. At first it's nothing.  But then after a while, you feel the pain of those drops. And that's what we were feeling.  We were under siege.  And all the agency heads were trying to get good stories out.  But the papers only wanted the bad stories.  So the allegations of drug use, the allegation of womanizing, all of the negative things were coming out.  Not--and negative stories about the agencies.  Nothing an agency'd do that was positive would ever get any press.  I mean it was just hard.  And, you know, I was there when he was arrested.  And that was the most difficult period for us.
Speaker 1: So talk about that.
Speaker 2: Well I had a habit of working late.  And this reporter had called. Tom Sherwood [from the 'Washington Post'] as a matter of fact. Tom Sherwood had been one of the reporters who had covered the mayor assidously.  And Tom Sherwood called me at the office that evening to say, "Look, tomorrow--" which was a Saturday.  He said, "I want to reserve a camera and a cameraman.  You need to get to the mayor to find out whether or not he'll do a standup interview with me."  'Cause the mayor was gonna announce his fourth term that day.  And so I said, "Well let me find out."  So I called the mayor in the car, got the security to get him on the phone.  Well he was in the homesteading program giving away houses for a dollar.  You know, that kind of program.  And so when he got back to the car, he didn't call me.  And I called security. And they said, "Well we gave him the message but now he's gone onto something else."  I said, "Something else!  He was scheduled to go home."  I didn't know until all this broke that at the top of the tape that you saw the mayor, when he's on the phone, he's talking to me.  And he's saying that he cannot do this.  Or he couldn't decide now. He'd talk to me later.  And just--so Tom Sherwood never got an answer.  And I went home.  And I got home and I was sitting on the side of the bed, you know, taking the shoes off slowly.  And I get this call from Emergency Preparedness.  And they say, "We believe the mayor has been arrested."  And so I'm going, "What?"  You know, you look at the phone like, "Am I sleep?  Is this another--Is this a dream?"  So I said, "What do you mean?"  "Well we're not sure but we think the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] had a sting and they got him."  So I rush back to Emergency Preparedness and we all meet at the Emergency Office.  And everybody is sitting there.  We're going through this thing.  The City Administrator Carol Thompson [Cole] is there and Sam Jordan, all the folks from FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency]. And we're trying to figure out--and deputy mayors and we're trying to figure out, "Well what are we gonna do now?"  And I said, "By the way has anybody called Mrs. [Effi] Barry?"  And the answer was, "No.  Why don't you do it?"  I said, "Oh--" something expletive.  And so I said, "Well okay.  I'm the Chief of Staff I'm, you know, just--I think this is part of my job."  So I called her and told her.  I said, "Mrs. Barry we're not sure but we think that the Mayor has been arrested."  And I never told anybody.  The folks in that room knew.  I never told anybody that I called her.  She did an interview with the 'New York Times.'  And she told them that I had called her. But people wanted to know what she said. And I said, "That--I'm taking that to the grave.  I'm not writing a book."  But the point is that that was a scary time.  Some of the staff in the mayor's office had to have, you know, psychiatric counseling.  It was really a scary time.  And I'm sort of riding along. It's just one more challenge that we have to deal with.  And people kept saying, "You're holding up so well."  "Why are you saying that to me?  I haven't done anything.  You know, this is part of the job.  I didn't ask for it.  I didn't want it but it has happened. And so when things happen, you do your best to resolve it."  And to this day I tell people that the phone stopped ringing. The very next day not a call.  All these folks that were you know, messages would stack up to here, no one called.  And every now and then I would pick up the phone to see, you know, what's going on.  The phones were working.  And so when you hear people talk about politics, what this says to you is that, "Politics is for the moment.  And as long as you're in the office, as long as you can hand out, you know, the wealth if you will, as long as you can do favors, you're in power.  But once folks think that power is not there, they're through with you."  And I was absolutely amazed at how many people dumped him.  And I thought that was just absolutely incredible.  My own persona says, "You don't do that.  If you're there when the person is up, then you're also there when they're down."  And a lot of those folks who had gotten so many things out of the government, as a result of the mayor's, you know, help--I had some real, real disdain for those folks.  And to this day I don't really talk to them a lot.  And I just feel as though the mayor got, you know. Whatever the things that he did to himself, there was never any evidence of criminal behavior, there was never any evidence to suggest that--I mean in terms of the city contracts and under the table dealings--but a lot of people around him were ruined.  And that's the way the system works.  They can't get you, they get the people all around you.  That's what they did with [President Bill] Clinton.  People around him fell like, you know, trees in a forest.  That happens to so many folks.  And the way the system deals with those individuals, "If you don't tell me what I want you to tell me, or if you don't say what I want you to say, then we'll get you.  'Cause we know this about you."  And it was--it was just a terrible time.
Speaker 1: So were you hurt as well?
Speaker 2: Emotionally yes.  Professionally no.  I think people say to me over and over again that, you know, "You managed to stay out of this."  But there was nothing to get into.  As far as I was concerned, I was a professional. I'm also a lawyer with bar certification.  I was not gonna risk all of that for anybody.  So clearly I knew what I had to do rightly or wrongly.  And the mayor knew.  I mean one of the things he use to say about me was, "Boy you are just too serious." Well maybe I am too serious but the--I'm serious about my professional life and my professional reputation.  And nothing I've done to this point in my life has sullied that.  I mean I'm not suggesting I've been perfect.  But I have not done anything to really sully my reputation as a professional.
Speaker 1: So how did--but you--you were sort of in between things a lot.  I mean this must have been a tremendous disappointment for you because you--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh sure!
Speaker 1: --had thought about whether you should take on the posi--you know, I mean you had been--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: You had counseled people.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Story_ID: 5667
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering even what your father and your minister said at that point. But, you know, this was--so how did you know. How did you handle that [the arrest of Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry]? And then weren't you handling the day-to-day things of government at this point too?
Speaker 2: I was more responsible for the mayor's office. There was a city administrator. That was Carol Thompson [Cole].  Carol Thompson was responsible for the agency and their activities.  So we understood that responsibility. But I did things like--I did the press conferences.  The press secretary just couldn't handle this.  His feeling was that, "You know, this is just too negative.  I'm not gonna do this.  I'm not gonna speak on this issue."  He left shortly thereafter.  Carol Thompson [Cole] would do some of them, but she was not as comfortable with the press. I--you know, all I could do was tell them what I knew. And I'd get these calls, "Well we heard the mayor's back in town."  I said, "Not to my knowledge."  And I think the mayor use to--was probably spreading these things himself [laughs].  'Cause he was down in Florida at the treatment facility.  But the point is that I managed to maintain my own professional reputation. Because again I hadn't done anything wrong.  I'm not a witness to anything.  In terms of trying to save the mayor from himself, the executive assistant and I used to do things. Like we'd look at certain telephone messages and we'd deep-six 'em.  We'd change his private line over and over again. And he'd give it out.  So, you know, when a person is bent on self-destruction at that point, you can do what you can do but no more.  And so I--that was my feeling about this.  He is doing too many things.  We would tell him to, "Stay off the phone in the car. 'Cause you don't need a wiretap to listen in."  And he wouldn't do it.  So, you know, you do what you can. But the feeling was that this was self-destructive behavior.  And he wasn't listening to us.  And it was just sad.  And it was traumatic.  It was emotionally draining.  But again it wasn't--I knew that I hadn't done anything.  So therefore I could only feel badly for him.  For his then wife Effi Barry.  And most importantly, for his son Christopher [Barry].  Those were the three people--the other two people in this that I felt most badly for.  And that night, calling her to tell her that he had been arrested--and we couldn't find him.  They had him. But we didn't know where they had him.  So we had the police chief trying to track him down.  And we didn't know whether they had taken him to an institution, whether he was riding around in a car. And they had taken him to some place. I don't even know where they had him.  But we found him at last.  And called Dr. Reed, Herb Reed to negotiate to get him out.  And it was just hell.  And, you know, it was painful.  It was very painful to see--like I had mentioned with Vernon Jordan to see a man who is so tall and so vibrant hooked up to all these wires and things.  I saw this man who I also thought was so vibrant being on this self-destruct path that had now led to a hole that he was falling into.  And to that extent, I really, really felt bad. But again I had to take care of that staff.  And one of those staff members was running up and down the hall screaming.  She just lost it.  I'm saying, (laughs) I know this--I'm laughing now but at the time I said, "What's wrong?  Why is this happening?"  She was so emotionally drawn.  Because what I didn't understand 'cause I had only been with him in that office for eighteen months. What I didn't understand was that a lot of these people had emotionally invested in the Marion Barry agenda for change.  They had put their heart and soul in loyalty to this individual.  And when he said, "I'm not doing anything wrong," they believed him.  Hook, line and sinker.  It's almost like [President Bill] Clinton again.  And as a matter of fact, a lot of people make comparisons between the two.  But when Clinton said, "I've done nothing wrong," people bought into that.  And when you buy into something so totally, then it becomes emotionally painful, and draining.  And sometimes taking you off the deep end, because what you believe in so thoroughly has been destroyed.
Speaker 1: Because I remember the picture or the--of his wife walking back and forth and the camera just showing her shadow. It was such--sort of eerie.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, picture.
Speaker 2: That same night when we tried to get Christopher out of the house, and we chose to come through the alley, the car was there waiting for him.  And he was under a blanket.  And there were all these cameras on this child! You know, it was like, "Ah!"  And Christopher was catching all kinds of stories and ridicule at the schools.  It was a traumatic time.  That's why I say I have so much empathy and sympathy for Effi Barry and Christopher Barry during this period.  More than I had for myself.  'Cause again, this was a job.  Even though I cared about what was going on, I cared about the city, it was still a job.  I wasn't the wife or the child of this man who was receiving all of this.  Christopher was having trouble in school because the kids would pick on him and he would fight.  It was just a difficult time.
Speaker 1: So now he was incarcerated for how many--was there a trial and then he was incarcerated?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.  And it was a misdemeanor. And I think he was there for, I wanna say it was about a year or a little less.  And then, you know. There was a big entourage to bring him back to D.C.  This--all through this, there were people who were loyal, who never left.  But they were not the folks that he really helped.  They were, you know, the folks.  And those that he helped with the entrepreneurial activities and--they were not there.  They just dumped him.  But there was this cadre of folks from the 'hood, as they say, who got on these buses and went down to welcome him back.  And those folks were loyal then, and they're loyal now.  And that's how he got to be mayor again.
Story_ID: 5668
Speaker 1: So now you--how long did you stay on at that point [after Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry's arrest and incarceration]?
Speaker 2: Well all this happened [in January, 1990] during my eighteen-month period. And I had said, I was gonna stay 'til the end of the year. That was my original conversation with him.  And so I left in December and his term was over in January during the swearing in of Sharon Pratt Kelly.  'Cause he didn't run.  People think that she defeated him--he didn't run again. I have to remind people of that. [However, after his release from prison, Barry ran in the 1992 mayoral election and won a fourth term.] But needless to say I left in December. Because this job at the [Greater Washington] Urban League [Washington, D.C.] was available.  And as a matter of fact, I had already begun to look for this job.  And I tell people, "You know, you may not believe in profound or spiritual occurrences. But I was at Betty Whaley's wake--or memorial service rather, when it suddenly dawned on me, out of the clear blue. 'Cause I had just gone to the wake to be respectful or to the services to be respectful that I could do this.  There was a vacancy at the Washington Urban League.  And again I believe in consulting people.  I called Vernon Jordan.  I called Ron Brown and I called Marion Barry and said, "I want to do this.  I want to go after this job."  And Marion Barry knew I was leaving.  Where I was going he didn't know.  And I didn't know.  But I knew I was not gonna spend another term--another year in government.  And they all said, "This is great.  Go after it."  And so I did.  And I believe in not pursuing a job and not telling your boss that you're looking.  Vernon Jordan used to make sure that you didn't do that. 'Cause if you did, you know, it got kiboshed (laughs).  That was true of Marion Barry too.  You don't go behind his back 'cause you don't know who he knows.  So I made sure that everybody knew that I was job hunting.  And--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Now when did the incident happen?  It happened when?  What was the date that it happened?
Speaker 2: Oh let's see. When was this?  Jeepers.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Was it in the spring?
Speaker 2: It was in the spring.  And I had about--No it was early fall.  And I had about three more months left in the administration. [sic, Mayor Barry was arrested January 18, 1990.]  And all of this broke.  And, you know, it was painful. But it's just a big challenge that we faced, and got through.
Story_ID: 5669
Speaker 1: So it [Marion Barry's arrest on cocaine charges] happened in the spring [sic, in January, 1990].  You left [as Mayor Marion Barry's Chief of Staff] in December [1990].  What was your responsibilities like during that period?
Speaker 2: Well one was closing down his office.  Because once he made the decision that he was not gonna run, then I was working with--Well remember the primary is in--When is the primary?  October?  And so at the primary--And the district is pretty much the election.  You know, once you get the person there, the Democratic and Republic controversy is gone.  And so we knew that Sharon Pratt Kelly was gonna probably be the Mayor.  So you start working with her staff to do whatever you can, quietly and behind the scenes to close down the office.  And that's what we were doing. 'Cause no matter who runs, even if it was a Republican that Mayor Marion Barry would be gone.  He'd have to vacate that office.  So that means taking down everything and getting it out of there.  And so the nine months that he was going to spend ultimately in jail, that just meant that you still had to do what you had to do in his office.  That meant also placing people.  Because of what had happened to him and because of the election and him not running, his personal staff was going to be unemployed unless you found a place for them in the agencies.  So that was part of my responsibilities, to get everybody placed.  And they knew that on January the 2nd, after the election, the following workday, they had a place to report to.  So we were doing that.  But it's kind of difficult to close out.  And I had never been a part of anything like that. And because I was leaving ultimately in December, I started the new job.  I went from his office on Friday to the [Greater Washington] Urban League on Monday.  I didn't--I don't believe in vacations.  But because of that, I had to finish early and make sure that I had gotten everything out.  And Sharon [Pratt] Kelly had made clear--she made it very clear she didn't want anybody up there.  She didn't want the receptionist; she didn't want anybody in that office from the Barry administration.  So we made sure there was absolutely nobody there.  And you couldn't answer the phones.  And there were some rumors--I had gone by that time--rumors that there were some missing keys on the computers (laughs).  Sounds familiar?  That, you know, things were not quite as they should have been?  But that was the choice that that administration had made. Which, you know--you never ask everybody to leave on the same day.  "Well where is the bathroom?"  "I don't know."  You know, you need somebody there to help with the transition.  The scheduler--I mean a mayor's schedule is very difficult.  You have no idea what it's like until you get in there.  Her schedule was mess--Sharon Kelly's schedule was messed up for a year or so.  Because no one really knew how to do that.  And you really need two schedules.  You have a day schedule and an evening schedule.  Well nobody asked for that. We offered it, but no one wanted that. So when they walked in, the first workday after the swearing in, the whole place was vacant.  And that's what they said they wanted. But again closing out, that was a part of the closeout, was transitioning.
Speaker 1: So who was advising you during this period?  Were you still in you know, in contact with him [Marion Barry]? I mean who was advi--I mean it's--
Speaker 2: Now he would call periodically.  Technically when you go into [substance abuse] treatment, you're not supposed to be calling back.  And the mayor you know, he's got telephonitis.  He's got to be talking on the telephone.  So they threatened to put him out of the facility 'cause he kept finding a phone.  And (laughs) you're not supposed to be--you're supposed to be dealing with your healing.  And he'd find a phone somewhere and I'd get a call.  And he'd ask me some questions and I'd respond.  Or if he wanted to know something, I'd find out and, when he'd call back again I'd get it for him. I traveled to the facility, because under our law, certain things only the mayor could sign.  And so I had to take them to him for signature.  And I would see him.  And he would walk around and  introduce me. "This is Judge so and so.  Yeah he's on drugs. And this is--"  I mean he would introduce these people and tell me what their problems were. Which I thought "I don't think you're supposed to be doing this."  But to him, it didn't seem so bad.  I mean that's their problem.  I met folks--This guy was in organized crime and--(Laughs).  It was like meeting his frat brothers or something (Laughs).  So I would go down there. And it was always scary. Because I would have to try to sneak down.  And at one point both Carol Thompson [Cole] and I went down.  And she had not gone through this before.  So she didn't know that when we got there, the reporters were stakin' us out.  And she said, "What is--"  I said, "Carol they know."  And to this day I'll always believe that Marion Barry probably told them.  But--'cause I think we--I think when it said unidentified source, most of the time it was him.  But we would go down there.  And I would go alone and, you know. It was kind of like scary.  That was a little scary for me. 'Cause I'd never been stalked that way by the media the way we were.  And I remember one night, I came out of the district building.  That was one night the rumor was that he was here.  And so when I came out of the district building, it was at night.  And I walked off the steps and there must have been a thousand camera lights.  That's what I felt like, in my face.  And so Dave Clark, who was the chair of the City Council at the time, parked right in front of me.  And I parked my car right behind him in front of the district building.  I kept trying to put my key into his car. 'Cause I was just so frantic.  It really scared me. And it took me a while to realize--And they were yelling questions at me. That the reason why my key wasn't working was 'cause this was not my car. But they stalked you.  And they called you relentlessly about these rumors.  And it was--that part was kind of like annoying to say the least.  But also scary. I can't imagine what it's like to be a person in trouble, with all these cameras around you all the time. And people peeping behind bushes to see if you're with anybody or doing anything.  Or whether they can read your lips or whatever. I mean it was like, "Ooh!"  I really found that uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: So who were you relying on? That's what I'm wondering.
Speaker 2: Well relying on self.  You have to run this age--you have to run the mayor's office.  And if you need advice and counsel, it was either Carol Thompson [Cole]. Or it might be somebody else that you knew would give you solid advice. Like the corporation council.  I mean you--there's really--you reported directly to the mayor.  When the mayor is not there, then Carol was in control of the agencies.  And we had to work together or I had to call other people that were close to the mayor like Herb Reed or the corporation council.  And that's how we did it.  I mean it was--there was no such thing as an interim advisory board.  You know. You just had to make it work.
Story_ID: 5670
Speaker 1: So you get over to the [Greater Washington] Urban League.  It must seem like a cakewalk.
Speaker 2: I thought it was gonna be (laughs).  I got to the Urban League. And I knew we had some financial difficulties.  And I knew that there were some things that I didn't know.  But I found kind of like the same thing with the [Washington, D.C.] Office of Human Rights.  That people weren't accountable. That there were some issues around the accountability up and some accountability down.  So I had to work through all that.  I had mistrust and a lack of trust of staff. But most importantly, the lack of money.  We really were without money.  And I had to do some fancy footwork to get funds raised to keep the staff paid.  Had to make some--had to have some riffs, which is always painful.  One of the persons that got riffed had been there for like seventeen years.  But there was just no space.  And the general fund is the only place that you can riff.  'Cause the other people are on contracts.  So it was a painful time.  But, you know, we went through that.  And on paper, we had about a $3 or $4 million budget.  But I went to my Finance Committee and said, "This doesn't exist. This money that's on this line that says foundation and grants zero."  So they gave me permission to redo the budget.  And it was less than $2 million. And one of those was a million dollar contract, which is very dangerous.  So our budget now is about $6.4 million.  And it's real dollars. It's not, "I wish I could raise this.  I hope I can raise this."  They're real dollars.  And so in terms of resources, I've done a fantastic job. I say that and pat myself on the back.  But in terms of the advocacy, we're spending more and more time now on fundraising.  And the advocacy is much less than I would like it to be.  And what I'm working towards now, as I look down the road to retirement, is making the Urban League self-sufficient.  Developing an endowment or an income stream that says, "You don't really have to go out here and spend as much time and energy on fundraising.  But you can be more of a community advocate." Which is really what I wanna do.
Speaker 1: You will do at this point in your life still?
Speaker 2: Well I'm--I've been there now ten years plus.  And my goal is to develop that income stream so I can become an even greater advocate.  We're advocates through our programs. Yes.  But I wanna be an advocate in terms of legislation and policy.  That's the part that's really missing. Because once you get out there on a piece of legislation, I learned from my days at the Washington bureau, is you gotta stick with it.  You cannot come out and make a statement and go back home.  You've got to organize. You got to share the information.  You gotta educate the public.  And even before you get to that, there's some preactivities that you must undertake before you can become a real advocate.
Speaker 1: Now you were saying, you know, before we even started to go on camera, that you're in the midst of a capital campaign. And this is something you really want.  You want this to be part of your legacy.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Exactly.  The notion of a new building for the Urban League is something that I really hold dear. And I'm passionate about as well.  We're in this space with boxes on top of one another.  The building is literally falling down.  Some of the tiles are missing in the ceiling.  The rain comes through. Every time it rains, I worry about what I'm gonna find when I get in the day after.  But it's too small.  And we've got programs all over the district.  And I'd like to bring most of those programs into this one facility.  And coordinate. Operate more efficiently and more effectively by sharing resources.  I think that's critical.  So the notion is to get this building and move the Urban League into it.  And most importantly, get it paid for before I retire.  Now that's part of the goal.  I don't want somebody to get in and then lose the building, or have issues because they can't meet the mortgage payments.

Speaker 1: Your views of the [National] Urban League--and its organization is how old?
Speaker 2: Our chapter [Greater Washington Urban League] was founded in 1938.  But the National Urban League was founded in 1910.  One year after the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: And your views of where the Urban League--because it had its predominance--you know, I won't say it's as predominant now, as it once was. And some people don't know, you know, still its mission.  And I'm wondering what you see as the mission of the organization?  You know, as we--you know, as we are in the 21st century?
Speaker 2: Well first of all, an organization that maintains the overall principles can survive if its strategies and its actions are different.  These are different times.  There're no longer signs up that says, you know, "No blacks."  You know. And there used to be signs in the south that said, "No blacks, no Jews, no dogs."  Things like that.  You don't have those signs.  You can sit anywhere on the bus you want.  So if you continue to operate in the old fashioned, the old way, you will die.  So the Urban League like most groups have changed their strategies.  The ones that did not are gone.  And so we recognize that.  And so we provide a great deal of social services, as well as civil rights activities.  The social services in our affiliate, for example, we provide housing.  We provide up to $20,000 in down payment assistance.  And some people don't view that as civil rights.  But the right to own a house when you are poor in this market is something that we want to be a part of.  We--we're engaged in environmental activities.  In the old days, environmental was pristine wilderness in Alaska, or out in Wyoming.  Now it's urban environment.  High rates of cancer.  High rates of infant mortality.  All kinds of things that relate to environments.  So we do change.  And we do provide things in a different way.  We believe in education.  The worst thing that can happen is for you to go into a facility and not be prepared.  The Urban League prepares you for those activities so that you can be a part of the fabric of this country.
Story_ID: 5672
Speaker 1: I have a question about--because you have spent aside from your St. Paul [Minnesota] experience your experience has been--and your experience with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service].  Your experience has been exclusively African American, working within an African American administrations, working with an African American organization. And, you know, and you told very poignantly of two instances, both at the [Greater Washington] Urban League that you're at right now, and, you know, when you were head of Human Services--[Washington, D.C. Office of] Human Rights--that you had to do clean up.  And there was a lot of--You know, really sort of patronage happening. Like an employee force that had gone you know, lazy. And I'm wondering what your thoughts about that are?  You know. Because, you know, what did this speak of in terms of these organizations and these administrations. And--I mean I know you're proficient at cleaning them up.  But what does this say?
Speaker 2: Well it says that in some instances, my predecessors weren't.  I mean one of the things about management and leadership is that you must be ever vigilant.  You cannot say, "I fixed this yesterday.  Now I must go on and not look back."  What I found out in some ways it's frustrating, is that I had it fixed yesterday.  But now it seems to be breaking again.  You put a process in place and you look around its gone or its--and I talked to my colleagues and it seems to be somewhat of a tradition.  You have to keep refixing things.  And once you start letting it go, then those other bad practices and bad habits start again.  And so if you really want to do something and do it right, you must constantly be vigilant.  You must constantly be reinforcing the positive behaviors.  And that's what I try to do.  It takes a lot of time.  It is time consuming.  But if you really care, and you wanna leave a place that some one behind you can come along and say, "It's great, or it's wonderful or it's--" you know, not so bad. Then you, "Gotta stay on the case." As the kids say.
Speaker 1: But some people would say, "That these--this is just what black organizations are like." Or, "This is how black people are."
Speaker 2: Well a lot of people would say that.  But white organizations often have the same issues.  It's just that we're so few, until if one is bad, it gets a lot of PR [public relations].  We don't get a lot of PR behind a lot of the white organizations.  If you look back, you'll see that Catholic charities had some issues.  You'll see that the Y [MCA, Young Men's Christian Association] has had issues.  You'll see Father [Edward] Flanagan's Boys' Town had issues.  But what you remember is the black organization that had the issues.  And that's unfortunate, but that is the way it is.
Story_ID: 5673
Speaker 1: Now what are your hopes or, you know, concerns for the black community as we look, you know, right into this millennium that we're in?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I really hope will start to happen is that we will understand that it is our responsibility to take care of our organizations.  That's the way it used to be post-slavery.  I mean we had banks, we had institutions.  We didn't need to go to all these other folks to get resources. To get help.  I think that if there's anything that I could wish upon our folks, it's that we would understand that as Calvin Rolock (ph.) used to say, "Nobody can save us but us."  And we need to be mindful of that.  You can't expect institutions to save your children.  You can't expect institutions provide you with the wherewithal to build wealth and to create wealth.  You gotta do some of this stuff for yourself.  And I wish that self-sufficiency--And that's one of the goals, by the way, of the [National] Urban League.  Self-sufficiency.  That we would grab onto that and make it happen.
Story_ID: 5674
Speaker 1: Now you as a--you know, you have had success as a female dealing in, you know, black organizations.  And that is not always easy. There is an unspoken sexism that occurs.  But it doesn't seem that it's impacted you. Or has it?
Speaker 2: I saw it.  I dealt with it.  I mean everything. When I first [1973] came into the [National Urban] League, at the Washington [D.C.] Bureau, people would not pay me any attention.  When I succeeded Ron Brown, "Don't mind her.  She's too young."  Ron Brown was one month older than me.  But I seemed too young.  There were you know, things said and things done that I addressed even to the point of telling one individual that I was going to hurt him because of his aggressiveness.  And he didn't believe me but I made it real clear.  I said to him, I said, "How will you explain to the folks downstairs how you got all those scratches on your face? 'Cause I will hurt you."  You know, sometimes I could be more bravado than there really is. But I was serious.  But the point is that that happens.  And some women can handle it and some can't.  I didn't need a lawsuit.  I didn't need a newspaper story. I just needed this turkey to get it straight.  That he was not gonna hurt me.  'Cause I was gonna hurt him.  But the sexism in the Urban League was rampant.  When I was in the Washington Bureau [starting in 1991] one of the things that I did start talking about to our execs was sex harassment. And what that meant, and what that could mean to them.  They used to make jokes.  "How you know how that feels?  How do you describe sexism?"  I said, "I--let's put it this way.  If that person next to you had done that or said that to your mother, how would you have felt?  If it was wrong for your mother, then it's wrong.  If you can't accept the explanation, put your mother, your wife or your daughter in the category.  And if they--you would be offended if this happened to them, then it's wrong."  And then it was shortly after that, we had a male exec sued.  Several male execs were sued subsequently.  But right after that conversation.  And then we had a female exec sued.  And I began to talk about the fact that, "Ladies it's coming to you too."  And you know, they were sitting back there so few in numbers, they didn't believe this.  But one of our female execs was sued for a sex harassment.  And unfortunately I would say to them that, "You know, it's not what you're doing, but it looks like you're doing."  And she would always take these nice young looking guys out for a drink after work.  She thought that was nice.  That was fun.  "Don't do that lady.  You've got to be careful.  Don't do that man.  You've got to be careful."  We had one person, his story hit the newspapers right after that.  He was dating some woman on staff.  And he didn't show the night before because the wife had priority.  And the woman had fixed his favorite food, which was spaghetti.  She came the next morning with a pot of spaghetti and dumped it on his head.  And that was the beginning. 'Cause everybody called the press.  The people that he was mad at on the staff, they called the press and told it.  But, you know, some of these guys didn't get it for a long time.  But now I think they got it.  I think they know, even though some one will--some will push the envelope, they know that this applies to them to.  Not just to Texaco [now part of the Chevron Corporation] and Coca Cola [Company] and some of these other companies.  It applies to you as well.
Story_ID: 5675
Speaker 1: When you look back and you think of--did your--is your father still alive?
Speaker 2: No he's not.
Speaker 1: Is your mother [Mary Louise Rice]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. She's still alive.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And but your father--What did--When did your father pass? He passed away--
Speaker 1: It was eight years ago.
Speaker 2: Eight years ago.  Okay. Well what did your parents think of you?  You know, here their only child and what was their view of you and your success?
Speaker 1: Well, Daddy had some questions about my success.  He kept wondering why I kept changing jobs.  I mean Daddy believed you get one job and you just stay there for--I said, "Daddy they don't do that anymore.  You move because you're getting more money, more prestige, combinations thereof.  You're bored."  "Well I don't understand that.  I mean you're not gonna be able to get another job 'cause you had too many jobs."  I said, "But Daddy I stay usually ten years.  That's a long time."  To his dying day he never understood why I kept changing.  But as he would see the evidences that this is a successful activity, then he was a little bit more calm about it.  And also when he saw--I wouldn't tell him exactly how much I made 'cause I didn't--But when I would say to him things like, "Daddy I make more money than you and Mom put together."  I'd say things like that. And he would say, "Well okay all right."  When he saw the evidences of success, you know, my own house, my car things like that, he was a bit more calm.  When I would come home to visit, one of the things you do when you go home, you should always make sure your hair looks right.  You take the best clothes, the best jewelry.  So he would see the evidences of success.  So he was pleased.  But inwardly he still worried about why you don't stay on these jobs forever.  I said, "Daddy I don't want a gold watch.  You know, that is not something I want."  So, you know, he was proud.  I mean one of the things I missed right after he died was sending him newspaper articles.  When I was in the newspaper or something had happened.  I mean when I was in the 'Jet' [magazine], I mean Daddy carried that around with him until it crackled.  You know, (laughs). You know, 'Jet.' You're in 'Jet,' you're certified.  But, you know, he was--He's from the old school.  And once he got on the railroad [Great Northern Railway] he stayed there.  And we're talking I don't know forty or fifty years.  And that is not something that I could do.  I get too restless.  I'm on this job as president of the [Greater Washington] Urban League longer than any other job.  I'm now going into my eleventh year.  And, you know, I'm staying. Because when I leave, I want to retire.  I don't wanna take on another job.  And every job that I've had has been clean up, fix up, headache.  Wherever I go next time, I tell people, "I wanna be in charge of looking out the left window at high noon for one-half hour Monday through Tuesday.  And that's it." And well-paid (laughs).
Story_ID: 5676
Speaker 1: I have one more question. And that's the legacy question.  And I wanna know what you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well right now, it's really focused on where I am.  I want the [Greater Washington] Urban League to be strong, self-sufficient and I want all these young people whose lives we're touching now to do something with that.  To take that out and do something that is very supportive of our folks.  To really make a difference.  One of the things I'm most proud of is my young professional group, twenty-one to thirty-five [called the Thursday Network] started with my nephew and a couple of his friends.  And now they're up to almost 200 members.  They serve the community.  They serve the homeless.  They clean up houses.  They tutor, they mentor.  They do so much in the community. And this is the generation everyone said is the selfish, you know, the "Me Too" generation.  And I--that is a group that I am just tremendously proud of.  We've got a young man who has been nominated.  Now he's a little over thirty-five.  But he's been nominated for a judge, a judgeship in the superior court of the district.  We have a young man the first president who was a White House fellow.  These are the young people for whom the Civil Rights Movement was fought.  And these are the people that folks died for so they'd have opportunities that we didn't have.  And so I am so proud of this group. But the bottom line for the young professionals is that professional is a state of mind.  It is not an occupation.  So I want that group to represent the future leadership of this country.  And the National Urban League has finally embraced them as a national auxiliary. And I think my group made that happen.  Because of the things that they've done, and are doing.

Speaker 1: Even though I head an organization that has its own activities and its own meetings. I am very, very active in a number of organizations. And this was a Delta Sigma Theta national conference in the Bahamas. And I took my mother [Mary Louise Rice], like I do on many of the activites that I go on--the trips that I go on--I take her with me. And so Mom and I were in Las Vegas--in Bahamas at this club. Again, I drag my mother everywhere and she goes along willingly, bless her heart. But that's what that was, and that was about six years ago.

Speaker 1: Part of--again, some of our activities, is to work with celebrities. And Don King and Mike Tyson were in the District of Columbia giving away turkeys during the holidays. And this way before he [Tyson] had his own issues and challenges and wound up in jail, but at that time they were in the District and they were giving away turkeys. And our site was on of the sites where people could come and pick up those turkeys. And so they were in our office and I was talking with them and taking pictures and there was a number of people in the meeting, at that time, with us.

Speaker 1: When these individuals came into the office, I had staff to go out and bring them in. So these were, as they say, boys in the hood who came in to meet Mike Tyson with that no-smiling look on their face. I kept trying to get them to smile and they wouldn't, you know, it's cool to look real, real serious. And of course, Don King was wonderful, he was very nice to the young men and very patient.

He had been arrested and he was, you know, telling folks--'cause the mayor was very good at this--telling folks what was happening to him and what his expectations were. And so folks came out. I mean, there was always standing room only at these events 'cause people wanted to see and let him know that were supporting him, but also to find out what was going on in the city.

And of those was the placement of a young lawyer's minority program in a white university. We had originally gotten an agreement from the states, from the feds that this program was going to be placed at Howard.  And when they broke the agreement, we decided to sit-in. And as a result of that sit-in, the lady in the fur coat is me, with the 'fro and the white stockings. And I was arrested, first time and only time in life. And we were loaded into this paddy wagon. And everyone was mad at us because they had to come back to work--.

We know that if you don't get them early, and start them early, then it's going to be too hard later on. So I'm proud to be a part of so many of our programs. And these are some of the few young people--a few of the young people that we work with. We work with hundreds and hundreds each day.
