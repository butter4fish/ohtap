Speaker 1: --Was born in 1918.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Wildersville, Tennessee. That's the backwoods of Tennessee.
Speaker 1: What is that? Is that East Tennessee or?
Speaker 2: It's, it's probably central but more leaning towards North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And how long did he live there?
Speaker 2: He lived there briefly 'cause my grandfather, Alvin Hart, was--moved to Salina, Kansas, so my father [Judson Hart] actually grew up in Salina, Kansas, though he was born in Wildersville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know why your father's--your grandfather moved to Kansas?
Speaker 2: He didn't like living in Tennessee. He was on a train on his way to Los Angeles [California] to try to find a career as a chef. He ran out of money in Salina, Kansas, and he became a leading citizen in Salina, Kansas. He opened a barbecue restaurant in Salina, Kansas, in the late 1940s, Al Hart's Barbecue on [U.S.] Route 40. He was financed by white businessmen and he told them if he was going to do this that the restaurant could not be segregated, that black and white patrons would have to sit wherever they wanted to sit in the restaurant and the white businessmen agreed. So, he became a leading citizen, businessman in Salina, Kansas, and that's where my father grew up.
Speaker 1: Did your father have siblings?
Speaker 2: No. He was an only child.
Speaker 1: And so, obviously, this would be your father, your grandfather, and his wife.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Did she work?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my grandmother [Agnes Hart] died the year I was born and my grandfather remarried. So, my grand- his, his first wife died in 1944, the year I was born, and he remarried a couple of years later to, to Dorothy Hart [Dorothy Butler Hart]. And so I did not know my--his first wife, but I knew his second wife who I considered to be my grandmother, obviously.
Speaker 1: From what you remember about your grandfather, how would you describe him? What kind of man was he?
Speaker 2: He was--his name was Alvin Emerson Hart. He was outgoing, gregarious, brown skinned, about your complexion, and great cook, great chef, and a good businessman 'cause his restaurant was very successful. Route 40 at the time was probably the main east to west highway. This was before the Interstate Highway System [National System of Interstate and Defense Highways] was built. So--and my brothers [Mondo Jud Hart and Christopher A. Hart] and I--my--at the time, my, my, my father was working for Union Pacific Railroad in the '50s [1950s] when we moved to--from the projects [Platte Valley Homes, Denver, Colorado] and so my brothers and I used to ride the Union Pacific from Denver [Colorado] to Salina in the summer, the three of us, about an eight hour train ride. My father didn't necessarily have to be on the train 'cause all of his friends were the porters, so they would watch over us when we were taking this eight hour train ride.
Story_ID: 622065
Speaker 1: And then when we--when we got to Salina [Kansas], my brothers [Mondo Jud Hart and Christopher A. Hart] and I, when we got old enough, we would work in the restaurant. And I remember meeting some very famous people in this restaurant who would stop at Al Hart's Barbecue on [U.S.] Route 40 as they were traversing east to west, west to east.
Speaker 2: Who were some of these people?
Speaker 1: Cab Calloway, mus- a lot of musicians, you know, Duke Ellington who were on the road traveling from--Salina was in the middle of the state. So, if they--if they played Kansas City, for example, their next big city stop would generally be Denver [Colorado] where they would go play in Denver. So, they would be, you know, traveling Route 40 and--especially if you're a black entertainer, you knew when you got to Salina, you, you wanted to stop at Al Hart's Barbecue. So, pretty much every musician that you could think about who was big in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], I met or served in Al Hart's Barbecue in Salina, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Kansas, of course, was a big music hub, similar to New Orleans [Louisiana]--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --or Mississippi with the blues (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kansas City. Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Going to Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Going to Kansas City, yeah.
Speaker 2: "Here I come" ['Kansas City'].
Speaker 1: Right. Right. Right.
Speaker 2: Did you ever see any of the music shows?
Speaker 1: Well, I saw a lot of them in Denver because, like I say--
Speaker 2: Oh, in Denver but not--
Speaker 1: They would--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They would--I met a lot of the, the musicians at Al Hart's Barbecue, but in terms of seeing them as I got older in Denver 'cause they would leave Kansas City, they go to Denver, the next stop would be L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and I, I saw many of them perform in Denver, but I--many of them, I had already met in Salina, so by the time they got to Denver, you know, they knew my parents. My mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] was a songwriter, school teacher but a songwriter. She was one of the first African American teachers hired by the Denver Public Schools, but she was also a songwriter. So, many of these known musicians would come by our house because they knew my [paternal] grandfather [Alvin Hart] from his restaurant, they'd come and play in Denver at the Rossonian [Rossonian Hotel] when you--it was, you know, segregated places to play. And oftentimes, they would come by our house because they knew my dad [Judson Hart] from Salina and we would--
Speaker 2: Did you--did you have a Brownie camera? Did you take any pictures with these guys?
Speaker 1: My parents did, my mother.
Speaker 2: Do you still have those pictures?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do.
Speaker 2: Are they easily accessible?
Speaker 1: Well, my mother passed away in November of 2015, so--my pa- my father passed away in 1998, so one of the things that we're going through--I'm the, the personal representative for my mother's estate, so that's one of the things we're going through now is all the photographs, basically trying to settle her estate and we're digitizing all the photos. So, we're--I, I, I have some of those, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's, it's a project, but the--but I can only imagine that they're, you know, historic images.
Story_ID: 622066
Speaker 1: Back to your [paternal] grandfather, did he ever talk about what life was like for him in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did. He didn't like it and my father [Judson Hart] liked it even less than my grandfather. My father didn't like to go back and visit Tennessee. Again, they grew up in the backwoods of Tennessee. They owned a lot of land, you know, probably 150, 200 acres they had. And so my grandfather's two brothers, Lum [Lum Hart] and Commodore [Commodore Hart], and his father, my great-grand--my great-grandfather, Joe Silas Hart [Joe Hart], still lived in the backwoods of Tennessee. So, we'd go back and, and visit in the summertime. My father would never go back with us 'cause he really, you know, had bad memories about Tennessee. My grandfather would go back, but my father really didn't like to go back to Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My brothers [Mondo Jud Hart and Christopher A. Hart] and--we--we'd go fairly often--
Speaker 1: Do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in the summertime.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your great-grandfather acquired the land? Was it--what--
Speaker 2: Homestead Act [Homestead Act of 1862], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay. Not, not the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands]?
Speaker 2: It may have been the Freedmen's Bureau, yeah, yeah. My grand--great-grandfather [Riley Banning] on my mother's [Murlee Shaw Hart] side, which we'll get into, he got his land in Oklahoma through the Homestead Act. The Freedmen's Bureau may be on the situation in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Tennessee, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you say your father didn't like--didn't have good memories of Tennessee, but was he ever specific? Was there some encounters, some physical encounters, some emotional (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He wasn't really specific. It was more general dislike. One--it was the backwoods, right? He moved to Salina [Kansas], then he moved to Denver [Colorado], so he ended up in a city, Salina much smaller town. But, where they--where he was born in Tennessee, Wildersville, they were basically in the backwoods. The first time we went to visit them I think was 1954. I was ten years old. We went in the summertime. We had a fifty--I think it was '55 [1955]--we had a--we--my parents had bought a '55 [1955] Ford. My dad wouldn't go with us. My--so, my mother and my two brothers and I drove to Salina. We picked up our [paternal] grandparents [Dorothy Butler Hart and Alvin Hart] and we drove to Tennessee. My father didn't go with us. But, I remember when we got to Tennessee, everybody was excited 'cause you got these Hart family members coming from Denver and from, from Salina, so they, you know, dug a big pit, went out and killed a pig, split the pig. You know, we--of course, we had to watch, right? We're the city boys. We had to watch them do all this stuff. And they, you know, roasted the pig. And--
Speaker 1: In the pit.
Speaker 2: In the pit. And then the, the adults went up deeper in the woods, got a little moonshine and came down and--you know, that was the first time I, I--they allowed me to, to taste. First time I tasted moonshine, I was ten years old.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) An authentic Tennessee experience.
Speaker 2: Yes, authentic. So--and I remember one, one--I know--you know, they're on the farm, so they'd wake us up five o'clock in the morning to do the farm work. And we're, we're city boys. We're from Denver. Like, we sleep until nine o'clock, right? So, by nine o'clock--if you wake up at five--nine o'clock, you're like, like the whole day has gone by, like what time is it? Oh, nine a.m. But, I remember one incident, my brothers and I were sitting on the front porch with my, my uncle and our activity that they were swatting flies. How many flies can you swat? Who would swat the most flies? And then all of a sudden, a--I think it was a cottonmouth or a puff adder 'cause there--you know, in those streams, there a lot of poisonous snakes, a puff adder or a cottonmouth came out of the stream and started, you know, up to the house. And my uncle got his hoe and we were watching. He went out there and chopped the head off of the puff adder and the snake--you know, the head was over here, the body was still (laughter)--and we're sitting there, we're like--we were from Denver, right? We're swatting flies in the--then he kills a snake and we're like--so I can understand my father like, "Get me out of here" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did--do you--did you--do you recall going back ever or, or was that your one--
Speaker 2: No, no, we went back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: As, as we got older (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we'd go back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and they--you know, they had outhouses.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, it was always a challenge and--
Speaker 1: And no showers. You had--
Speaker 2: No showers.
Speaker 1: You had the--you had the tin tub.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What--did you have the round tub or the long tub?
Speaker 2: The long one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then that little bucket if you wanted to pee and you didn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --want to go to the outhouse--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and you wanted to pee in the middle of the night, you pee in the bucket.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then you dump it the, in the morning.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: If you had to, you know, do number two--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that was--
Speaker 2: --then you would have to go to the outhouse.
Speaker 1: Yes, of course.
Speaker 2: That was always a challenge in the middle of the night.
Speaker 1: Did you have toilet paper or were you using newspaper?
Speaker 2: I think they had toilet paper. They had toilet paper (laughter).
Speaker 1: I ask that because I grew up in Mississippi (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So you know what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter), exactly. And if it was wintertime, you really didn't want to go out.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, you didn't want to go out.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: And, see, in my mind after the--after my uncle killed that puff adder or--whether--or whether it was a puff adder or a cottonmouth, poisonous snake, whatever, and I was always like, man, if I go out to this outhouse and I sit on--is, is there--could there be in the--could there be theoretically--
Speaker 1: A, a snake that would bite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a snake that would bite me in the ass (laughter)?
Story_ID: 622067
Speaker 1: Is the property still in your family?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That, that is fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And some of the family--it's an interesting migration pattern. Some of the family, like my [paternal] grandfather [Alvin Hart] said, he went to Salina [Kansas]--some of the family--Hart family I'm talking about. My--when, when I grew up in--when, when I was growing up, they would always tell me there are three--kind of three family lines in Tennessee; Hart, Timber, Parker--I mean, Hart, Timberlake [ph.], Parker. And so the Hart branch specifically, some members went west like Salina, L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Denver [Colorado], some went east like North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. So, this young man, Josh Hart, who was just drafted in the first round by the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers], he played at Villanova [Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania]. He grew up in Silver Spring [Maryland]. That's part of the family that went east from Tennessee to, to Maryland. So, I'm--you know, I'm, I--I'm pleased that he was--yeah, he played at Villanova, won a national championship at Villanova. But, that's part of the branch that went east and some went west.
Speaker 1: So, he's your cousin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, cousin, nephew.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know. But, yes, we, we would go back after that first trip. But by the--you know, the other thing I remember is that '54 [sic. 1955] when Emmett Till was killed, my older brother was twelve then, I was ten, my younger brother was seven. My older brother, Jud [Mondo Jud Hart], was--you know, he started looking at girls. Denver was more liberal. We went to school with white kids, Asian kids, Mexican American kids, but the summer that Emmett Till was killed, I remember my parents and my grandfather specifically telling my brother, my older brother, "When you get down here, make sure you don't do--you don't look at--you don't whistle, you don't even give the impression that a white woman or white girl that you, you know." And, and the family was well known. The Hart family was well known. But, they're very--they, they will--I remember that specifically. They, they warned him to be very careful. But when we--when we got there the first time, the white people and the black people, they, they knew the Hart family. Like, you know, they knew the Hart family. So, I, I've always say, you know, and I don't know Emmett Till's family situation that well when he went down--when he went from Chicago [Illinois], but in our instance, I'm saying, you know, if--I--and I may be optimistic that if my twelve year old brother had--if someone had--a white person had said he was looking at that white woman or he whistled at that white girl, I don't think a white person would've showed up at my great-grandfather's house and taken him out, you know. They would've--they would've had problems doing that in--at that time.
Speaker 1: I am wondering and I'll just be blunt about this, whether there was not some white relations of your grandfather still in the community?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, 'cause Joe Silas Hart [Joe Hart], my great-grandfather, his father was a slave owner. And so Joe Silas Hart, my great-grandfather, was maybe my complexion, maybe a little darker like in my--and my, my, my younger brother, Chris [Christopher A. Hart], is, of the three brothers has--is a darker complexion. My older brother is a little darker than I am. My, my mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] is about my complexion. My father [Judson Hart] is a little darker. But, Joe Silas Hart, his, his father was a slave owner. So, his mother [Cheril Olive] was enslaved and he was--he's the result of the union between the Hart slave owner and--
Speaker 1: Did he bequeath your great-grandfather any property, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, part of the property that they, they were on in Tennessee may have been bequeathed part- partially. I, I don't think the whole area was. But, part of it may have been.
Speaker 1: And, and I'm going to move on in a second, but what kind of farm was it? What, what did, did they grow?
Speaker 2: Chickens.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: There were chickens, you know, fruits, vegetables. But, I remember chickens specifically because the first time we visited, they made us go out and watch them take the head off and then, "Do you want to do that? Do you want to--?" (Laughter) And you're still like--and then you're like, I don't even want to eat that chicken. But, you know, by the time you're sitting down at six o'clock to eat breakfast, you got chicken and biscuits and you, you know, you're saying--
Speaker 1: Your mind changes as the aroma (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Your mind changes. Say, that chicken was good (laughter).
Story_ID: 622068
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Judson Hart] grew up in Salinas, Kansas [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Salina, S-A-L-I-N-A--
Speaker 1: N-A-S [sic.].
Speaker 2: --Kansas.
Speaker 1: --Kansas. And he went to college--
Speaker 2: University of Kansas.
Speaker 1: University of Kansas.
Speaker 2: Lawrence, Kansas.
Speaker 1: And that's where your mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] went to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she grew up in Wichita [Kansas] after her family moved from St. Louis [Missouri] to Wichita and she went to the University of Kansas.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father here. What did he study when he was in college?
Speaker 2: When he, when he was--he--basically social sciences. He was social science. And then when they got married--he hadn't graduated--he--he's three years older than my mother, so he hadn't graduated. He finished maybe two years--finished his sophomore year when they got married and moved to Denver [Colorado]. He later finished his bachelor's degree at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: And what was his first job?
Speaker 2: His first job--going through my mother's effects in Denver, his first job was a--when my older brother [Mondo Jud Hart] was born, on the bir- his birth certificate, my father had his job as janitor, my mother as house maker, you know, hou- homemaker.
Speaker 1: Your, your father had college--well, he hadn't finished college, but he had--
Speaker 2: Two years of college.
Speaker 1: --two years of college and he was a janitor.
Speaker 2: He was a janitor, um-hm, and my mother was a homemaker.
Speaker 1: And she had her degree.
Speaker 2: She had her degree, yeah. She, she earned her--she was nineteen when she graduated 'cause she graduated from high school [Wichita East High School, Wichita, Kansas] early and she--when she finished University of Kansas, her bachelor's degree, she was nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: Why did they move from Kansas to Denver?
Speaker 2: They had heard that Denver offered more opportunities for, for African Americans and they did--they thought they would find better opportunities there than in either Missouri or Kansas, and so that's why they, they migrated to Denver.
Speaker 1: So, you were living in this housing development in the Five Points area of Denver?
Speaker 2: Platte Valley public housing projects [Platte Valley Homes].
Speaker 1: Was that where most of the African Americans that you knew lived?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was a segregated city?
Speaker 2: It was segregated, but you could--unlike other cities that were segregated, you--if you were black, you could go places. You may not live there, but you, you were--you know, I could go to--I could go to movie theaters. Like, the other thing, when I went to Tennessee and go to the movie theater, I go my--buy my ticket, they tell me I--you know, that's--we gotta go sit up in the balcony. In Denver, I just go in and sit wherever I want to sit.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You know, when I was growing up in Mississippi, of course, we had one black movie house--well, actually, there were two, but one near me. But, in Yazoo City [Mississippi], there was only one movie house. So, the, the colored section was upstairs in what we call the, the chicken roost.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and you couldn't sit on--you couldn't sit down and you--if you wanted popcorn, you had to go to this little side window to buy it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then take it back up.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay. But, just to finish up on that, the movie theater distinction between Tennessee and Denver, you could go wherever you wanted.
Speaker 1: Wherever I wanted to, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I also want to--in the Platte Valley public housing projects, I wanna--everybody knows probably who Pam Grier is, the movie star. Her family--her mother was our first babysitter. Her family lived two doors down from my--her parents lived two doors down from my parents, so Pam's mother, Gwen, is about eight years younger than my mother. So when, when my brothers and I were born, our first babysitter was Gwen Samuels [Gwendolyn Samuels Grier], who is Pam Grier's mother.
Story_ID: 622069
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother [Murlee Shaw Hart], please. Your mother was born where?
Speaker 2: She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, December 8th, 1921.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know her parents?
Speaker 2: I knew her mother, Virginia Banning Shaw.
Speaker 1: Do--did her mother work or was she a homemaker, do you know? Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My--her, her mother worked as a domestic and--when they lived in--they lived in Okla- she lived in Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas.
Speaker 1: She moved around a lot?
Speaker 2: She was born in Oklahoma. Her family was--my mother's--her grandfather was the one that got 165 acres through the Homestead Act [Homestead Act of 1862] in central Tennessee and that's where my--
Speaker 1: In, in Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: In Oklahoma, central Oklahoma, rather, Canton, Oklahoma, Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and that's where my grandmother, Virginia Banning, was born, in central Oklahoma. Riley and Cora Banning were my grandmother's parents and they--Riley Banning was the one that received the, via the Homestead Act, 165 acres in central Tennessee in 1907, I believe, 1905, 1907.
Speaker 1: And then how did your grandmother make it to--
Speaker 2: Well, her--when she left Oklahoma, she went to Iowa, and the reason she went to Iowa, her younger br- she had three brothers, a younger brother, James Herman, and two older brothers, Archibald [Archibald Banning] and Cornelius [ph.], and, and her younger brother, James Herman Banning [James Banning], learned to fly. Well, initially, he, he was--he was interested in engineering. He was accepted to Iowa State College [Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa] in their engineering program. He was born in 1900, so he went to Iowa State probably 1918, 1919. And at the time, Iowa was the--Iowa was the center of aviation activity. He was in school at Iowa State. He dropped out and opened a--opened a shop that repaired bicycles and motorcycles, and he then got into flying planes 'cause many of the planes used bicycle parts or motorcycle parts as--in their engines as well as automobile parts. So, he got--he got interested in aviation. He became--he learned to fly and started flying in 1924.
Speaker 1: But, let me--let me stop you because I, I want to get--that's gonna be a major part of our interview. But, let me just talk about your mother now. So, she goes to Iowa?
Speaker 2: Well, her, her mother goes to Iowa 'cause she--the point I was making is that she followed him to Io- Ames, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother followed her son to--
Speaker 2: Her--
Speaker 1: --Ames--
Speaker 2: No, no. My, my, my grandmother followed her younger brother. It was her younger brother, James Herman Banning, my, my grandmother's name--her maiden name was Virginia Banning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She followed her younger brother to Ames, Iowa, when he went to school there and that's how she ended up in Iowa. And then she met Emmett Shaw and they moved to St. Louis, and that's where my, my mother and her older sister, Pearl [Pearl Shaw Dillard], were born in St. Louis. And then my grandmother and her husband separated, divorced, and my grandmother then moved to Wichita, Kansas, took the girls to Wichita, Kansas.
Speaker 1: And that's where your mother grew up?
Speaker 2: And my mother grew up in Wichita, Kansas.
Story_ID: 622070
Speaker 1: So, if she [Hart's mother, Murlee Shaw Hart] graduated from college at age nineteen, this suggests she was pretty near genius, so she must've entered at, what fifteen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifteen. Fifteen, sixteen 'cause she finished college in three years. Yeah, she was--she was--she was very smart. I don't know if I would say she's a genius. I don't know too many geniuses even though a lot of people get called geniuses. But, she was very smart. She's--she graduated when she was nineteen and met my dad [Judson Hart] at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and that in itself was a story in terms of, of African American, or Negroes in those days or black, students as undergraduates. Obviously, they lived in segregated situation at the University of Kansas. My dad could not play basketball at the University of Kansas, you know. Phog Allen was the coach at the time.
Speaker 1: Why couldn't he play basketball?
Speaker 2: 'Cause he was black. You know, you, you, you didn't play sports at a university like that. If he'd have gone to a predominantly, you know, historically black college or university [HBCU], he could've played, but he went to University of Kansas. You, you couldn't play sports. It basically was all white.
Speaker 1: This was like 1930s?
Speaker 2: It was 1930s, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Although, Robeson [Paul Robeson], was able to play for--
Speaker 2: At Rutgers [Rutgers College; Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Yeah, for Rutgers, but that was on the East Coast.
Speaker 2: That was on the East Coast.
Speaker 1: Not Kansas.
Speaker 2: Kansas.
Speaker 1: Not--
Speaker 2: Kanas is just above the Mason Dixon Line.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, Kansas and Missouri, you're talking about you're not far away from--
Speaker 1: You're up south.
Speaker 2: Yes, you're up south, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and what was your mother's major in college, do you know?
Speaker 2: Education.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, she planned to be a teacher?
Speaker 2: She had planned to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she--when they moved to Denver [Colorado], she was probably--she, she was one of the first African American teachers hired by the Denver public school system [Denver Public Schools], but it was--you know, she wasn't immediately hired even though she got a college degree. Then, she went on and got a master's degree in education from the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], then got a Ph.D. in education from the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].
Story_ID: 622071
Speaker 1: So, approximately what year did your parents move to Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty [1940].
Speaker 1: World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: World War II (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just before World War II.
Speaker 2: Just before World War II.
Speaker 1: Was your father [Judson Hart] drafted?
Speaker 2: No 'cause he had a family. His, his--my, my older brother, Jud [Mondo Jud Hart], was born in 1942 and so the war was--you know, was--it was the early days of the United States being in the war. I was born in '44 [1944] and my younger brother, Chris [Christopher A. Hart], was born in 1947.
Speaker 1: So you could get a deferment if you had a family at that point?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] was one of the first teachers hired by the Denver public school system, but do you know approximately what year?
Speaker 2: It was probably around 1954.
Speaker 1: So, it took about ten or fifteen years for her to get--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --get hired.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know if she had to file any kind of action or get some help from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: No, it was 'cause it was soon after Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 1: Then they opened the doors.
Speaker 2: And so they opened the doors for--'cause she and one of her friends were both among the first African American teachers hired by the Denver Public Schools, but soon after Brown versus Board of Education.
Story_ID: 622072
Speaker 1: You entered elementary school around 1950 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty [1950], um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, your teachers were all white?
Speaker 2: My teachers were all white, yes.
Speaker 1: And the principal.
Speaker 2: Principal, all white.
Speaker 1: What was that like for, for, for a black kid going to a school where there are no black teachers, no black administrators? What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: That's how it was. I mean, there were black students. Denver [Colorado] is a very diverse city, so I had black students, Mexican American students, Asian students, so the students, my friends were all--a, a mosaic. The teachers, we didn't really--it's not like we were astute enough to think, why are all these teachers white? Why are--why is the principal white? You know, I had good teachers.
Speaker 1: Oh, they were good--that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were good teachers.
Speaker 1: That was the other question. Were they supportive? Were they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were supportive.
Speaker 1: --encouraging?
Speaker 2: They were supportive because--one reason they were supportive was because we had very active parents. I think about my friends' parents. They were very much attuned to getting a good education and they would be--they were active in the schools. The teachers knew who they were. So, you know--and the parents obviously need to still play that kind of role with their children in terms of being active and caring, and the teachers know that if you, you, you can't mistreat the kids because of--you know, one of my good friends, his father was a former professional boxer. He was a mailman and he's--this is a white kid, Bobby Hamm. We're working on a book together now. He's a social worker up in Maine. We're working on a children's book now about our experience growing up black and white.
Speaker 1: In Denver?
Speaker 2: In Denver, Hamm and Hart [HistoryMaker Philip Hart], Mile High Denver. And his father was a professional boxer in his earlier life and he was a, a postal carrier. And all the teachers knew--all the, the--you know, we played sports. All the gym teachers, all the coaches knew, you didn't mess with us because Mr. Hamm might come in and kick your behind (laughter). So, it--I wasn't really at that point in elementary school conscious of like why, why don't I have a black teacher? Why is the principal black--not black?
Speaker 1: And, and sounds as if you had good relations with your white classmates?
Speaker 2: White, Mexican American--
Speaker 1: Mexican--yeah.
Speaker 2: Asian.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We had--we, we, we were friends and are friends to this day.
Speaker 1: And yet the--
Speaker 2: If they're still alive.
Story_ID: 622073
Speaker 1: And yet the city itself was segregated. Your mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] couldn't get a job as a teacher.
Speaker 2: But it was--it was soft segregation, if you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: What's a soft segregation?
Speaker 2: Well, in the sense that I remember when the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention was held in Denver [Colorado], I don't remember the year--and, and all of these black men and women from around the country come to Denver and I remember them coming to our house and remarking about how, "This is, this is nice, like, you can--you can go eat at any restaurant, you can go to any mov- you can go--basically go anywhere you want." We lived in northeast Denver; that's where most of us lived, African Americans at that time. But in terms of moving throughout the city, moving up--going up to Boulder [Colorado]. I remember them to this day remarking, the NAACP people who came to Denver, "This is, this is nice. You can, you can--you know"--
Speaker 1: And you could--
Speaker 2: --"this is--people--you can go everywhere you want to."
Speaker 1: And there were no hotel restrictions?
Speaker 2: Well, there were hotel restrictions up until the '50s [1950s] 'cause the, the, the black hotel, the Rossonian Hotel [Denver, Colorado], which was owned by my father's friend, Elvin Caldwell [Elvin R. Caldwell], was the hotel where the stars that I mentioned earlier that I met in Salina [Kansas], that's where they would stay 'cause they, they, they couldn't stay in the downtown hotels up until about the mid-'50s [1950s]. But they--so, they would stay at the Rossonian and they'd, they'd play at clubs, you know, in the Five Points area [Denver, Colorado]. But probably in the mid-'50s [1950s] or so, it opened up where you could go and stay in the downtown hotels and the Rossonian was still a favorite place for black entertainers who, who, who had come to Denver. But, just in general, soft segregation, I, I mean that even though we were residentially segregated, there was never the sense that you couldn't go wherever you wanted to go and be chastised because you did so.
Story_ID: 622074
Speaker 1: (Clears throat).
Speaker 2: Do you recall when your dad got the job with the Denver Housing Authority?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But, he was a postal worker first or, or?
Speaker 1: Well, he was a janitor, then he was a postal worker, then he worked for Yellow Cab [Yellow Cab Company], he drove cabs, and then he got into hou- public housing. And so the story I like to tell about my dad, when they first came to Denver [Colorado] after they were living with friends from the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and found their own place in public housing, at that time, public housing was a transition point. It wasn't a permanent residence. He--we lived in the Platte Valley public housing projects [Platte Valley Homes, Denver, Colorado], and the story I like to tell about my dad, when he got into public housing, he became the manager of that same pro- Platte Valley public housing project where he used to be a resident. And then, that's where he met George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown]. We were talking about George Brown, and then my dad and George Brown worked together with the Denver Housing Authority. So, so, he moved from being a resident of Platte Valley to then managing Platte Valley, and then managing the George Brown--the whole public housing system in Denver.
Speaker 2: But in terms of the career progression, it was janitor, postal worker--
Speaker 1: Cab driver, public housing.
Speaker 2: And, and with--so, with the Denver public housing system, what was his job?
Speaker 1: He was deputy to George Brown.
Speaker 2: Oh, so Brown was the director of--
Speaker 1: He became the director. He--they both started at their housing--at some--he wasn't the director when he first moved into, but he eventually became the director, dad was the deputy, and then George became lieutenant governor of the State of Colorado.
Speaker 2: Did, did George try to get your, your dad to go into politics with him?
Speaker 1: No, my dad stayed in housing--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --because he, he stayed--he, he then began with HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], and then when he retired, he was the regional director for HUD, which meant Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Utah, those Rocky Mountain states, and so he would show up at various places as the head of HUD. And he's a black guy, right? So, you, you--in Montana, they're like, "Who is this man?" But, he was qualified. What I like to say in terms of our current politics is that if my dad--he died in 1998, but if my dad knew Ben Carson [HistoryMaker Dr. Benjamin Carson, Sr.] was the head, the secretary of HUD, he--he's rolling over in his grave right now as I say that, in terms of looking at your progression and your career to know what you're doing in your job. And, so, anyway I wanted to add that editorial comment.
Speaker 2: This is your interview, sir. It is all editorial. George Brown, do you know when they met? Were they--were they--was it--was it at Denver public housing or--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was--it was--it was probably at Denver public housing when my father--you know, they probably met because Denver--again, in that '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], it was a relatively small black community that all lived basically in the same geographic boundary. So, I'm sure they met sometime during the time that my dad lived in Platte Valley public housing project because my dad's--the way they bought their first house, Earl West, who, who was--went to the University of Kansas, he start--he and Elvin Caldwell [Elvin R. Caldwell] started Equity Savings and Loan [Equity Savings and Loan Association], which is based in the Five Points [Denver, Colorado], 'cause if you wanted to be a home owner and you're black, you couldn't get a loan from a bank. So, they started Equity Savings and Loan, which is the bank that lent money to black, black people who wanted to become homeowners. So, that's--my parents [Murlee Shaw Hart and Judson Hart] bought their first house in 1950. It was through--a loan through Equ- from Equity Savings and Loan.
Speaker 2: Because they couldn't get a loan from a white bank?
Speaker 1: Because they couldn't get a loan from (Unclear) Savings Bank [ph.] or whatever. You know, so they--Earl West and Elvin Caldwell were the two black businessmen and they--you know, my father knew Earl West from the University of Kansas. And so, George Brown was in that same circle. So, as my father made his way up the ladder, George Brown was doing the same thing. And then people like Earl West and Elvin Caldwell were helping them, you know, move up the ladder. So, they probably met before my dad became the manager of the Platte Valley public housing project around that same time and then they both made their way up in the Denver Housing Authority.
Story_ID: 622075
Speaker 1: Now, you had some connection with Mr. Brown. You delivered newspapers?
Speaker 2: No, no. I was--my jo- my summer job when I was eighteen and nineteen, I was a postman because my dad [Judson Hart] worked for--he had worked for the U.S. Postal Service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service]. So, the summer jobs that--we had to--my brothers [Mondo Jud Hart and Christopher A. Hart] and I, we had to get summer jobs. I played baseball. I played baseball in the summer and my summer job, though, was delivering mail. So, I would deliver mail from six to two and then my baseball game would usually be like at four o'clock. So, I had two careers as a (laughter) eighteen--but, anyway, my dad got us jobs as postal carriers. So, one of the--and when you're a summer replacement, you--they--if someone goes on vacation in this part of the city, that part, you go out and--you, you--their--you do their route. So, when George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown] was--I knew were George lived 'cause he was a friend of my father's. He lived on Monaco Parkway, which is like the--you know, when black people start living on Monaco Parkway, it's like, oh, okay. That's where Sonny Liston--when he moved to Denver [Colorado], he moved to Monaco Parkway. I was his postal carrier, too. But, George Brown lived on Monaco, so I would use--you know, one of my summer routes, I would deliver mail to George's house. You know, I knew--it wasn't George, it was Mr. Brown. And I would deliver his mail and--
Speaker 1: He had not yet become lieutenant governor, though (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --at that--
Speaker 2: He wasn't the--
Speaker 1: --at that--
Speaker 2: He wasn't lieutenant governor.
Speaker 1: So, did you ever meet Mr. Liston?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah. I know Sonny Liston since I was a kid.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a very--he was kind of a, a--he didn't--he wasn't an outgoing personality except if it involved him trying to get a woman interested.
Speaker 1: You saw this?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause Sonny was--you know, Sonny lived in the same general neighborhood that we lived. He lived on Monaco Parkway not too far from George Brown. But, you know, if you were at a bus stop or we played pickup basketball, Sonny used to like to come out--come out when we were playing pickup basketball and just sit and watch us and, you know, make comments. And--but, if you were at a bus stop and there were a couple nice looking black women there, Sonny's Cadillac might pull up and he'd lower his window and see if he can--and he was married, right--Ernestine [sic. Geraldine Chambers Liston]--see if he could, you know, get one of the young ladies to join him in his Cadillac. And then the thing I remember, though, is that Sonny's house on Monaco Parkway, Cassius Clay, who we later knew as Muhammad Ali, I was walking home from a party late one night and I was walking past Sonny's house. This was after Cassius had won the Olympic, you know, medal in 1960 [1960 Summer Olympics, Rome, Italy], and so he was trying to get Sonny List- Sonny was a heavyweight champion at the time--he was trying to get Sonny to agree to a fight, you know, to give him a, a, a title bout. So, I was walking past Sonny's house late one night from a party on the way to my house, and this bus dr- stops and drives up and out jumps Cassius Clay. And he goes and--it's about two o'clock in the morning, right? It's about two o'clock in the morning and bangs on Sonny's--you know, they called him the Big Bear--goes and bangs on the door, "Big Bear." And so I'm, I'm standing there--I said--I knew who Clay was, right? And I knew this is Sonny's house. And so Sonny opens the door, he's got his bathrobe on, his pajamas (laughter). And so, that was--Clay was--and, and, and it paid off 'cause event- you know--
Speaker 1: What--well, did--could you hear the rest of the conversation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was--
Speaker 1: Did Sonny (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) standing right there.
Speaker 1: --curse him out for banging on his door?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did Sonny curse him out for banging on his door?
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause it's two o'clock in the morning. Sonny was not happy.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did he let him in?
Speaker 2: No. They stood out there, you know, and I'm, I'm just watching, saying this is very interesting. You know, you didn't--of course, I didn't have a camera. I didn't--you know, it's not like you had an iPhone or something (laughter), you know--
Speaker 1: But, but, but--
Speaker 2: --in those days.
Speaker 1: But, but, but in today's world, you could've called TMZ and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --made some money.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Just tell them the story. Guess what I just saw?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter). So, eventually, Sonny decided he--you know, okay, 'cause he thought--he just thought Clay was just this hot head young--he's gonna--he's gonna kick his butt thoroughly. That was his--what was on his mind, you know. But, but, Clay, you could--he was campaigning to get him to fight him, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a promoter par excellence.
Speaker 1: Before a promoter.
Speaker 2: Before a promoter.
Speaker 1: Yeah with the poems. I mean, he was such a genius.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Genius.
Speaker 2: But, but I tell people that story. They say, "Do you know Sonny Liston? Did you ever meet--?" "Yeah, I knew Sonny Liston." And I tell the story about when I was just--happened to be walking by and this bus drives up and screeches, two o'clock in the morning, it's Clay banging on the Bear's door (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) you got to put that in a book.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's, that's one of the many unknown anecdotes about--
Speaker 2: And that was on Monaco Parkway in Denver. And so George Brown's house was down the street not too far from Sonny's house. And Joe Louis, he lived in Denver for a while--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --which is one of the reasons that Sonny moved there in addition to the Catholic priest who kind of adopted him and convinced him not to be a thug anymore, 'cause he was just out of, you know, prison. He, he learned how to box in prison. And then I don't know if you, you know who Ronnie Lyle [Ron Lyle] is. Ronnie Lyle was a heavyweight boxer who grew up with me. We used to play basketball together. He's a couple years older. He, he went to jail when he was--for, for manslaughter. He got into a fight in an alley and killed somebody. They sent him to Canon City [Colorado State Penitentiary, Canon City, Colorado]. He learned to fight in, in Canon City, which is a state prison in Colorado. Ronnie Lyle was a heavyweight contender, so he fought--he fought Ali, who was now at that point Ali, later in his career. But, Ronnie Lyle, that's one of the reasons he got into boxing 'cause he knew that Sonny was a former convict who learned how to box in prison and maybe I can I make a career out of this. So, Joe Louis lived down the street on Monaco, George Brown, then here's Sonny's house and Clay drives up and--two o'clock in the morning.

Speaker 1: This is obviously after your high school years, but in addition to the actress, Pam--the person who would become the actress, Pam Grier, you had a number of notables from your high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. East Denver High School [East High School], East Denver High School is the oldest public high school in Denver [Colorado] and it--it's right next to City Park. So, the second house that my parents [Murlee Shaw Hart and Judson Hart] bought on Josephine Street, my brothers and I, we all attended East Denver High School. We'd just walk across City Park to the school. This northeast Denver neighborhood was predominantly black, Mexican American, Asian, and then the other side of the high school were where the affluent white kids came, so we all kind of met here at East Denver High School. But, Hattie McDaniel attended East Denver High School. Don Cheadle, Philip Bailey, Earth, Wind and Fire, Pam Grier are among those that attended East Denver High School. My, my brother, Chris Hart [Christopher A. Hart], who is the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Robert Smith [HistoryMaker Robert F. Smith] who is the second wealthiest behind Opra- Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] in the country. Robert Smith is worth about 2.5 billion [dollars]. He's in, in private equity in Austin, Texas.
Speaker 1: He's a silent billionaire who doesn't talk--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --to reporters (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct. Yeah, but he's worth about 2.5 billion. So, he and I support a lot of activities at East--at East Denver High School over the years. So, last September, my younger brother, Chris, was nominated into the East Denver High School hall of fame. They call it the Heritage Gallery [sic. Heritage Hall]. So, we were all together last September. So, Robert Smith and I were two of the sponsors of this, this big dinner and this big event. And people like Pam Grier, they're already in the hall of fame and, you know, Don Cheadle, Philip Bailey. So, Larry Dunn is one of the people that was also inducted the same time that my brother was, and he was one of the founding members of, of Earth, Wind and Fire. He's also a East Denver High School graduate. So, those are the African American--Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., who founded--one of the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was a graduate of East Denver High School. Sidney Sheldon, who is a--you know, bestselling author, he's passed away. So, there's a, a lot of famous black and white graduates of East Denver High School.
Story_ID: 622077
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: First one I went to when I was living in Platte Valley [Platte Valley Homes, Denver, Colorado] was Gilpin Elementary School [Gilpin Montessori School, Denver, Colorado] and then when my parents [Murlee Shaw Hart and Judson Hart] moved to their first house that they bought, I was going to Columbine Elementary School [Denver, Colorado]. And then after that, I went to Smiley Junior High School [William H. Smiley Junior High School; McAuliffe International School, Denver, Colorado] prior to going to East, East Denver High School [East High School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: So, let's go back to your first elementary school. Do you remember your teachers? Do you remember your principal?
Speaker 2: At Gilpin?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I rem- I, I don't remember their names. I remember an experience that I had, that my mother used to still recount 'cause I was a--I was a good reader and they'd have you in reading circles. And my mother, again, being an active parent, we had a reading circle, so as a, a young--this--I was six years old.
Speaker 1: First grade.
Speaker 2: First grade, a six year old white girl sitting next to me that couldn't read as well as I could read, and I loved reading Dick Tracy. And so we were reading, you know, Dick and Jane, and so she was--you know, go in the circle, she had a hard time reading Dick and Jane, and so I leaned over and said, "As a matter of fact, yes," which is from Dick Tracy. And so she said--reading Dick and Janes, "As a matter of fact, yes." And the teacher is like--and the teacher looked at me like, "Okay, Phil Hart [HistoryMaker Philip Hart]," 'cause she told my--she told my mother. She said, "You're not--you know, not only are you not helping her read what's in Dick and Jane, but you're giving her something from Dick Tracy," you know. So, I probably said something like, I thought Dick Tracy's girlfriend was Jane (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you were a wiseacre at a young age, huh?
Speaker 2: But, I was--like my mother likes to say, as the middle child, I was a wiseacre, the quietest of the three boys, but the one that got in the most trouble, but you didn't know about it or get other--my brothers in trouble, but it was like they get blamed but not me.
Speaker 1: So, how many years were you in this first elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, Gilpin, I was just there for a brief period 'cause they then moved to the--to the house from the projects and I went--then went to Columbine Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Columbine--oh, oh, and do you remember your--
Speaker 2: Columbine is the state flower of Colorado, so it's Columbine Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: I remember the principal, Ms. London [ph.], was the principal and, again, they were all white teachers, all white principals, but a mosaic of student population, K through six [kindergarten to sixth grade]. It was a K through six.
Speaker 1: Why do you remember the principal?
Speaker 2: 'Cause she was mean and her husband died, and I remember that was the first time I felt sorry for her because it was--she was called away from school one day and then we found out that her husband died. So, it was like--you know, you really feel sympathy for somebody that you had thought was really a taskmaster, and she had been called out of school because her husband had died.
Speaker 1: So--but, before her husband died, before you began to feel sympathy for her, give me an example of some of the things that she did or said that led you to conclude that she was mean.
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, I, I would get in trouble, but I could, I could--I--people didn't know that it was me. It was always someone else that would get called to the principal's office. So, I saw her, you know, call a lot of my friends to the principal's office. But, she was very supportive, too, even though she was mean 'cause we--Columbine Elementary School, we had a cerebral palsy school across the street and so we developed a, a, a, a kinship between the two schools, like--so, a lot of my friends as I was growing up were not only Columbine Elementary School, but students at this--that had cerebral palsy. And so I was in the color guard, so in the morning, we not only raised the flag in front of Columbine Elementary School, then we'd go across the street and raise the flag at the cerebral palsy school. So, I remember one morning, you know, when Mrs.--Ms. London--Mrs. London was particularly mean was when we raised the flag at Columbine, then we went over across the street to raise the flag there, but when we raised it, we looked up and said, "Oh, it's upside down" (laughter). So, she came running across the street and chastised us. So, I remember that. And then one of our teachers I remember is Mr. White [ph.], 'cause, again, my mother knew all the teachers 'cause she wanted to get into teaching, so all the teachers knew that she was--she had a lot of promise, so she developed a relationship with all of our teachers.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: I was a very good student. I liked social sciences like, like my dad [Judson Hart] and I liked history. I liked science, math, and I was a very good student and a very good athlete.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't have to worry about finishing your homework.
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: And your parents weren't really helping you with your homework?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother would help, yeah.
Speaker 1: If, if you needed it.
Speaker 2: Yeah. My dad was working all the time, but my mother would help if I needed help. And then my older brother [Mondo Jud Hart] would help 'cause that's--and then I would help my younger brother [Christopher A. Hart]. So, we were--we kind of tutored each other and we would--you know, we were going through the same schools, having some of the same teachers, so my older brother with me and my--me with my younger brother, we kind of helped guide and tutor and--
Story_ID: 622078
Speaker 1: So, at what point did you begin playing sports in school?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Junior high school?
Speaker 2: No, elementary school.
Speaker 1: Elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Our, our sixth grade team, the Columbine Cardinals, was the city sixth grade champion. We, we were undefeated. But, we--Columbine Elementary School [Denver, Colorado], again, is in a predominantly black neighborhood. The school itself didn't have a gym and so we had to go to the Park Hill neighborhood [Denver, Colorado], which is predominantly white, to Stedman [Stedman Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] because they had a gym, so our Columbine team, we still called ourselves the Columbine Cardinals, but we had to go to Stedman to play 'cause they had a gym. And we beat all their teams. You know, we beat all their teams. And when, when I made a reference earlier to, to my friend, Bobby Hamm's father, he was a professional boxer, he's the one--he'd get off--'cause he'd get off--he was a postal carrier, so he'd finish his job at two o'clock and he could--he had a big Jeep, he could take us to--from Columbine to Stedman to play. And we beat up all their teams so bad that one--and the--but the physical education teacher who was also the referee, we beat up--all the Stedman team so bad that at the--one time, he tried to--when we were behind, right, he tried to--at the end of the third quarter, we played four quarters, he tried to say the game is over 'cause the Stedman team was ahead, right? And Mr. Hamm came over and said, "They got one more quarter to play. I think you better finish the game." And, of course, we finished the game and we--
Speaker 1: This is Mr. Hamm, the professional boxer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The professional boxer. And, of course, we finished the game and we won. So, we--so, anyway, sixth grade, I started basketball, baseball, football, track. I was a multisport athlete starting in the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: The name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Smiley Junior High School [William H. Smiley Junior High School; McAuliffe International School, Denver, Colorado]. That was in the Park Hill neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that experience?
Speaker 2: I--that was a very good high school--a very, very good junior high school experience. Again, I was, you know, with a mosaic of students. I've always--growing up was with black students, Mexican American, Asian, white, whatever, and Smiley was the same situation. I remember there, again, all of our sports teams were, were city champions and my physical education teacher, Carle Stearns, was a star football player--had been a star football player at the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado]. And he was a very much of a stern taskmaster. And his son, John Stearns, used to tag aroun- around with us and John Stearns later became a star football player and baseball at University of Colorado, and then a catcher with the New York Mets. They--and they called him John, John Bad, Bad Man Stearns [sic. Bad Dude], something like that 'cause he was like his dad. He was like, you know, intense. But I remember him as a kid. Then, I--when he became a catcher with the New York Mets, I remember going and watching him play and--with his dad and we'd just say, "Oh, John is a Major League baseball player now" (laughter). But, Smiley was a very good school academically, athletically and, and so I achieved both, in both those areas.
Speaker 1: So, I assume that that system at the time was six, three, three? Six years elementary, three years junior--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and three years high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, elementary was K through six [kindergarten to sixth grade], then--
Speaker 1: K through--
Speaker 2: --seven, seven through nine, junior high school, then ten through twelve, high school.
Speaker 1: In junior high school in addition to sports, did you have any interest in band, choir, student council, anything else?
Speaker 2: No, I mainly played sports 'cause I played every sport, so I was busy playing sports and trying to get good grades. And, of course, you're interested in girls and, and, you know, I had--even in those days, you know, if you had a girlfriend, it was generally a black or Mexican American or Asian. Whites were--girls were still kind of off limits even though they, they--you know, they wanted to date me or other black guys, but their parents wouldn't, wouldn't approve of it.
Speaker 1: What did your parents [Murlee Shaw Hart and Judson Hart] think about that, you dating out of your circle as it were?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the--my neighbors, they--you know, my first girlfriend when we moved to Vine Street was Sandra Endesola [ph.], a Mexican American family that lived next door. That was my first girlfriend. And then Charlotte Shimazu [ph.], a Japanese American, so my parents didn't have any issue with that.

Speaker 1: High school, what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: East Denver High School [East High School], the oldest public high school in the City of Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember a lot of my teachers. Mr. Hinderlider was my fifth grade teacher and, again, this story involves Bobby Hamm's father, the former professional boxer 'cause Mr. Hinderlider was a former Marine [U.S. Marine Corps]. And so he thought he could introduce some Marine disciplinary measures into the fifth grade classroom [at Columbine Elementary School, Denver, Colorado]. So, I remember if you had done something that he didn't approve of, you would have to go to the back of the room and sit like you were sitting in your desk, but you didn't have your--actually have your desk there.
Speaker 1: So, you're sitting on air.
Speaker 2: So, you're sitting on air, and so you have to do that for maybe a half hour, forty-five minutes. That was his form of discipline. He was a former Marine. But, the thing I remember, though, is that one time we were having an assembly in the auditorium and so we're sitting there--you know, I was in Mr. Hinderlider's class, and there was a commotion out in the hallway outside the auditorium, so Mr. Hinderlider opened the door to go out and, you know, see what was going on, shut the door, and didn't know that the door was locked. And so, we were sitting there when Mr. Hinderlider came back, he couldn't come in. So, he was knocking on the door and, and none--we just (makes face).
Speaker 1: No one heard anything.
Speaker 2: Nobody heard anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, in high school, who, who, who was your--who was your favorite--
Speaker 2: Probably Mr. Linbloom [ph.], Mr. Linbloom in the tenth grade, the reason I, I decided to pursue a degree and become a sociologist essentially. Mr. Linbloom was--his, his degree was in sociology, and so he was my--one of my twelfth grade teachers, social sciences. And so I liked him. He was a very, very good teacher, and I really got interested in social sciences, learned what economics, sociology, psychology, social psychology, political science. It was mainly because of him.
Story_ID: 622080
Speaker 1: Prior to twelfth grade, if someone had asked you, what do you want to be when you grow up, what would have been your answer?
Speaker 2: Either professional baseball player or professional basketball player 'cause one reason I convinced my parents--like I said, I worked in the po- at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] in the summer, but I, I was done by two, I could be at the baseball game by four [o'clock], and I convinced my parents--and I was very good. You know, all--a lot of my friends were going on to Major League careers--that if they let me continue my baseball playing in the summer, I would eventually become a Major League baseball player. And the point--going back to my father [Judson Hart] and my younger brother, one summer when my father was the manager of the Platte Valley public housing project [Platte Valley Homes, Denver, Colorado], you know, when rent day is due, when--you know, people--if you're, if you're a criminal, you know that there's a lot of money in there 'cause people paying their rent. So, one rent day, end of the month, first of the month, some guys came in and--with sawed off shotguns, my father's office and robbed Platte Valley public housing project. And my father--I remember him telling us--he was--they said, "Hit the floor," and my father immediately hit the floor. The other staff was like in shock and so my father, "Hit the floor," you know, 'cause--and so they, they were robbed. So, that was early in the day. My younger brother, Chris [Christopher A. Hart], had a paper route. He was out again, you know, go--you know, getting the payments for--from his customers and he was pedaling on his bike up near--he was up near George Brown's [HistoryMaker George L. Brown] house, Monaco Parkway, and he was robbed by two--robbed of his Denver Post [The Denver Post] money (laughter). And so they ba- I, I was at home after a baseball game, you know, in the evening, sitting there watching TV in the basement. They both came home talking about how on the very same day, they both got robbed. And I told my mother [Murlee Shaw Hart], I said, "You know what?" And--'cause they were always on me about you need--you need to get another job. I was all, "You know what? That's why I don't need to get another job. Just let me keep playing baseball, Little League baseball in the afternoon," you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well (laughter)--I'm--well, I guess that worked for a minute.
Speaker 2: And it ends up that the two guys that robbed my little brother, they--my older brother's name is Jud [Mondo Jud Hart]--the two guys that robbed my little brother said, "Oh, you're Jud's brother" (laughter). So we knew the two guys that robbed (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --my younger brother.
Speaker 1: Did you take recompense at some point?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did at some point.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I can't--I can't confess to that at this point.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But something happened to those--
Speaker 2: Something happened, yeah.
Speaker 1: Something happened to those guys (laughter).
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't want to--you know, this interview to end up in the wrong hands. I don't know if the statute of limitations--
Speaker 1: That's if--
Speaker 2: --has passed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, if they're still alive, you know, you're, you're okay. If they're dead, that's another problem (laughter). What happened to those boys (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, boy. So, at what point did you--well, did you actually try to go out for the minors? Did you--did you pursue (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this dream of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --professional--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I was--but I was--I, I was always a very good student, so it was always--I, I, I--when I first went to college, I got an athletic scholarship and an academic scholarship and, you know, I'll--East High School [Denver, Colorado] itself has sent a lot of guys to the pro ranks. And so when I got to University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], you know, football players, basketball players were all--you know, everybody thought you were gonna go. If you played on the football team or on the basketball team, you thought you were gonna go play in professional--NBA [National Basketball Association] or NFL [National Football League] or Major League Baseball [MLB]. And what I--and I was a good student and I tried--what I tried to do was, was tell--especially the black players but including the white players, you have a athletic scholarship for--so, so, so for four years, you're basically getting a free education if you take advantage of it 'cause the, the coaches, what they would do especially with black players, they, they try to keep you eligible, but you may not be on a track that--
Speaker 1: Get a degree.
Speaker 2: --that you're gonna get a degree. And then if you're the--if you're, you're the young man, you're like, well I'm gonna be--I'm gonna play in the NBA. I'm playing--you know, I don't need a college degree. And I was--I tried--my role was really to try to convince them. You get--you have four years, so I, I--again, I was being a tutor to them and I graduated. I was an honors graduate. I was a varsity athlete. I graduated in four years, inducted into University of Colorado hall of fame about twenty-one years ago with Dick Anderson who played for the Miami Dolphins undefeated team in 1972. He went to Boulder High School [Boulder, Colorado], so I'd known him since he was in high school. Our teams were rivals. So, I did have aspirations to be a professional athlete 'cause I--baseball was--I liked number one, basketball was number two, football was number three, and then I also participated in track. But, when I finished University of Colorado, I got offered to go to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]--you know, graduate studies and got my master's [degree] and Ph.D. there. And I played semi-pro basketball. They had a league in Ohio, Michigan. I played for the Lansing [Michigan] team. But all--a lot of my friends were playing at the ABA [American Basketball Association], NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball.
Story_ID: 622081
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the Hart household. So, it's your mom [Murlee Shaw Hart], your dad [Judson Hart], and you and your two brothers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you guys have chores?
Speaker 2: Yeah and in addition to that, my mother's sister lived--older sister lived, lived near us, so she had three girls, so we were really kind of like a combined three boys, three girls--my mother, my father, my Aunt Pearl [Pearl Shaw Dillard], she was married--by the time she died, she was married four or five times, so she was kind of like Elizabeth Taylor. You know, she attracted men and she would divorce you if she, she got tired of you.
Speaker 1: Serial monogamist.
Speaker 2: Yes. But, she was very, very--I love my Aunt Pearl. So, we'd all gather. Like, holidays would be a family thing and then we'd have other people come. And my parents, the house--houses that they had were--you know, were big houses. Denver [Colorado] has nice big houses even the--in the predominantly black neighborhood, brick houses. So, we had a big house and holidays, we'd--you know, my parents, and my mother and my aunt were very good cooks. My, my--and my father was a very good cook, too, 'cause his father [Alvin Hart] was the one that was a chef. So, sometimes people would come from Kansas and my father and my grandfather and my mother would cook. And my Aunt Pearl, her specialty was the desserts, especially around holiday, holiday time. She--she'd supply all the desserts. So, you know, I've, I've nothing but positive and, and good memories about my family gatherings and then they were very open to involving others in the--in the family gatherings. And family members would come from other parts of the country and just good times, really.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of chores did your parents require you guys to do?
Speaker 2: Well, when we moved to Josephine Street, Josephine Street was a corner lot, so we had a big yard, big backyard, big front yard, side yard, so mowing the lawn, which took a--quite a while, and you had three boys.
Speaker 1: And you have the push lawnmower, not the gas powered lawnmower.
Speaker 2: Well, early on, we had the push. Later, we had a power. And then, of course Denver, it snows, so then you had to shovel the snow. And I--the, the--you know, so you're talking about the porch coming down, here, all the way down to the alley, and you had to do that before you went to school. So, that was--that was a, a very strenuous chore. And, of course, at a certain point, my dad is saying, "I got three boys, you guys are gonna do all that. I'm not doing that." So, that was our responsibility in terms of mowing the grass, pulling the weeds, taking care of the lawn, so, I, I, I know how to do that, and then shoveling the snow.
Speaker 1: How deep do you recall an average snowfall in, in the winter in Denver back in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, Denver had--Denver has a very interesting climate because I remember summer--winters sometime it might be sunny and seventy-five degrees on Christmas Day. Other Christmases it might be seven, five feet of snow. And so--but--so whatever the, the height of the snow was, we had to get out and take care of it, if it was a school day, before school. If it was not a school day, we still had to get out and do it early just so you could traverse, you know. And, and, like I said, we lived on a big corner lot, so there was a lot of grass, there were a lot of side--there was a lot of sidewalk, so I'm just glad I had two brothers so we could kind of split it three ways.
Speaker 1: Was either one of you a slacker?
Speaker 2: No. My older brother probably was the, the slacker. He would say--my older brother, Jud, likes to say he, he lived the bohemian life 'cause he was--he's, he's a visual artist. He's a very well known visual artist in San Francisco [California], Mondo Jud Hart. But, he got into girls early. He was the artistic one. He was actually a, a pen pal of Walt Disney 'cause he, he, he liked to draw the Disney characters. And so in the basement of our house, my parents kind of like--that--that's the boys' areas. And so he--on the walls of the ba- our house, he would draw--he liked Goofy, Donald Duck. He liked Disney characters. And my parents let him--it was like a little gallery. So, he was the artistically inclined. I'm--I was the, the athlete. My, my older brother was a very good track athlete, though. He was track and field, sprints, broad jump. I was the--probably the superior athlete of the three boys. I was in the social sciences and my younger brother, Chris [Christopher A. Hart], was the engineer, the math genius. So, not to stereotype, but the artistic older brother was the one that my parents had the most trouble making sure he did what was needed to do. So, if--he was the one that was most likely to slack if there was gonna be any slack. And so if that occurred, then it left me and my younger brother, you know, to pick up the pieces.
Story_ID: 622082
Speaker 1: Were both of your parents disciplinarians? Let me put it another way. Was one more of a disciplinarian than the other?
Speaker 2: They were both disciplinarians but different. My father [Judson Hart] was very hardworking. He, you know, like the black men in that era, he had a coup- at least a couple jobs, two or three jobs even if he had a--even if he had a primary job. And so he was gone from the house more than my mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] 'cause even when my mother got her job teaching, she was like--you know, the tea- the day would start at eight and it would end by three [o'clock], so she's--you know, and we--and we'd be out of the school the same time that she'd be home from, from her job. So, my father was more the, the belt disciplinarian. My mother was more the, the soft, guiding you in the right direction and do things like withhold your allowance or other things that would try to make you do the right thing.
Speaker 1: So, corporal punishment was part of your upbringing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you ever--
Speaker 2: Switch, belts, yes.
Speaker 1: For what kind of misdeed?
Speaker 2: Well, it would vary. I mean, if you--you know, if you didn't take care of the snow before you went to school and my dad would come home from a hard day at work and there was still some unshoveled snow that could lead to a little corporal punishment.
Speaker 1: What did you think about that?
Speaker 2: I just thought that was--that's how parents disciplined children. It was not like--I mean, I, suppose if you look at it in today's world, it wasn't like it was so severe where you were, you know--but, you know, today's world, I suppose peop- people would call you on it and say we're gonna call children's service because you're being brutal to that child. I just--that's what parents did to kids at--when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, my--our, our youngest daughter reminds me to this day about when I took her out of the car and spanked her on the side of the road, and she's saying, "All of those people were watching me," and I said, "Nobody knew who you were in"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, anyway.
Speaker 2: But in those, those days, too, I mean, it was other--not only your parents. I mean, it was--it--we, we--you look at in--the neighbors in those days, we were really like extended families. You knew who lived in this house, you knew the kids, and if you were doing some--if I was doing something wrong and two blocks away, one of my friend--my parents' friends could call me on it and, you know--
Speaker 1: And then call your mom and--
Speaker 2: And then call my mother and my father and I'd pay attention. I mean, they wouldn't necessarily come out and beat me with a belt--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, but they would call me on it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and expect me to, to behave.
Story_ID: 622083
Speaker 1: So, now, at college, you're majoring in the socials- in sociology?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I--when I, I, I went to Colorado College when I was a freshman. It's a private liberal arts college in Colorado Springs [Colorado] and I--a very good academic program and I was a basketball star. I remember that Colorado College, we played Creighton University in Omaha [Nebraska] when Paul Silas was the star of Creighton, and Creighton didn't have a football team, so we were the--they played--they had a basketball homecoming. We were their basketball homecoming opponent and played at Omaha Auditorium [Omaha Civic Auditorium, Omaha, Nebraska], and we took the train from Colorado Springs there. And I remember we lost, but--and Paul Silas went for about thirty-five points and twenty-five rebounds. I went for about twenty-five points and about fifteen rebounds. But say that--but say, you know, Paul Silas, went on to a very good career in the NBA [National Basketball Association]. But, one of my friends who was on my team, Bob Heiny, he was a professor of mathematics at Colorado State University [sic. University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado], passed away last year, and in, in his obituary, one of the things he says in the obituary that he remembers is that--'cause he was the one that was guarding Paul Silas, Paul Silas had thirty-five, twenty-five, Bob in his obituary had, and I held Paul Silas to under forty (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Significant moments in life.
Speaker 2: So, anyway, I went to Colorado College as a freshman. Then, I, I--you know, I transferred to the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] and, and became a scholarship athlete, University of Colorado. And, yes, from my freshman year because of Mr. Linbloom [ph.] in high school [East High School, Denver, Colorado], I wanted to pursue the social sciences. I didn't know whether it was gonna be economics, sociology, psychology, but it ended up being sociology. And so my bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado is in sociology with a minor in mathematics.
Story_ID: 622084
Speaker 1: Did you work between college and your--and your graduate program at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked in the summer. I--after I graduated from the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] in 1966, I was accepted and, and became a--work--went to Washington, D.C., to work for the Office of Economic Opportunity. I was a program assistant, was my title. It was a summer job. Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was the president. Jules Richmond [Julius B. Richmond] was the head of--Sargent Shriver [R. Sargent Shriver] was the head of OEO. Jules Richmond ran the--worked in the Office of Economic Opportunity, which essentially provided grants to various community organizations, so that was the first time I met [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry 'cause one of my jobs was to go out with a senior person and, you know, agencies that they granted funds to go out and kind of do a site visit.
Speaker 1: So, Marion Barry at that point was running a community development (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pride, Incorporated.
Speaker 1: --program, community action program.
Speaker 2: Called Pride, Incorporated.
Speaker 1: Pride, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I'm trying to remember his partner. It was Julius Catfish Mayfield [sic. Rufus Mayfield] or something like that. And then Topper Carew was--I don't know if you know who Topper Carew was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, TB [ph.].
Speaker 2: Topper, Topper was running the New Thing for Art and Architecture [sic. New Thing Art and Architecture Center, Washington, D.C.], so there were two of our community action grants is what we called them. So, I was--my job was to go out to site visit these agencies that received funds. So, that was my summer job before I went to Michigan State as a graduate student.
Speaker 1: Do you recall an impression of Marion Barry? Do you recall anything about him at that point in his life?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, what--
Speaker 2: Well, the Pride, Incorporated, what they were doing was essentially providing kind of--in today's world, you--you'd call it a youth program where they're working with young people in the Washington, D.C. area to--you know, tutorials, help them in school, job training in the summer and actual jobs in the summertime 'cause I was there in the summertime. So, he was, he was a serious community oriented, community organizing type of individual and--as was his partner, and Topper Carew was the same thing. And that, that was the--and I met Lyndon Johnson as well that summer because they had--all of our, our summer employees that were there, we were--we went to the White House [Washington, D.C.] and he entertained us basically at the White House in that sum- so, it was the summer of '66 [1966]. Then, the fall is when I went to Michigan State University for graduate school.
Speaker 1: But, let me just go back a second. So, you met President Lyndon Johnson.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And he talked to, to you all as a group?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or, or--
Speaker 2: And some of us as individuals.
Speaker 1: Did he talk to you as an individual?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember anything that he said to you, any--
Speaker 2: Well, one reason he talked to me and others from the office that I worked in 'cause, 'cause, again, Sargent Shriver was the head of OEO. So you look at all the other programs where you had summer interns there, I, I was an intern but I was getting paid, and my job was program assistant, that Sargent Shriver was a Kennedy family person.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Maria's [Maria Shriver] dad.
Speaker 2: Yes. And so Lyndon Johnson liked what OEO represented and so when I met him, he had, you know, a few of us come into the Oval Office. We had a big, big thing and then he had a few of us come in the Oval Office just to--so we could--you, you kind of do a little quiz of, "What, what do you do? Where are you from?" You know, that kind of thing. And Sargent Shriver was, was there as well.
Speaker 1: Did he tell any jokes?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Did he tell any jokes? Lyndon Johnson?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay. I was--'cause, you know, he had a--
Speaker 2: I know he was a jokester but, I mean, he, he didn't--we were--we were like twenty-one year olds and twenty-two year olds, so some of his more off color jokes--
Speaker 1: He, he--
Speaker 2: --I don't think he felt--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was a proper.
Speaker 1: It would be appropriate for--
Speaker 2: Be appropriate--
Speaker 1: --for the young men, yeah.
Speaker 2: --for the young men and young women in the room with him.
Speaker 1: So, that--was obviously, OEO was part of his Great Society program--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which--much of which exists to this day.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I will add an editorial comment. And some people are trying to deconstruct it.
Speaker 2: Yes. It was a very good program 'cause I--I'm--like I say, you just look at the two individuals I mentioned that I came in contact with who had--who received community action grants. Whatever you say about Marion Barry, his goods and his bads, he became the mayor of Washington, D.C., still very popular even though he has passed away in Washington, D.C. You look at the career that Topper Carew was able to carve out as a film and TV producer, trained as an architect. That's why his organization was called the New Thing for Art and Architecture.
Speaker 1: And, and this--we're gonna get to this later in the interview, but Marion Barry was the architect of the beginning of Washington's rebuilding.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: The development that we see today began during his term of office--
Speaker 2: Yes, and beyond--
Speaker 1: --when--
Speaker 2: --that just the extent that he went to to make sure that minority business enterprises participated in the redevelopment of Washington, D.C., unlike any--even Walter Washington before him, but unlike any mayor to make sure there was inclusion by the majority of, of Washington, D.C., African American.
Story_ID: 622085
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s], so, you graduated from the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] in 1966.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: So, your college years coincided with some of the early days, or not the days but the height of the Civil Rights Movement down south.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Freedom Riders '61 [1961], voter registration drives in Mississippi '64 [1964], assassinations got--you know, sixty--the bombing of the churches in Birmingham [Alabama]. While all of this is going on in the South, were you impacted by any of that in, in Colorado? Were you--was, was there any, I don't know, ancillary Civil Rights Movement going on in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, 'cause we had an NAACT--NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter in Denver [Colorado], so there was--there was a lot of activism and support. I remember when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Denver and spoke and in addition, people like I mentioned before Elvin Caldwell [Elvin R. Caldwell], Earl West, my dad [Judson Hart] were financial supporters of activity, Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC], you know, other activities where you had--not only Denver, but other cities, African American, American businesspeople or middle class status who had the means to financially support activity in the South, which I, I was aware of.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think about taking off from college and going down and joining the marchers?
Speaker 2: Well, we still were going to Tennessee, so I was still in from--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: --that standpoint.
Speaker 1: No, I meant like joining the civil rights protests, you know, the voter registration--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No. I, I didn't do that. And I involved myself in other ways on the--on the campuses, specifically in terms of, of black athletes--
Speaker 1: Encouraging them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) black students.
Speaker 1: --to get their degree.
Speaker 2: Well, also to be--to be different than the stereotypical black athlete. 'Cause even now when I tell my younger friends that I played major Division I college basketball and I graduated in 1966, they looked at me like, you were a pioneer. You know, because my--University of Colorado, we had fifteen scholarship athletes on the basketball team, five of whom were black. And so one of the other things I was aware of that I, I kind of became--that I spoke out about was the quota, quota system. Color--University of Colorado at the time was in the Big Eight [Big Eight Conference], University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], Jo Jo White was the star. But, we had five black players. So, if we played at home, there might be two black starters. The five black guys were the best players if I may say that, two black starters. If we got in trouble, maybe three. If we were on the road, he might start three. If we got in trouble, maybe four, but never five because--especially at home because you had the boosters, you had the alumni and they're like, you know, the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So, unlike today when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was a quota system and so in terms of me speaking out--I'm, I'm not saying I'm like [HistoryMaker] Harry Edwards, but aware of that and making a point about that to the coaches and the players, that we wanna win. I wanna win. I--my whole career, I've--my, my sports teams have been winning teams and we--it hasn't been like how many black, white, what--you know, it was like who's the best players? So, that's what I was used to. So, when I got to college, it's like if we wanna win, if we wanna beat Kansas at home, we got the five--play all five of the black guys.
Speaker 1: But, that wasn't going to happen.
Speaker 2: That wasn't going to happen.
Speaker 1: So, Kansas beat you.
Speaker 2: So, Kansas beat us. And in those days, only the--sixteen teams went to the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament in those days, the conference champions. So, if you were second place, you didn't go. Kansas was generally ahead of us.
Speaker 1: So different from today when, when a lot of teams are all--for, for any Division I school are--mostly are all black.
Speaker 2: Well, I go to University of Colorado games--basketball games now and I see fifteen guys, scholarship guys, sitting on the bench, maybe two of them are white.
Speaker 1: And one of them is from Europe.
Speaker 2: Right. And so it's just--that's how it is now. But, in my day, five of us were black out of fifteen scholarship athletes and there were clear quotas. And I would go and speak to the coach about that, so they kind of regarded me--even though I was a very good player, I was kind of like--and I was--I did well in class. So, it was like, no, you're not gonna tell me to take this route 'cause I--when I finish, I'm gonna have a degree. And, you know, and I--do you wanna win or are you gonna be more concerned that you lose to Kansas and the next Monday you don't--you're not gonna hear from the alumni and the boosters or you can play the five of us, we beat Kansas, and on Monday, yeah, you're gonna hear from the, the alum- but you won.
Speaker 1: Well, what did the coaches say to your argument?
Speaker 2: They use the quota system.
Speaker 1: They said that?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't say that. It's like my fir- like, like I said earlier, my first girlfriend [Sandra Endesola (ph.)] was Mexican American. I've had Asian girlfriends, had white girlfriends before I went to the University of Colorado. First me- I was a point guard.
Story_ID: 622086
Speaker 1: You were point guard.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And you had many relationships, shall we say?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, the--my, my coll- college coach at University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], Russell "Sox" Walseth, who is a legend in Colorado. The basketball floor that they play in is called Russell Sox Walseth floor [Sox Walseth Court]; he's passed away. But, my first meeting, I remember--and like I said, I had all kinds of girlfriends before I got there of different races. My first meeting with him, I thought we were gonna talk about basketball kind of stuff. But, the point he made to me was, "I don't want to hear or see that you are dating a white girl here on campus." That was my first--subject of our first meeting. And I'm like, okay--and I'm coming from a, a mosaic of growing up with having had girlfriends from all types of racial ethnic backgrounds and so it's kind of like, okay. Was I gonna listen to him? I mean, I--you know, I wanted to keep my scholarship. I wanted to participate. But, I knew that I wanted--I, I wanted to achieve certain things academically as well. And I, I, I didn't have anybody on the academic side ever approach or meet with me and say--make some suggestions as to whom I should not associate with; my basketball coach did.
Speaker 1: Do you think he was speaking for those on the academic side?
Speaker 2: To a certain extent, but he's mainly speaking for the boosters, the alumni that--
Speaker 1: Funded--
Speaker 2: --that funded--that were important parts of funding what the public funds didn't provide, that they, you know, would be unhappy.
Speaker 1: You, you just made me remember something and I had intended to, to, to go back to it and I forgot. You, you referenced earlier in our conversation being aware of--well, who wasn't if you were black, of being aware of the brutal killing of Emmett Till.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And the instructions that your older--oldest--
Speaker 2: Older--
Speaker 1: --brother [Mondo Jud Hart] was given--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about what he was and was not supposed to do--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in visiting Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Your, your [paternal] grandparents [Dorothy Butler Hart and Alvin Hart] and your family in Tennessee. Now, you were old enough to, to see the--did you--did, did they allow you to see the front page of Jet magazine?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you saw--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you read it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do, do you recall how that impacted you or, or, or did you think this is like something that happened in another world or another place in--
Speaker 2: No, I knew, I knew it was--I knew it was part of my world and, again, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm light skinned and we have our own discussion about shades of race in our own group.
Speaker 1: Color consciousness.
Speaker 2: Color consciousness. But the bottom line is that I'm African American, and so when we went to Tennessee and my parents [Murlee Shaw Hart and Judson Hart] and my grandparents gave that lecture to my brother soon after Emmett Till, we were there in the South, not in the same state, and we were aware that we had to kind of watch what we did versus being in Denver [Colorado] 'cause there could be con- there could be consequences that maybe they couldn't control themselves as our parents and our grandparents. So, I was aware of it. So, it wasn't like it was another world. It was like, this is my world. This is the world that I'm growing up in. And even though I'm growing up in a city where it's--people are saying it's more progressive on the issue of race or more liberal, you know, there's still things that you got directed at you. I mean, it--going back to my basketball, I'm light skinned so, you know, when my, my East Denver High School [East High School, Denver, Colorado] team when I was a senior, we had four black starters. I was number ten. We, we play in the big city auditorium [Denver Municipal Auditorium, Denver, Colorado], so when my team would show up, some people would say, I thought the--to--my brother would be sitting there, my older brother, "I thought there were four black starters on East and where is number ten?" And my brother would say to them, "Wait 'til the game starts." And so they'd see this fast, high jumping light skinned Steph Curry [Stephen Curry] of that era (laughter).
Speaker 1: Steph Curry, whoa (laughter), high praise, indeed. Okay, I just wanted to, to--because Emmett Till is such a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But that was--you know, I mean, we were--we were conscious of that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause we--the adults had, had told us behave in a certain way.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I was--I was too young to know what was going on, but I do remember from--said it was '54 [1954]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Fifty- fifty-four [1954]--yeah, I was--
Speaker 2: I think--if I remember, '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: Maybe it was '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: I wasn't even in elementary school then, but my mom was always talking about--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Emmett Till and what, you know--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was eleven in 1955, my brother was thirteen. He, he--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was the one that had the, the wandering eyes for girls more so than I did.
Story_ID: 622087
Speaker 1: So now we are at Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan] and you're pursuing what?
Speaker 2: My--well, my--initially, it was a master's degree in social psychology and I was working in the--in the laboratory. They had funding from the, the National Institute of Mental Health. We were doing decision making research kind of, social psychological. So, so my master's degree is in social psychology. My Ph.D. is in sociology. But, it was also during the era when, 1968, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, so became very active. I was one of the founders of the Black Student Alliance at Michigan State. I was a campus activist in addition to being a student and playing basketball. So, my, my photograph was in a lot of local newspapers, campus newspapers, activist, and that's how my wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart], who was an undergraduate at the time, became aware of me. She saw my photos everywhere before she--before she met me. And so after Dr. King was assassinated, we--university responded by initiating what they call the, the Detroit Program [Detroit Program for an Integrated School System]. So, what that meant--University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] did the same thing. So, they--what, what that meant is they increased the amount of scholarship funds they directed towards black students coming out of Detroit [Michigan] public high schools to bring them to Michigan State or University of Michigan. So, we had a large influx of black undergraduates to Michigan State and, and graduate students. And then--that was in 1968, the center [Center for Urban Affairs] was formed. In 1970, I was part of the committee that brought in Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] as the president in 1970. He became the first African American president to head up a predominantly--a major, predominantly white university. So, he came in his--in 1970. And so I've been friends with him since, since 1970.
Speaker 1: How, how did you all--what was he doing before?
Speaker 2: He was--I think he was--I'm, I'm trying to remember exactly what he was doing before, but he--his, his father [Clifton R. Wharton, Sr.] was an ambassador to Sweden [sic.], and he grew up in Roxbury, in, in the Boston [Massachusetts] area, where I also lived for a while at the time. He was--I'm trying to remember what he was doing. I, I remember exactly what he did. After, he went to, to run TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] when he left Michigan State University. But before then, I think--I'm trying to remember if he was--he, he--his background, he has a Ph.D. in economics.
Speaker 1: So, so, so, you were the student representative--
Speaker 2: I was student representative on the search committee--
Speaker 1: On the search committee.
Speaker 2: --as, you know, Black Student Alliance, we made certain--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --demands, certain--so--
Speaker 1: But you could've been outvoted by the other members.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Obviously, Wharton must've been--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, he--
Speaker 1: --very impressive (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, he was very impressive 'cause he succeeded John Hannah [John A. Hannah]. John Hannah was a long time president of Michigan State. He was important and when the Agency for International Development, 'cause Michigan State is a land grant university, so John Hannah was head of AID [United States Agency for International Development], and then, then there was a--there was a interim between them. I can't remember his name, Walter something [Walter Adams], when John Hannah died. And then that's the search committee that led to bringing in Cliff Wharton. But, obviously, he--his--not only his credentials, but you go back to his family. His father was a diplomat. You know, he had a Ph.D. in economics. He was more than qualified to be a university president.
Speaker 1: What kind of relationship did you have with him personally, you know aside from just being one of the students, thousands of students on that campus? Were you able--I mean, did, did you continue conversing with him? Or once he was appointed, you just went back to class and did your thing and he ran the place?
Speaker 2: No, no. We--you know, 'cause I was a graduate student, I wasn't an undergraduate, so I was working on a doctorate at that time and he was--we would have conversations. His, his wife, Dolores [HistoryMaker Dolores D. Wharton], we would--you know, I would sometimes go to the president's house for dinner, might be a group of people and, and over the years, we maintained a relationship. When I was in Boston and running various program sometimes, I'd ask him to come and be like a keynote speaker. And he was in New York [New York] running TIAA-CREF and he and his wife would come up to Boston and he would speak and then we'd go out to dinner and, you know, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 622088
Speaker 1: So, this was 1970 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] became the president [of Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] in 1970.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970]. Now, this was also during the Vietnam War.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: You could get a 2-S deferment for four years, but did it carry on into grad school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. The reason I, I didn't pursue a professional baseball or basketball career but rather high school--I mean, college graduate program, 'cause I had a 2-S. I could keep a 2-S--
Speaker 1: As long as you were in school.
Speaker 2: --as long as I was in school. If I took the risk of going to pursue ABA [American Basketball Association] or Major League Baseball [MLB], I may have been drafted. But, one reason that I didn't--I knew I didn't want to go to Southeast Asia, going back to my being a mailman. Our rival high school in Denver [Colorado], Denver, Manual High School [sic. West High School, Denver, Colorado], I had a friend who was a year older than me, Joe Willie White [Joe White], and I knew exactly where Joe Willie lived. I delivered--on my summer job, I delivered Joe Willie's notice that he was being drafted. Before Vietnam, there was Laos. They sent Joe Willie to Laos. So, I remember a year later, it was, again, summer, doing my route. I see a, a, a got--a gaunt figure in military garb walking towards me, it's Joe Willie. And I said, "Joe Willie, I--I've never told you this, but I'm the one that delivered your draft notice when you were drafted, my summer job." And he looked much thinner, much--you know, had his military uniform on, and I remember to this day what he said to me. He had been in Laos. He said, "Whatever you do, don't go over there," meant Laos and then Vietnam. So, I said, "Oh, okay." So, I kept--I was 2-S. I was--kept my 2-S through my--what I tell people, the only reason I have a Ph.D. 'cause I didn't wanna go to Vietnam, 'cause I saw friends come back from Vietnam and then I, I had friends who didn't come back from Vietnam. And I remember what Joe Willie said, "Don't go over there," and I looked at him then 'cause he was gaunt, had his military--you know, uni--
Speaker 1: Do you know what happened to him?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Do you know what happened to him after?
Speaker 2: Well, he was--his--he was one of those military gunners that was lead--when the trucks went out--
Speaker 1: No, no, I meant--
Speaker 2: Oh, over the--
Speaker 1: --after, after the war.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's dead now. He's dead now.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: He's dead. But, he--his--he was a gunner, so when you're--you know, you're, you're out on a convoy in a truck, he's in front of the truck--
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the .50 cal [.50 caliber].
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I resolved, I said, well--and Vietnam was always very unpopular in my--in my--what--my age group and I saw mostly black and Mexican American kids that I knew going over there, and I said I'm not--I'm, I'm gonna stay in school. So, I--like I said, I got my Ph.D. because I didn't wanna go to Vietnam, and during that era became active in anti-Vietnam civil rights kind of stuff, while at the same time working on my graduate degrees, playing basketball, you know, and, and trying to continue to tutor black men and women in terms of getting an education.
Speaker 1: You know, Colorado, as you know is a, a major center of military facilities--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and also home of a lot of retirees.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I'm going to assume that because you grew up in Colorado, your teachers, you mentioned one in particular who was a--an ex-Marine [U.S. Marine Corps]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were, were you ever, I don't--encouraged to perform you, your, your national duty as--or--I forgot what--your, your [U.S.] military--
Speaker 2: You mean, military (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) military obligation, is what--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I wasn't--there wasn't--you know--and I knew people at Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado Springs [Colorado], was other--you know, Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, no, I was never--ne- people never put pressure on me to do that 'cause they knew that I was gonna do what I wanted to do anyway and that, you know, I was an activist and even with the military establishment there, you had a strong anti-Vietnam, even though you had a pro-military. Yes, we're in a war, but it's--you're being a patriot by agreeing to participate even if you disagree with the objectives. So, people respected, you know, my opinion and, and, like I said, the personal story of what Joe Willie White said to me and then in addition having friends go over there, some of whom I never saw again, some of whom who came back in less stable positions--
Speaker 1: Shattered.
Speaker 2: --than they were when they left, some of whom came back as drug addicts, you know--you know, without a limb, so--
Speaker 1: Agent, Agent Orange poison.
Speaker 2: Agent Orange. And I'm--I was thinking about, you know, Joe Willie White, had some--he had some good advice for me, you know, even though I delivered his draft notice.
Story_ID: 622089
Speaker 1: What was your--oh, for your master's degree [from Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], what was your thesis?
Speaker 2: It dealt with--it's, it's, it's--dealt with what's called stochastic processes, that is--like I said, I worked in the re- the, the labs where we did research on decision making, looking at is, is this event related to the next event? So, it's called stochast- study of stochastic processes. So, if you look at--
Speaker 1: Spell stochastic.
Speaker 2: S-T-O-C-H-A-S-T-I-C.
Speaker 1: Never heard of that word.
Speaker 2: Well, it's like, like I said, I was in sociology and math, so statistics and that kind of stuff, I'm very adept at that, math and statistics. So, stochastic decision making means essentially if I make a decision to do this, is it related to the--a following decision or is it related to a pri- prior decision. You look at events of the last few weeks with Charlottesville [Virginia] and Trump [President Donald John Trump] and say, okay, he made a decision at, at one point to say what he said and then people jumped on him, and then he came back and kind of had a prepared statement what--that was less inflammatory. Then, at a press conference, he then goes back to these inflammatory statements. Say, okay, in a decision making process, what's the relationship between this event, this event, and this--as we're--as we are--as individuals making decisions within a larger context 'cause social psychology is basically looking at--psychology is the study of the individual. Social psychology is the study of individual within an institutional context. Sociology is the study of human groups.
Speaker 1: And, and then--and then how does the--your stochastic--
Speaker 2: Stochastic.
Speaker 1: --dissertation, I don't know, relate to managerial decision making or corporate--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's related to that. It's basically, if you look at any decision making within an organizational context or an individual context, how is your decision making trained, if you will? How does this event relate to this event? Are they related? Are they unrelated?
Speaker 1: So, you need to be aware of the interrelationships--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as, as you make those decisions.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you're not just making a decision in the blind or in the clear, you, you got--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like regard--
Speaker 2: Right. So, if you look at stochastic decision making, we're looking at it from, from the standpoint of Trump and I look at it from what I was trained in at that point, like, there's some irrationality going on here in terms of the decision making, you know. There's not a relatedness between A, B, C, D, E.
Speaker 1: And what was your doctoral dissertation?
Speaker 2: My doctoral dissertation, again, I'm then moving up to organizational study. It was called 'Problems in Organizational Renewal' ['Problems in Organizational Renewal: A Case Study of Organization Change,' Philip S. Hart] and that's available and Google Books has that. And what--that's again current because institutions, organizations and we're in the midst of that now are always renewing and changing. You know, we're talking about institutional renewal. We're talking about organizational renewal. So, that's what my Ph.D. dissertation focused on, the problems in organizational renewal, like what are some of the things that occur as organizations are renewing? We look at, again, going back to Trump's White House. They're trying to--John Kelly [John F. Kelly] is in, who I know from Boston [Massachusetts]. He was one of my--he was a graduate of University of Massachusetts Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], graduated in 1976. I started teaching during '74 [1974], so I've known him for a while. He's trying to restore--or I won't say restore, introduce discipline in the White House. He's trying to renew the organization, if you will. One of the things that happens with organizational renewal is turnover, right? We've seen turnover in the White House, right?
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --much faster than--
Speaker 2: Much faster than we had anticipated, but there's turnover. So, one of the outcomes of this organizational renewal process is turnover. There's other things, but turnover is, is, is one of the--and organizations are systems just like the individual is a system, and the organizations and the individuals are going through renewal so that at the individual level, we're talking about I wanna, you know, lose weight, I want to start reading more. We make New Year's resolutions. How, how am I going to renew myself? Organizations as systems are going through the same renewal and change process.
Story_ID: 622090
Speaker 1: What was your first job after you earned your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was working on my Ph.D., I worked for the Lansing Urban League [Greater Lansing Urban League] while I was at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]. I worked for the Center for Urban Affairs, I worked for Lansing Urban League while I was working on my doctorate and playing basketball. Then, I met my wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart] and then we got married in Muskegon, Michigan, in her hometown in March of '69 [1969], Mound--Mount Zion Church of God in Christ, which her parents [Jean Glenn Hinton and Lewis Hinton] had founded in their living room in the '40s [1940s]. So, I was recruited--the National Urban League wanted me to come to New York [New York] 'cause I had worked for the Urban League in Lansing [Michigan]. They wanted me to come to New York and work in the headquarters.
Speaker 1: Was Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm. And I got an offer in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] 'cause I'd--again, I'd worked for the office of, you know--and then I also got an offer to--in Boston [Massachusetts] and I had lived in New York. I'd lived in Washington, D.C. I'd never lived in Boston. I said, okay. Me and my young family, we had a six month old--six week old daughter [Ayanna Hart Beebe], and I accepted a job with the Community University Center for Inner City Change [Joint Community University Center for Inner City Change].
Speaker 1: Excuse me, back up. You said you lived in New York. When did you live in New York?
Speaker 2: When I was a graduate student, one summer, I lived in New York. I was--my wife was working for the radio station, WKAR [WKAR Radio, East Lansing, Michigan]. I was at Colum- at--Amitai Etzioni is a very famous sociologist--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so he had a--affiliated with Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] a thing called Center for Policy Research [sic. Center for Urban Research and Policy]. So, I was one of the graduate students that was selected to be--do this summer program at the Center for Policy Research the summer of 1971.
Speaker 1: And your wife was at the Columbia radio station KCR [WKCR Radio, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. She was at the Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Oh, Michigan State.
Speaker 2: --radio station--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --WKAR. So, we went to New York, lived in the East Village [New York, New York] in St. Mark's Place, and she--with KAR, she became--she--what she did was then review--she would go to the theater 'cause she'd do theater--she was a theater critic and sent her reports back to, to, East Lansing [Michigan]. And East Lansing, "Oh, we're getting a, a, a Broadway"--
Speaker 1: Broadway--
Speaker 2: --"review?" And I was at the Center for Policy Research.
Speaker 1: Gotcha.
Speaker 2: So, we're living in the East Village, I was going up to Columbia every day--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so I got to be friends with Amitai Etzioni. I think he's at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.] now. And so that's when we lived in New York.
Speaker 1: So, so at--so then because you lived in New York and you lived in D.C., you went to Boston.
Speaker 2: Then, that same summer, I got these various job offers and so the one I accepted was to go to Boston to work for the Community University Center for Inner City Change, which was a inner city nonprofit, kind of like a think tank in, in those days that was funded by Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and the National Institute of Health [National Institutes of Health].
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: I went there the fall of '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: So, that was the year you received your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No, I, I got my Ph.D. in '74 [1974] because I--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I got my Ph.D. at seventy--I, I had been working on it, but when I decided to leave, I wasn't on campus to be in immediate contact with my committee and I wanted to--at that point, I was ready to, to, to leave East Lansing.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so you're--you, you--the--your--you completed your--you earned the degree itself in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: I had completed all my coursework and I was working on my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay, in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: I had--by '71 [1971], I had completed my coursework.
Speaker 1: And, but you got the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The, the degree--
Speaker 1: --degree in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: --was actually conferred in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: In '74 [1974].
Story_ID: 622091
Speaker 1: But, by then, you were working in Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: By then, I was working in Boston [Massachusetts] in '71 [1971],
Speaker 1: Okay. And that's for the Community--
Speaker 2: Community University for Inner City Change [Joint Community University Center for Inner City Change]. And what that did was all the major universities in the Boston area, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], and then we get the community organization. So, the idea was to how do you bring the, the influence and leverage of major universities to help accelerate community development? So, we had university research assistants for our staff and they would be paired with community research assistants, so it matched up the universities with community agencies to try to, to accelerate redevelopment, revitalization in the African American community.
Speaker 1: How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there a little over a year, then I was recruited to run the--there, I was the second in, in charge. Ed Goff [Edgar Goff], who is an architect, the late Ed Goff, he's from L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. He's Hattie McDaniel's nephew. He was running the Community University Center. Our program officer at Ford Foundation [New York, New York] was Ron Gault [HistoryMaker Ronald T. Gault], who is Charlayne Hunter--who is [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault's husband. He was our program officer at the Ford Foundation. And so, I was--there were--I was recruited then to run the Federation of Boston Community Schools [Boston, Massachusetts]. These were alternative schools that black parents had founded in the 1960s because they were--'cause essentially, the Boston Pul- Public Schools [Boston Public Schools] were racist. So, the black parents came together and formed these alternative schools called the Federation of Boston Community Schools. So--
Speaker 1: So, they were--they were pre-charters? They were--
Speaker 2: They were pre-charters. Yeah, they were pre-charter.
Speaker 1: And this was also around the--so, this would've been towards the end of the Boston busing controversy?
Speaker 2: No. It was--it was-it was towards the beginning.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: The Boston busing controversy started around '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Louise Day--
Speaker 2: So, I started run--
Speaker 1: --Hicks and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I've known Louise Day Hicks. So, '72 [1972] is when I started running these alternative schools, and they were primarily black schools in the African American community, and I was like the superintendent of schools. I was about twenty-seven, twenty-eight years old. They were the largest budgeted nonprofit agency, if you will, in the city.
Speaker 1: Who, who was providing the funds?
Speaker 2: Local foun- the local foundation community.
Speaker 1: Not the City of Boston?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. The--these were independent of the City of Boston. So, part of my job was I had the development office; we raised money. So, it was private foundations, Ford Foundation, local--the charitable community in Boston is very strong. You know, we had a--we were--federal--we had a lunch program, which was federally funded, and so what I did with the lunch program which, again, if I'm reciting this, it could be somebody come back and say the statute of limitations hasn't passed. The school lunch program was to provide school lunches for the kids who went to the schools. These were K [kindergarten] through eight schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, what I did is make them real community schools. So, if you were a resident in that neighborhood where one of our schools was located--
Speaker 1: You could have lunch.
Speaker 2: --you could have lunch. You could have breakfast--
Speaker 1: Whether or not you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you could have lunch.
Speaker 1: Whether you were in the school or--
Speaker 2: But from a--from a legal standpoint, I was not--I could've been held accountable for that 'cause it was supposed to be only for the kids, right? But, I opened it up and somebody could've come and audited me and said, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you would've had an ankle--well, they didn't have ankle bracelets back then. That's what happened to the president of Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia]. She [HistoryMaker Dolores E. Cross] was trying to keep the school open and use some money for purposes that they weren't supposed to be used for. Anyway--
Speaker 2: But, let me tell the story. I--just real quick.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. Yes, please.
Speaker 2: I was like the superintendent of schools, of these alternative schools. Boston--again, this is pre-busing, so the explosion of Boston being a racist city hadn't yet hit the nation. You know, 'cause people--Harvard, MIT, oh. You know, so, early in my job as a superintendent, the federation, the organization had some tax issue with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] under the previous administration. So, when I became the superintendent, I was--of course, took responsibility for dealing with the IRS around this issue. Irish Catholic, I go down to downtown Boston to the JFK Building [John F. Kennedy Federal Building, Boston, Massachusetts] to meet with the IRS about the issue that's related to the schools, right? I show up. There's two Irish Catholic officers, IRS officers. First thing they do, they, they pull out my personal income tax to try to intimidate me, you know, to try to--and I'm--you know, they know these are black schools. So, they're, they're not addressing initially the, the organizational issue. They're addressing, okay--trying to intimidate me, which is--I'm, I'm learning about this whole Irish Catholic, African American relationship in Boston. This is 1972. Seventy-three [1973] is when you have--the forced busing begins, kids from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] being bused to South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], scenes that you see that are Charlottesville [Virginia] scenes, if you wanna put it that way. You know, "Nigger, go home." And you're talking about two neighbor- neighborhoods that are (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right next to each other.
Speaker 2: Next to each other, you know what I'm saying? And so--
Speaker 1: This is Boston.
Speaker 2: This is Boston (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the North.
Speaker 2: And today, we're having free speech activity on the Boston Common [Boston, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 622092
Speaker 1: So, you're in your mid-twenties, you've just gotten your terminal degree. I haven't heard you say anything about taking any education pedagogy courses in the course of your undergraduate and graduate doctoral work. How did you think you could be the top administrator of a school system?
Speaker 2: With the courses that I took?
Speaker 1: Well, just because you hadn't been prepared as an educator, I'm--not as a administrator, I should say.
Speaker 2: No, I was administrator, but I was working for the Lansing Urban League [Greater Lansing Urban League]. I was in a--I was doing administrative things. When I worked for the Center for Urban Affairs, which we founded after the--Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, I was doing administrative things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I set up--for example, I set--when, when the Center for Urban--first initiative that Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] used--went to--
Speaker 1: Hold on just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No, but what I was really trying to get to is like, you know, teaching is a--I don't know, it's its own thing, but you hadn't really ever been a teacher, had you?
Speaker 2: Before what?
Speaker 1: Before, before you became the superintendent of the, the, the Federation of Boston School [sic. Federation of Boston Community Schools, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was. Yeah, at Michigan State. I was--I was like a teaching assistant. I was a research assistant.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: When I--at the Urban League, I ran a program called the Labor Edu- Labor Education and Advancement Program where I would teach people how to get into the construct- basically, how to pass the test to get in--become an apprentice in the construction trades.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Because most of it at that time, you're talking about the '60s [1960s], how you got into the construction trades was usually--
Speaker 1: Your uncle, your--
Speaker 2: --your uncle, your father, your grandfather, so it excluded us. And there was a test that you had to take, and so I taught people how to take the test and pass the test so we could be--so, I go back to Michigan now, a lot of people I got into the trades, they've either retired or I see them working on--you know, they're supervisors now, whatever, you know.
Speaker 1: And, and they started with, with that Urban League program?
Speaker 2: It was called Labor Education Advancement Program, LEAP, L-E-A-P (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) LEAP? Oh, yeah, I remember that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was around the same time of--as OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it was in--it was in different cities--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, basically funded by the labor department [U.S. Department of Labor].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Urban League, we get labor department funding and formed the--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 622093
Speaker 1: So, I was--I'm really trying to get to--so, so, when you became superintendent of the Federation of Boston--
Speaker 2: Community Schools [Federation of Boston Community Schools, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: --Community Schools, you already had teaching experience from your--
Speaker 2: Teaching and administrative experience.
Speaker 1: And administrative experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I've al- I've managed big budgets basically since my twenties.
Speaker 1: So, how long were you with the, with the--with that school system?
Speaker 2: I was with them a couple years and then I was recruited by the University of Massachusetts Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] to help found a new college called College of Public and Community Service, and so I went there in 1974 as a faculty member at the College of Public and Community Service, which was a new college that the University of Massachusetts at Boston was founding and they wanted me to help get that off the ground.
Speaker 1: And what was your position there?
Speaker 2: I was on the faculty. I was--I was a professor.
Speaker 1: And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: Until I took early retirement in 2002. So, I was there almost--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --twenty years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you continued to teach.
Speaker 2: Teach and I was a, a--you know, department chair and I ran--I was director of the William Monroe Trotter--for the Institute of Black Culture [William Monroe Trotter Institute for the Study of Black Culture], which was basically research institute at the university and a professor of sociology.
Speaker 1: So, that was all at the University of Massachusetts Boston?
Speaker 2: At Boston, '74 [1974] to 2002, so I was there about twenty-eight years and then I took early retirement in 2002 when I was in my mid-fifties.
Speaker 1: So, when were you affiliated with the Ralph Bunche Center for--
Speaker 2: I was the--I had two affiliations with the Ralph Bunche Center [Center for Afro American Studies; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, Los Angeles, California]. I was the visiting research sociologist there two separate times, when I was either on sabbatical leave or a leave from University of Massachusetts Boston. I was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and first time was in eighty--when I was working on a book with James Blackwell [James E. Blackwell] called 'Cities, Suburbs and Blacks: A Study of Concerns, Distrust and Alienation.' That book came out in '82 [1982], so that was the first time. And then later, about four years later when I was working on the documentary film called 'Flyers: In Search of a Dream' about American early black aviators, I was also visiting research sociologist at the Bunche Center at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 622094
Speaker 1: I keep looking at my watch because I know we haven't gotten to, to, to the aviation piece, but I, I definitely have to cover your--at least some of the information about your extensive experience in real estate development. At what point would you say that you entered that field?
Speaker 2: Well, probably beyond the work that I did with my father [Judson Hart] when, when I was in Lansing [Michigan], one of the--my friends and one of my roommates' brother, Joel Ferguson [Joel I. Ferguson], who is now probably the major African American real estate developer in, in Michigan. He's the chairman of the board of trustees at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]. We got involved in some, some projects, but it was mainly when I moved to Boston [Massachusetts] and I was introduced to a gentleman named Marvin Gilmore [Marvin E. Gilmore, Jr.], who is probably the--one of the most wealthy African Americans here in Massachusetts. His--he lived in Cambridge [Massachusetts], but he--second generation real estate owner and developer, and we joined together in the mid-'70s [1970s] with the Community Development Corporation of Boston [Community Development Corporation of Boston, Inc.]. And we decided we were going to build an urban industrial park in an area of the city where manufacturing jobs were moving out from the inner city. We got a [U.S.] Department of Commerce EDA [Economic Development Administration] grant to do a feasibility study and then we got a Title IV grant that did side prep [preparation] and infrastructure. So, we basically assembled about forty-five acres to start and five parcels. We went out to Maynard, Mass [Maynard, Massachusetts], to Ken Olsen, the president of--and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation and asked him if he'd be interested in building his second inner city plant. The first one was in Springfield, Mass [Springfield, Massachusetts]. We convinced him that we--that this would be--he--to come and be our anchor tenant. The mayor of Boston at the time, Kevin White, wanted this particular parcel to be a methadone maintenance clinic. And he--we told him, "Well, Ken Olsen, wants to build a, a, a manufacturing plant there." Digital was a Fortune 500 company at the time, the second largest computer company in the world behind IBM [International Business Machines Corporation]. And so, the mayor, of course, didn't believe me and Marvin Gilmore, who is African American, even though he knew us. So, finally, we got Ken Olsen down to city hall [Boston City Hall, Boston, Massachusetts], so we had Ken Olsen, the founder of Digital, say, "Yes, I do want to build a plant there." So, the mayor was finally convinced, okay, maybe a, a manufacturing plant by a Fortune 500 company is a better option to hire and better use than a methadone maintenance clinic. So, anyway, we, we developed the Digital Equipment Corporation plant. They opened in 1980. So, we were African American developers, me and Marvin.
Speaker 1: May I ask a question? What--so, if you had the forty-five acres, could the mayor have blocked your--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh. He could've blocked your plans?
Speaker 2: Part of it was public, public own--part of it was--it was a combination of private and public--
Speaker 1: Ah. You didn't have all of it. You had--
Speaker 2: No, we had--we had it all assembled--we, we had already done an overall, overall economic development plan, but there were--part of it was public, part of it was private. So, he had to buy in with the part that was public because we needed all of it in order to make this work. So, yes, he could've--so, we had to convince him. And then, anyway, we, we were African American developers. We had an African American architect, Stull and Lee [Stull and Lee, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts], African American contractor, Cruz Construction [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts], so that Digital Equipment Corporation plant in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], which was a keyboard assembly plant, was essentially built by and designed by African American architects, developers, contractors. And the only thing Ken Olsen said to us, "Make sure the roof does not leak." That's the only instruction he gave us. And so that opened in 1980. And that plant in the industrial district, you had Roxbury here, you had South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] I referred to earlier, these communities a few years earlier were at odds around forced busing. This plant opened, you had--predominantly black workforce, but you had folks from Irish Catholic from South Boston working there. They worked together, had jobs, you know, good paying jobs. The plant--the black--the plant managers were all black. Ralph Gillespie was the first plant manager. [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Terrell, who I mentioned earlier, went, went on to higher and better things.
Speaker 1: Where did she go?
Speaker 2: Well, she went to Sun Microsystem [Sun Microsystems, Inc.] when she left Digital.
Speaker 1: And she started at OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers]?
Speaker 2: She started at OIC. She's been interviewed by HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] several years ago. January of 1983, President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] visited our DEC Roxbury plant. Kevin White, the mayor, was there, Tip O'Neill was, you know--Ken Olsen gave them a tour, Ralph Gillespie, the plant manager. Ronald Reagan on that visit, you know, 'cause he saw black and white people working together, a tech- a, a Fortune 500 inner city plant. And so he declared it a model for America. And then one of the questions at--he had a question and answer, one of the African American workers asked him was he going to support the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] federal holiday bill? He said, "Yes, I intend to sign that later when I get back to Washington [D.C.]." Later that year, that became a federal holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day]. So, they--that--he answered that questions affirmatively when he was there. But, he said this plant is a model. It's like if t--if today if, if Google [Google Inc.] or Apple [Apple Inc.] decided to build a plant in Watts [Los Angeles, California], you know? Same type of thing.
Story_ID: 622095
Speaker 1: And then after that, we, we had bought a building across the street, which was not--which was in this--these forty-five acres, a fifty thousand square foot paint brush factory, Baltimore Brush Company. We bought that building and used it as our offices. And then one day, we got--we were doing a--what they call a shell and core renovation. We started in 1987. Boston University School of Medicine [Boston, Massachusetts] is about three blocks down the street. One, one day the dean was driving by and said, "We want that whole--we want that whole building; we're expanding." So, I said, "Well, okay, we'll take--we'll keep 10 percent for our office, you can take the rest of it." So, that's when we entered into a partnership, landlord relationship with Boston University School of Medicine to build a biotech facility for university, labs and offices for university researchers, commercial firms, a biotech business incubator, and teaching labs for middle school and high school students and their teachers. And that has expanded now to what's called BioSquare, which is Boston's [Boston, Massachusetts] premier biotech business park. So, it's expanded much beyond the forty-five acres.
Speaker 2: At the outset when you and your partner [Marvin E. Gilmore, Jr.] envisioned how you were going to develop these forty-five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Forty-five.
Speaker 2: --five--forty-five acres, was the sociologist in you at that point thinking that you could--that one of the byproducts of that development could be to bring together disparate parts of the community? Was that--was that even in your--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --thought?
Speaker 1: --what I tell people 'cause like I say, I've been around job sites my whole life and know what construction, real estate design was all about. Sociology, like, is the study of human groups. Human groups make use of buildings. I know how to develop a building, I know how to design a building, I know how--and it's basically, people are using the building whether you talk about a school, whether you're talking about a technology company, a biotechnology company, people are making use of that facility. How best can you build a facility where people like being there, they make productive use of their time in that facility? And then in the instance of the Digital plant [Digital Equipment Corporation], you had the workforce just because of their proximity to this facility, Irish Catholic, African Americans, Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], two communities that just a few years before, you know, were at war with each other essentially around forced busing. Now, they're working side by side, doing--putting together keyboard assembly, you know, doing keyboard assembly. And President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], who is Irish American, visits. You know, the plant manager is black, workforce is predominantly black even though a good number of Irish, Irish and white Italians. And, you know, so I, I, I bas- I guess what I'm saying, I know--it's like a, a mer- a melding of hu- sociology, the study of human groups. Human groups use buildings. That's where we congregate. We congregate outside also, so I'm also involved in building open space urban parks. But, it's, it's, it's a sociological thing. Not too many sociologists know how to build stuff like I know how to build stuff.
Story_ID: 622096
Speaker 1: The intersection of your discipline and your experience, is anyone else like you?
Speaker 2: No. And I write about it. If you look at the number of articles--I'm a member of Urban Land Institute. A number--we have a monthly magazine, Urban Land Magazine. If you look at the range of articles that are written about Urban Land Maga- in Urban Land Magazine, it's basically trying to say this is what I did here. This can be duplicated elsewhere and I've written--my Urban Land Magazine articles cover Boston [Massachusetts], Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], New Orleans [Louisiana], you know.
Speaker 1: One of the articles 'Planning for Racial Diversity' [sic.].
Speaker 2: Planning--
Speaker 1: For (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) for a racially--
Speaker 1: Diverse--
Speaker 2: --racially diverse America ['Planning for a Racially Diverse America,' Philip Hart].
Speaker 1: --America. Just give me the, the, the--not the theory, but your, your perspective on how communities should plan for the diversity that is--well, it's around us right now, really, but it's going to be even more so going forward.
Speaker 2: Well, the catch words that we use today are, are diversity, inclusion, equity. So, if you look at what I'm saying in that article, it's talking about the demographic changes that we're going through in this country. We're talking about many cities are now majority minority. The nation will--2042, 2050 perhaps will be a majority minority. We look at the resistance that we're seeing now, it's partially in response to people saying--feeling that there's a change, people who were--
Speaker 1: That they're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) formerly--
Speaker 1: --being replaced.
Speaker 2: That they're being replaced. People who were formerly considered to be in the majority, there's a minority that's growing and it's causing anxiety. It's causing people to be nervous. So, what do you do in response to that? Like the, the question I asked at the Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] event la- earlier was that you look at leadership 'cause whether you're talking about Trump [President Donald John Trump] or Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and you like their leadership style or not, we're talking about leadership. What kind of leader--if, if you got, you know, again, the Boston analogy, you got working class white, working class black, economic anxiety. I saw this--these groups at each other's throat in Boston back in 1973. They're at each other's throats again now. What kind of leadership skill, and it might be a superhero, who knows--what kind of leadership skill can bring these groups so it's not continually a divide and conquer ethos that leaders can use to keep us at each other's throats? And so I l- I used the Digital Equipment Corporation plan as a--just a mini example, a, a Fortune 500 technology company, brought these two disparate groups together. They had good jobs, so they weren't fighting about, you know, what we would consider insignificant things. They had good jobs, you know. You had black plant managers, you had black workers working with white workers, you know, who were we would call working class now, trying to get--move up and become middle class. You had a Irish American president visit [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], Tip O'Neill, Irish American, he's there with them, Irish American mayor [Kevin White]. So, what kind of leader--what kind of skills are going to help bring us together in that kind of way that we are experiencing the exact opposite right now in terms of tearing us apart, putting us at, at each other's throats? Study of human groups.
Story_ID: 622097
Speaker 1: One of the sad phenomenon of some urban areas, many urban areas, is that over time, and I'm sort of thinking probably somewhat deliberately, they have been allowed to fall into decay. They've been abandoned. Part of that is because people have opportunities to move elsewhere, and so people pick up and leave the inner cities.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But then there's nothing that is put in its place and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the infrastructure--you know, the sewers aren't maintained, the streets aren't maintained and then you get a situation like in my hometown, Jackson [Mississippi], parts of it look like a war zone.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean and, and once vibrant, thriving commercial areas when the days of segregation forced you to do your business in one area, nobody does business there anymore, nobody lives there anymore. What do you do for those kinds of communities? What do you do for those kinds of areas? How does--how, how, how does--how, how does the intersection of sociology and, and, and development, public sector, private sector, finance fix that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, modestly speaking, you need more of me. You need more people like me, you know. I go to a lot of panels that you have attorneys, social scientists. They're talking about these issues, but it's--to me, it's like not satisfying to me because it's not expressing what I think needs to be done as a result of what I've done to create a situation where jo- people have jobs, good paying jobs, career--jobs in 21st century indus- industries, technology, biotechnology; those two things I've done development in in inner city areas. People have earned good money, so they're not as interested in going after somebody else's throat.
Speaker 1: So, so, then, if you were going to spell out the--I don't know the, the, the paradigm, what are some essential elements? What are some essential building blocks for the kind of solution that you see applicable?
Speaker 2: Well, if you just look at them on a small scale relative to what I said, you look at the--Apple [Apple Inc.] is the largest capitalized company in the world, I believe. If Apple--again, using the analogy that I did thirty-seven years ago, Apple said, "We're going to build a plant in Watts [Los Angeles, California]. We're going to build a plant in East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland]." What--select whatever community you want to select that's maybe predominantly African American, maybe Mexican American, maybe what we call quote unquote underserved, and to do what Ken Olsen agreed with me and Marvin Gilmore [Marvin E. Gilmore, Jr.] to do back in 1980, that brought two communities together, employment. It created good paying jobs and it was kind of a sociology of how you make things better in urban areas. Because you go back to Gunnar Myrdal in 1944. He's talking about an American dilemma. He--and part of what he did in his two volumes ['An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy'], here are the prim- ten top concerns of black Americans. Here are the tip--top, top ten concerns of white Americans. They're exact opposite. My book in 1982 ['Cities, Suburbs and Blacks: A Study of Concerns, Distrust and Alienation,' Philip S. Hart and James E. Blackwell], we did it, that same thing looking at black Americans, not necessarily white Americans. If you look at 2017, I would--I would say it's probably accurate that if you surveyed working class white, working class black, working class Mexican American, all of their top priorities would be how do I better my economic condition? So, there's economic anxiety. When there's economic anxiety, that's when if you have uninformed leadership, they can take advantage of that anxiety to create these other conditions that we're experiencing now. But, if you had someone like me who came in and said we're going to institute what I did in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] thirty-seven years ago, we're gonna create economic opportunities whether it's in rural settings where you have working class white, working class bl- whether it's an urban setting, you know. We're gonna create jobs of tomorrow, 21st century jobs, not coal, not--you know, we're talking clean tech, biotech--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --technology jobs.
Story_ID: 622098
Speaker 1: Then how do you answer the, the, the opponents who say, yeah, but those folks aren't trained. We have to bring--they, they don't--they don't have the skillset (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Again, that's part--
Speaker 1: They don't have--
Speaker 2: --of what we did. We trained--like I said, in our biotech facility [BioSquare, Boston, Massachusetts], we had labs for middle school, high school ages, and their teachers, students and their teachers. Where we were located, again, most urban context, we were located--down the street was a public housing project, that public housing project, Orchard Park [Boston, Massachusetts]. That's where New Edition kids grew up, Bobby Brown. All those kids grew up there. Over here, there was a county jail, Suffolk County, County House of Correction [Suffolk County House of Corrections, Boston, Massachusetts]. And, literally, like, my office was on the first floor. Boston University was in 90 percent of the building. My office was on the first floor. I might see a nineteen year old walk down the street from the public housing project, I would go out and literally grab him and say, "Do you know what's in this building? Let me show--we got a, a, a teaching lab here. You can learn how to become a laboratory assistant." And I go back now, this kid might be working for Genzyme [Genzyme Corporation]--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --or Amgen [Amgen Inc.].
Speaker 1: You actually would go out on the street and grab the kids--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Or if I see somebody get out of the county jail, I'd go out and say--and grab him, say, "Where you going? Let me show, show you what's in this building." They come in. They--if they get engaged, they, they might become--they--you know, and there was a program with Boston University School of Medicine [Boston, Massachusetts] there. So, we had--you could get a certificate, you could get an A.A., you could get a bachelor's [degree], you get a master's [degree], you a Ph.D. So, I grabbed--literally grabbed public--kids from the projects, guys coming out of the county jail, brought them into this building, got them into these teaching labs, they became lab assistants. I go to Boston [Massachusetts] now, I might see this guy who I got into this twenty-five years ago, he's working for Genzyme. This one's working for Vertex Pharmaceuticals [Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]. You know what I'm saying? And I'm, I'm only one person. I can just do that at this--my level. And one of my--if you want to look at the evenag- the church evangelis- evangelical, that's one of the themes I've evang- evangelized on and why I'm involved with L.A. now, trying to create--in L.A. County [Los Angeles County, California] trying to create a biotech cluster so we can--with, with the ed- the job training component. So, one of the sites that we're looking at is the USC County Hospital [Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center] over in Boyle Heights [Los Angeles, California], which is predominantly Mexican American. Okay, what's down this road? A, a, a public housing project. What's over here? A county jail. Okay? In the communities that, that we grew up in urban areas, you're more--you're gonna find the public housing project. You're gonna find a jail.
Speaker 1: And, and your position is then, now, and in the future, you can train people to do whatever you want them to do?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's--I believe that. I believe that.
Speaker 1: There's no lacking of, of, of innate skills--
Speaker 2: Just the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to learn.
Speaker 2: --opportunity, the opportunity. And if we had technology companies, biotechnology companies, clean technology companies that were willing to make the investment that Ken Olsen did in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] in 1980 or that Boston University School of Medicine continues to do with their biotech activities, that you can--you know, I can--I can take somebody out from the--off the street, put them in the lab, and they can have, have a career in a--in a industry of today and tomorrow.
Speaker 1: What was the title of the 1982 book?
Speaker 2: 'Cities, Suburbs and Blacks: A Study of Concerns, Distrust and Alienation.' And my co-author is James Blackwell [James E. Blackwell]. We were--at the time, we were professors of sociology at University of Massachusetts Boston [Boston, Massachusetts]. So, 'Cities, Suburbs and Blacks: A Study of Concerns, Distrust and Alienation.' It's still being used in, you know, classes, college classes.

Speaker 1: Let's switch now to talk about your interest--your family's connection to aviation. You are now probably the leading expert on African American involvement in aviation from the early days.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: How did you become interested in that topic?
Speaker 2: Well, really, family albums. Again, my mother [Murlee Shaw Hart], my aunt [Pearl Shaw Dillard], my cousins, and my brother, they'd show us family albums and they'd show us James Herman Banning [James Banning], who was my mother's uncle, my grandmother's [Virginia Banning Shaw] younger brother, and he was standing in front of his plane in Ames, Iowa, called the Miss Ames. It was a biplane. Like I said earlier, he was--went to Iowa State College [Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa] to study engineering and got interested in aviation, learned to fly in 1924, got his license in 1926, became the chief--or recruited to be the chief pilot for the Bessie Coleman Aero Club, which was founded in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in 1929. It was the first all-black flight school in the world, was the first black pilot to fly coast to coast with his mechanic, Thomas Allen [Thomas C. Allen], in 1932. So, all their stories are in the Smithsonian institute air and space museum [National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.] 'Black Wings' exhibit. So, my initial interest was seeing these family photos and then I would--this was when I was in like elementary school, junior high school, high school. Then, I would take these photos, I would go to the library and try to see if there's anything written about him. I'd find things about Charles Lindbergh, Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart. So, I'd start out trying to--I wanted to learn about him 'cause I had these family photos and then about his peers. So, that over time, over time and as I got more sophisticated, this was like my hobby, if you will.
Speaker 1: So, you found nothing in the library about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --African American--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --flyers?
Speaker 2: No. No. And so, you know, I would take the photos to school and they're like, okay, that's interesting; they're family photos.
Speaker 1: Well, wait, wait. So, your teachers would see your granduncle in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --front of an airplane?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Would they allow you to do show and tell to your--
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: --to your classmates?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I didn't have nothing to show. I had the pho--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if you--
Speaker 2: I had the family photos to show--
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but I couldn't--I couldn't back--contextualize it by going to the li- school library or the Denver Public Library [Denver, Colorado] and kind of--
Speaker 1: But they did read--
Speaker 2: I mean, people knew about the Tuskegee Airmen, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: People knew about--and I was saying, no, there were people before--
Speaker 1: Before.
Speaker 2: --them. And, but there was no context for me within which to formulate a paper other than family history. So, it took unt- it, it--so, as I got more sophisticated doing research and was able to either have my own money or raise money, I, I kept doing it. And then I eventually was approached by the air--excuse me--air and space museum in the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: But, but, wait, before, before we get to that. How did you find your--other than the family photos, how did you begin to build--to document your--who did you talk to? Where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, the air--the basically air and space museum in Washington, D.C., because probably it wasn't--in the '70s [1970s], up until then, it was--it was like I was kind of on my own, you know what I'm saying? And I ran into a gentleman, I can't remember his name, and--out in L.A., David [ph.]--he's passed away now, but he, he was a white guy but he was interested in aviation. He showed me this book called 'Black Wings' that William Powell [William J. Powell] had written in 1935 [sic. 1934]. And so that book had all these stories about James Herman Banning, about Hubert Julian, William Powell, the aviation activities in L.A., the aviation activities in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And that was the first time you had seen that book?
Speaker 2: That I had seen the book. That's--I was probably in my twenties then. I was in probably in my twenties. So, I was out of University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado]. And I was still--I was spending my own money to try to--you know, to travel or find out stuff.
Story_ID: 622100
Speaker 1: You find this book, 'Black Wings' [William J. Powell], and in that, does it mention your [maternal] granduncle?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, my, my, my, my great uncle, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause William Powell was one of the--he was one of the founders of the Bessie Coleman Aero Club [Los Angeles, California] in 1929. So, he's the one that recruited my great uncle, James Herman Banning [James Banning], from Ames, Iowa, to be the chief pilot because Banning was the most experienced black pilot at that time. He had earned his license in 1926. So, Powell authored this book. So, in the book, it's chapters about basically their adventures.
Speaker 1: How did your great uncle get his pilot's license at a time when African Americans weren't--certainly weren't hired as pilots? How did, how did he do that?
Speaker 2: Well, he couldn't--Iowa, Iowa was the center of aviation activity during the--after--post World War I [WWI] with Curtiss Jennys [Curtiss JN-4] and others--other biplanes, and he couldn't find a school, but a World War I veteran named Lieutenant Raymond Fisher agreed to teach him--you know, kind of independent of a school. He was part of a school, but the school wouldn't accept him, but the--Lieutenant Fisher said, "Well, you come after the school closes, on the weekends when I'm not busy, I'll teach you how to fly." So, it was basically Lieutenant Raymond Fisher agreed kind of on a tutorial basis to teach him how to fly a biplane. So, that was in 1924. And then in 1926 is when the U.S. Department of Commerce started licensing pilots 'cause prior to 1926, the, the--we weren't licensing pilots. France and Germany were. They were licensing pilots over there. That's where Bessie Coleman got her license, in France. U.S. started in 1926. So, Banning's license number is 1324, which essentially means he was the 1324th person to get through the door to get his li- his license, but he was the first black person to do so. So, he was licensed in 1926 and then the--Powell and others, Irvin Wells, they formed the Bessie Coleman Club in 1929.
Speaker 1: Bessie Coleman, when did she get her license?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-one [1921] in France.
Speaker 1: So, she was the first--
Speaker 2: Female.
Speaker 1: Female, period.
Speaker 2: Period.
Speaker 1: Of any color?
Speaker 2: No, no, not the first--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: --female period of any color. There were--Harriet Quimby and others before--there were--others preceded her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the first African American female. The first African American was Emory Malick [Emory Conrad Malick] in 1912. He got his license in San Diego [California] in 1912, again, from the French certification agency.
Speaker 1: Because there were some African American pilots in World War I, correct?
Speaker 2: Eugene Bullard. He flew for the French in World War I. He was from Georgia. He stowed away to France and I read about all these people in all my children's books and my other Oxford University Press [Oxford, England]. He went to France and learned to fly in France, flew for the--you know, Lafayette Escadrille and the (unclear). And then, so, he flew for the French. And then when the U.S. entered World War I and had--and came over with our Air Force [U.S. Army Air Service; U.S. Air Force], they refused to let him fly for the U.S. even though he was more experienced than (laughter) any of the white pilots that the U.S. had flying for them. He had already flyed in a war. He was already--you know, had--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --shot down Germans and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--but, you know, they said he was not, you know, qualified.
Speaker 1: So, so, he went back to fly for, for the French or he--
Speaker 2: Yes. He flew for the French.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know if he ever had any encounters with the Red Baron [Manfred von Richthofen]?
Speaker 2: I don't know specifically. I'm, I'm, I'm--I've--
Speaker 1: You just--
Speaker 2: I've got an Oxford University Press online photo essay that was published in 2013. I talk about Eugene Bullard and others, Banning, Powell, Bessie Coleman, so I'm continuing that research and finding out more about them. I'm doing--I'm doing movies about all these people. I have a--I've created a franchise of movies about all these--ten of these early aviators.
Speaker 1: Let's see, so you've written, I know 'Up in the Air' and--
Speaker 2: 'Up in the Air,' yeah.
Speaker 1: --and 'Flying Free' ['Flying Free: America's First Black Aviators,' Philip S. Hart].
Speaker 2: 'Flying Free' came out in 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Up in the Air: The Story of Bessie Coleman' [Philip S. Hart] came out in '96 [1996]. Then, 'Bessie Coleman (Just the Facts)' ['Bessie Coleman,' Philip S. Hart] came out in 2005. Those are all children's books. And then 2013, I did an Oxford University Press online photo essay. Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] is the editor of the--this Oxford African American study [Oxford African American Studies Center], online photo series, and that's called 'Early African American Aviators.' So, that's, that's more of a, a general audience, adult focus.
Speaker 1: And the--and then the Smithsonian's African American museum of history and culture, that display went up last year when it opened, right?
Speaker 2: No, no. The, the 'Black Wings' exhibit opened--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --at the--in 1982--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That opened in '82 [1982]. So, that's, that's been there for thirty-five years and they've had traveling exhibits over this thirty-five year period.
Speaker 1: I got confused because I saw [HistoryMaker] Lonnie Bunch's--
Speaker 2: No, Lonnie is--appears in my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At--in--
Speaker 2: --eighty-seven [1987] film--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --'Flyers in Search' ['Flyers in Search of a Dream']--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --'cause Lonnie is an aviation historian. So, James Herman Banning has been one of his interests. He, he published an article in '83 [1983] called 'In Search of a Dream' ['In Search of a Dream: The Flight of Herman Banning and Thomas Allen,' Lonnie G. Bunch III], which talks about Banning and Allen's [Thomas C. Allen] cross country flight. So, Lonnie has been writing about my family and Banning since '83 [1983]. And--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: --so I appeared--he appeared in my '87 [1987] film as an aviation expert, aviation historian 'cause at the time, he was a curator at the California African American Museum in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: And now he, of course, is the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --executive director of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Found--
Speaker 1: --museum.
Speaker 2: Founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So, is--
Speaker 2: So, I have arti- I have archives in there as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That--in there.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. So, you do have archives.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 622101
Speaker 1: So, tell me about this relative who gave you some film?
Speaker 2: That was William Powell's son. William Powell [William J. Powell] was the guy who helped found the Bessie Coleman Aero Club in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Who hired your [maternal] great uncle?
Speaker 2: Who brought my great uncle in as a chief pilot.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, William Powell was a--he was a pilot himself. He was a businessman. He was from Chicago [Illinois]. He served in World War I [WWI]. He was gassed his last day there, so he had kind of asthmatic issues. So, he was a businessman, owned gas stations and garages in Chicago. His doctors told him he needed to find a more temperate climate, so he moved to L.A., founded the Bessie Coleman Aero Club in L.A. with his--using his entrepreneurial skills, recruited James Herman Banning [James Banning] to be the chief pilot. So, anyway, when I was doing research to--the 'Black Wings' exhibit opened in '82 [1982] and I realized there was no documentary film about these early aviators. There was documentary films about the Tuskegee Airmen. People don't know there were people before them who laid the foundation. So, I was doing research for the film, doing oral history interviews with all the ones that were--aviators that were still alive, the early av- aviators. And so William Powell, Jr., William Powell's son, 'cause William Powell, Sr., had passed away in 1942. His son is a mu- is a composer in L.A. So, I was visiting with him one day, talking about his father, telling him what I want to do. He said, "Hold on just a minute. Let me tell--," this is true--how we found black history. He said, "Hold on, man." He went back out to the garage, he brought me this film can. The film was close to deterioration. He said, "I don't know what's on here, but if you take this, have it restored, give me a copy, you can do whatever you want with it." So, I, I was in L.A., I was living in Boston [Massachusetts] at the time. I brought it back to Boston and John Allen [John E. Allen, Inc.] in New Jersey was a top film restoration company in the world. I didn't know what was on the film. But, I sent it to John, said (laughter), "I don't know how much it's gonna cost but, please, see if you can save this, right? Save this film." So, a few weeks later, he sends the film back to me, he's restored it, right? I, I play it. It's like this mini documentary called 'Unemployment, The Negro and Aviation'--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --which William Powell--it's like a docudrama. He produced it and he directed it. It's--was--it's a silent film from 1935. So, I used excerpts--clips from that in my 1987 PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] film, 'Flyers in Search of a Dream.' Then, I donated it to the National Air and Space Museum [Washington, D.C.] so other researchers, you know, could come and make use of it, you know, in, in years later. So, I used it in my film, which was released in '87 [1987]. I donated it to the air and space museum in probably '86 [1986], but it's called 'Unemployment, The Negro and Aviation.' What Powell was saying, like I was saying earlier about, we need to get into these industries on the ground floor, whether you're talking about clean tech, biotech, you know, technology. What he was saying back in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s], aviation is a new industry. It's rooted in technology, right? We need to get in on the ground floor as pilots, as owners, maintenance, whatever. We need--and that's essentially what his--the 'Black Wings' book [William J. Powell] does; that's what his film is doing. He's evangelizing. Like I was saying, I was--I'm an evangelist. So, I have these people that I've--that I've learned from. Maybe I haven't met them, but I've over the years uncovered what they--they're doing and looking at it and saying, you know, and, and, of course, his vision is not realized. We don't have a great number of black pilots, commercial, otherwise, black ownership of airlines. But, that was his vision. That--you know, he was evangelizing for that in everything that he did.
Speaker 1: What was the significance of finding that film? I mean, in, in your search, in your quest to not only develop your great uncle's story but all of his compatriots at the time? What, what was--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --the significance?
Speaker 2: Well, like I say, when I saw the--was looking at these family photo albums when I was six, seven, twelve, fifteen, I want to learn more about him, James Herman Banning, and his peers. So, I get this--I meet William Powell's son. He gives me this film footage. I have it restored at my own expense and it wasn't cheap, you know.
Speaker 1: How much was it? We won't tell your wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart] (laughter).
Speaker 2: In 1984, it was at least ten thousand dollars 'cause it was crumbling. It had--so, it, it needed careful care- real care and restoration procedures in order to bring it--like, like, like I was saying, black history is--if I had--if he hadn't given me that film in 1984 and I had--and if I didn't have the means to restore it, that would've been lost to history. It'd have just crumbled and just crumbled, you know. So, I had the, the means to bring it back to the best restoration company in the world. I didn't know what was on it. All I knew, when he sent it to me, it was a bill for ten thousand dollars (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 622102
Speaker 1: And so when I look at it, I say this is worth more than ten thousand dollars, 'Unemployment, The Negro and Aviation,' 1935. I got footage of William Powell [William J. Powell] flying over L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with his goggles on in a biplane in 1935 looking down over L.A. And it reinforces what I knew. I--my uncle wasn't out there--my [maternal] great uncle [James Banning] wasn't out there alone. There were others who wanted to be pilots and this is documentation that--and, and, and, again, William Powell consider--he was a businessman. He had gas sta- he owned gas stations and garages in Chicago [Illinois]. So, he had the--he had an entrepreneurial ability. He could come out to L.A., organize the Bessie Coleman Aero Club at 1423 West Jefferson Boulevard in a store front. The store front is still there. Go to Jeff--Jefferson High School [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California] and say, "Can we do aviation classes here?" So, you--I got photos of, of William Powell doing aviation classes at Jefferson High School. Joe Louis visited one time. Here's Joe Louis standing with William Powell. Going back to what I was saying earlier about can you train people to do stuff? He--I--he was doing it back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] to train people who were interested in flying an airplane, right? And at the same time, people were--this was before Tuskegee Airmen, people saying black people don't have the aptitude to fly an airplane even when we got to the Tuskegee Airmen era, '41 [1941]. People were still saying that, right? But, we'll do this little special experiment over here.
Speaker 2: And we know it's not gonna work and it was--it was the first lady--
Speaker 1: Eleanor Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: --Eleanor Roosevelt--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who flew--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who--and, and they're telling her, "Oh, no, madam first lady, don't, don't, don't--I'll fly you."
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chief Anderson.
Speaker 2: The, the white guy.
Speaker 1: Alfred Ander- Alfred Anderson [Charles Alfred Anderson].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's who was in the pla- plane with her. And what I tell people, I have a lot--so much respect for the Tuskegee Air- Airmen, I said, they're--but these--the early people, it's a different story. Whatever the Tuskegee Airmen experiment--experience when they came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], when they got there, there were planes waiting for them, they didn't have to worry about paying for the gas--
Speaker 2: Instruction.
Speaker 1: --or the oil or the instruction. The early people, they didn't have airplanes. How do you get an airplane? How do you maintain it? How do you pay for the gas and oil? They were--so, they were entrepreneurs in their own sense, so the air shows that they did, they were--people were pa- charging. They were--that was their ent- their way of doing an entrepreneurial activity. And then if you look at pre-Depression [Great Depression], they have an air show, my great uncle might take home five hundred, thousand dollars a week from an air show that they did on--you know, a weekend air show, Saturday, Sunday.
Speaker 2: Not five hundred thousand.
Speaker 1: No, five hundred dollars.
Speaker 2: Five hundred.
Speaker 1: Five hundred dollars to a thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: To a thousand.
Speaker 1: Five hundred to a thousand dollars he might earn from that weekend air show, right? In, in 1929, 1930--
Speaker 2: That's big money.
Speaker 1: --that's, you know.
Speaker 2: And well, when he was flying across country, it took twenty-two days?
Speaker 1: Twenty-one days. They left on, if I remember correctly, September 19th, 1932. They landed on October 9th, 1932. They took off from L.A. Eastside Airport [Los Angeles Eastside Airport, Los Angeles, California], landed at Valley Stream airfield in Long Island [Curtiss Airport; Columbia Aircraft Company Airfield, Valley Stream, New York]. It took twenty-one days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why did it take so long?
Speaker 1: Well 'cause the plane was a secondhand plane and unlike Charles Lindbergh, they didn't have corporate support. So, they had twenty-five dollars when they left L.A. Their, their main supporter was a numbers runner, Ed Black--Ed "Big Black" Dennis [sic. Ed "Small Black" Dennis]. Ed Black Dennis was one of the--was quote unquote corporate support. So, they called themselves the flying hobos 'cause they realized flying from L.A. to Long Island, we're gonna have to map our route so that we--when we, when we have unforced landings to get gas, we'll land where there's a black community nearby so we can go in into the church and see if they'll pass the hat, let us raise some money. If they had--if they had forced landings, then they had to improvise, like if you're in the middle of a field and you see a plane land near the farmer, your white farmer, you run out and these two black guys get out of a plane in 1932, you're like (makes a face). So, they called themselves the flying hobos, so they basically saw themselves hoboing across the country, so that's why it took twenty-one days. So, I'm making that into the film too, called 'The Hallelujah Flight.'
Speaker 2: 'The Hallelujah Flight.'
Speaker 1: I've been working on that for a while. We started that with Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California], so we have a script done and that's one of the films that, that I'm doing.
Story_ID: 622103
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask you about your children. Your daughter is helping you with, with a mo- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my daughter--we have a daughter, Ayanna [Ayanna Hart Beebe]. She was born in Lansing [Michigan] and we moved to Boston [Massachusetts]. She's also in the business. She's chief operating officer and in house producer of a company in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called Fancy Films [ph.]. They've, they've done Oscar [Academy Award] nominated films and films and festivals. And so the founder of that company is a, a 1 percent very wealthy guy, so he's in the process of turning that out over to our daughter, so she's a partner with us on our various film projects and other TV and film projects that we do.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And she's--she was born in Lansing in nine--in August of 1971 and has--I have a granddaughter, Chloe Beebe, who--fifteen years old, she just finished a seven week pre-college program at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] this summer. She earned eight college credits. She is going into her junior year. She works for Immaculate Heart--she, she goes to school at Immaculate Heart Col- High School [Immaculate Heart High School and Middle School] in L.A. And her father, my daughter's first husband, is Brendan Beebe. He comes from a long line of radio, radio family. He is an--a--one of the top sound engineers in the film industry. He's earned Oscars with 'Titanic' and other film and television programs. He's earned awards.
Speaker 1: Is that B-E-E-B-E?
Speaker 2: B-E-E-B-E.
Speaker 1: Your daughter is also working on a movie about Bessie Coleman, right?
Speaker 2: She's working with us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're doing a--we're doing a Bessie, Bessie Coleman movie, so she's collaborating--she's one of the producing partners on our movie.
Speaker 1: And the name of the movie is?
Speaker 2: It's probably gonna be called 'Flying Free.'
Speaker 1: 'Flying Free with Bessie Coleman'?
Speaker 2: Right. So, we're, we're working on that now. We'll have the script done probably in a couple months and then her job is to budget it so we know how much we need to raise in order to do the film.
Speaker 1: And you have any other children?
Speaker 2: No. One daughter.
Speaker 1: One daughter, okay.
Speaker 2: Several, several adults now that were children that grew up in our home, but that's our biological daughter.
Speaker 1: Several children who grew up in your home. Who were they?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Foster--
Speaker 2: --we were close with their parents, but they--we were--we kind of helped raised--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Karen Charles Peterson now, for example, she's--
Speaker 1: Oh, just friends of--I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You weren't foster parents?
Speaker 2: No, no, we weren't foster parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, Karen is a--she's a telecommunications tsar here in Massachusetts now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 622104
Speaker 1: Your brother, Christopher [Christopher A. Hart], is the head of the National Transportation Safety Board?
Speaker 2: He was appointed in 2009 to the National Transportation Safety Board when Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] came in as president. In 2015, he be- he became the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. His term ends the--Dec- end of December of 2017. So, he's been on eight years now and part of that eight years, he was the chairman, so he was the first African American to chair the National Transportation Safety Board. He's a licensed pilot, has a law degree from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and--
Speaker 1: What, what is he checked out to fly?
Speaker 2: Oh, he can fly anything. But, I mean, we--generally, we fly Cessnas, 310s [Cessna 310], 210s [Cessna 210], but he, he can fly--he--he's flown Airbuses and, you know--
Speaker 1: Was, was--
Speaker 2: --FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] planes and--
Speaker 1: Did he ever work as a--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He's, he's, he's never worked as a commercial pilot, it's just that he's, he's been flying since the '70s [1970s] and so he's licensed to fly--
Speaker 1: So, he can fly an Airbus?
Speaker 2: He's flown an Airbus, yeah. I mean, he's gotta--he's gotta have the Airbus guy here, but--it's not like he routinely flies Airbuses.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. I--yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: He can--but, he can fly any kind of plane is essentially what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: And your other brother, Judson, Jr., is a--is a visual artist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a visual artist in San Francisco [California]. He exhibits under the name of Mondo Jud Hart, so he's a well known visual artist in the San Francisco Bay Area and he's also an author. He published a book about ten years ago about his--one of his characters whose name is Jabbo ['The Book of Jabbo: Revelations in 6 Languages,' Mondo Jud Hart]. It's a, a--
Speaker 1: And do you have--and there are no sisters?
Speaker 2: No, just my cousins who grew up with us like sisters.
Speaker 1: Yeah. The three--
Speaker 2: Three cousins--
Speaker 1: --that, that--
Speaker 2: --two of--two of whom have now passed, passed on.
Story_ID: 622105
Speaker 1: So, I asked you early on at the beginning, what did you consider to be your primary profession and you said educator. In the course of our conversation, it turns out that you are also a teacher, a school administrator, a real estate developer, corporate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Urban planner.
Speaker 1: --urban planner, corporate--
Speaker 2: Author, filmmaker.
Speaker 1: Filmmaker, sociologist, social psychologist. Is that why The Boston Globe called you a renaissance man?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you consider yourself--
Speaker 2: And athlete.
Speaker 1: Oh, and athlete. So, what's next? What's, what's on your bucket list?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanna--I'd, I'd like to finish these--create this franchise around having ten films about real life heroes, Bessie Coleman, James Herman Banning [Hart's maternal great uncle, James Banning], William Powell [William J. Powell], Will--Hubert Fauntleroy Julian [Hubert Julian], Eugene Bullard, that that becomes a franchise. I have scripts for two of those now that I'm working on. I'd like to, to finish that. And then, of course, my daughter [Ayanna Hart Beebe], I'm a--I'm a senior citizen now, so my daughter is a producing partner, so that transition happens. She can take over the mantle. And then the other is a project I've been working on in L.A. County [Los Angeles County, California] to expand the biotech industry cluster in L.A. County, to create what I did in Boston [BioSquare, Boston, Massachusetts] and to provide the training for African American, Mexican Americans to get into this biotech industry of the future. So, those are two primary things that I think that I would like to advance.
Story_ID: 622106
Speaker 1: You wanted to tell me about the West Angels--
Speaker 2: West Angeles.
Speaker 1: Ca- West Angeles cathedral.
Speaker 2: Well, my wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart] grew up in the Church of God in Christ. Her parents [Jean Glenn Hinton and Lewis Hinton] founded Mount Zion Church of God in Christ in their living room in Muskegon, Michigan, in the '40s [1940s]. That's the church that my wife and I got married in in March of twen- 1969. It's, of course, out of their living room. It's a much bigger church now. It's one of the churches I helped with this thirty--Leon Sullivan's 36-10 Plan [sic. 10-36 Plan] to pay off their mortgage. So, when we moved to Los Angeles [California] in 1990--
Speaker 1: Oh, excuse me a second. When we were talking about that plan, we weren't on camera. So, just tell me again, Leon Sullivan was--
Speaker 2: Leon Sullivan was a--
Speaker 1: A minister and--
Speaker 2: --minister, Reverend Leon Sullivan. He founded Opportunities Industrial Center--Industrialization Center [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].
Speaker 1: OIC.
Speaker 2: OIC, which many well known individuals have come out of. He also had an idea for black churches who were interested in retiring their mortgage. He calls it the 36-10 Plan, and that is the--if, if the preach- if the lead pastor can convince, in addition to paying your tithes and offering, for thirty-six weeks, you pay ten dollars above what you would pay for your tithes and offering and dedicate that ten dollars for the members of your congregation for thirty-six weeks to pay off the mortgage if you have a mortgage. That's his 36-10 Plan. So, anyway, the Mount Zion Church of God in Christ, we got married there in 1969. Then, when we moved to L.A. in 1990, we joined West Angeles Church of God in Christ, which is the megachurch in South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. We joined in 1990. That's the year that they institute a plan to build a larger cathedral, a larger facility, a larger edifice because the exis- Ch- Bishop Charles Blake [Charles E. Blake, Sr.] is a, is a pastor of--and at the time, he was the presiding bishop for the Southern California Jurisdiction [Southern California First Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction]. He was preaching four morning services, a very popular church, preaching four morning services. We knew that we'd have to build a bigger facility so, he wouldn't live long if he was preaching four morning services. So, we embarked in 1990 in a building fund to build a five thousand seat cathedral. Bishop Blake was the chairman of the building fund. Magic Johnson was a co-chair. Denzel Washington was a co-chair of--very--celebrities like that attend this church. I was a project manager, the one that--with the development skills to make sure that this thing was built and the money was raised. So, we embarked on building a West Angeles cathedral at the corner of Crenshaw [Boulevard] and Exposition [Boulevard], South L.A., five thousand seat auditorium. That opened in April of 2001, so it's been open, open about sixteen years now. The church itself has about twenty-five thousand members. Bishop Blake now is the presiding bishop of the Church of God in Christ denomina- denomination, which is based in Memphis [Tennessee]. And our Mason Temple in Memphis [Mason Temple Church of God in Christ] where--is where Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] preached his last sermon, April 3rd, 1968, when he was saying, "I've reached the mountaintop." And then the next day, he was assassinated, April 4th, 1968. So, anyway, the chur- West Angeles Church of God in Christ which, like I said, I was the developer if you wanna put it in that context, but I was really the project manager. And I became the project manager because I was serving initially on the demolition committee 'cause there were buildings on this five acre site that we were building on that the buildings had to be taken down. So, I was a demolition--on the demolition committee. When we took the buildings down, the demolition committee came--became the building committee. And so Bishop Blake had 250 churches under his jurisdiction so that he was trying to be the project manager at the same time he was the--our pastor. So, one building committee meeting I said, "Bishop, you can't be the project manager and be the--a preacher and have all these other churches." So, everybody turned to me and said, "Okay, you're the project manager" (laughter). So, I became the project manager and so the, the cathedral opened in 2001. So--
Speaker 1: How much did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) now we're to--
Speaker 1: How much did it cost?
Speaker 2: In 2001 dollars when we finished, it was like sixty-five million [dollars]. Today's dollars, it would be about 130 million. That's total development cost, land acquisition, architectural, what they cause soft cost, hard cost, sixty-five million.
Speaker 1: Would that be--would that be the most expensive African American edifice in America?
Speaker 2: At that point that it opened, yes. And then if you look at it from the standpoint of how we raised the money, it cost sixty-five million. Thirty-five million came--was basically equity if you want to put it that way, church members contributing to the building fund between 1990 and when it opened in 2001, that was about thirty-five million. We borrowed thirty million from Wells Fargo bank [Wells Fargo and Company]. So at the time, that was the largest loan of a black church in the United States. We borrowed thirty million. So we're now embarking on a process to pay that mortgage down, so that mortgage now is maybe ten million. So, we're, we're on a--we're on the--we start with a five acre campus, we build--we, we bought adjoining property, so we're now seven acres.
Story_ID: 622107
Speaker 1: Continuing about, about the, the church [West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Los Angeles, California], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the church, we initially had five acres, so we built a five thousand seat cathedral. We're in the process of paying down the mortgage to--down from thirty, to down to about ten now, ten million [dollars]. And we have another--we want to build our office building. We have about two hundred employees. We call it the Family Life Center [West Angeles Family Life Center] right in the back of the church flush to the rear of the cathedral and a parking structure 'cause we all--we built a five hundred stall parking garage as part of building the cathedral, now we need another five hundred stall garage, you know. So, our--the capital campaign that we're embarking on now where, again, Bishop Blake [Charles E. Blake, Sr.] is the--a chair with Magic Johnson as a co-chair, is to raise enough money to pay the mortgage off entirely on the cathedral and then to raise the capital that we need to build a seventy thousand square foot office building and a five hundred stall garage without debt.
Speaker 1: And how close are you?
Speaker 2: Right now, we're at--last time I was at church, I think we're at fifteen million. So, we're in a position to pay off the mortgage and then move into the next phase with raising money to build the, the Family Life Center and the parking garage.
Speaker 1: Are you familiar with American Family Radio?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about making that part of your portfolio, too, to start some kind of national communication system that would be religious church based but of a different kind of information stream?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm affiliated with American Urban Radio Networks.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, you're affiliated with urban--okay.
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: So, that is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart] is--my wife is--we're, we're the white--we're the Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] bureau and she's a correspondent on--of American Urban Radio Networks. And she, she is like April Ryan is in the White House [Washington, D.C.]. April is the White House bureau, we're the Hollywood bureau, West Coast bureau.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, my wife--like I said, she started out in radio, so she's, you know, still in radio. And then we have a gospel network with AURN and I'm friends with the previous owners and friends of the current owner. But--so, yeah, we've had a long time relationship with urban--American Urban Radio Networks.
Speaker 1: So you're--
Speaker 2: And we've had a long time relationship with BET [Black Entertainment Television] as well.
Story_ID: 622108
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mom [Murlee Shaw Hart] as we enter the last half hour of our interview. She was an educator who was the, the first or one of the first African American teachers hired by the Denver public school system, but tell me about her as a person.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a very smart individual, you know, ahead of her time in the sense of being African American and a woman and being smarter than everybody else in the room and that particularly--that was difficult for black men, but it was even more difficult for white men. But, she was a very talented person. She--most of her career, she was a teacher in diagnostic learning in the Denver Public Schools. She passed away November 15th of 2015 and I'm--
Speaker 1: She was how old?
Speaker 2: Ninety-three. She was about three weeks short of being ninety-four. So, I'm the personal representative for her estate. But, she was a school teacher. She was a songwriter. She published over five hundred songs. She was very computer literate. She--the, the, the reading and math games that she developed as part of her teaching--she was primarily a elementary school teacher--di- and she worked with the diagnostic learning center in the Denver Public Schools. She developed computer and math reading games and so I'm in the process of--they're on what we--floppy disks, so I'm in the process of, of--you know, upgrade, upgrade--updating the technology and marketing those--that software is basically her intellectual property. She also did computer art, so all over her house are, are computer--is computer art that she created. And my older brother [Mondo Jud Hart] is a visual artist, she was a visual artist in her later years when she retired especially. So, she was what you would call a renaissance woman, an educator, a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother. And it's interesting, I have a--you know, when I, I hear people say, you know, I have--, "My, my, my, my mother or my grandmother is not computer literate. I had to teach them how to--," and I'm saying, "No, no, no, no." In my instance, my, my mother was more computer literate than her sons, than her son [Christopher A. Hart] who was a engineer, than me is supposed to be--and her older son who is a visual artist is very computer--she computed, like I say, computer, reading, and math games that are--that are intellectual property that are gonna be on the market soon, you know, primarily for school districts and elementary school.
Speaker 1: So, she developed these but she didn't market them?
Speaker 2: Well, she started to, but, you know, she retired when she was sixty-five, so after she was sixty-five was where she could really devote her attention to, I've got these things. I got music, I got copyrights for music, I've got these computer reading and literacy games, I got computer art, how do I then, you know, turn these into--this--make this intellectual property? So, that's kind of like my job at this point.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When you asked me earlier what are the things I wanna do until at the point that I can do nothing anymore, that's one of the things, too, is to take her intellectual property, her music, her, her computer art, and do what she was attempting to do, but do it on a, a scale that she would appreciate.
Story_ID: 622109
Speaker 1: Were any of her [Hart's mother, Murlee Shaw Hart] songs ever recorded or covered by any--by anyone, do you know?
Speaker 2: There were--I'm--that's one of the things I'm finding out as I go back through. I remember from early--'cause I remember people like Nat King Cole's brother, Ike Cole, come and visit us and other song writers and sing or some--I, I--I'm--that's one of the things I'm trying to uncover now. My wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart] is a singer, so we've done some of her music. We've covered some of her songs. But there are--and then there are local Denver [Colorado] musical artists. For example, there's a young man--not young anymore, he's older than me. He's Purnell Steen. He's a, a noted piano player and jazz musician in Denver. And when I had--when we did the celebration of my, my, my mother's life, it was at her house, which was like a art gallery and we sat up a jazz trio. So, Purnell and his jazz trio performed and he would tell the story about when he, when he was first taking piano lessons in '50 [1950], how my mother would give his mother money to help her pay for his piano lessons. And then later in life when he was an established jazz musician, you know, in the Denver area--he's also an activist--that my mother said, you know, "I've got some of, of my original music, Purnell, I want you to compose and arrange some of this." And to this day, he still tells the story of how he, he was--he broke into tears because she had asked him to do this and also she was gonna pay him, right? And so he, he's, he's composed and arranged and played some of her work in the Denver area. So, that's another aspect of me trying to get into this and expand the--you know, those who record her music.
Speaker 1: That's P-U- P-U-R-N-E-L-L?
Speaker 2: P-U-R-N-E-L-L, S-T-E-E-N, Purnell Steen. So, he's a--he's a graduate of East Denver High School [East High School, Denver, Colorado] as well, so I--when I told you the story of my brother, Chris [Christopher A. Hart], being inducted into the hall of fame there and Larry Dunn from Earth, Wind, and Fire being inducted, Purnell was inducted that same ceremony. So, I have--I took footage of Larry Dunn as a pianist, the Earth, Wind and Fire guy. Purnell is a pianist, so I have footage when the--when the event ended and everybody is kind of milling around, they, they both went to a piano--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --like pianist do, right--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and started jamming together, you know. So, I--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --went and took a little few shots. That's Larry Dunn, Earth, Wind and Fire, Purnell Steen, two different generations--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --of music. And, and you don't play any instruments yourself?
Speaker 2: No. I, I sing.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well--
Speaker 2: Not too well.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: But, see, my mother, she organized us as a group. Like my mother, my two brothers and I, we used to have a group and we'd sing around Denver.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, okay. So, how long did that go on?
Speaker 2: Probably about, you know, until we got into high school. Then, we got too--we--the--we, we--the boys, my brothers and I got kind of too busy and we were all into sports and stuff, so we kind of didn't pursue it too much when we got into high school.
Speaker 1: So, I assume you sang at church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was an altar boy--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --and sang.
Speaker 1: And, and--altar boy, Catholic?
Speaker 2: Episcopal.
Speaker 1: Episcopal. But your mother was--no, wait, who's church--oh, your wife was Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 2: My wife is Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was raised at, at Holy Redeemer Episcopal [Church of the Holy Redeemer]--
Speaker 1: Episcopal--
Speaker 2: --Church--
Speaker 1: --Church.
Speaker 2: --in Denver.
Speaker 1: And your dad [Judson Hart], was he involved in church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was the deacon. He was very active in the church and the--and our--and our--and the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].
Speaker 1: So, what kind of music did, did your mom have you guys performing?
Speaker 2: Well, this is in the '50s [1950s], so it was probably what you would call now popular music.
Speaker 1: Popular music, okay. Not--
Speaker 2: And it was some of her--
Speaker 1: Not religious.
Speaker 2: No, no. We weren't doing religious. It was--it was basically popular music and then some of her songs. But, it wasn't--we weren't, we weren't a religious singing group. We were more like--she--and she loved Sam Cooke so, you know, she--
Speaker 1: "Born by the river"--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --"in a little shack" ['A Change Is Gonna Come']. Did you rehearse a lot? Did she have you guys rehearse a lot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: In our basement.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: 'Cause our basement, like I said at the time, was my brother's art gallery. We had--so, we had the, the Disney characters on the wall.
Speaker 1: So, she was the--so, did she sing--
Speaker 2: She was on the piano.
Speaker 1: Did she sing with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah. She was, she was our--she was the piano player--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we were like a vocal trio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The three boys.
Speaker 1: But, I mean, did she vocalize with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, she vocalized with us, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know what you were paid?
Speaker 2: Do I know what we were paid?
Speaker 1: I mean, I assume when you were going around performing--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we get paid.
Speaker 1: But, but, were you getting the money or did mom keep it for you?
Speaker 2: No, mom get the money.
Speaker 1: Mom got the money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's college tuition.
Speaker 1: And she kept it for you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) College tuition.
Speaker 1: And, and were you all dressed up?
Speaker 2: But we didn't--we didn't get paid for mowing the lawn, though, and shoveling snow.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and were you all dressed the same? She had a little--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We had a little--you know, and she was a--she, she was a very good piano player, so she, she was a piano player.
Speaker 1: Do you have any recordings of it?
Speaker 2: I may have. That's part of what I'm going through--
Speaker 1: Going through her stuff.
Speaker 2: --now as I--as I'm going through her stuff 'cause she had a large house--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Denver.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, so, so, did your dad have papers that you also went through when he passed?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how old was he when he passed?
Speaker 2: He, he was seventy-nine. He had been eighty if he'd have been--made it to his--
Speaker 1: So, I assume--
Speaker 2: --October twenty--
Speaker 1: --you, you finished going through his papers?
Speaker 2: Well, they're all--'cause they lived in the same house. It was a big--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --house in Denver.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. So, everything is with your mom.
Speaker 2: Everything. So, some of the stuff, we've kind of--we got the house cleaned out in late June--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but--so, some of the stuff is in storage in Denver, some of it's in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and so I'm still in the process of sorting and going through and cataloguing.
Story_ID: 622110
Speaker 1: So far, what has been the most surprising thing that you've learned about your parents that you didn't know as a result of going through their, their documents and papers?
Speaker 2: Well, you appreciate your parents as you're growing up, but to really hear people today talk about their leadership in Denver [Colorado] at the time. Like, I go--for, for example, I was at a--one of my friends' seventieth birthday party a couple years ago, went back to Denver to his sister's house, had a out--backyard barbecue, and I had at least two or three people come up that I had grown up with. And they--they're telling me about how their--my dad [Judson Hart] got them their first house, you know, or how my dad found them the architect that helped them when they wanted to redesign the house. So, just, you know, things like that. And then--and these, these were, you know, black people and when I go to my fiftieth high school reunion at East [East High School, Denver, Colorado], I used to have white kids come up and tell me, you know, "Your dad gave me my first job." Or, or, or some of them who went into teaching, "Your mother [Murlee Shaw Hart] was like such a mentor to me when I went into the teaching profession."
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So, it's just things that, you know, you, you, you take your parents for granted. You--they die and you're like, oh my god, I'm, you know--but then you have your friends come up and tell you things about your parents as they were growing up as your peers, right? And they're telling you these things. They're retired now. They're in their sixties, seventies, you know. "That's how I got my first house." "Your father or your mother was a very important mentor when I was teaching at such and such and such school in Denver," you know. And it's--you, you--it gives you a, you know, posthumous appreciation.
Speaker 1: And what would you say are the most--not things, philosophy--philosophically speaking that you take from your parents that you live today?
Speaker 2: Well, like I say, you know, going to church every Sunday, see my father in a position of responsibility. I'm a altar boy [at Church of the Holy Redeemer, Denver, Colorado]. Me and my brothers [Mondo Jud Hart and Christopher A. Hart] were altar boys, so we had responsibilities, you know, so I carry that forward. I meet my wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart]. I'm not an--a practicing Episcopalian now. I'm Church of God in Christ. It's a little more vibrant, a little more active, a little more--than an Episcopal service. And I'm a--I try to emulate my father. I'm a--I'm a leader in the church [West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Los Angeles, California]. He was one who helped raise money when the church wanted to expand or whatever. I'm in that--doing that same thing. So, it's really taking those lessons that they taught me in terms of God comes first. God, family, you know, are the first things you pay attention to, and I just said, okay, that seems to work. It worked for them. It's working for me. And so as I think of myself as an educator, I--that's the message I try--whatever I've done in my life is that--that's, you know, God first.
Story_ID: 622111
Speaker 1: What would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy is going to be the buildings that I've built that people can go to. I, I think of myself, if you look at biotechnology coming up with treatments that will help people heal. I look at building a cathedral [West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Los Angeles, California]. What is--we go to church, we're talking about healing, right? So, those two--that's what I see as my legacy, is buildings in--that promote healing, whether you're talking about medicinal, whether you're talking about religious. So, kind of the sacred and the secular healing that we need as individuals, that we need as a society.
Speaker 1: And the project in Boston [Massachusetts] isn't the only one that you've been involved in revitalizing.
Speaker 2: No, I've done a lot,
Speaker 1: What are some others?
Speaker 2: Well, I was involved with Urban Land Institute when, when Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] devastated New Orleans [Louisiana]. We were--
Speaker 1: Rebuilding New Orleans (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) rebuilding New Orleans, yeah, um-hm. South L.A. [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] after the riots in the--speaking--not the '65 [1965] riots, but the--
Speaker 1: The Rodney King--
Speaker 2: --Rodney King riots, you know. My hometown of Denver [Colorado], Boston--
Speaker 1: You've done some work on redevelopment in Denver?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what, what--
Speaker 2: Well, one, one specific project I'm involved with now is rebuilding the Hattie McDaniel Museum in Five Points [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In other cities where I've been involved, Camden, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: What did--
Speaker 2: San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: What did you do in Camden?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we--again, Urban Land Institute, we--we're planners and developers. They asked us to come in to help them come up with a rev- revitalize--redevelopment plan for Haddon Avenue. That's the main street that goes through Camden and it's bookended by two medical centers, which are very active. But, they--there's need for work in between. It's a basically if you're familiar with Camden very--when we visited Camden, it was--it was known as the most dangerous city in the country (laughter). And San Antonio, the same thing, doing similar things in San Antonio. Washington, D.C., I helped with the Urban Land Institute when Anthony Williams [Anthony A. Williams] was the mayor. He ins- he instituted a--initiated a Great Streets program, five corridors in D.C., to impr- you know, make them great streets. So, we helped them--excuse me--in 2006 implement their Great Streets program and then the Great Streets program, which started in Washington, D.C., has been adopted by other cities. L.A. [Los Angeles, California], the mayor of L.A., Mayor Garcetti [Eric Garcetti], who is a friend of mine, he's implemented the Great Streets program in L.A. based upon what we did in Washington, D.C. So, several cities around the country either as a, a individual developer, urban planner, and then with the Urban Land Institute 'cause that's one of the things that we focus on with one of our advisory services program is Urban Land Institute. People call us in to help them come up with redevelopment, revitalization strategies. Might be a disaster like after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] in New York [New York] or a disaster like Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.
Story_ID: 622112
Speaker 1: Is there anything that I have not asked you that you want to add?
Speaker 2: I guess one of the things is, is the regrets thing. I guess that's one of the--regrets. Probably regrets is that I didn't actually put the time in to really become both a NBA [National Basketball Association] star and a Major League Baseball [MLB] star, to be a two sport star. That's my main regret.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, maybe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kind of like Deion Sanders, you know?
Speaker 1: Or, or Bo [Bo Jackson].
Speaker 2: Or Bo (laughter).
Speaker 1: And look how long they didn't last (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and yet you continue.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You've had--
Speaker 2: But if I say that's my regret 'cause I, I was--you know, I was a very good athlete and a lot of my friends did that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but I was kind of like I wanted to do this, you know, education, you know, building stuff. But, I think--you know, and, and I, I joke to say, say it in this context, when Mike Conley [Mike Conley, Jr.] last year, plays for the Memphis Grizzlies, Mike Conley, 6'1" point guard, when Mike Conley signed a five year contract for $150 million, I said to my wife [HistoryMaker Tanya Hart], "I gotta find a fountain of youth or a--what do they call it, a hot tub time machine." If Mike Conley signs for five years $150 million, I gotta find the fountain of youth.
Speaker 1: Because you were looking at him playing saying I could--in my day (laughter)--
Speaker 2: And then--and then even further, my, my, my high yellow younger compatriot, Steph Curry [Stephen Curry], signs five years for 201 million. It's like oh, my god.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Why didn't I become--well, of course, the old school guys who always complain, they didn't pay like that back--
Speaker 1: Then (laughter).
Speaker 2: --then (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, but, as you pointed out, you might not have made it past the name.
Speaker 2: That's right. And--but, Charles Barkley likes to put it, he blames his mother [Charcey Glenn], said, "Why did my mother have me back then? Why didn't she have me twenty years ago" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
