I'm Julia Hamilton Smith. I was born in Washington, D. C., August the first, 1885. My parents were Hamilton S. Smith and Julia Luke Brooks Smith. At the age of one month I was taken to Boston, Massachusetts, to visit the grandparents and be christened in Advent Church on Brimmer Street, Boston, Massachusetts, Beacon Hill.
At the age of three to six or seven, I used to make the trip to my grandparents' home in Boston on the Colonial Express with my aunt, Florence J. Smith. I enjoyed going back and forth to Massachusetts because my grandmother and my aunts were very kind and loving to me, and my grandmother used to take me to all the places. There was a playground down at Charles Street near the river, and she would take me there— the sandbox and the swings—and to the Public Gardens on the swan boats, and I enjoyed that. As I grew older and used to come back and forth, she would take me to Revere Beach and I'd get on the hobbyhorses and...I'd get on the horse and Grandmother would sit in the seat. Her daughters always used to say, "Oh yes, Mother likes to have Julia come up because she's doing the things she never did when she was a child." But they were very, very kind to me.
Those years I went back and forth... A year and a half after I was born, I was blessed with a lovely little brother that I loved dearly. Mother had him at home in the summertime, and I was in Massachusetts. When I got to be about five years old, that summer I decided I didn't want to go to Massachusetts. I wanted to stay home. My Aunt Florence, who was devoted to me, was shocked—I guess I have inherited some of her traits. My mother was a homebody. And so every Saturday and holidays my aunt always took me some place— points of interest in Washington, to the museums. Sundays my father used to take﻿2
JS: (cont.) my brother and myself for a walk, and we'd go to the zoological park, to see the animals, which of course, attracted my brother.
This summer when my aunt got ready—school closed and she was going back home for the summer vacation—I told her that I didn't want to go to Boston this year. She was quite hurt and disappointed. She decided that, nothing she could do, just went home alone. When she came in my grandmother said, "Where's my little child?" She said, "She didn't want to come, Mother." So immediately my grandmother's looks dropped, and she felt very bad. She sat down and wrote my father and wanted to know what the trouble was. So the result of all of this was when my father told me my grandmother wanted me to come and missed me, childlike, I wanted to go.
He decided that he'd see what he could do about it because he couldn't take me at that time. He knew a porter, and he got in touch with the porter on the Pullman train. I was packed up and duly tagged, with lunch, doll baby, and told not to get oat of that seat, or that car, until my grandfather or
my aunt came in the car for me. I was an obedient child.
When the Colonial Express reached Jersey City, it always ran on a ferryboat; and you got out of the car and went upstairs to look at the harbor. I had been up there many times with my aunt. But my father told me not to get out of that car, so I didn't get out. Everybody was out of the car except three ladies, and I can see them as plain today as though it was yesterday, a mother and two daughters. Evidently Father had just died, because they were in deep mourning. In those days everybody wore black, and draped themselves in black. They were all friendly and interested in me, this little girl traveling all by herself. I guess I always was a little talkative, and chattering around. So the youngest daughter came and sat on the edge of my chair and chatted with me, and the porter came in several times to see if I was all right. And when the train went on the ferry, he came to take me upstairs. I said, "I'm not going upstairs. My father told me not to get out of this car, and I'm not going to get out." He tried three times, but he wasn't successful.
The ladies ordered their lunch to be brought in from the dining car into the parlor car, and set up a table, and insisted that I come and sit at their table. I brought my little lunch box with me that my mother had fixed; I had a nice trip. We were the only ones left in the car. They got out at Providence and handed me a box of candy, and I got to Boston, my eyes as big as saucers because everybody was out of the car but me. Then here I saw my grandfather coming in one door, and my aunt coming in the other door; I had arrived safely. This was quite an event for Washington because at that time it was almost unheard of for a little girl making a trip from Washington, five hundred miles, alone. So everybody stayed up until the telegram was delivered at midnight, that I had arrived safely. It was a twelve-hour ride.
Well, that was an experience that is still very fresh in my mind because it was pleasant. I'd been over the road with my aunt, and I knew the road, and I enjoyed the trip and found these people very pleasant. When I arrived at my grandmother's home, I said, "Here, Grandmother, here's a box of candy a lady gave to me, but I didn't touch it because... You taste it and see whether it is all right." And my grandmother thought that was cute. But I had heard my folks talk about somebody had been poisoned with candy out in California, so I'd always been taught not to eat anything from strangers. I had a nice summer.﻿3
JS: (cont.) From that time on, off and on, I went to Boston, but I played with the children in the neighborhood, and we jumped rope and played jacks, and skipped around, and sometimes boys and girls were playing together. The boys would be playing ball, and occasionally they'd break a window. My brother always came back home and told, "They was playing ball, Papa, and we broke a window on 16th Street." We lived right off of 16th Street.
CG: In Northwest Washington?
JS: In the Northwest. And my father said, "Well, as long as you're honest, I won't punish you." In those days, they had no playgrounds.
In the meanwhile, I was sent to a private school that was opened by a lady fr om Philadelphia, Mrs. Corbin. I don't remember how many children were there, but they were children in the neighborhood, not more than three or four blocks at the least, from S Street to U Street...children whose parents were friends of my parents, a nice group of children. I don't know how much we learned. There were no kindergartens in those days, but we sang songs and recited poetry and learned how to live with each other and get along, and played little games. It was a pleasant experience.
CG: Was Mrs. Corbin a colored lady?
JS: Yes, she was colored, and she lived on 16th Street in a house that was owned by the Cooks, and Mr. Cook was superintendent of the schools at one time. We went there for a year, and it was nice; we had a nice time. Then I was old enough to enter the public schools, and when I went, I was placed in the primary school, which was Magruder School. I don't know who, or whom it was named for. I don't remember right now, but they had teachers there, for it served as a training center for young women entering into the teaching profession. So we had fine teachers. Next door—Magruder was on M Street— was Sumner where I went to the grammar school. I entered the third grade at six years of age, the youngest in my class. I stayed the youngest in my class throughout my whole period of education.
After the fourth grade I was sent to Sumner School where the offices were of the superintendent, George F. T. Cook, an aristocrat, a fine man, and Henry P. Montgomery, the supervisor for that area at that time. There were ten divisions in the public schools, and that was the tenth division. Colored and white were separated, but they had the same course of study. They had well-trained teachers, fortunately. I can remember some of them. One was Miss Ada C. Hand, a first grade teacher, and I contacted her later in life, when I went to the training school, and a Miss Bowie in the primary school. And then there was Miss Blennie Bruce who was aunt to Judge Bruce Robinson, who has just retired here.
CG: Was Miss Bruce any relation to the Bruces, Senator Bruce?
JS: No.
CG: You were telling me about the different teachers, Miss Hand, Miss Bruce, Miss Bowie.
Yes. Well, I finished the seventh grade at Sumner School. That June or July﻿4
(cont.) my father, who was a special examiner for the Bureau of Pensions, and used his law training in that particular type of work—his profession was dentistry—had been sent to Kansas on one assignment. This time he was being sent to Indiana where he was going to be stationed for a year. My mother suffered a great deal from hay fever, and he thought perhaps a change of climate might be beneficial, so we went to Columbus, Indiana, forty miles from Indianapolis.
Indiana was a borderline state, very prejudiced, but my father's position, of course, demanded that we get the best that this little town offered. So we lived two doors from the son of the mayor of the city, and directly back of us was the representative of that area in Congress. All of our neighbors were of a group, and there were not very many colored people there of the class of people that we had associated with in Washington. So we lived our own life. They were rather rude, they were very seldom ever seen in the area where we were. But they would come out of their way to be objectionable and yell, "There's where the high class live is here." I don't know what they called...but it was very disagreeable.
There was only one elementary school there, and up to the sixth grade they had one colored teacher who taught all six grades, so the children didn't learn too much. But from the seventh and eighth grade, the colored children could go in with the white children. So I entered the eighth grade, and there were two colored girls there, who were very, very mean to me, but I paid no attention to them. My hair was long, braided, and ribbons on it; of course, they pulled the ribbons off every time they got a chance, at playtime. I sat nowhere near them in the school, and I imagine they must have had some compulsory law, but there was just those two in the class. They made no contribution.
A doctor, a physician that had to contact my father sometimes in reference to his report on illness of some of these people who were applying for pensions of the Civil War veterans, his daughter was in the class with me. She was swarthy, and she could have gone with my group as well as she could have gone with the white group. Had she been in Washington, I had friends fairer than she was. In fact, I had relatives that were fairer than she was. So one day she got her dander up and her nerve and said, "I want to ask you a question." I said, "You can ask me. I don't promise you I'll answer it." So she says, "I was telling my father how smart you were, and every time we had a question, and nobody else knew it, your hand went up; and that you had been on trains and on boats, and you had sailed down from Boston to Norfolk out into the Atlantic Ocean, and you'd been in the mountains. So I want to ask you, are you all colored?" I said, "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm all American. Just like you are. I'm no more colored than you are. I'm an American citizen." "Well, you're so smart. My father said your father's a brilliant man." I said, "Well, we won't discuss that. I'm here this year to go to school." I led the class into the high school.
My father had some shocking, dangerous experiences, and he didn't want to expose us children to too much that was unpleasant. It was quite a strain on my mother because in parts of Indiana there were no railroads, and he had to travel in a double-horse buggy; of course, there were no colored drivers, so he had to contact a livery. He had to get this white man for a driver, and﻿5
JS: (cont.) they traveled twenty and thirty miles in this buggy, and had to relay the horses and get another set of horses, to go on and on. One night the driver said to him, "Doctor, do you see anything?" He says, "Yes, I see two men." That was still the wild West, and my father reached down. He was allowed to be armed, and he got his revolvers out. He had belonged to the militia, and he knew how to use them. It was moonlight. And then when the buggy and the men met, they divided. One went on the driver's side, and the other went on my father's side. The one on my father's side with an oath screamed, "Let him go. He's armed." That saved his life.
In a station in Indiana they had a sign up where my father had to go for a deposition. When he reached this one-horse hotel, the proprietor said, "No, we don't have any reservation for you. Didn't you see the sign in the railroad station?" He said, "Yes, I saw a sign there, 'Nigger, don't let the sun go down on you here.'" By that time, my father had gotten out his reservation statement, showed it to him. He was perplexed. Father said, "Now you can suit yourself. You can either accommodate me, or you don't accommodate me. But I want to tell you, I'm an agent of the United States government, and I'm not taking any foolishness. If you want trouble, I'll give you trouble. I'm a peaceful man, but when the issue arises, I know how to take care of it." So he decided he would let him stay.
He thought he was in for danger, and he got his guns out, got them where he could get hold of them quickly. In the meanwhile he took care of his business and there was a knock at the door. He said, "What is it?" It was the proprietor. He said, "What do you want? I'm busy." "Well, they're going to have a gathering at the common." It was right opposite the common where these people gathered from all around the country. He says, "They're going to have a time over here that I thought you'd like to see." He said, "I've got no time. I don't come here for amusement. I came here on business." He thought, sure, the word had gotten around; they were going to lynch him. They lynched a man for horse stealing right across from this hotel. But Brown County, Indiana, was known to be very prejudiced.
The time came when my father had to go back there a couple of times to interview different people, as he couldn't catch them. He took my little brother with him one day, and my brother came back with some baby chicks, which he didn't know anything about, and my mother knew less...and roasted corn eighteen inches long, as sweet as honey. They treated my brother beautifully. So it shows you that prejudice is an artificial thing. It's a mean thing, and it shows how small the human nature is in love of people. For no reason has the colored race been subjected to all of this discomfort, meanness, and death, simply because their skin is different color. That's all. Somebody has kept the myth going. They don't realize that every human being in this world has the same organs, and the same, made in the spirit of Christ. And I say, "Until man gets educated enough to realize that he's only a speck in God's creation, and until he can respect every other man and give him the same attention and courtesy that he enjoys, we will never have a peaceful world."
In September we returned, my mother brought the two children back home. In the meanwhile, I had been given a little puppy, a Skye terrier, just two or three weeks old. I put it in a basket, as my mother had a drawing room, a bedroom, and we stayed in there, and the puppy was as nice as she could be. When we﻿6
(cont.) got in to Washington station, and the train was backing in and switching out on another track to get farther in to the station, the puppy evidently realized that her journey was over, and the conductor came by, going through the car for something. And she says, "Yap, yap." He came back and says, "What was that I heard?" And my mother says, "My daughter's little puppy." "Well, it should have been in the baggage car." My mother said, "Nobody said anything about it, and I didn't know anything about putting it in the baggage car. We've taken care of the puppy. She hasn't done any harm."
The puppy grew, her name was Gypsy. A beautiful little Skye terrier...went with me wherever I went. It was, "Love me and love my dog, or I stay away." So everybody always looked for me, and if I didn't have Gypsy with me, they said, "Where's Gypsy? Where's Gypsy?"
We used to go to the mountains in West Virginia, a place called Opequon. And that was a taste of country life which I had not enjoyed before. A mother, two daughters and two sons catered to summer visitors. People would come from Baltimore and Washington and around various places, young women, and these country boys would drive up to their aunt's place. They served beautiful meals...open air. It was a nice group of people that went there. And whenever they came, of course, they had to have buggies, some kind to travel around in to see the country. It was usually Sunday when they would come, because they were working. And if you saw them after that, they asked you to go for a ride, and that of course was always nice for the city girls. If you were asked, the first person who asked you, I later learned, you were supposed to go with that same fellow each time you went out. Of course, they were trying to make some hay while the sun was shining, but I guess hard-boiled Julia didn't bite. But I had a nice time.
Then they'd come up during the night some time. They would have square dances. I can hear them now, "Swing your partner, swing your partner." Virginia reel, I think they called it. We had a nice time. They made the most delicious ice cream. Whenever they were having one of these little get-togethers, the girls, the daughters would make this ice cream and delicious cake, and we showed our appreciation. We had a very nice time. We had a hayride one day up to the mountainside, and our chaperone was deaf. She could see, but she was deaf. We had a wonderful time.
My father had become interested in photography, so everywhere he went, he had his camera. So we went back to Opequon—it's beyond Harper's Ferry—in the fall of the year to see the scenery. In the meanwhile, that summer, we had little rain, and I used to lie in the hammock under the tree sometimes and read and relax. Of course, my dog would come with me and she would lie on the ground. But evidently she caught cold, so in the fall she died. I wrote to Sue, and I told her my little doggie had died. When Father and I went back one weekend—he took some pictures of the neighboring country—one of the sons said to me, "Miss Julia, you see that dog over there? I picked that dog out for you. It's a puppy, and it's a thoroughbred shepherd and collie; the mother's a shepherd and the father's a collie, a thoroughbred—beautiful dog." I said, "I don't want any more dogs. Thank you ever so much." Well, later on my father came. I was standing talking to my father when he came up and said, "Doctor, you see that dog over there? I offered him to Miss Julia, but she don't want him." He told him it was a thoroughbred. Of course, Father had his camera, and I came back with the dog.﻿7
(cont.) The dog and I had a wonderful time, and the dog was a part of the household from then on. But the family moved and Father got sick, and finally we had to give the dog away, and the dog died of grief.
The dog had more sense than some people. My father used to come to Massachusetts to vote, and this dog was in the yard, in a little house. But my father told me to put him in the summer kitchen which was right next to the winter kitchen, built in as part of the house. There was a door that went down into the cellar. I closed that off. He said, "Now you let him stay in there, and just leave your kitchen door, just on a slight jar, in case he hears anything." I bade Laddie good night. My father and mother had come up in November, as he was going to vote. I stopped in my aunt's room, Aunt Florence, and chatted with her, as my room was on the third floor. Then I went upstairs, bade her good night, and got my clothes off, and I heard a soft whimpering sound. I said, "Now that sounds like Laddie's..." We used to leave his tags on the collar so we could locate him. Here he was, sneaking upstairs. He had gone through the hall, and didn't come in my room, which was at the head of the steps. He went through the hall into the other room—the doors were open—and there he was lying between the two bedrooms. I said, "What are you doing up here? You don't have any business up here. Come on, let's go back downstairs." Well, I caught hold of his collar, and I talked to him, and I told him, and finally there was so much commotion, my aunt opened her door, says, "What's the matter, Julia?" I said, "This dog's come upstairs. He knows better than that." Well, I got him back downstairs. I said, "You stay down there, and be a good dog." And I came on upstairs. I got in the bed. I had to go to school the next morning. So did she. Well, I had no longer settled myself in the bed when I heard this thing, "Ding, ding." That dog came upstairs every night while my father was gone.
Every day he put his paws on the windowsill and watched, for he knew about the time I came in, and watched me from what they used to call parlors. When he saw me coming, he was at the front door to greet me. And when my father came home, that night he rushed up to my father and put his paws on his shoulders, and from that time on, he never made the slightest effort to come upstairs. That has always impressed me, because it just shows you man is made
in the image of God, with a brain. We don't think animals sometimes have brains, but as I look at some of them, I wonder if their brains aren't better sometimes than human beings' brains.
When my father was taken sick, that dog would sneak upstairs and lie under the bed by his head, and my father would put his arm out of the bed and pat the dog. That dog wouldn't move. You couldn't get him to move...doing no harm. And when he wanted to go downstairs, he'd get up and go on downstairs. But you couldn't move him.
But going back, all this is connected, in a way. I went to Washington after leading the class in Indiana...to the high school. I was given a test by the superintendent, and passed the test, and was put into the M Street High School, later rebuilt and named the Dunbar High School. I went in with the class that I had left the year before, and in this class were forty smart children. At that time, they didn't have intelligence tests, but they had eighty children that they considered of superior intelligence, so they made two classes of forty each, and I was one of the fortunate ones to be in with the forty. All of the pupils from the Sumner eighth grade, which I would have been in, had I﻿8

(cont.) not gone to Indiana, were among the forty, so we went through the high school. Now, M Street High School was the first high school in Washington, D. C., regardless of race or color, and it was started by a man by the name of Syphax, whose ancestry goes back...
S-Y-P-H-A-X?
S-Y-P-H-A-X. His ancestry goes back to Custis family and George Washington, and there's still some of them living in Washington. They all went to the M Street High School.
They've been outstanding in public service.
Yes. It was a very unique relationship in school history. I don't think any other city in the country had such a school as M Street High School. For colored people to get any decent employment, very few opportunities, so the trained colored men and women from the North went South, and stopped in Washington, became teachers in M Street High School, others went farther south. But we had such teachers as Parker Bailey; William Tecumseh Jackson, who taught mathematics; Henry Bailey taught Latin and English; Caddie Parke taught mathematics.
Who?
Caddie, C-A-D-D-I-E. Caddie Parke. We always called her Caddie. They called her Caddie Parke. Laura Barley taught history; Nellie Catcher, science, chemistry; Charles Thomas, biology; and Mineola Kirkland was science and biology. And these were outstanding people whose...and the principal was Robert Terrell, who later became judge...and following him in the high school was Anna J. Cooper.
Anna Cooper.
Anna J. Cooper. C-O-O-P-E-R, Anna. Robert Terrell was the principal when I was there, and when he left, Anna J. Cooper became principal. And those are outstanding people.
Yes.
These teachers were trained in northern colleg es, and... Did I give Dr. Henry Bailey as a teacher?
Parker Bailey.
Parker Bailey, and then there's a Dr. Henry Bailey.
Now, are either one of these two men, Parker Bailey and Henry Bailey, are either one of those related to Mrs. Thurman?
No.
It's not the same family? No.﻿9
CG: Now, you were telling me why it's so important to know who these teachers are.
JS: These teachers, the names I have just given you, made a very definite impression on all the students that attended M Street High School during the time that they served. They brought their culture and their refinement, and their high ideals of living to the student body. From that training came some of our most outstanding citizens of the present era.
CG: Yes. Because when M Street became Dunbar...Dunbar has produced a lot of leadership.
JS: And it has carried on into the professions: teaching, law, medicine, dentistry, and business. And then later on, they developed a business school, business high school. Up to this present day, we have people who have been the product of my generation and future generations who have made their mark in world history. Edward Brooke, senator, first colored man from Massachusetts to be a senator; and the second one, he followed, Blanche K. Bruce, B. K. Bruce, who was from Mississippi; and there's Robert Weaver, Thurgood Marshall, Judge Hastie; Roscoe Bruce, superintendent of Washington schools; Dr. Montague Cobb, all of the Wormley family. Oh, I could name you hundreds of graduates from Dunbar High School. There has been said that Dunbar High School was for the elite. Dunbar High School was open for all of the children in Washington who qualified and were able to attend a high school, regardless of where they lived, for Washington was divided into four sections, Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast, and the division line was from the Capitol, the United States Capitol. Children came from all classes, and in my class were two outstanding young men from the Southwest section.
CG: What was the difference between the different sections in terms of social class?
JS: Well, the whole city was divided into these different sections, and when you wrote mail, you always had to put Northwest, or Northeast, or Southwest, or Southeast, and anybody could live in those sections. There were colored people living in all sections.
CG: Were there differences between, say, the colored people in the Southwest and the colored people in Northwest?
JS: There were colored people in the Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, and
Northeast. I have taught in the Northwest, I taught in the Southwest, I taught in the Southeast, and I taught in the Northeast.
CG: Did you notice any differences between the neighborhoods that you taught in?
JS: I shouldn't say, in the Southwest was a lower class. The majority of the
people were the poor people, of colored people of Washington, and poor whites, too. In those days, they had a very high regard for what you might say, the upper class, or the educated class of colored people. When they had the riot, I think it was around 1919—the schools were not in session. It was July. But many of the women didn't get the opportunity for training for teachers, and...
CG: You were saying, "July, the schools were out..."﻿10
JS: The people in the Southwest were poor, but when they had the riot, my
father, along with all the other, what they call the elite—now I believe they're naming them the aristocrats—got out in the street. They heard that there was going to be this trouble, and most of the women worked in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. At all the car stops in the Northwest, they stationed themselves on the corners to tell the women to go straight home, there was going to be trouble. They stood there about two or more hours, and up come these great big cars, open cars with machine guns on them, what you call, the poor people, the lower class of people from the Southwest. "Gentlemen, riding around the corners, go home and take care of your wives and your daughters and your sisters. We will take care of the rebels." Now, that was the spirit that existed between the poorer class of people, and the more affluent.
In the Northwest there were some poor people, too. But the masses of the lower class were in Southwest. When they say Southwest, that was south of the Capitol. Now that has all been renovated, and they have many of the new government buildings down there, with the condominium apartments. I taught twice in the Southwest section, at Cardozo, where I was assistant principal, and at Randall Group School. A few years later, a new junior high school, Randall, was built, where I had taught English and history, social studies, rather. I taught in the Southeast one year. I always found the people cooperative.
When children were out of school for a couple of days and we got no response— they lived in alleys in the Southwest, so we were not allowed to go in there alone—two teachers would have to go; sometimes three. The men were sitting on these little two-step doors, because the houses were anything but desirable for decent living. That's the best they could afford, because they were all in manual labor or street employees in...none of them were in government service. They were using profane language and gambling. When they'd spy us, they'd put their hands up over their eyes and someone would holler out, "Shut up. Them's teachers. Ladies, hope you didn't hear us. We didn't mean that for you."
I tell you this because I think it's very important that at the era when I came along, we didn't get the violence that we are experiencing today from people who are having a much better way of life, even though they may be on welfare, than the people were in those days who were living from hand to mouth, and accepting gifts. Many of them came all the way from Southwest to do a day's work for the people in the Northwest. Cars ran up. There was only one fare, five cents. The people would always treat them very nicely. They would supply them with clothes from their children, and they never left with a day's work that they didn't have enough for a meal or two. And there was that relationship that existed.
I and this friend of mine, very often, usually twice a month, would go down into the various parts of the Southwest, and of course, the men—what money they had earned, drank it up before they got home, and sometimes the children and mothers didn't have any food in the house. I would take a market basket and go by, as we had open markets in those days, and vegetables on the street, and in the building were the meats—although my salary was small. I would stop and carry some food down. Then they didn't have any fuel to cook it with— so they had bundles of wood in the store—and I would take some of the children to the little corner store and get a bundle of wood and a bag of coal on﻿11
JS: (cont.) Saturdays, and had the respect of the people. We were not afraid to go into those alleys. They treated us just as nicely as they could, accepted what we did.
The teachers banded themselves together and organized, and the lady who was head of the primary department of the schools organized us, had this club, and paid so much money each month as she made arrangements with one of the shoe stores, and we would give tickets to the mother when a child couldn't come to school because they had no shoes. We paid for the shoes. There was that cooperation. There was no welfare in those days, no welfare.
My mother had help; this lady used to come two or three times a week to help with the work, and I remember very keenly, one day my mother said to her, "Maggie, will you hurry up and finish? I want to give you your lunch." "This is Miss Julia's dress, and I just love Miss Julia. I just got to be particular with it, because after a while this dress is going to come to my daughter." So it was... She would do anything for you. My mother helped her all she could, and often I'd say to mother, "Where's my pink dress?" or green dress, or something. "Oh, I gave that to Maggie. You don't need it." "Well, Mother, you just bought that dress." "Well, yes, Julia, you give away some of the things that you like. You don't give everything away that you don't want." And we were brought up that way. My brother did the same thing. Now that's going into the teaching.
CG: That's very important.
JS: While I was still getting some education, in high school, my family had a summer place at Arundel, and I used to go down there...
A summer place where?
Arundel. A-R-U-N-D-E-L, Arundel, on the bay, Chesapeake Bay. Our cousins and the Douglasses and the Francises and the Wormleys all had places down there. My father's little place unfortunately was burned, or fortunately, but he never rebuilt. But I was visiting my cousins, and had it not been that one of them was a good swimmer, I probably would have been drowned. But that's all right. After a while, then we went to Opequon in Virginia, as I told you.
And then, we had friends, the Lovetts, who ran a hotel at Harper's Ferry. They had two daughters who graduated, and came back and helped their parents run this hotel. They catered to the diplomatic corps of Washington and some of the senators. They were at the top of a hill where you could see the Shenandoah and the Potomac River meet. And I had many, many a pleasant day there, and even after the family left Washington,in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. Riding around to Gettysburg and various places, I've seen a whole lot.
Now then comes the time, we eighty pupils, and the rest of the students in the high school—and there was no animosity, the children who were not in the two special classes were very nice; they showed no ill feeling—we all graduated, those who made the grades. Of course, some of them dropped out. But we graduated from Lafayette Theater in Washington, D. C., which was just a block and a half from the White House.﻿12
JS: (cont.) Then came the choice of what you were going to do after the high school graduation. The law was, you had to be eighteen years old before you could take the examination for the training school for teachers. I was sixteen, and at the beginning of the second half of my senior year, my father was notified that I would not be permitted to take the examination but that he'd better have me drop some subjects until... Well, that didn't appeal to my father. My father was a New Englander, and he wanted me to come North to school. But I wasn't very strong. The doctor didn't advise it. So time went on. My father said, "She's not going to drop any subjects. She has made excellent marks; she's in this class with her fellow comrades, and she's going to graduate with them. I'll decide after that what to do with my daughter, but she will graduate with her class." So he talked, met with the board, and nothing was done...still said that I couldn't take the examination. My father, a lawyer, said, "I'm going to take this to court and test it. I see no reason if a student has completed the grade with marks that my daughter has made, why she should be exempt." Only forty were allowed in this training school, the Miner Normal School.
CG: Oh, the Miner Normal School.
JS: The Miner Normal School.
CG: It was, Myrtilla Miner founded it. Yes, yes. And...
CG: It's now Federal City, isn't it? It's now Federal City College in Washington...
JS: Yes. So time went on. I didn't fret. It didn't bother me. But my father carried it to court. The week before the examination, the pupils who were to take the examination were being coached by the teachers at Dunbar, refreshing them on some of the things. Well, I wasn't. I was told, "You can't take the examination." So it didn't bother me. The night before the examination, the evening paper, in broad headlines—and in my father's mail that day—the decision the court had made, that the rule was unfair, and that a student who had completed the high school with satisfactory grades would be allowed to take the examination. All the others had been coached, and I hadn't been coached. The next morning I showed up for the examination; my classmates were all surprised to see me. And I passed the examination and was one of the forty admitted to the school in September... two-year training in Miner Normal School under Dr. Lucy E. Moten, who was the principal, a cultured, very refined lady. Why I have any nerves, I don't know.
During the two years of training, I was a subject for display by the principal, the board of education, and the superintendent of schools—white. Everybody was coming to see the child who was under age, who was permitted to enter the school. Then they found out I graduated among the first ten, from 98 to 99 percent. There was hardly a tenth's difference between the ten of us. I was called out from class—they came, a recitation was going on—"Please call on the young lady. Let us see her recite." I'm sitting in class and called out and taken downstairs to a class of children to teach, and not even prepared for the lesson. That was the experience that I went through. I was appointed to teach, the youngest teacher in the public schools, white or colored, at the time I came through, in 1904.﻿13
CG: You know, you probably won the first age discrimination case in the country?
JS: Mm hmm.
CG: And you started in 1904, teaching?
JS: In 1904. Retired, end of the school year, 1947. I retired just to come take care of my brother. Now from that time on, I taught primary school, as I have said, in different sections of Washington. I have gone from the primary, I was constantly being promoted, to the grammar. They developed group schools where the population grew, and they had a number of group schools in each section. I taught under my aunt as an assistant principal in the group school. I taught under Miss Page at Randall in Southwest. No, that's junior high school. I taught under Miss Lewis at Garnet, Miss Orme at Garrison, and Miss Thompson at the Cook School—four assistant principals in group schools. I taught in two junior high schools, English, the social subjects, and mathematics, and pinch-hit in anything where they couldn't get a substitute, except the foreign languages. I didn't like foreign languages.
I was not retirement age. They had just passed a law that one could get out without being ill. Of course, I didn't get the pension that I would have gotten, but my brother was sick—I had heard it—he didn't tell me. And I gave up and came to Massachusetts. My classroom, in the eighth grade in the grammar schools, and in the junior high schools where I taught the first-year high school students, was a laboratory for university students where they learned teaching methods and class management, record work and so forth...from the Miner Normal College and Howard University. You wonder I have any nerves? With all those temperaments?
CG: JS: CG:
JS:
You say you lived in Washington until 1947?
CG: JS:
Yes, 1947.
What was Washington society like? cultured colored people?
What was Washington like for refined,
Life in Washington, I should say, was a happy existence. There was prejudice, and we knew there was prejudice, but I think Washington had more cultured, educated people than possibly any city in the country. They came to Washington because of economic opportunities. They could train and get into the public schools, into the United States government departments, for they had a good university there, which had both colored and white on the faculty. For years they had a white president, up until the time Dr. Mordecai Johnson came, who was a power, and since then they've had colored presidents.
He was the first one, yes. I think it's Dr. Cheek who's the person now?
Yes, he's president now. Washington people had a church life that was very important to them, of various denominations—Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopal; a few Roman Catholics, which, was a mixed group. But those churches were very important because they provided an opportunity for people to know each other and for social outlet with entertainments.﻿14
JS: (cont.) Now I'll go back to my church, which was Saint Luke's Episcopal Churoh. The people were active in their churches. My father held every office in the church except the minister. He was superintendent of the Sunday schools, member of the vestry, which included both junior and senior wardens, and lay reader of the church. My aunt was secretary of the women's guild for years, and every year they would have entertainments. One strikes me very much, which I remember, they had them to raise money for the church.
In those days people were only making twenty-five, forty dollars a month, and those were the high wages, forty dollars, and a few others, a little bit more. But every year they had entertainments at different churches. And the people from one church, the friends who were Presbyterians or Baptists or Methodists would come to the Episcopal church to the entertainments, and that would go around. So you got your social life, and it was a wholesome sort of a thing. No jealousy, no meanness.
At my particular church, they had these fairs. My mother was very fine with a needle, fancy work, and she would make all sorts of fancy things, and they used to have worsted slippers that she would knit, and they always sold well. My mother was not much of a goer, she was quiet and a good homemaker, and intelligent; she read a great deal. She was a good cook, and used to make, oh, jars that long, of cookies, sugar cookies and ginger cookies, which sold beautifully. My aunt was very artistic—one of her sisters was an artist— my aunt drew very nicely. The men all helped to make up the different booths, and there was that nice, friendly rivalry of each one having a booth, each one trying to make their booth prettier than the other one, or as nice looking, with various colors. Well, this particular fair, they decided that they would... I always was among the children that helped in some way for the entertainment. They got a group of girls, twelve or more, to represent flowers in a flower garden, and the little stage was decorated as a flower garden, and we were all dressed in paper dresses, which my aunt and another lady and I had helped to make, with the hats to match, and violets and carnations and roses and dandelions; and we all had little verses to say about our flowers. That has always stood out as one of the nicest things that I can remember about the fairs. But they were always well attended. They lasted a week. Friends went from one church to another. Each one was different, but you patronized them, you know, and sold fancy articles and whatnot. There was that sort of a life. The men were active in the churches, and of course, they helped to build the booths.
Every so often there was some big convention meeting in Washington—for instance, the Grand Army (you don't hear anything about it now), but the Grand Army used to come there, and people used to travel from all over the United States; and the colored would have their entertainments, and they'd have a big ball at a hall, and that was the big social event. Then there was the inauguration every four years, and they had their inauguration parties separate from the whites. You could go to the white inaugural ball, but very few colored people went. It was expensive, and they just didn't see any particular point in going, because the policemen used to almost fight to get duty at the colored ball because they said they never saw so many beautiful, well-dressed women in their life. They looked like a garden of flowers. The women were all shades, beautiful, and beautifully dressed, and they had their ball and their entertainments. Then in between these, while these different conventions were meeting there, there were the private receptions, teas, breakfasts, for your personal friends. Now that wasn't every day. It might not be every﻿15
JS: (cont.) year, but every two years at least.
And from time to time friends would be visiting some of their family or their friends from other parts of the United States. Something was always going on, and you were invited to spend the evening with your guests at their home, and people in Washington enjoyed a very nice relationship with each other, and nobody ever, so far as I know, ever thought of who had much money or who didn't have money. You were accepted.
Now I had a friend whose father was in charge of Freedmen's Hospital at the time that we were children, Dr. Thurman Shadd. He had two children, Harriet and Thurman, his son. Harriet was a little older than I was, and her birthday was Halloween night, and every year they had a birthday party for her. There would always be about twelve, fifteen or more children at their home, and they were in very good circumstances. But everybody that I knew had a job, and nobody tried to outdo anybody. Nobody ever said, "My father's so—and—so and so-and-so," or, "My mother's so-and-so." That would never occur to you. The mother sometimes would be visiting, they'd bring some of their children in to see their friend who had children, and there was that back and forth, that made life quite worthwhile.
You lived on a street; the neighbors respected you. When my father was taken sick—outside of three or four, maybe four, residents who were friends, all the people were nice people, but were not visiting friends—but when my father was taken sick, every last person on that street rang the doorbell to want to know if they could do anything for Dr. Smith or for the family. The men wanted to know if they could sit up with him at night, and it was just that sort of a friendship that existed.
One day I was skating, and I came in the house, and I had a nickel. "I have five cents, a nickel." She said, "What?" I said, "I have five cents, a nickel." "Where did you get it, Julia?" "Mrs. Magruder asked me to go to the store." "All right, you go right straight back to Mrs. Magruder, and you give her back that nickel, and you tell Mrs. Magruder your mother says, anytime that she wants you to go to the store, that you are to go to the store for her, but please not to give you any money."
CG: Your mother did that.
So, it was that sort of relationship that existed. When I was in the grammar school, they had a sewing teacher that came in once a week to teach the girls— the boys had a little bit of carpentry at the same time—I wouldn't wear a thimble, but I'd push the needles through with my fingers. So at Christmastime, my sewing teacher lived four houses below me—her sister was principal of the schools—and she gave me this little package for Christmas with a thimble. So I learned to use the thimble. Now I can't sew without a thimble!
The teachers were nice, and they were interested. They wanted you to learn, and we learned. We went to school to learn. We didn't go to school to get a piece of paper and know nothing.
Now, later in life I had a struggle with health. I was last, always last— Brother would get all the children's diseases, I didn't get them until everybody else had them. And when I was in training school, I was out of school off and on for three months with neuralgia, and they'd send me home because I was in﻿16
JS: (cont.) agony. I would go by the doctor's. "What? You back here again?
I've given you enough stuff to knock a horse out." My father was a dentist, not my teeth, but I had this neuralgia, and of course, I'd go because I didn't want to lose out in my work. But as I said, I came through, and I wanted to graduate. My father wanted me to go North to college, but the doctor said the weather was too much for me, and Howard was up on the hill. It was too much of a strain. And at that time you didn't dare give up your job because you might not get it again.
Later on I went to Howard and completed my course at Howard; after I studied at Ypsilanti, Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Boston University and Harvard and Columbia. I'm not interested in paper, I'm interested in learning, and the only subject I got just a passing mark was in drawing. I'm no artist, I didn't pick that. But I love music, and I took a course under Damrosch in New York. He used to come to Washington at certain periods during the year, so I took a course under him for appreciation of music. I'm very fond of music. So I feel I've had quite a rounded education and I've had enough points to have passed a master's degree, but I'm not interested. Paper didn't mean anything to me then because I had achieved what I wanted to achieve scholastically. I didn't want to go any farther in the school system. I was satisfied to help children.
Out of the experience I had in travel—for I' ve traveled all down from Washington through the Shenandoah Valley, different seasons of the year, spring, fall; into the caverns—Endless Cavern, Luray Caverns, the Natural Bridge, and they're beyond description, just beyond description. When you think of how nature has produced that... And these are things that I used to give to my children that other teachers didn't have the experience. Yes, some of them had their master's degree, but I could have had it, but I just didn't want another piece of paper. I don't even know where my diploma is... guess I lost it. It don't mean anything to me. And the mountains, the rivers, the valleys all meant so much to me. When I could see these different things in the caverns...I have no words to describe the beauty and the wonder of nature. I'm a nature lover, and I've been all down the Atlantic Coast, I've been to Jamestown, I've been to Monticello, Jefferson's home, and Mount Vernon and Newport News...
Well, Williamsburg is an old city.
Yes, that's an old city.
CG: It's an old town, pre-Revolutionary 'War town. Now, you wanted to go back and remind me of something?
JS: In my childhood days, while in Washington, at the top of the house, we had a playroom, and ever so often the children in the neighborhood were allowed to come in on a Saturday morning for two hours and play in the playroom. When the weather was warm and we would be skating and play in the street, in the afternoons we'd sit on the porch and play games, like Lotto and Parcheesi and Authors, which were very helpful because we learned the names of all of the fine writers of the country—Tennyson and Longfellow and Dickens and Lowell and all the rest of them. At times, my father had a magic lantern. In those days there were no moving pictures. And as I have grown older, I sort of fancy it was his magic lantern that made him become interested in the art of﻿17
JS: (cont.) can. All during my life I used to say, "Somebody else isn't going to do it. I'm going to do it." All during my study period, somebody else felt, "This is difficult." Well, if somebody else did it, I can do it, too. And that's the thing that has carried me on. We were made to know that the other fellow had just as much rights as you had. And in the schools, the janitors always used to say to me, "Any time, Miss Smith, you need anything, don't hesitate to call on me. You're different from any of the teachers." I said, "No, we're all teachers." He said, "Oh yes, but you're different. You're a lady." That's what they'd tell me.
One year I was coming home and a snowstorm developed. I asked, as there was half session that day, I asked him if he would look out for a cab so that I could get to the train. No cabs were in the neighborhood. The storm was getting worse and no public transportation nearer than four and a half or seven blocks, which meant transfer, waiting, and a suitcase to carry. The janitor had a car and offered to take me to the station. I was surprised, tor it solved my problem. Teachers had cars but none were going in that direction of Union Station. I gladly accepted his kind offer, arrived in time to board my car for my trip to spend the Christmas vacation with my beloved brother. He was at the station to meet me, as he always met me and saw me off.
Incidents like these have been throughout my life. God has been my Companion and Comforter for most of my adult life. Since 1919 I've been away from my loving family, spending what holidays I could with them. Friends and relatives have been kind to me, and when I did not go home, I was always with some of them.
Now during my lifetime, I've been in and out of Boston all my life. I find Boston a very different place from what it was years ago. But I've had the good fortune of meeting most all the people who are in history. Now, you know who I mean?
CG: Yes. Just a minute. Now, just to reorient myself, you came to Boston in 1947?
JS: Yes. I haven't said anything about my parents. Should I?
CG: Yes.
JS: i think it's about time I ought to say something about them. My father, Hamilton S. Smith, was the only son, with five sisters in the family, and he attended the public schools of Boston, and graduated from Boston Latin School, first colored to graduate from Boston University, studied law, and got his practice in Judge Gaston's office. If I remember correctly, Judge Gaston was one of the governors. Phillips Brooks was his friend, spoke very favorably of him. He didn't like law as a profession, but he felt that it was necessary, and it did pay quite a part in his work as a special examiner in the United States Bureau of Pensions, when he was sent out various times on cases. I mentioned the fact that he'd been to Indiana.
He was a kind, loving father, a devoted husband, and gave his wife and children every comfort he could afford. He enjoyed fishing. I don't know﻿18
JS: (cont.) how many meals we enjoyed from his catch, but photography later became one of his hobbies, and everywhere he went, he took his camera with him, and he made pictures of all sizes. A lover of nature and history, and he probably is the first black in the art of photography. He was active in the community, was a Mason, and enjoyed all of the honors of the Masonic Order that the Masons offered. He was master, grand master, knight templar, and chairman of the foreign correspondence committee, where he had contacts with every person in the order in the world. He was a very kind man, and lived up to the principles of the Masonic Order.
After he left Washington, and after his death, people would meet me, whom I did not know and say, "Excuse me, aren't you Dr. Smith's daughter?" I said, yes. "Well, you know, I was sorry to hear of his passing. Dr. Smith was such a kind man. You know, when my husband died," or my daughter, or whoever it happened to be, or some catastrophe had happened, "Dr. Smith was always there to help. After he left Washington, we missed him." So he was highly respected by the people. For his livelihood he practiced dentistry, and was assistant professor for a while, volunteer, in the dental school at Howard University.
My mother was Julia Luke Brooks, and one of four daughters of John and Agnes Gratefield Brooks. She was born in Baltimore, and educated in a Catholic school and private schools, because colored could not attend the public schools in Baltimore at that time. She and her sister Mary Elizabeth were among the first colored teachers in the public schools of Washington, D. C. She was a fine, devoted wife, an excellent mother, and always put home first; positive, kind to her children, excellent cook, and had many, many friends.
CG: Did she teach while she was married?
JS: No, before she was married. They didn't allow women to teach after they were married.
CG: Oh, that's right.
JS: She married April 19, 1884, and died in 1936. My brother, John J. Smith, was educated in the public schools of Washington, D. C., same schools I attended. As a little boy, he was cute, and liked by his boy friends and classmates. He played baseball and football, was the youngest and smallest member of the high school cadets, and won a trophy. Every year some company of the cadets won a trophy. It was one of Washington's annual affairs that included all classes of people, from all four sections of Washington City, held in the baseball park. He was not interested in living away from home, for his devotion to his parents was extremely great and when he was a baby boy of two or three years old—he loved his home while I was away with my father's people in New England in the summer.
He decided to go to Howard rather than go away to medical school. So he graduated from Howard, the youngest doctor ever to graduate, and became one of the interns at the new Freedmen's Hospital, for one year. He passed two state boards, including Virginia, District of Columbia, Maryland, and New England, which gave him the privilege of practicing in forty-four of the then forty-eight states. He was written up by the Carnegie Foundation, and he﻿19
JS: (cont.) was admitted to practice medicine by means of an examination, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the youngest ever licensed in this country. He studied at Harvard Medical School, and became a member of the Massachusetts, New England, and American Medical Associations. Dr. Cabot wanted him to become a member of the Massachusetts General Hospital staff, and recommended him, but Dr. Cabot, embarrassed, had to come to his office and tell him because of his racial identity, not his ability—he was needed there as he was exceptional in diagnosis—they would not accept him.
He made application in World War I, because he had been listed as a private, so he appealed to...for the Medical Corps, as he was of draft age. The application returned, checked in red ink. "Age, nationality, education, and experience—impossible for a Negro," written in red ink across his application. He went to Washington and with his father, who was a licensed lawyer, to see the secretary of war about this matter and was given the runaround; but my father was a determined man and finally saw the secretary and threatened a court case if his son was not listed for medical service, where he was qualified and needed. Result: commissioned lieutenant, but never called to service.
He practiced medicine in Cambridge over thirty-five years, when his health failed. He served at the Resthaven, where he gave his services fifteen years as physician, subject to call all hours. Now, you want something about my grandfather? [break]
CG: You were saying that your brother was involved with Resthaven during the depression?
JS: Now, my brother gave his services at Resthaven as a volunteer doctor to
look after the aged at the time when ration stamps were issued, and it was difficult sometimes for him to even have enough stamps to get from Cambridge to Roxbury. Fifteen years of service he gave, and the matron who was there at that time, a Mrs. Mary Dandridge, was very grateful. She was a friend of the family's, and she was a friend of the donor, Attorney Edgar Benjamin, who had given Resthaven to the community; she was very appreciative. She left, and when my brother's health failed, he had to, of course, give up going to Resthaven, and at his death they made absolutely no recognition, the new matron, of his services that he rendered; I never heard from them.
His hobby was reading. He was an inveterate reader. He was a student, brilliant, and he read all of the Boston Transcript, which now has long since been out of issue, and all the medical journals, and The Nation, and the big magazines, and he played a friendly game of cards with three other friends. The two Houston brothers: David Houston, classmate of Teddy Roosevelt, graduated from Harvard, was up visiting in the summer, and John Cromwell from Washington, D. C., who was a graduate of Dartmouth. His daughter is Adelaide Hill Gulliver, who now has charge of the Afro-American Department of Boston University.
CG: She's also professor of sociology there.
JS: They, four of them, used to play cards. Dave Houston and Joe Houston, and
John Cromwell and my brother in the summertime. Just a friendly game of cards.﻿20

(cont.) He didn't gamble, arid he didn't run with women. His morals were high. For exercise he played tennis, and he took part in several tournaments, and got a couple of loving cups which I always treasured.
Was that unusual for blacks to participate in tennis tournaments in those days? Yes.
Where were the places that he played at?
He played right out here at Jarvis Field, connected with Harvard, and he went to Trenton one time. Now where else did he go? Of course, when he went to Trenton, I had to call my cousin in Brooklyn to contact him because our loving devoted aunt became ill and was dying-
Tennis is such an important sport now, and there's so much controversy about...
He was a good tennis player, and he enjoyed the sport, played until he injured his elbow, and then that sort of took away from him the only outlet that he had, because he was not a society man. He loved his profession, and he was quite disturbed when patients were ill. As I've said, I've seen him play. I know they had something out here at Jarvis Field one time—that's connected with Harvard. He always went and enjoyed the tennis tournaments in Brookline.
Now you say your brother was not a society man?
No.
Tell us what a society person is?
Well, a society person is a person who belongs to fraternities and dances and clubs, where they meet their social friends, and... Sometimes in the summer up here they used to have some camp which some of them would go to. Davis, the undertaker, was one that went to the camp. I don't say he was a society man, but my brother wasn't that kind. My brother was interested, as members of the family have always been, in helping human beings, in health. Unfortunately he lost his health, and he died in his sixties. But his profession he kept up, and he took all the medical journals, belonged to all the medical societies, the names of which I have forgotten. I know it's American Medical Society and New England Medical Society. The doctors paid him quite a compliment when he died, saying that he was such a gentleman. Highly educated, knew his medicine.
My mother was taken sick, and then my brother diagnosed her case, and he called the doctor, a specialist—she had pneumonia. I was home that time, and the specialist came and examined my mother. As he left the room, the doctor called me out, and he said, "Miss Smith, I want to tell you that your brother made a better diagnosis of your mother's case than I could make. Have no fear. I will come back if you need me, but I put your mother in your brother's hands. He is an excellent doctor, and he has diagnosed the case better than I could."
Wonderful.
I came home sick one day, one year at Easter, and I had been told that I had﻿21
JS: (cont.) no ulcer. The day after I got home, I was taken sick, and my brother took me to Massachusetts General Hospital, and I got X-rayed, and they found out he had diagnosed the case. "You haven't got this," is what they said. And he wasn't satisfied, so they took me and developed it. I had a duodenal ulcer, which the doctors had not discovered in Washington. Of course, he kept me there, and I had to send to Washington and get released from school. I returned with the prescription he gave me, and I was on a diet for two years. When my brother died some twenty years afterwards, the doctor asked me about the ulcer—Dr. Murill, a new doctor—because I hadn't had to have a doctor, he said, "Well, whoever was your doctor when you had duodenal ulcer knew what he was doing, because there's no trace of a duodenal ulcer." And he said, "We physicians have always said that we never will say a duodenal ulcer is cured." I've had no effects from that since.
CG: He was a very talented and gifted doctor.
JS: He was. He devoted his time to medicine. He was very modest, he didn't do
any bragging, except as a profession he hated to be called doctor. He wanted his friends to call him by his first name. Of course, his patients always called him doctor. When he first started to practice, some elderly lady called him in. "Why, you're nothing but a boy." [laughter] He had tried to put on a suit that would make him look older, and he said, "Well, I'm a graduated doctor, and they sent for me, and I'll try to do the best I can for you." She fell in love with him because he was so kind and nice. And to this day, I'll go out in the street and people sometimes don't know me, and they'll say, "Pardon me, are you Miss Smith?" I'll say yes. "Are you any relation to Dr. John Smith?" I'll say, "Yes, he happened to be my brother." "Oh, he was our physician, and we haven't had a doctor like him since." I get that now, and he's been dead since '54.
He was, as a brother, loving and kind, considerate. He treated his sister as he would treat any other lady. In and out of the car, he'd open the door and help me in, and come and open the door and let me out. He couldn't do any different because it was a part of him. After Mother died, and my work was in Washington, D. C., my holidays I was taken ill, and I was out of school. I didn't come to him because he had his problems. But I took a trip to Bermuda, where I spent two weeks or so in Bermuda. It was a boat trip, which I enjoyed which helped me. I was only in school two weeks in the fall, two weeks in the end of the school term, to end up the school year.
He was as kind and nice to me as he possibly could be. We never interfered with each other's affairs. Neither one of us ever left home that we didn't tell where we were going. If he was going out on his business, he said, "Sister, I'm going out. I'll be out about two hours." If he was delayed, or whatever time he would be home, if he was delayed, he'd go to the telephone and say, "I'll be a little late." If he was called out at night, he would say, as we always slept with our doors open or ajar, "Sister, are you asleep?" I'd hear the telephone ring, and I'd wake right up. I'd say no. He'd say, "I'm called out. I'll get back just as soon as I can get back." And when he came back, "I'm back home," for always I heard him come in, as I didn't sleep. When I went out, I told him where I was going. We did the same thing with our mother while she lived there, after Father died. My father never went out that he didn't tell his wife where he was going, so that if anything﻿22
JS: (cont.) happened, we could locate him. So that's the kind of life that our family enjoyed. We all had bicycles. Did I tell you that?
CG: No, you didn't tell me about your bicycle.
JS: Well, this is sort of a rambling talk. [laughter] We all had our bicycles, and used to ride. We were all different shades. My mother and brother were fair, and my father and I were yellow brown, I guess you'd call it. I don't know what you'd call us. My father had black hair, and a long nose which was part of his Indian ancestry, so they say, from Alexander Hamilton and Pocahontas. That I have never gone into, and I don't mention because it doesn't mean anything to me. But he had this long nose that his father had, which they always say, and high cheek bones, was from the Indians. We went bicycle riding, and we went into Georgetown, which was where many of the rich whites lived—not all of them, because many of them lived in the area where I lived. We lived right off of 16th Street near what they call the boundary, which was the end of Washington City when I was a little girl. Now of course it has extended out to the line of Maryland, where the government hospitals are, the embassies. But the embassies were on 16th Street when I was a child.
CG: Was this near Rock Creek Park?
JS: Oh yes. We used to go to Rock Creek Park. My father's taken many pictures
of Rock Creek Park, and I enjoyed Rock Creek Park, and the zoological gardens were there. On Sunday mornings, my father would take us, weather permitting, if we were home, for a walk before breakfast; we'd walk out to the zoo. Of course, Brother was always interested in the animals. There wasn't much that we missed in the way of public interest. Buildings, and the zoological park, and the city at large. And when we were all riding, and my aunt lived with us, rode, too. In Georgetown one day, one white boy called out, "Oh, come quick. Look. Chocolate and vanilla ice cream on bicycles."
CG: oh no.
JS: Which we thought was funny. But I think we were about the only family that everybody in the family had bicycles. And my brother...
CG: You went together, too, which was...
JS: Yes. And we went out and enjoyed the fresh air, and rode down to the Potomac
River. We'd sit by the bank and watch the boats come in. We had a happy life. As children we would lend our bicycles to the children in the neighborhood who didn't have them. They rode around blocks or two at a time. We all had skates and sleds, and my father used to pull the sled, and as he used to fasten the sleds of other children, and many a time he'd take us up to the end of what we'd call the boundary, where there was a slight hill, and he'd pull the sled with us children on it. The people always called him Dr. Smith. "Dr. Smith, are you going to take us out on the sleds?"
So we had a very happy, very happy and a very unpretentious home. We had comforts, and we were among the first people that ever had a furnace. We had coal stoves and latrobes—a latrobe was an open stove on the order of a grate, as best I can describe it—and you got the heat in one room, and not too much elsewhere, and you had a big iron stove in the kitchen, and you﻿23
JS: (cont.) had these latrobes in the two sitting rooms, so little heat went
upstairs. But shortly after my father bought the house, he says, "Unh-unh. I've got to find better heat than this." And so we were about among the first to have a furnace put in. A coal furnace that solved the heating problem for us.
CG: How big was the house? Can you describe the house?
JS: Yes. The house was a brick house in a row, and it had nine rooms. My father put on a summer kitchen, which made nine rooms, and the cellar that was the length of the three rooms, and a yard. And we had the most beautiful roses in the yard, and they were all along the back fence. Of course, Washington has alleys, and nothing's out on the street like they are here. All the trash goes out the back door, and it's a very clean looking city when you ride around. But what disturbs me here is, every day is trash day, and these plastic bags packed up, it just makes the city look terrible. I think it's worse than jwhen they had the cans. I won't go into that.
But my brother didn't care much about riding, he didn't care for automobiles. He only used them because he had to in his business. He was a splendid driver. Whatever he did, he was like his father—it was done perfectly and as good as he could do it. Nothing was slipshod, except his desk in his office [laughter] which was full of everything. And I said to him one day, "I don't see how you find anything." He says, "There's just one thing I want to say to you, please do me a favor, don't ever touch anything on this desk." Other than that, you'd go in his bedroom, and everything in his bureau drawers and chiffonier were as precise as they could be. When he was taken sick, I opened up his drawer. He didn't meddle in my bedroom, and I didn't meddle with his. He never touched my mail, and I didn't touch his. If there was some mail he got, and he wanted me to read something, he'd hand it to me. Same thing with me. We lived our lives, we loved each other, and we lived happily together.
Somebody said to him, "Well, your sister won't like it in Massachusetts." He says, "You don't know my sister." He says, "My sister didn't come into Massachusetts to love Massachusetts, my sister came... I didn't know she was coming, because if she'd asked me I'd have told her no, because I know it's not the kind of life she's used to. But," he says, "my sister came because she loved me, and we're more important to each other than any place, and the home is here. And," he says, "I tried... She knows I saved the home so she could have a place to live in." And I lived in that home twenty years after he died, but I was driven out by these awful criminals around here and crime, which has altered my life. But that's getting to the end of the story.
CG: Let me ask you, because when you described the house and you described your childhood, you brought back another question I wanted to ask you. Two weeks ago, when we talked, you mentioned that on Sundays when you went to church, the men wore morning coats.
JS: Grey trousers and Prince Albert coats on special occasions. They dressed like all cultured, educated gentlemen did. Any Sunday you could see men from Saint Luke's Church dressed just like the men one block away in the Dutch Reformed Church when Theodore Roosevelt attended, dressed in the same style.
CG: Yes. And because you had mentioned that, you promised to tell me about the﻿24
CG: (cont.) dress, the clothing, and the lifestyle, the social lifestyle of Washington.
JS: What?
CG: The social lifestyle of Washington. About the parties and the assemblies?
JS: Yes. Yes, they had parties and assemblies.
CG: What were the assemblies, now?
JS: The assemblies? Just were given a name. They were, I don't remember, maybe twelve or twenty couples, and some single people. Maybe fifty or thirty. I don't remember the number, but they were friends. Four times a year they got together, with no fancy dress, just with nice, every day clothes. Oh, people dressed well, and they always looked nice, but no party dresses as such. One of the meetings was an outside meeting, a big party, where the ladies wore evening clothes and invited their friends. And I'm telling you, they were beautiful. The women were beautiful. Of course, I was a child, but the women in Washington at that time all dressed nicely, they were ladylike, and they were refined, they were educated.
When I see the way the women are dressing now, I'm sometimes ashamed of my sex. When I see them in the street, and they can't respect the body that has a soul and the spirit of Christ in them, this flesh and blood is nothing. It's clay. It goes back to clay. Yet this is the temple of your soul. ■ You don't respect it. You pay a whole lot of money to buy costly furniture to put it in a house, and yet you can't cover the body that has the soul of Christ? That's the only thing that counts in life is the spirit that's within you. This is your temple. When you go into temples, temples are the places where you worship God. Well, you're carrying the spirit of Christ with you. You don't respect Him enough to be decent in the street? I can't understand it. I'm an Episcopalian. I respect everybody's religion. Now I'll go off on another channel, and you have to cut your tapes.
When I was in Japan and I went into their temples, they would have people in there worshipping Buddha. I've never seen such ardent worship. Tourists in and out of those temples, trains and buses coming all the time. We went several places on the train to some of these temples, and those people worshipping Buddha were there to say their prayers, and pay their respect for Buddha. They didn't know whether there was one tourist or thousands, they never moved a muscle. They sat, lay, knelt, and prayed to their Buddha. The same thing was true when I was in Egypt, especially, I noticed. Throughout the area where Mohammed—and also in India where they worship Buddha—and they worship Mohammed in Egypt, and those bells toll certain hours of the day, and those Mohammedans, Egyptians, or whatever nationality they were, because there were all kinds of nationalities there, when the bell tolled, they're walking down the street, they stopped and knelt on the sidewalk. If they were crossing the street with the traffic, wherever they were they stopped and the traffic stopped. They knelt in the middle of the street, in the crossing—they didn't run back to the curbstone—and said their prayers. Not a car or a bus or anything moved while they were kneeling praying. They paid no attention to anybody. You went into the mosques in Egypt, which were gorgeous. The most handsome Persian rugs—real Persian, now you're not getting them—and they go in there, and they'll be in there﻿25
JS: (cont.) praying, kneeling on the floor, no benches, many of them students, studying and prayers, and they never moved a muscle.
I said to myself, "We Americans are the most conceited set of people in the world. We call ourselves Christians, and I've been in many denominations— I'm not narrow, I try not to be. You go in a Catholic church, an Episcopal church, a Baptist church, a Methodist church, a Congregational church, let somebody cough, they turn around to see who's coughing. Let somebody come in, and they are turning around to see who's coming in. A board cracks, they're turning around." I said, "Those people, if Buddha is their god, or Mohammed is their god, or whoever is their god, they believe in him; they have that faith." I was astounded. I went in Episcopal churches on my travels when I could get to church, and I went in Westminster Abbey and had communion in Westminster Abbey. Of course, that's so big, I didn't notice that. But in most places, especially in America, you can't go and enjoy a service hardly. If somebody drops a book or something, they turn around to see. Well, if their mind is on God, they would not even hear the book.
CG: Right.
JS: So those are some of the things that in my older years have made an impression on me, and if I have been guilty—probably have—I'm trying to rectify it now when I'm able to get to church. Because I've tried to be a Christian—how good a one I am, that's for God to decide. I know I'm no good, I'm weak and human like all other people, but I know God reigns, and I know He's been good to me, and He's pulled me from the valley of the shadow of death, but I'll get to that at the end of the story. Now, any more questions?
CG: Yes. You started to tell me about... You mentioned that people dressed well, and when they went to church, but even every day. What would be a typical way of dressing for every day when you lived in Washington?
JS: Well, of course, the people were poor, and sometimes you'd see people with patched clothes, and we had„ my mother had help. There's a woman—I never did know her last name—her name was Maggie, and Maggie worked for us. She used to come and do the laundry vork. In those days you had a tub and washboard, no washing machines. She did the washing, and come back the next day and she'd do the laundry work—the ironing—and she'd come back on Friday, and do the housework. And Maggie was s-ery neat, and always clean, and my mother always supplied her with my clothes, some new and some that I had worn. And unless Maggie would ask for something that was worn, Mother wouldn't offer it to her. She'd give it to somebody else, maybe, but not to Maggie. Maggie was kind; even though she was poor, she had the highest respect. I was nothing bat. a child, ten or twelve years old, and then the children wore kilted dresses and...
CG: Kilted dresses?
JS: Kilted.
CG: Pleated?
JS: Pleated, yes. Maggie was ironing this dress and Mother said to her, "Now Maggie, don't put so much time on that dress." She said, "Oh Mrs. Smith,﻿26
JS: (cont.) no indeedy. This is for Miss Julie." Now I'm only ten years old. "This is for Miss Julie, and Miss Julie's nice, and this has got to look right." She said, "Never mind about the dress being for Julie. She's going to put it on and the few times that she sits in it, it'll be wrinkled. Now you get through that. I'll give you your lunch, and then I'll want you to help me do so-and-so." So we never looked down on people, and my mother would sit at the table and eat her lunch with Maggie. Maggie was a human being. She had the same soul, heart, and lungs in her body that we had in ours. And we were taught to respect her. She loved my brother and myself. We were always being taught to respect people regardless of their station in life, their color or their occupation. And it's just as natural for me to say, "Thank you," or "Excuse me," as it is for me to go open the door, and step aside to let a person pass. It just comes. But today I notice, people pass in front of you, they don't say, "Excuse me," they don't say, "Thank you"; they're not appreciative of anything. There's hardly anyone much concerned by even common decency and respect for his fellow man.
CG: I was in the subway, and I found myself the only one who was saying excuse me, and I thought, "Very strange."
JS: Yes. Well now, any more questions?
CG: Oh yes. Oh yes.
JS: I want you to ask them, because I'll go off on these tangents. It all comes back to me because I had a happy life, and now I don't see anybody much. And I won't say that, because people are kind to me.
CG: Theodore Roosevelt. You wanted to talk about Theodore Roosevelt's riding.
JS: Yes. When we were children, there were boys and girls, all lived in the neighborhood with a radius of four blocks, and most of the girls had long hair. It was worn in plaits and had a ribbon tied on. And we used to skate up and down 16th Street. Theodore Roosevelt was president of the United States; he hated Secret Service men, so he would be two blocks ahead of them, on his horse. We'd skate up and down, as we never knew what day he was horseback riding, because it all would depend upon what he was doing. Of course, then the president didn't run out of the White House every minute like they do now. And they didn't have the big office, of course, at the White House. He would horseback ride. He was a stout, tall man, not too big. Well proportioned. We children were skating up and down 16th Street, boys and girls, and when he'd come along, we'd see him coming; we'd skate down to meet him, which would be about two or three blocks when we'd see him coming. It was about a mile from where I lived, the White House was. I could go right from the corner of my street—as we lived in the middle of the block—and we'd be skating, as I said, we'd skate three or four blocks down when we'd see when he was coming along... Unconsciously. We didn't plan it. Started it one day, and then we kept it up. "How d'you do, Mr. Roosevelt?" "How you doing, President Roosevelt?" "How do ya do, Teddy Roosevelt?" "Howdy do." "Hello, Mr. Roosevelt, the Rough Rider." Everybody in their little whiny, childish voice, which he apparently enjoyed. And from time to time— not too often—he would reach out if we were near enough, to try to catch hold of one of our braids. I think one time he was successful, but usually﻿27
JS: (cont.) we stayed enough away from the horse to avoid, but once he caught hold of one of the girl's braids. Occasionally he'd have a paper bag all tied up, and he would throw out peanuts, and of course we'd all skate to try to catch the bag, or what we'd call kisses, candy kisses, which were taffy in wrappers. Sometimes just plain taffy. He enjoyed it, and we got a big kick out of it, as we too enjoyed it.
That was a pleasant experience. We weren't doing anybody any harm. We were children, but we... We weren't bad children. I mean the boys. If they were playing ball, they didn't have any playrooms, playgrounds then, and they had to play in the street. And if they broke a window, my brother would come home and tell his father, "We were playing ball today and we broke a window on 16th Street, near 16th and S"—that was just around the corner from us. "All right, Son, you come with me and we'll go around there and I'll see the people, and I'll tell them that I'll pay for the window. But if you ever tell me a story, then I'm going to punish you. You tell me the truth, and I won't punish you."
CG: Now, you were going to tell me about your Aunt Florence?
JS: My aunt. Well, this goes along with my childhood days. My Aunt Florence lived with us as she was my father's sister, was principal of a school. I'll talk about her later, but every Saturday, when the weather permitted, she would take me out in the afternoon, and it either would be visiting a public building, the Treasury or the Bureau of Engraving where they made the money and the stamps, or to the Capitol, or to the public library, or Supreme Court, or the museum, Smithsonian Museum and the national museum. At one time she had a friend, Mr. Sinclair, who was in the Cleveland administration, and we got an opportunity to go all through the White House when President Cleveland was there, with this friend who was one of the aides, I guess you might call him. Mr. Sinclair was from Albany, New York, under Grover Cleveland as president. I've been to the White House as a grown—a young woman—to White House receptions which they have open to the public. And my aunt used to take me to matinees, and I'd see some of the best plays.
She was the one that took me to Boston, the trips when I was a little girl. She was very dear to me, and she and mother, although not blood related, were sisters. My father's sisters and my mother's sisters were all just like one. They knew no difference. I have some very happy memories. My father taking us to the parks, and when I'd be up and Brother had left and come to Massachusetts, and Father was still interested in his photography, for a few more years, I used to go around with him. He was interested more in nature than he was in taking portraits of people. The family was sort of accidental, we were sort of the guinea pigs for him to try out some new project that he thought about. That's the reason we get all these pictures of the family.
CG- Let me ask you about the White House receptions. Do you remember, do any of them stand out in your mind?
Js: Well, I guess I was too young really to appreciate it too much, but there were many, many rooms in the White House, and they had... If I remember correctly, the receptions were in the East Room. Of course, they've renovated the White House, and I don't know what it looks like now. But you stood in line, and for a while, at that time the president and his wife were there, and you﻿28
JS: (cont.) greeted them. But the only reason we got there was because of our
friend—my family's friend, Mr. Sinclair. He and his wife lived right around the corner from us on 16th Street, and of course we got an invitation to get to this reception. They had them for, well, there weren't too many diplomats then, but for the members of the cabinet and the Congress, and a few who might be from foreign countries. Now, how far had I gotten... Did I finish my life? I'm putting my life in it everywhere, so it don't matter.
Rocky Nook was interesting. It was about forty miles from Boston. At the time we went there it wasn't too developed, and we were the only people of color down there, but nobody paid any attention to us. There was a little corner store operated by a typical Maine Yankee—very nice. You had kerosene lamps, and had to go over there to get some kerosene so you could have some light, and the house was built by a carpenter, so it was well built. It had five rooms, three down and two up. Downstairs there was, I guess you'd call it a living room, but I always called the place a camp. We had a dining room with a table, a round table and six chairs and a little sofa by the window, one window and a door, that opened on to a porch around the side and the front, all the way around. It had two hammocks on the porch, and then the kitchen was off the dining room. There were three doors: one from the dining room to the porch, one from the front room—I'd rather call it front room than living room, because it wasn't—and one from the kitchen to the back porch, and then we had a toilet off of the kitchen porch with running water which many of the people did not have. There was a pump at the sink when we first moved there, but having lived in the city, we weren't too adjusted to pumping water, so we got hold of a plumber, my people did, and we got it changed and we had a faucet put in—just one faucet. We cooked by oil stove; we had an old stove there.
Nobody had ever lived in the camp but the builder himself—the house, I'll say, because it really was a house—he was only there one year, and we bought the house with it furnished, so-called, but we never changed the beds. We changed the mattresses, but we left the iron beds there, and I painted them later on. The front room had a bureau and wash stand, and had a little closet, not quite as large as that hallway there, that's just a rack where you'd hang your clothes, and I put a curtain up. In the back room were the two double beds, and we got mattresses for them, that's the only thing. They had dishes and an old iron stove; I guess they burned wood, pieces of wood. But that didn't prove too satisfactory long, so from Sears and Roebuck we got an oil range, and oh, was it nice, a little different.
I was different from my brother. My brother, I guess, was what you'd call the aristocrat. He didn't like the camp, and one of his patients told him some years ago, "Dr. Smith, you are all right, but," he says, "you're living with champagne ideas off of a lager beer pocketbook," which I thought proved, or explained it very nicely. I can adjust. I like beauty and comfort, but I enjoyed the freedom. I used to walk all around, everybody knew me. I liked flowers, and at one time I had window boxes—as I grew older, window boxes gave out. And my energy wasn't getting any better—it was giving out, from all the many things I had to do. But I would walk around, so I loved the wild flowers. People turn up their nose and don't think wild flowers are beautiful. Queen Anne's lace is one of the prettiest flowers in the world, and I used to set them on two little steps, and they were wide steps. The porch was all screened in, and these two hammocks on the porch and flowers on the table on﻿29
JS: (cont.) the porch made it attractive and comfortable.
The neighbors were very lovely to me, very lovely to the family, and we hadn't been there... I think it was the first visit or second visit, my brother came down, and he had his medical bag with him—I knew it hadn't been long, they found out he was doctor—somebody hurt themselves down at the beach and somebody came up and tapped on the screen door. "Excuse me, but they tell me there's a doctor here. Somebody's hurt themselves down at the beach and they wondered if the doctor could come down." So my brother picks up his bag and runs on down to the beach and did what was necessary.
And when he gets ready to go home—of course, he came in and didn't put his bag where he had had it, or didn't take it back up to his room—he walks off and leaves his bag. Sunday night, because he had to be back on Monday... They did have a telephone in this little two-by-four store,
go over to the telephone, and I try to get him; I couldn't get the line. I said to this—oh, he was a good old Yankee, he was from Maine, interesting old fellow—I said, "I'm upset." I said, "My brother's left his medical bag down here, and he has some appointments first thing in the morning. I'll come back and see if I can get him a little later." Before I could get back to the store there was a rap on the door, and this man was there. "I'm Mr. So-and-so. I live right up there on this street here. I understand that somebody left a medical bag down here, with your family. Where do you live?" I said, "We live in Cambridge, right off of..."—I gave the address, off of Massachusetts Avenue. He says, "I live in Lexington, and I go right straight through Cambridge to get to Lexington. I'm leaving five o clock tomorrow morning. If you will permit me, I will be very happy to take this medical bag up to your home."
I finally got my brother, and I said, "John, you left your medical bag here. Mr. Wheaton, a neighbor up the street, he has offered to bring your bag, and he's leaving at five o'clock in the morning, and he'll be by your house about six." "Oh," he says, "Sister, I'm so glad, because I didn't know what I was going to do, because I just couldn't come right down to get it." That showed the friendship. And never one word said about color.
But some newcomers came down there one day, and I was out walking alone—my mother had died—and across from me, right across the road...
CG: Now about what year was this?
JS: My mother had died in '36, and I Stayed there until '71. Brother came off and on, he died in '55, and he come down once or twice in the summer maybe to stay overnight, but he liked his nice comforts. Sister liked to roam around. So I was walking around. In the meanwhile, they developed a tennis court there, and a place, a hall where the children could play. As I was walking around, and this neighbor heard this woman say, "Humph, who's she?" as I passed by this building. This man had been wealthy—they had a lovely place, two houses, one for their guests, and one for themselves which they had built. He turned around; he says, "Who are you talking about?" "That woman going up the street." I was told this by a friend. He said, "Let me tell you something. She's got more brains than all you people down here. She's one of the finest women." He hadn't known me too long either. "She's one of the﻿30
JS: (cont.) finest people that I've ever known. She's a graduate of college
and a teacher, and don't you ever let me hear you say anything about her." And he turned around. That's the only time anything was ever said.
People are lovely to me. One of my neighbors saw that article that was in the Chronicle. She lives in Brockton. Known her forty years. And some friend here in Cambridge had sent—she had a place down there, she lives right down here on Appleton Street—she sent it down there to one of the neighbors. Now some of them live down there. My friend who lives in Brockton—and they had two houses down there—she said, "Don't I miss you, Julia? I saw this article, I'm calling to tell you, Julia, it's wonderful. Could you get me a copy?" So I sent her a copy, and she wanted it because some friend had gotten me some Xerox copies for me. So I've had very pleasant experiences.
I used to walk all around, and people would say, "I knew you were here, Miss Smith. I saw you with your flowers in your hand." I'd say, "You don't say weeds." They'd say, "No, because you didn't like the word weeds, because you always call them flowers." I said, "They are flowers. They are just as beautiful as though they are carnations or roses. All have their places. I just love them."
So, I used to go in bathing. We were about two short blocks from the beach. The shore was rocky—that's where it got it's name. So I used to do rock bathing. I have had two experiences at drowning. One, at Arundel, Chesapeake Bay; another one at Ocean City, when I used to swim, I decided that a third time might be fatal, so I used to dip down into the water as far as my neck, but I never ventured out. I'd sit on the rocks and enjoy being near the waves, until the doctor told me that it'd be better for me not to go bathing any more. But I like the salt air. It braces me up. I had very pleasant experiences.
Plymouth was about four miles, and they used to have a bus that used to go in Plymouth from the very time we moved down there; you'd get transportation. They used to have a railroad train from Boston that went down there, and that was only about a walk up the tracks, it would be about a mile and a quarter to where I lived. So I enjoyed it. They used to come around with fresh fish, and when they got lobsters they would bring lobsters around from the fish wharf from some of the adjoining towns. Men would come around with fresh vegetables. My neighbors across the street were lovely to me down there. She keeps in contact with me. She lives in Arlington now. Her husband died and she gave up. I said, "Well, when you move and things are changing, it won't be long before I'll be out of here." She talked to me just before I went away. They keep in touch with me. I've had a nice, interesting, full life. I'm satisfied. Only thing is, I don't have anybody to go anywhere with me now. That's the reason I can't get about. I don't have much strength, and I don't think it's safe for me to go too far away alone, because I'm not too steady on my legs, due to every nervx- shattered and no reserve energy.
CG= Can I just ask you one very quick, sort of parenthetical, question? Mrs.
Mary Dandridge, who was at Resthaven with your brother, was she a relative of the same Dandridge family that Dorothy Dandridge came from?
No. No, she had a daughter named Ethelind, who was in social work in New York, had a good social job, and she took her mother to New York, as her mother﻿31
JS: (cont.) wasn't able to work any longer—or she thought she shouldn't work any longer. I used to stop in New York to see them on my way home. And when they'd come up here, they'd always get together with us.
CG: Let me ask you, when you became an adult, that was around the time that various social movements were being started for black people and by black people, by people of color.
JS: What was started?
CG: Social movements, like the NAACP.
JS: Yes.
CG: Do you remember the beginning of that?
JS: Around 1916, the Niagara Movement was taken over. I think it was a little earlier than that, but around 1916 the NAACP was... People were interested in this Niagara Movement, and they developed a branch in Washington, and it didn't have much membership for a while.
And in 1919, and everything seemed to happen in my life, a big thing for which I got not even a thank you—well, a thank you, maybe, but nothing else to mark it—that was the year that I had paid off the debt. I was interested in paying six weeks off the eight-thousand-dollar debt, which was successful.
A group of us had gotten together—there were either six or eight, I don't recall all of the names now, which isn't important right now. It s only one, as I recall, that's living besides myself. We decided, they wanted a hundred dollars to organize and to make the association legal, we needed a hundred dollars. Attorney Archibald Grimke was the president, and Mr. GrimkS had known me ever since I was, before I was born, because he was friendly with my parents before they married. He knew my father up here in Massachusetts, Boston. We decided it would be nice if we could help them get this hundred dollars. Mr. Grimke?, that aristocrat, he thought he would get ten people at ten dollars, and he'd get his hundred dollars. So we asked him to come to a meeting, and we thought it would be nice if we could get more people out for a smaller amount of money. So we met at Dr. Adelaide Gulliver's aunt's home, Miss Mary Cromwell.
^G: This is in Washington?
JS: Washington, D. C. We gave our suggestion to Attorney Grimke. Of course, to Mr. Grimk^ it was just as foreign as though he never heard of anybody having any campaign, and we didn't make any impression whatever, although he was very polite, a perfect gentleman. We talked—or they talked. I was rather quiet and I was the youngest of the group, always was. He left, and we were kind of dejected. So we talked that day, and we got together another week. We weren't satisfied, so we asked Mr. Grimkl to come back two weeks later, and they talked. Then me, with my little timid self, "Mr. Grimke, a hundred dollars is a hundred dollars, and the ten people here could give ten dollars apiece, and they wouldn't even feel it, and they wouldn't care a thing about your organization. Wouldn't mean a thing﻿32
JS: (cont.) to them. There are twenty people who could give five dollars apiece, and they wouldn't feel reluctant to give five dollars. Now," I said, "if you get a hundred people at a dollar apiece, you have a hundred people who have joined, and they will say, 'Oh, I've just joined a new organization.' Their friends will say, 'What is it? Oh, I'd like to belong to it.' You've got your hundred dollars, and you've got a hundred people, and you've got something to work with."
That floored Mr. Grimke. He still wasn't overjubilant. "Well, young ladies, if that's what you want to do, this money is due in four weeks. If this is what you want to do, I will consent, and you get your hundred dollars or make a report four weeks from now." So he bowed out gracefully and went on about his business, still not convinced. I guess he thought we were young silly women. After he left they said, "Julia, you were the one that broke Mr. Grimk£ down, so we will make you treasurer." I said, "Can't I ever be anywhere without having to do the work?" Well, the upshot of it was, I collected the hundred dollars from my friends, and at the end of four weeks—each week we came and reported, and at the fourth week I made the report—the secretary had kept a record—and I turned in five hundred dollars to the association, the first money the NAACP ever had, and the first campaign that was ever in the United States, from which the yearly drives developed. I am a life member out of my own money, as I believe in the NAACP, hoping it will continue its fine work of past years, and some day the race may be full-fledged citizens of their country.
CG: People are writing articles now about the role of the elite.
JS: Yes. Today I've noticed in many of the writeups about my family, we are being called the elite and the aristocrats. In Washington we never paid any attention to that. I admit that all of the people that I knew personally, who were my friends and my parents' friends, were all educated people. They all were making good livings, most of them were living in their own homes, they were buying their homes and rearing their children, and we had our own group, but I said they always did something, worked in the churches, and they tried to do what they could in the community to make the community better. The city was divided up legally into sections, Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast. Southwest had the poorer kind of colored people. Whenever there was any trouble, the people in the Northwest would go to the aid of those people. I taught in the Southwest twice in my teaching experience.
I took food to the children,for there were no school lunches. And I took food on Saturdays, when some of the men hadn't been trained to take care of their families, and when they got their week's pay from their laborers' jobs, because most of them were laborers, making very little bit of money. They'd stop in the saloon and spend the money, and the poor little family had nothing to eat during the week. Often I would stop by the market—as we had open markets then, no supermarkets—and carry food down. But I said, we always tried to do something for somebody else, just like we got, we younger people wanted to help in the community, we started this campaign, and got this money for the NAACP, which has been the lifeline of the American people, and had it not been called the NAACP, with the militant movement that was in this country, I don't know when or where the colored people would have landed, because they were out to ruin and break up the NAACP, the militants.﻿33
CG: Which militants now are you talking about?
JS: I only know them as militants. The people who organized and were trying to say that the NAACP was listed with the Communist movement, which was not true. And Roy Wilkins deserves a great deal of credit for having held the NAACP together through those years when the colored people were fighting for civil rights, but they were not organized sufficiently to involve all of the people, and the techniques that they used were very unfortunate in many instances. They were threatening people who would have helped, but you can't expect people to help when you tell them you're going to blow up their homes.
CG: Do you remember the Garvey movement at all?
JS: No, I didn't know much about the Garvey movement. They were in New York, and at the time I came along, there was very little talk about colored people being associated with Africans. The Garvey movement has come into light in the last ten years, in my memory, up here in Massachusetts, in Roxbury. As far as I know, I don't know if Garvey ever lived in Massachusetts. I had to inquire. The honor that they've given him, the Garvey-something Honor, I think is very unfortunate, because I do feel that when we're making history, we ought to be very sure of what we're saying. I'm telling nothing in the story of my life and my family and my friends that hasn't been my personal experience, that I know is true. And I would be willing to swear that everything I've said... And when I've had a doubt, I've always said, "I'm not sure of this." But it has been reported. Because history should be authentic, as far as you can go.
CG: So there was not that much influence from the Garvey movement in Washington?
JS: No. There was no interest, no interest in Washington at all.
CG: In a sense this is the kind of thing that you were talking about to me earlier, when you told me about the difference between a society person and other blacks that you knew, other people of color that you knew in that time in Washington.
JS: What about it?
CG: when you said your family, members of your family, were not society people, this is the kind of person that you meant, the person that works for the community?
Js: I guess maybe you might, what I meant to say, there wasn't anything in
Washington of a social nature that my family wasn't a part of. But they didn't devote their whole life to card playing as the women did in my later adult life, especially after my family left Washington. When I came along, the mothers stayed at home. Many of them had been schoolteachers, some of them perhaps had worked in the government, and they were all educated, and I told you, they had these assemblies. Whenever they had an inauguration, they always had a big ball, and the women were beautifully dressed. Of course, materials didn't cost what they do now, but they had their silks, and their satins, and their velvets, and they were of all complexions. When I said my family were not social butterflies, I meant they weren't running around to every party that was given. They went to anything that was worthwhile,﻿34
(cont.) when invited to it. I told you about the Brownie Club, did I not? No, you did not.
The Brownie Club was a club organized by twenty-five single women, and they said, "No men, no dancing, and no card playing." They were living off of their wits for entertainment, and they had the most clever parties that anybody ever attended. Of course, in time, some of the women married, but they didn't invite any men to their parties. Only time they had men and outsiders was when some big affair was going on, like the inauguration. They always had a very lovely party at inauguration. They invited couples and their friends and the visitors, for they hired a hall, and paid all the expenses. Nobody could buy a ticket. One time they had a masquerade ball, and everybody came masqueraded...beautiful, and very unique. Their monthly meetings were held in each person's home. They had all kinds of entertainment. Halloween time, apples were hung, and you would be walking blindfolded and see if you could bite the apple. Or some peanuts were hidden somewhere, and you could see how many peanuts you could find. They gave little prizes, nothing expensive. Didn't gamble, none of them gambled. Then you'd be given a piece of paper and a pencil, and there may be ten questions. One would be, What's on the face of a penny? Oh, the most unique entertainments. They lasted thirty years. And my Aunt Florence was president for years.
Do you remember which year this was again? Which year?
Well, now, let me see. No. The last person that would know died last year. I left Washington in '47. Let me see, my aunt left in '26, and they were organized long before that. They were an organization during somebody s inauguration—I don't remember—but I should say, around... sometime xn the early 1900s. I remember it was before my family left Washington xn 1919. They stayed an organization for thirty years. As members died out sometxmes they got new members, and then, like everything else, so many members dxed out, and then of course it ended. Younger people came in, and condxtxons changed.
Any member of the club, when it was your club meeting time, you could invite as many of your friends to your house that you wanted to. If somebody else was entertaining, and you had a visitor in town, you would call up the hostess and ask if you could bring this visitor from out of town, or two visitors. You didn't pay for them. No. The club paid for them. You paid your dues in the club, but when you invited guests, nobody paid. And one lady who had been invited, invited the whole party, the whole club to her house one evening for entertainment. Of course, her entertainment wasn't the same type, but she paid her respect to the club, her thanks for having them come, to have a reception for them. They had receptions, and my people went. I went to receptions, but I didn't belong to card clubs. I only belonged to one, and that was one year, and that was enough for me. I enjoyed it. I played cards occasionally, but I was more interested in community affairs.
When you say, "played cards," what games did people play, bridge? Whist.
Oh, whist.﻿35
JS: And then of course, it became bid whist, and then it became—what was the other one?
CG: Pinochle?
JS: No, not pinochle. Some kind of whist. There was bid whist... Bridge, then bridge came along. Five hundred. I belonged to a club that played 500, and I played whist. We used to play whist in my home, maybe the Sinclairs and some people who lived in the neighborhood, maybe two tables. Just come in on the weekend sometime, and whoever came in, wanted to play a game of cards, two games, sit down at the table and play. But I mean, we weren't out to playing cards every night.
CG: Do you remember any of the, or were you involved in any of the clubs that were affiliated with the National Association of Colored Women?
JS: No. The National Association of Colored Women came along after my Aunt Florence left. She was the joiner. My mother wasn't. I never joined the National Association of Colored Women. Mrs. Bethune was very active in that, and they have a building in Washington, and—what's the girl's name who's president now?
CG: The National Council of Negro Women was organized in 1935.
^S: Yes, it was around that time.
CG: Right. But the National Association of Colored Women was organized by Mary Church Terrell and Margaret Murray Washington in 1896, so that would have tied in...
JS: You write that so I'll get that straight myself. Mary Church Terrell was a friend of the family. My mother was no joiner.
CG: That's why I thought maybe you might have been involved in that, because Mrs. Terrell was an organizer of the group.
Js= Mary Church Terrell was a friend of the family's. In fact, Robert Terrell got his first job through my father's influence. He graduated from Harvard. I traveled with Mary Bethune from Washington to Philadelphia one time. She sat in the seat right in front of me in a parlor car, unplanned.
CG: Oh, did you two have the chance to talk?
JS: Yes, I talked to her.
CG: What was it like meeting her, and talking with her?
JS: No different talking to her than anybody else. Mary Bethune was no different than meeting anybody else. I'd known Mrs. Terrell only through organization work in public life. Mr. Terrell later studied law. He was principal of Dunbar High School when I was in school. And many of the teachers there were friends of my family. Did I get to the M Street High School in my story?
You told me about your attending the high school.﻿36
JS: These teachers in the high school were from New England colleges, which were very rare. This is very important because there was not another high school in the country like Dunbar High School. Dunbar High School we called Dunbar. It was M Street High School, and it was started, the first high school—let me look, because I don't want to miss this.
CG: It was the first, the first...oh yes, it was started by the Syphax family.
JS: Syphax. And one of the relatives graduated from Radcliffe, and she's coming up here next week. She's a friend of mine, Mary Gibson Hundley. Her mother was Syphax. And she wrote, "I'll see you, Julia, when I come up to some activities at Radcliffe." She's been very active until the last two or three years trying to get students from M Street to Radcliffe. So she'll be up for graduation.
CG: Is she having a class reunion this year?
JS: She didn't say. She said she was coming. I guess it is her class reunion. Probably fiftieth.
CG: What other clubs and community activities did you participate in while you were living in Washington, before you moved to Cambridge?
JS: I'm not a club woman. Most of the things I did, I worked in the YWCA. Oh, I didn't tell you that?
CG: No.
JS: Nineteen nineteen. When was the world war? Nineteen hundred., fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen. I think this was in 1919, but I'm not sure of the dates, so maybe you'd better not put anything down. But it was in the early nineteen hundreds.
CG: We can check it.
JS: A group of grown women, older women, started a YWCA, and they were meeting
around in a home, parlor. They had no money, and I don t remember how many, but one was Mrs. John Francis, and one was Mrs. Frances Boyce, another one was Florence J. Smith, my aunt. The others I don't recall, nor how many— whether eight or ten—just a few; there might have been a dozen. Anywhere from eight to a dozen, more or less, which would make it accurate, see-met. Some of us young women, knowing their plight, no place to meet... This was just before the war started.
This was earlier.
Js= I know 1919, because I was working on the church debt when they won. Well, anyhow, this was before that. They started around 1916 and were meeting, and they needed some money, so some of us young women said, "Let us get together and see if we can't get up an entertainment, and see if we can get a little money, so they can hire a hall where they can have their meetxng. We got together, talking with the other members of the board, and decided we would be living pictures of women in history. Not many colored women, they were white women mostly—Mona Lisa, and Susan B. Anthony, and the writers, Louisa May Alcott, and various ones. I was Minnehaha. They had﻿37
JS: (cont.) this large picture frame made, we stepped in the picture frame, and then they drew the curtain and we told the story of the history of the character that we were representing. I recited part of Hiawatha, as I was Minnehaha. I made that dress that I wore that was shown later in a picture.
CG: That is beautiful. I'm looking at the details, and...
JS: Brown cambric, that front panel was taken out of a dress that my mother
once had. Finally came down to me, and I had it all put together, feathers in my hair, Indian beaded bag and beads.
CG: Did you do all this work here by hand? The fringe?
JS: Well, what had to be done by hand, I did by hand, yes. And these are Indian beads, bag, I had them all ready; now I lost them all...in moving.
CG: This is beautiful. Did you do the bracelets yourself also?
JS: i made the dress out of brown cambric, and it shone from the stage, looked like satin. Everybody thought it was brown satin; it wasn't nothing but cambric.
CG: That is beautiful.
JS: So we had this entertainment, and we got money. They secured a hall, quite a distance from where—the Northwest section—where all the ladies lived. Then came this war effort. I guess it was [World] War I... They got this money, and then the war came along a little later, and there was money. There was a colored woman sent from New Bedford—I can see her, but I can't think of her name, but I can get her name because I have friends in New Bedford—through her they got a new YWCA building. That was during World War I. I worked in the YW in Washington, volunteer work. I worked with a group called Alumnae of Howard University to make it nicer for the students who were living in the dormitory. As I told you, I belonged to this 500 club. As a child, I went to a dancing class with some students. I never cared much about dancing. I can't dance now. Never liked to, for myself, but I like fancy dancing.
CG: Now, what kind of dancing was this dancing class?
JS: jUst ordinary dancing, trying to teach the girls to be graceful. That was the kind of experiences we grew up with. Two ladies had this dancing class once a week. My father was out in Kansas, government assignment. We sent a package by express, which came just before I was to go to the class that Saturday, and Mother opened it. The package had something for everybody— and mine was a doll, a sleeping and talking doll, just made, and my mother had to go downstairs for something, and my little, inquisitive brother, when she got back upstairs, had pulled the doll to pieces to find out what made that doll talk. Of course, when I come home—I just saw the doll and went out to the lesson. I've never forgotten that. He was just mischievous and inquisitive and wanted to see. Of course, Mother punished him, but that didn't bring the doll back. That was something new, time when they just commenced to have talking and sleeping dolls.﻿38
JS: (cont.) No, I was never a club member. I would join to help something, but just to go in for just club work, no. My aunt was a joiner, and she was in the YWCA. Mother would contribute, and when they had fairs or anything—she sewed beautifully, she did fancy work beautifully—she'd make fancy scarves or cookies or cakes or whatever, but she was a homebody. She was active when she was single, and when she married she said she believed a woman ought to stay home and take care of her children. She was a good mother, and everybody always knew she was going to be home. Somebody was always sitting at our table. Sunday night our house was almost like a forum. They'd drop in, sometimes they'd have supper, who dropped in in time for supper, and then they stayed. There were two single bachelors. One was Mr. Parker Bailey, who was one of my teachers of English at the high school, graduate of Harvard, and Mr. Richard Brennan from Philadelphia, of an old family. They invariably would come. We always looked for them. Mr. Parker Bailey was the first person saw me outside of my family after I was born, and he taught me English in the high school. My father knew him up here in Massachusetts.
You asked me what clubs—I worked in the YWCA in Washington, volunteer work only, one of the committees, and then Mrs. Boyce was a friend of the family's and she got interested in my interest in the Y. It was during the war when I went to Cincinnati, after this entertainment was given, because they needed an executive.
CG: Now, this war, you're talking about World War I now, right?
JS: Yes. And I had just paid off the debt of Saint Luke's. I'm mixed up, but I know it's 1919 when I paid off the debt of the church, and it was the same year that the NAACP needed help. All came at one time. They were opening a branch in Cincinnati, Ohio, and they contacted me, and wanted me to go to Cincinnati, Ohio, to be their executive secretary. I didn't want to go, so I told them no, I was interested in the church work, and I hadn't finished, and I wanted my vacation. Well, Miss Bowles was head of the YWCA in New York City, and was head of all YW's. They telegraphed—then they were just getting telephones—and she telegraphed me. Finally she wound up in Washington, and I landed in Cincinnati, Ohio, after I finished, and that was in June, and after Fourth of July, after I'd straightened out and turned in the money to the NAACP, $500, got myself straightened out, I went to Cincinnati. My folks, my brother was up in Massachusetts, Mother and Father were in Washington; my Aunt Florence had come up to Boston as she always did, to be with the rest of her family, her sisters who were living. Yes, that's right.
CG: Your mother passed in 1936?
JS: Yes. My Aunt Florence passed away in '26, and my father in '24, my brother in '54. Those are dates I remember. I don't go to the cemetery very often. It hasn't been convenient when I could go, I guess. But I always remember my loved ones by doing some kind act for sick on the respective dates. I went to Cincinnati, and I was met by the girls' worker whose name was Colson. She was from Petersburg, Virginia. I was taken directly to this building where they were having this YWCA. The board was having a meeting, and I was introduced, as I was to start the meeting with the Lord's Prayer. I was an Episcopalian. We never pray out publicly. All the prayers we ever knew were in the prayer book. And I was young, and I don't know what I said,﻿39
JS: (cont.) but I prayed. Trembling inside like a mouse for a week. Didn't know a soul.
I started my work in Cincinnati, and they wanted me to stay in the Y, but I had trained to be a teacher; I liked children, and I preferred to stay with my family. They wanted to take me to New York for special training, I didn't go. I returned to teaching in D. C. In the meanwhile, when the time came, my parents went to Boston, as my father wasn't very well. So I went from Cincinnati to Boston—this meant two weeks'vacation—then I came on back to Washington with my parents and took up my school work.
But while I was in Cincinnati, there was a Miss Jenny Porter—I'll never forget her name. She was the colored boss in Cincinnati, playing with the white people. Perfect Miss Massa Tom. In fact, we had some right here in Boston; makes me so mad.
CG: Oh. Perfect Miss...
JS: I say, a perfect Miss Massa Tom
CG: Oh, I see.
JS: Female.
CG: Right, right.
JS: Playing with the white people. She was in the school system, I think, and
she had the school teachers paying for the entertainment of, being Dixieland and all that kind of stuff. So she came up to me a few days after I was there, and said, "Miss Smith, I'm the leader of the colored people." Of course, they'd all been introduced to me the first day I was there, and I didn't know one from the other... scared to death, hadn't even gotten to the place to put my bag down, change my clothes. So, "I'm Miss Jenny Porter." I said, "Yes, Miss Porter. You were introduced to me the other day." I didn't know a thing about Miss Jenny Porter. But she says, "I want to tell you, you know nothing goes on in Cincinnati among my people that I don't control." I looked at her. I said, "What did you say, Miss Porter?" "Well, everything that goes on, you have to consult me." I said, "Just a minute, Miss Porter. I'm accommodating the YWCA and," I said, "I want you to know that they have sent me because they felt that I could do their job. I don't have to stay in this city twenty-four hours. I've got a lifetime job, and you're not going to tell me how to run this YWCA. If Miss Bowles don't like what I'm doing," I said," that's between Miss Bowles and myself." And Miss Jenny Porter never bothered me.
I went on and did what I thought was right. Nobody told me what do do. They had belief in me. I didn't ask for the job. They begged me to take it. They had nobody to do the work. And they felt, with my experience, and my ability, that I could organize this Y, which I did. Miss Colson was warm hearted, conscientious, southern educated, and we got along beautifully together.
Two weeks or more before I left Cincinnati, Miss Porter tried to be nice, and I was nice to her, but she just stayed a forty-foot pole from me. I just paid her no mind, and I never heard from her afterwards. She invited me to her house for supper. I found it very convenient—I couldn't accept﻿40
JS: (cont.) her invitation, I thanked her. I never went near her. That's the kind of woman I am. I'm not deceitful. I'm not a hypocrite. If I tell you something, I mean it. If I can't do it, I'm woman enough to tell you. If something happens and there's a misunderstanding, I'm woman enough to come if I hurt somebody, or something has happened; I'll make the first step and try to straighten it out.
I did that in my classrooms, with children, and somebody's children would get in trouble, some disorder or something, and "Oh, John did it, Miss Smith." Then I'd say to John, "Well, you stay after school. Miss Smith wants to see you." Then he'd come, "Miss Smith, I didn't do it. Roscoe, Roscoe and Henry." And then I'd call them, when I found out John wasn't in trouble. The next day I would say, "Class, just a minute. Miss Smith has something she wants to say to you all. Yesterday I was told that John was the one that made the disorder and caused this trouble. Now," I said, "I found out that John is not the one who's guilty. Since I accused him before the class, I'm asking John to accept my apology." I said, "John, I'm sorry. I accused you and you were not guilty. Now you other two boys were guilty. Now you stand up and let the children see that you told me a sinful story."
CG: I wish some of my teachers had had so much respect for students.
JS: And every child... I had two children living in Washington, I taught both
of them...not in the same class...and in the eighth grade. I couldn't tell you how many years ago that was, when I was in the school, twice under my aunt. I hear from them. They moved to Bronx, New York, and they've invited me down to visit. Now they're back in Washington, and they tell me any time I come to Washington, "Just let me know," or come visit them, come stay with them. They'll come meet me.
CG: Do you ever hear from any of your other students as well?
JS: No. When I was at 464, shortly after I came to Boston...
CG: Four sixty-four Massachusetts Avenue. The Women's Service Club.
JS: Yes. They were having an entertainment for funds for children's camp. I went over. There was a young man, I can't think of his name to save my life. I've tried to, since you've asked me this, and I was in the audience and this young man was giving a reading. He was at the university. When he finished, they all applauded, he got up and thanked them. The applause was maddening, it was so loud and long, and he thanked them again. He then said, "I thank you very much. I am very glad that you appreciated my rendition." He gave two readings, but the highlight of my evening, "I appreciate your applause, but I see in the audience one of my former teachers, and it is my former teacher who is responsible for me being here tonight. Miss Julia Smith, will you please stand up. Miss Smith taught me in the high school, and," he says, "I except nobody, not even the university professors, were as fine as Miss Smith was. She taught me appreciation for literature, and that's the reason I'm taking this course." I was embarrassed because I didn't know the people, and I had to stand up. One of my friends who'd been teaching at Bordentown, New Jersey, was there, and afterwards she said, "Julia, you must have felt honored." I said, "No, I was embarrassed." I said, "I don't like publicity."﻿41
JS: (cont.) Another time I was with this Ethelind Dandridge. We had been to
the Pops Concert, or a concert at Symphony Hall. She was up here visiting me the beginning of summer, June, and crossing Huntington Avenue to go where her car was parked comes this young man rushing across the street and running down. I said, "Hold on to your bag, be quick, for it might be dangerous." This young man stood in front of us, "Excuse me, ladies, I didn't mean to frighten you, but I saw my teacher, and I wanted to speak to her. Miss Smith, Miss Smith." I'm saying, "Lord have mercy." "I just wanted to shake your hand, Miss Smith." Of course, that was some years back. "Oh, you look fine." And I've had those experiences where they see me. When I go to Washington, as soon as anybody sees me on the street, it might just as well be like the policeman with a whistle, because, before the day is out, most of my friends know that I'm there. And it's to lunch, take a ride, get the people together, a little dinner party or something. So I've had a full life, and I've done the best I could. I hope I've impressed somebody. Now what else? Where do we go from here?
CG: "I had asked you about clubs you were involved with in Washington. What kind of groups were you involved with when you came to Cambridge?
JS: When I came to Cambridge, I came to Cambridge because of a friend of mine
whose parents and my parents had been friends for years. And her brothers, both of them, were friends of mine, they used to take me out. They were both attorneys. One was appointed to the Massachusetts attorney general's office, first colored graduate of Harvard. His grandfather was of Indian descent, and he had a place on Boylston Street, I think, a doctor. Well, anyhow, she wrote me this letter, told me that my brother wasn't well. That's all she said, "I thought you ought to know." The next day after school I went down to the office and inquired. And the man said, "Pension for whom?" I said, "Myself." He looked at me, "Go on back to your schoolroom, lady, you're too young for a pension." I said, "Well, you could find if I'm eligible if you look at the record." I said, "Thank you." He says, "Listen, I don't want to give you any approval. We need you. Your record is fine, and they need good teachers." I said, "Listen, my brother is sick, and my brother's all I have. These dollars don't mean a thing to me. I want a pension plan and I want the papers." I said nothing to the superintendent and I said nothing to the principal. I signed the papers, and she had to sign them. She didn't want to, nor did the superintendent. I didn't have too much respect for him, so... I showed him, I'm not deceitful, "I gave my best now. I am the last of my family in the D. C. public school system." You couldn't fawn over me.
I came to Boston, unbeknownst to my brother, and I came in, and then I told him I was home for good. He says, "What, Sister?" I didn't tell him he was sick. I said, "Oh, teaching's getting hard." I said, "The last assignment I had, a tough area, and I'm tired of pulling chestnuts out of the fire when the other teachers are going scot free, and they're wearing my nerves out." I didn't tell him then that I'd heard he was sick. I stayed with him.
I was invited to join YWCA, which was two blocks or three blocks from my house, Temple Place, in Cambridge. And I worked there for fifteen years, volunteer service, on three different committees, helped with the rummage sales, went to several conferences—one was at Worcester—and had a very pleasant association, always attended their annual dinner meetings, and took part in their discussion groups. I attended the seminars, and participated﻿42
JS: (cont.) in them, and made studies of Cambridge and the welfare situation, which I didn't find encouraging at all.
CG: Now, when did you do the study of the welfare situation?
JS: That was under the YWCA, in some of their offices. I went in about '48, '49, and I worked fifteen years or more. I even went there after my brother died, in the sixties. I was invited to join Community Relations Committee in Cambridge, which was under the auspices in some way of YWCA; the executive secretary was a very fine woman, Jane Sadler. She was a graduate of Fisk, but she was originally from beyond the Midwest somewhere. I don't know much about her family, or nothing, practically, but she was an exceptionally fine woman, which made me appreciate our contacts. They were a mixed group of colored and white, and the whites were very well-to-do. They met around at people's houses. They never got the chance to meet at my house because time passed on, and then they decided that they'd meet at the Y later on. But they did meet at one colored person's house, and one of the members of the group was Reverend Payne. Can't think of his first name. We met in his home on Brattle Street. We worked and got the fair employment law passed. That was the first effort of racial work that we did.
CG:
Did you meet Dr. Mary Thompson in the process of doing this work?
JS- She wasn't in that organization as far as I know, but I know Dr. Mary Thompson. I gave her a contribution. She went to Africa, I think it was Nigeria, she was interested in a university. She came to my house and I gave her a check. I saw her the other day, and told her there was a lady I'd wanted to come see, that she'd been sick. She says, 'Well, I hope you all will get down."
Well, and then I became interested in the inner belt. For almost two years I worked alone protesting about the road coming through, across the Boston University Bridge, into Cambridge, back of Saint Peter s Episcopal Church, through Lee Street, where I lived. Of course, it would have affected me, it probably would have taken my home. That dxdn't bother me What bothered me was that I had lived in Washington and I had known about the beginnings of urban renewal, and had attended a couple of meetings. I m civic minded, I'm public-spirited minded, and I'm a humanitarian, and I attended a number of meetings in Cambridge concerning buildings and city improvement, which I didn't think too much of. I tried to alert the people, but I didn t find them very much interested. So I protested about the inner belt, and I felt very little support from anybody. They had a big meeting with the public works department. After I succeeded I contacted the members of the Council whom I did not know, and I contacted only one representative that I knew, who was Mary Newman—she and I had worked in the YWCA together; she was also a Republican, and I later on worked with her in the Republican Party.
I contacted the representative on the, members of the legislature, I would say, of Cambridge, and told them about the belt route, and this very Thomas P O'Neill, who is speaker now, told me, "Oh, no, there was no danger. He didn't know me, know anything about me. He was up here to get some award, and I said to him, "Well, Mr. O'Neill, you took an oath of office to protect your constituents, and I'm in your jurisdiction." I said, "You don't know anything about it." He said, "Well, where did you get your information?"﻿43
(cont.) I said, "From the source, from the public works department on Nassau Street in Boston, and I've been down and seen the maps." I said, "Unless you make yourself more cognizant of what's going on in your city, remember that I have a vote, and I have friends, and I have a very good memory." Mr. Thomas P. O'Neill upped to the issue—I don't think he has my new address—I've been getting correspondence from him constantly of things that he thinks I'd be interested in. I write to my congressman when there's some legislation that I don't approve of, and I get replies. I can go there and show you some letters from Senator Brooke, and from Senator Kennedy, of things that I don't approve of, and called their attention to it.
What are some of those issues that have concerned you most?
One is the waste of American money on the elderly. I don't think the money is being spent judiciously. One is taxation. I think it's very unfair to tax elderly people who have been paying taxes, income tax, ever since it became a law, and to reach over eighty-five, let's say, or even ninety, or even eighty, and have to be annoyed to pay income tax. And not only that, if your income is over a certain amount, then you have to pay an estimated tax, which makes the government use your money one whole year when you could draw a few pennies from the bank. The government is using your money with an income tax. It's taxation which I think is very unfair. Those are two of the things. And then when they have legislation up, now when they were talking about the Panama Canal, I didn't approve of some of the things that they did, and I felt that they should make more...
I realize that we have to be careful in publicity. I think there are certain issues that are going to affect the future, the future generations; the people who are making the laws and making the decisions should be given a reasonable amount of information to make them intelligent enough to know whether it is to be approved or disapproved. Because after all, I said, we citizens are the ones who put you people in Congress, and we are due something. Those are the types of letters that I write. I get nice replies. And Ed Brooke wrote me a letter, personal letter—sometimes it's typewritten and he just signs "Ed" underneath. And he wrote me a personal letter of a few lines saying he thanked me so much for the letters. "Yes, I get letters, letters, letters, but there are very few of them that I can use. Every letter that you send to me, I read two and three times because," he says, "they're thought-provoking, and if I'm not on the committee, I will refer what you say to the congressman who is the head of the committee. I appreciate it, because I don't get much help from many of the people..." And I thought to myself, "No, because the people in Massachusetts are more stupid than I thought they were." Does that answer your question?
Yes. I assume you are a Republican.
I am a Republican. I vote independently. I'm a Republican on the books. I've never changed, and I vote for the person and what they stand for, regardless of their party. Not Communism, of course. A Democrat or a Republican. If it's a straight ticket and I approve it, then I vote a straight ticket. If I want to vote for a Democrat, I'll vote for a Democrat on my ballot. I vote for the person I think is more capable of carrying out the duties of their office.
I take it you did not change parties when Franklin Roosevelt became president?﻿44
JS: No.
CG: The majority of colored people switched from the Republican Party to the Democrat...
JS: No, all those people didn't, because I was living in Washington then, but too many of them switched, and some of them, most of them have never gone back to the Republican Party. But when you really look at the parties, there isn't much difference between the principles and the behavior of the Democrats and the Republicans. Agree with me?
CG: I agree with you.
JS: But I feel that we need a two-party system and, as I say, it's not much
difference between either one of them. We have good people in the Democratic Party, we have good people in the Republican Party. But too many people are leaving the Republican Party, and unless they come back, in this next election, we're going to have a one-party system, and a one-party system is not going to be a democracy. That's what's annoying me now. We need the two-party system. Of course, the independents don't get very many votes. I became interested because I lived in Washington where people did not vote.
I had a vote, I had an absentee ballot because I was a citizen of Massachusetts, and I voted, but many times I didn't know who the people were, except that they were put up by the party. I voted for the president and didn't vote for the local people. Only people in Washington who had a state affiliation voted. Now they do vote. I'll go into that another day, not on this. And when I came to Massachusetts, I said, "Well now, here, I'm going to vote, and I'm not going to vote blindly just because I belong to the Republican Party, and I'm going to find out what this is."
I'm not a politician, I only became interested in politics because I felt Massachusetts prides itself in being so liberal, and it's one of the meanest states in the union. It has more prejudice, or as much as Mississippi. It could go down there and be Mississippi's sister or brother. So many times it is done in a sneakish sort of way. They're hypocrites. They smile at you, and stab you behind your back. And when you looked at the records, from 1900, early 1900s, to 1942 or 1943—I'm not sure of the date, but it's the 1940s, first part of the forties—there hasn't been one colored man elected to their legislature. And I said, this is a disgrace. I became interested to find out how they operate.
When Ed Brooke first started out, I had no special personal interest in Ed Brooke. I knew him passingly, he was cross bearer in Saint Luke's Church where I attended in Washington, as a little boy; but if I'd have met him on the street after I came here, I wouldn't have known him, because of course he's grown up, and I had not seen him since he'd been to war. But when he became interested in politics, I looked up his record, found out he'd graduated from Boston University, Howard University, and had a good record as a soldier, who was an officer. I said, "Now, here's a man who can represent the race." The first time he ran for representative, he was defeated in Roxbury. Then he ran, it was when he became attorney general. I couldn't do anything when he was in Roxbury because I wasn't in Roxbury.
But when he started his campaign for attorney general, I had cousins living﻿45
JS: (cont.) in Roxbury, and one cousin especially, who didn't live too far from where Ed Brooke lived, and they met his mother, and she was very friendly with his mother. I haven't seen her for a long time, she was not particularly close, because they lived in the Northeast sections, and some very lovely people lived in the Northeast sections, and so my cousin said to him, "I have a cousin in Cambridge. My cousin is quiet, but she's very effective. She won't talk about what she's doing. But," she says, "if you can get her, she'll be an asset to you." So I was contacted by some of his people, and I worked in his campaign office, and he was elected attorney general. I went down to my summer home, and the only one down in my group. I told my friends that I had this friend who was running for the attorney general, and I'd appreciate it if they didn't have any other choice, to give him a vote. When he was elected, my telephone rang from Brockton and from Kingston, "Hello, Miss Smith. I voted. Your man won." And so he was elected. And when the time came for him to become senator, I worked in his campaign office, and managed his office with somebody else, and kept the records and sent them out.
CG: Now, was this for the senatorial campaign you're talking about now?
JS: Ed Brooke, when he was senator, running for his first senatorship.
CG: Okay, so you worked with the YWCA before it was integrated, and then afterward.
JS: Yes.
CG: Did you participate in the meetings that led to the integration of the Y?
JS: Well, they had this colored Y in Washington. Of course, I was teaching, and I couldn't go to the meetings in the daytime, so... But the people went, and Mrs. Julia West Hamilton was president actively, when I was there.
CG: Wait a minute. Mrs. Julia...
JS: Her name was Mrs. Julia West Hamilton.
CG: But she wasn't your relative.
JS: No, no relation to me. Her son was colonel in the army, World War II.
Colonel West Hamilton. And he was a classmate of my brother's, and visited our home when he was stationed up here.
The YW had a nice building, and they took care of transients. After my folks moved out of their home and sold it, and I returned one year from Boston where I was going to stay, they weren't ready for me, so I spent a couple of days at the Y, so I know that they gave you good service. They had a cafeteria there, and the best cooked meals, home-cooked food. Nothing like that around here. They used to have all the clientele, the teachers, and call them a league, all...when they wanted to. It s just like a family group or social group. We met there, and they had tables that would seat four or six or eight or ten, and your friends were there, so quite often I ate there. I had my apartment with the couple who owned the home, and she was an excellent cook, but many times, coming from teaching, I'd be with a group and I'd call her up and I'd say, "I won't be home for﻿46
JS: (cont.) dinner today," because I wouldn't let her fix a meal, even though I paid her; I don't waste food, and I treat other people as I'd want to be treated. And I'd say, "I won't be home for dinner today. I'm going to go to the Y with some friends." And oh, we got the nicest food there.
Now, let us get on. We're not making too much progress in the talking along.
CG: We haven't done the travel yet, and, let me see.
JS: You can prepare while I get my notes. I was selected, received a letter from the president of Howard University asking me to represent them at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology centennial in Cambridge, and I happily accepted their invitation. They offered to pay all expenses that might be incurred; I told them that I was only too happy to represent my school at this centennial. I considered it a privilege and an honor, and I would do the best that I could. The only expense that I had was taxi fare, and hiring of my hood, which I did not have. My partner in line was from Heidelberg University, Germany. We walked down the steps of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, across Massachusetts Avenue into their auditorium to hear the prime minister of England, Harold Macmillan, who made the special address. It was one of the loveliest experiences of my life. I was the only citizen of Cambridge in the audience — none from Boston. The only other people from Cambridge were the mayor, Edward Crane, and the president of Harvard College, and the president of Radcliffe. They hadn't united then. The president of Harvard was President Pusey, and I sat directly behind the mayor of the city. Those three people were only there because of their political and their official position. I was the only citizen there, I was the only colored American among all those people from the far nations of the world.
I was invited by the vice-president of MIT and his wife to sit at their table at the dinner banquet with twelve at the table, and we were the only three Americans at the table; I had a marvelous time. They had a luncheon, and I was hostess at the luncheon with nine men from various countries, and we had a wonderful conversation. It's an experience that I can't describe, but it was uplifting, and having been around the world, and now having this privilege of associating with educators from around the world, more and more I am convinced that when God made man, he made a beautiful animal. Some of them are marvelous. There's really no difference in people, regardless of their nationality and their religion, or their language. If they have the spirit of Christ in them, it radiates. I found the people at the centennial most cordial and most lovely. I experienced no feeling whatever of being a colored American. I was an American, I was in the field of education, and they accepted me.
The president, the former president of Howard had only retired a few years previously, Dr. Mordecai Johnson—everybody knew him. Of course, we all wore our name cards, you introduced yourself, and talked about your school or points of interest. But everybody knew Dr. Mordecai Johnson, and they spoke of Howard University as being such a wonderful university, and that made me happy, because it is outstanding; it has been interracial ever since it's been organized, and people come there from various colleges of the world. I've said nothing about it, because I find most people are not interested and I've never blown my horn. I had no horn to blow.﻿47
You wanted to say something about some of the visitors that came to your house in Washington over the years.
Friends were very nice. We used to have company. My mother was well liked and she was, oh, I guess you'd call her a belle when she was younger, but some of the people used to come, whenever they visited Washington, to the house; many of the visitors were old friends. There was Mr. Harry Furniss, who was minister to Haiti, and his brother, Dr. Sumner Furniss, who was living in Detroit, and he used to come to Washington. He was a grand master in the Masons and a friend of my father's. And Reverend and Mrs. Francis Grimke, and Reverend Grimkl's brother, Archibald Grimk?, who had been minister to Haiti. And Alexander Crummell, who was the first minister of Saint Luke's Church.
Alexander Crum...
Crummell.
Crummell. And is another member of this same family?
No, Dr. Crummell, Reverend Crummell was the first minister of Saint Luke's Church, and he was trained in Oxford, England, and had the church built after an Episcopal church in Edinburgh. A fine gentleman...1 can see him now, with his black, high hat. And doctors and their wives Shadd, Purvis, and Francis, Senator B. K. Bruce, and wives, all friends.
Do you remember Senator Bruce very well, and his wife? Yes.
What were they like? What was it like meeting them?
Well, meeting these people was just like meeting anybody else to me, because they'were old friends. Now Mrs. Bruce was a friend of my mother's before she ever married. All of these people, some of the women, my mother knew before she ever married. My mother was very attractive. She had some French blood in her, showed in her manner, as she was very Frenchy. She was not too stout, she had a good shape, and nice looking, but not pretty. She really was beautiful, best looking of the family, four sisters. But she was very Frenchy, in her manner...unconsciously. I mean it was a part of her. Meeting these people, and knowing these people, no more than meeting you. It didn't make any difference to me.
But, see, these people we read about in our history books, and to us they're heroes.
Well, that's just it. Then there was Dr. Lucy Moten,who was the principal of the Miner Training, Teachers School, and a very cultured lady, trained in Massachusetts. When you came out of that normal school, if you weren't a lady when you went in there, you certainly were one when you came out. The normal training school was open to anybody. It wasn't open to just a certain group of people. Judge Robert Terrell, and his wife, Molly Terrell, and William Smith and family were Washingtonians; also Dr. Daniel Williams...
Excuse me, just a second. You said, Judge Terrell and his wife...﻿48
JS: His wife, Mrs. Mary Church Terrell.
CG: Oh, I thought you said Molly.
JS: I did, I said Molly. Mary Church Terrell.
CG: But her nickname was Molly?
JS: Well, they used to call her Molly. I mean, their intimate friends. She spoke in German at a conference in Europe one time years ago. Dr. Daniel Williams, the first one to make heart surgery, from Chicago, whose family lived two doors from us. Let's see. There are many others. John Mercer Langston, early president of Howard University, and his wife. My mother used to call them by their first name.
CG: Now, Mr. Langston...
JS: I'm trying to remember. He was first president, I think, of Howard University. No, I'm sorry. I'll have to get that. Oh, many more. Daniel Murray and his family.
CG: Was politics discussed openly when people came to visit? Did you get a chance to have many discussions about politics with these various people who came?
JS: Of course, I was a little child when many of these people visited. I remember them as children, most of them. And grown, too. They talked about general topics in conversation, just like you and I have been talking. Sometimes it would be politics. But Sundays when these folks used to visit, current topics were a part of it. Then they used to have a forum at the A.M.E. Church where people went and discussed the issues of the day and the political situation. Of course, Washington was the seat of the government, but not too many, as I remember, of the people were interested in politics, because they had no part in it. Now they have. Then later on there was Cheatman, and White who were congressmen, and John Hope's family, Lyons, whose name was on every paper bill of the country.
CG: Oh, the treasurer.
JS: Treasurer of the country. And he had two daughters, one became a teacher in the normal college, and the other one became assistant superintendent of the schools of Washington...very lovely. They're both dead since I've moved here. Visitors from out of town would always drop in and they were always invited to the house to dinner. And up here, the visitors at the Cambridge, the Boston home, was William H. Lewis and wife, Phoebe Glover, son and daughter, both accomplished musicians—he played the violin and she played piano, and used to teach piano, lessons, and always had students at commencement at conservatory every June. And J. H. Lewis, who was one of the big tailors, colored tailors were few in number. Phoebe Glover and J. H. Lewis had their places of business around the area of the Public Gardens. J.H. Lewis's place was where the Filene's store is now. He was a tailor, and he had a family. His first wife died, and he married a Philadelphia woman, friend of my mother's. I can't think of all the people. Wolffs, James Wolff and family, Lawyer James Wolff; Lawyer Ed Brown and wife; the Benjamin family, Lawyer Benjamin gave Resthaven; his brother and sister, Mrs. Sampson and Mrs... Single sisters were all﻿49
JS: (cont.) friends. And of course, in the early days, there was the Ruffins, Judge Ruffin's family, Mr. Dupree, Eliza Gardner, and Lewis Hayden.
CG: Ah, so you knew Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin?
JS: Yes, I knew Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. They were neighbors of my grandfather. And their daughter was friendly with one of my aunts, my father's sister, and she spent more time in my grandfather's house than she did in her own house. And in later years, let me see, in my grandfather's day, there was a Miss Eliza Gardner, and nobody calls her name... Somebody tried and said they knew something about her, but they've never given me the information. Now I want to get it. She was interested in the antislavery movement. I remember her. She was one of the homeliest women I ever saw. But when she opened her mouth, you didn't move a muscle.
CG: Her first name is Eliza?
JS: Eliza Gardner. She lived sSown in the West End where most all the colored people lived in those days. Now, wait a minute, there was Lewis Hayden— these are older people, friends of my grandparents. She and Lewis Hayden and Judge Ruffin, all those were friends of my grandfather's family. And now, wait a minute. What's his first name? His name was Joseph Lee. He made a bread mixer, and he had four children. One son went to Europe and stayed. He had three daughters, one taught school in Washington, Tessa Lee. They had a place in Auburndale. You can put them down because they were in business." They had a hotel in Swampscott.
CG: Hotel in Swampscott?
JS: Swampscott. And then they had one in what they call Auburndale, which was supposed to be far away. Now I think it's Newton. That was the first one. They had these three daughters. There were the Hemming family... One daughter graduated from Vassar. And the brother Fred was a chemist.
CG: This is the Lee family?
JS: Oh no. I've finished witfa them. One brother went to Paris. I don't know what he did—of the Lee family. But the three daughters, Genevieve, Tessa and Narka Lee, everybody knew them. There was a Miss Nellie Smith, who was a teacher, whose mother was from Baltimore. And in my day, there was a family of Turners, and the father had a big livery stable business... outstanding. Two sisters taught school in Boston. They've just retired, in my day, since I've been up here. They have eight hundred or a thousand dolls, in a doll collection. Everybody knows about the Turner doll collection, which is wonderful. One sister, Grace, is now living in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts. They were living in Boston, and their brother was Dr. Harry Turner; he was on the staff of one hospital—I don t know where. I know the family- They owned property down in Oak Bluffs for many years.
You see, these people live, die, then people soon forget them. Soon forget. Oh, there's a Doctor Penham, a Mr. Clement Morgan, Lawyer Clement Morgan, graduated Harvard, and his wife, and that's in my day, I knew both. He was the first member of the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts. They called him alderman then. Yes, that's right. He was an alderman...first colored, and he lived in Cambridge. His wife used to visit the house. And he has a﻿50
JS: (cont.) niece whose name is Nadine Wright Goodman, and she's one of the early colored graduates of Radcliffe. She's a good friend of mine. And she taught school in the South, I think, for a while. And she taught school here in Cambridge, if I'm not mistaken. She lives now in Norwell, Massachusetts. I have been a guest in her home many times. We still keep in touch and her niece takes me to see her about once a year.
CG: Miss Smith, you have an incident in your childhood you wanted to tell me about regarding Frederick Douglass?
JS: Frederick Douglass lived in Anacostia his last years. My mother hadn't married then, so she knew the first Mrs. Douglass very well, and also her sister, Elizabeth. Their friendship went on—of course, he was a busy man and he didn't, you know, visit, but I have visited his home in Cedar Hill, Anacostia. I was a little girl, and attended public schools, Sumner and Magruder School, when Frederick Douglass died. And the children of the school, which was located a block and a half from the Methodist A.M.E. Church on M Street Northwest... Was buried, and the children were taken to view his remains—all the children, in both schools. I have never forgotten it. He had then remarried his second wife, who was white, and at that time she came in with green, and it sort of stunned everybody at the funeral because people then were dressed in mourning. I knew Frederick Douglass...
CG: She wore green?
JS: Yes. I can see her now, with her green feather in her hat. My mother took me to the funeral. I knew Frederick Douglass's two sons, Charles and Louis, and their wives, visited their homes, and knew Charles's two sons, Joe, Joseph, who was a violonist and his wife, and Haley, a graduate of Harvard College, a classmate of Theodore Roosevelt. They lived in the Northeast, Charles Douglass lived in the Northeast—put that in the upper register—Charles Douglass lived in the Northeast. Haley married after his parents died, and lived in the Northwest, on 15th Street, just about three blocks, two blocks from where my home was at that time. Haley taught in the M Street, later known as the Dunbar High School, which now has gone the way of destruction. It has been demolished, with this new social pattern that they have today.
The building's been destroyed. And the old graduates of Dunbar feel very badly about it because the M Street High School was the first high school in Washington, D. C., established by a colored man by the name of Syphax, and it is the only high school in the country that has such a record, and some of the graduates are outstanding. Judge Hastie, who was sent to the islands; Attorney General of the Supreme Court Robert Weaver; Thurgood Marshall; Senator Roscoe Bruce who became superintendent of schools of Washington, D. C. ; Dr. Cobb, vice-president of the NAACP at present-all of these people my family knew, and I knew the younger people. Most of them are dead now—Dr. Cobb's still living, retired. He's on the faculty of the medical school, retired from Howard University. Did I say Senator Brooke?
CG: Senator Brooke? No.
JS: Senator Brooke, and many others that I can name. Judge Bruce Robinson, of﻿51
JS: (cont.) Boston, a good Washingtonian.
CG: They demolished the building, but the school still exists itself, doesn't it, in a new building?
JS: They demolished the M Street High School, built a new building. The new government in Washington just didn't seem to appreciate what it meant to the history of Washington, and they allowed it to be [destroyed]. This is unfortunate. Along with this, in the last couple of years has been the destruction of the 15th Street Presbyterian Church, outstanding, of which Reverend Francis Grimke was the minister for many, many years...and the 19th Street Baptist Church, one of the oldest Baptist churches in the Northwest, pastored by Reverend Walter Brooks almost his whole lifetime.
CG: If I'm not mistaken, both of those churches were the sites of women's conventions in 1895.
JS: That's right, that's right.
CG: One, on M Street was the Colored Women's League and 19th Street was the
National Association of Afro-American Women before they became the National Association of Colored Women. So those were very important shrines.
JS: They're very important.
CG: And they've destroyed those buildings?
JS: Those have been destroyed in the last couple of years, which of course, makes the older families of Washington, the old citizens, the younger generations living, and who attended these churches or the high school, or their friends, feel that the important history of relics of Washington pertaining to the colored race are destroyed. Saint Luke's Church is still standing. It has been renovated; it was founded by Reverend Alexander Crummell, who was educated in Oxford in England, and planned the building of the church after an Episcopal church in Edinburgh.
CG: This is the church that you raised all the money for? The eight thousand dollars?
JS: Yes. That's the church. And I just got a report there, if you want to see it. It's that red book over there on top of that hassock.
CG: Oh, they had their centennial.
JS: I just got that this week.
CG: This is beautiful.
JS: Now here's their story, right in here. Well, you can look—see the page marker. That's the account of its history, unfortunately does not record the birth and early years of the church's struggle and real history.
CG: Alexander Crummell. Saint Luke's P.E. Church. What does P.E. stand for?
JS: it means Protestant Episcopal. I haven't had a chance to read it, with﻿52
JS: (cont.) friends here yesterday while I was getting some other things to show. They found that paragraph.
CG: There are pictures. Beautiful.
JS: Oh, it's a beautiful thing.
CG: Well, you played a great role in its survival. And Senator Brooke here.
JS: But you see, this is, only has the record from 1947. These are all modern pictures because these people don't know the history, and they didn't try to get the records or contact members still living who did know its history. There's a lady still living in Washington who was a neighbor, when she was a child, of Reverend Crummell, but these people do not know the people, hence that's one of the things that I find that's unfortunate. Now I know the two ministers who are there, the assistant minister, Reverend J. Shelton Pollen,Jr., is from Medford, Massachusetts, and I knew his mother and aunts. His father was a Washingtonian, and his aunt, his father's sister, taught in the building where my aunt was principal at that time. His mother taught school in Baltimore, Maryland.
One of the ministers, Reverend Thomas Brown's wife was a sister-in-law to Mr. Harry Furniss, who was one of the visitors in my home years ago, when I was a child, and was ambassador to Haiti. Those were the kind of people I was associated with, but you don't find them in Massachusetts.
CG: So this was your family's church as well. Not only did you attend this church, but your family members attended this church as well?
JS: All my family. My father held every office in the church except the
minister. He was superintendent of the Sunday school, leader, senior and junior warden; my aunt was secretary of the Women's Guild club for years. I was secretary of the young women's club that paid off the first mortgage debt of $8000. And my brother was an acolyte to the rector. I sang in the choir, and my brother was, of course, in Sunday school, as was I. [break]
I'll start off with that. Having said something about my immediate family, perhaps you'd like to know something about my parents' families. My grandfather on my father's side, John J. Smith, was born in Richmond, Virginia, and came to Massachusetts early 1800s, around 1820, because he was bitterly opposed to new laws that prevented him from getting an education. Arriving in Boston, he found out that he had the same problem, because they had segregated schools in Boston, and he objected to it. So he got himself a tutor and attended private school and educated himself and became one of the most important citizens of the Back Bay area of Boston. He went in the gold rush to California and came back no richer, and I guess with less money than he took with him. However, he became interested in community affairs, and the movement started, the antislavery movement. He joined them, and worked with Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, and William Lloyd Garrison. He and Charles Sumner became very close friends, and in the biography of Charles Sumner, they said, "If you couldn't find him in his law office, you'd be sure to find him in John J. Smith's place of business."
CG: What kind of business was your grandfather...﻿53
JS: They had the fancy name of tonsorial artist,which was a barber. He had a barber shop. Barber shop and tailoring were about the only businesses that colored people were able to carry on. He employed barbers, as he didn't do very much of the work, because he became interested in community work. Worked with abolitionists, and in the 1840s, Charles Sumner was elected between the late forties and fifties to the legislature, and from 1845. ..
Once a period of ten years, they were fighting. My father's father, my grandfather and some other people were fighting against the segregated schools. When Charles Sumner became member of the legislature, he introduced a bill that abolished the segregation in the Boston schools. My grandfather had five daughters. You want the names?
CG: Yes.
JS: Elizabeth, first colored teacher in Boston; Florence, principal of a school in Washington, D. C,, for forty-two years; Georgiana, an artist, married Dr. George F. T. Grant—I can show you their pictures; and Adelaide, a mezzo-soprano concert artist, traveled around the East in concerts; Harriet, a Boston schoolteacher; and Hamilton S., a lawyer and a dentist, and the first Negro to develop photography as an art—perhaps you can word it better than I did.
CG: That's quite a record of achievement.
JS: I will refer to them a little later, but Hamilton was the only male in the
family in his generation. My grandfather was interested in community affairs, and was finally elected as a member, a representative in the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1868 to 1872, until the 1940s, the only Negro who ever was elected for two terms in Suffolk County. He was elected from voters of Suffolk County. And from 1900 until 1940 there were no colored members in the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He was a member of the standing committee and on the federal roads committee, roads and bridges, and a member of the Boston Common Council, Ward 9, in 1878. He was sent as recruiting officer by the governor of Massachusetts, for the United States government during the Civil War to the nation's capitol for a period of time. Years later, when Charles Sumner was elected senator, he asked my grandfather, who had been to Washington, to recommend some places 1 where he could stay because Washington was a new city and a young city. My grandfather recommended him to a hotel operated by his friend, James Wormley, colored, where Charles Sumner remained as long as he was senator in Washington. Many congressmen stayed there during their terms. Those who were married and had families,sought residence elsewhere when necessary. Mr. Wormley became very friendly with Mr. Sumner, and presented the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a portrait that he had made of Charles Sumner, which is hanging in the library of the State House of Massachusetts, which very few colored people know anything about, and I dare say, not one of these colored members of the legislature. About ten years ago, Mary Newman, who was representative from my area in Cambridge, my ward, invited me to the legislature when Martin Luther King spoke, and I was allowed to sit in the seat that my grandfather had occupied in the House of Representatives. Up to that time, the one or two colored men who were in the legislature were not even conscious of John J. Smith having been a forerunner, didn't know him or me, which was an interesting experience.﻿54
JS: (cont.) He became interested in the slavery movement. Lewis Hayden
lived on Phillips Street when my grandfather in his early years lived on Anderson, 'round the next street or so in downtown Boston, West End. Finally my grandfather moved to 86 Pinckney Street, which is now one of the landmarks in the Freedom Trail in Boston, and there is a marker to be placed on the building. About eight or ten years ago, I was in Louisburg Square when they were having open gardens—friend of mine had invited me to come to Louisburg Square and see the gardens. The last place I visited—my friend had to leave to go to a meeting, so I finished the trip around—it wasn't a tour, you just went and saw what you wanted, so I ended up at 88 Pinckney Street, which was next door to 86 where my grandfather used to live, where I used to go as a little girl. The gardens in the backyard were so small, the yard laid with brick, with the gardens in the rear of their backyard. With the little alleyway on the side, where they would roll the trash barrels out for collection day.
I walked through the house into the back, and I sensed somebody looking at me, but that's nothing new—so many times T travel alone because nobody's available to go with me, for I am interested in things and people of interest, not in gossip. When I finished and came back through the house, this very fine looking, well-dressed elderly gentleman said to me, "Pardon me, but I'm interested in you." I said, "Yes? Why?" He said, "You seem to show a great deal of interest. The people come in here, race through and race on out, but you just seem to have been interested." I said I was. He said, "May I ask you what was your interest?" I told him that my grandfather lived next door. He says, "Your grandfather?" And of course I guess he thought I was crazy. And I said yes. "Well, who is your grandfather?" I said, "John J. Smith." I said, "It brings back pleasant memories to me because I used to visit him at his home there." And he says, "John J. Smith?" and put his hand up to his forehead. He says, "Pardon me, but I'm seventy-eight years old, and this brain of mine don't work like it used to, but the name is familiar, but I can't remember what he did. Would you tell me what he did?" I said, "He had his own business." He said, " Well, what else? What business was he in?" I said, "He had a barber shop and employed a number of barbers, and he was interested in community affairs." He said, "No, there's something else, because the name I remember, but I just can't think." "Well," I said, "he was a member of the legislature." "That's it, that's it," he said. "I remember my father telling me about John J. Smith, and he was one of the most outstanding citizens of the community at that time." And with that, he called his wife and insisted on taking me through the house, which they of course had modernized. I shall always remember it as one of the nicest experiences, to think that it was similar to the home that my grandfather had had, because they all had been renovated.
CG: Who was this person who remembered your grandfather?
JS: I don't remember his name.
My grandfather educated his six children, and they all made their mark in whatever it was, of their chosen abilities. Now, let's see. He became a Mason, I was saying, he lived near to Lewis Hayden whose house was a station for runaway slaves. He had his cellar so fixed, and underground passages so that they could get away. Sometimes he'd have an overflow, and of course my grandfather had six children and his wife and his wife's sister living there, so he didn't have too much spare room, but of course they put the﻿55
JS: (cont.) slaves in the cellar. My grandfather had one portion of the cellar fixed so that when these slaveholders would come up, and if Lewis Hayden had an overflow, then he would get the slaves into my grandfather's house.
My grandfather was very outspoken, made a lot of speeches at Faneuil Hall all through his life. These slaveholders would come up, knew of John J. Smith, only knew the name. Many a time he was spirited away from home for safety. In those days we didn't have the trolley cars, and we didn't have the buses, and we didn't have the automobiles, so Arlington was a long distance from Boston by horseback or by buggy where he was taken away, out of Boston when they got word that some of these slaveholders would be coming up. They tried to get the free men in the North, colored; if they could capture them, they'd take them back South and make slaves of them.
My grandmother, with these six little children, said to him, "John, will you please stop this foolishness? What am I to do if you get captured or get killed? I've got these six little children to take care of." But my grandfather was a very strong-minded man, very kind hearted, very keen, and an excellent orator, and he did his own thinking, and fearless. He persisted to be interested m the abolitionist movement until the Civil War was fought, and the slaves were supposed to be free and have the same rights as other citizens, people in America. And up to this present day, the struggle is still going on. I want that recorded.
CG: Yes. I wanted to ask you, you said he came up from Virginia. How long had his family been free?
JS: I didn't know too much about his family. I hope some of the younger people in the future may find out. What little I did have, after I moved...I had some more records, but in the moving, they got destroyed, somebody got hold of them. I had them ready to bring, but I was ill unto death, so I don't remember. His family was well known, and his father was quite friendly with an outstanding white citizen. They passed several laws, and that angered my grandfather, who was a youth, hence he wouldn't stay in Virginia. Came to what he thought was a liberal place, but I guess he found that out, too, that it wasn't. All this I have written from time to time. I've got loads of stuff. Now let's see.
He became a Mason, also Lewis Hayden became a Mason. Both of them became grand masters, and they had a lodge, a chapter, and a building named for John J. Smith, the temple on Tremont Street, which now has gone the way of all flesh; now the masonic building is in Roxbury, in the Grove Hall area. He was married fifty-six years. All of his children have passed. My Aunt Florence, the second oldest was the last to pass, in 1926, two years after my father, her brother, in 1924.
CG: She was the aunt you were very close to?
JS: Yes, she was the one who lived with us. After she retired, she remained in Washington a few months, then returned to Massachusetts. All of her family died but her brother (my father). The nieces married,so she continued to make her home with her brother and family in Cambridge at 12 Lee Street,for it was just a continuation of home for her where she'd spent forty-two years of her life.﻿56
JS: (cont.) I have written some notes; you can look them over. If there's anything that you desire me to speak of I'll do my best.
CG: You have a note about the fifty-fifth wedding anniversary of your grandparents. Was that a social occasion in the family?
JS: Yes.
CG: What happened then?
JS: They had a reception.
CG: This was May 14, 1902, or May 11?
JS: Nineteen something...
CG: 1902.
JS: Yes. 1902. It was the fifty-fifth wedding anniversary.
CG: Where was the reception?
JS: The reception was at their home at 45 Wellesley Park, Dorchester. It was a very lovely affair. The Masons presented him with a framed picture of himself. It's about___two feet, would you say? Twenty-four inches —
CG: Yes, that's at least two feet.
JS: ...by eighteen inches, in a frame about twenty-six by eighteen inches, gilt frame. They presented that to the family, which I have given to the Masons to hang in their temple with other grand masters.
CG: You say your grandfather had a very active life?
JS: He had a very active life. He was one of West End's most renowned citizens for his work in the community, helping people and trying to right the wrongs that prevailed against the colored people. He came to Boston, educated himself and his family. He was living in Wellesley Park, where a home was purchased after a few years. All of his children except Florence and Hamilton had died. He came to Washington, paid a visit, went to the Capitol to see his Congressman. He said to my mother, "Daughter, I'm just going out for a little walk." He didn't come back. She waited and waited, and then she got worried. He got in just a few minutes before my father came from work, and my mother said, "Pa, you had me worried to death. I didn't know what had happened to you." He said, "I've been to the Capitol, Julia." She says, "You've been where?" "I've been up to the Capitol, and I made a speech. They had me make a speech up there in Congress." Eighty-two years old, or eighty-four. I don't remember the date. He died at the age of eighty-six, and lived longer in years than any of his family, but one, as I am ninety-three.
CG: Your grandfather was also involved in the Odd Fellows here.
JS; Yes. My grandfather joined the Odd Fellows—I believe they called it the
high priests of Saint Stephen's Royal Arch Chapter, and past grand priest of a﻿57
JS: (cont.) grand chapter, and ambassador of the grand representatives of
grand lodges of Germany in fraternal association with Prince Hall Grand Lodge. I can't keep track of my grandfather. He was the oldest of all the Odd Fellows in this part of the country at his death in 1906, and last surviving charter member of the Bay State Lodge, I.O.O.F. (whatever that means, I don't know), organized in Boston in 1884, of which he was one of the first of the noble grand.
CG: Your grandmother, his wife.
JS: My grandmother was Georgiana Smith, his wife. She was from Halifax, Nova Scotia—a very fine woman, very loving, a good mother, and a Christian. She worked in her church. She didn't have time to do much community work, because she had this family to take care of. I loved my grandmother. She was very kind to me when I visited her, and I learned of her death on my return from a weekend trip in Baltimore where I'd gone to see some of my cousins and aunts, on my way coming through the station, I met a classmate of mine, and he said, "Julia, I just saw your father and aunt." I said, "Yes. Where were they?" He says, "They just boarded a train for Boston. Somebody's died." And I said, "Oh, I was going home anyhow." So I rushed home and my mother told me that my grandmother had died, and that Aunt Florence and Father had to go on home to the funeral.
Now, my grandmother was well liked, and very kind to the people who visited, and of course, there were all these people coming in. My grandfather was so well known. When Livingstone College—I want to tell you this—was first started, Mr. Atkins had been told to come to Boston and get in touch with John J. Smith, who would put him in touch with some of the philanthropists. So Atkins came to Boston, Mr. Atkins, and my grandfather became very friendly. My grandfather put him in touch with the philanthropists, and he made several trips to and fro from North Carolina.
CG: Who were some of the philanthropists that your grandfather put him in touch with?
JS: I don't know. I didn't know this until 1936 when I went on a motor trip, a trip South to Tuskegee, my first trip in the southern states, then I met Mr. Atkins. Well, let me finish... So Mr. Atkins brought his wife up to Boston, and she became very friendly with the family. I don't know whether they stayed in my grandfather's home or not; that I don't know. But when my Aunt Elizabeth, whom I spoke of before, was on sabbatical leave, she wasn't too well, and was on her way to Florida. She stopped by Salisbury, North Carolina—I think that's where it is—to see the Atkinses at Livingstone College, and they were still in a dearth for trained, educated teachers. The need was great, so she spent the rest of her sabbatical leave in teaching in Livingstone College. She stopped on her way South—I was a little girl—spent Christmas holidays with us and left for Florida. She came back in June and spent a few days with us, and then went on back to Massachusetts.
I never did know that she never did get to Florida—for at that time Florida meant nothing to me, because I was a little girl, and we only got just a little in geography—not until 1936 when I took a motor trip to Tuskegee. I stopped and met Mr. Atkins. His daughter-in-law was teaching in Washington, gave me﻿58
JS: (cont.) a letter of introduction, because at that time you could not stay at hotels in the South, and people, the colleges usually would accommodate people or some home. So she gave me her father-in-law's address, and at that time, when she gave it to me, it didn't mean anything to me. But when I gave him her card, as she had written him... Two older ladies who were with me, I was youngest. He said, "Smith? Where are you from, Miss Smith?" I said, "Well, like a man with no country, at present I'm from Washington." "But, where else?" I said, "Boston. I've been Midwest." He said, "Boston? Do you know anybody, ever heard of anybody by the name, family of John J. Smith. I think most of the family had died." I paused a minute and I looked him in the face. I never yet introduced him to the two older ladies with whom I was riding, making the trip. I looked at him. I said, "Yes, I happen to be John J. Smith's granddaughter." And with that he grabbed me and kissed me. He says, "Don't think an old man, seventy-eight years old, is fresh." Then he told me the story of which I have just told you about my grandfather and his relationship. Until then I never knew that my aunt never did go where she was supposed to go. So these are things that my family has done in helping people and I take after them.
CG: I have a question. You said they gave you an introduction. Was that a letter of introduction and a calling card?
JS: Yes. This letter of introduction was from his daughter-in-law.
CG: That's a custom that has sort of passed away in these days. People don't use cards any more.
JS: Oh, yes. In my day, unless you knew who people were, you didn't get intimate with them. You had to be introduced one way or another.
Anybody coming through Washington... As my father was well known, he helped a lot of people, and of course, he was from the states and had a vote. Many people came to Washington to get government jobs, so in order to get help, you had to have somebody who would know them, introduce them. Otherwise, you were just out of luck.
CG: What was the proper way to use a calling card in those days? That's something that a lot of young people would never understand, because they've never been exposed to it.
JS: You would introduce people as your friend, or Mr. So-and-so, who is from
such-and-such a place, he's a member of such a church, or he's a, whatever position he might happen to have. Then they would give their credentials of people whom they knew who had recommended them, and that was the introduction. So people who were seeking jobs, personal friends, you were introduced as a friend, from a friend of yours. And that was just a common custom. And people then had courtesy and good manners. Now I've reached this family history, now... I'm going to give you this to glance over, because maybe I've told you part of it.
CG: This is from the narrative now?
JS: Yes.﻿59
CG: This is your mother's family.
JS: George F. T. Grant, my father's family.
CG: You're talking now about Georgiana, who was the artist?
JS: Yes. I told you about Elizabeth just now. She was the one that...
CG: ...taught school...
JS: ...went to Livingstone. That was the outstanding thing, 'cause she didn't live too long. None of them lived, oh, none of them lived beyond their sixties. Harriet died young, and Elizabeth died young. Florence lived. She's the last one. Adelaide, and my father...Adelaide died before my father, and then my father, and then Florence.
CG: ^ What kind of artist was Georgiana?
JS: What I remember of her, she didn't pursue it, as she got married and had two children: Maybelle, who married Dr. Alfred Russell, and had two children, two daughters—three.
CG: Maybelle had three.
JS: Yes, Maybelle had three daughters. Lillian, who became a Catholic nun, at present living in a Washington, D. C.... What do you call the place?
CG: Convent.
JS: ...convent in Washington; and Inez, a director of Boston school physical culture department, physical culture. I don't know what they name it. I call it physical culture.
CG: Physical education?
JS: Yes, she's director of the Boston...one of them. I don't know whether
they have one, or more than one, but she's director of physical education, Boston public schools.
CG: She's doing this now?
JS: She is now.
CG: Is her name still Russell?
JS: Her name is Inez Russell. The youngest one is Georgine, or Georgiana.
I think she calls herself Georgine Russell Hill, and she's an artist named after her grandmother. She at present is making portraits of some of the— I think the man was superintendent of schools in Bermuda, or an official of Bermuda. Right now that's what she's doing. She's married to Hill— what's his first name?—Hilton Hill. He is in the airplane, air force business. They've been to Africa two or three times on business, trying to establish air lines between America and parts of African countries. She was over there this spring. She comes quite frequently to help, see her sister, her father, who has since died. Now let's see. Now, that's Georgiana.﻿60
JS: (cont.) Florence J. Smith went to Jersey and taught for a year, and then she went to Washington, D. C., where she had an uncle and cousins, and became principal of Birney School, Anacostia, D. C., which was within walking distance of Frederick Douglass's home. She was principal there for forty years, and was tendered one of the nicest receptions when she retired. Then she returned to Massachusetts, and came to Cambridge to live with my father. Now, that's Florence. Adelaide was a concert singer, and she had two daughters, Edith and Florence.
CG: Now, who did Adelaide marry?
JS: Adelaide...concert singer, and sang in the large cities on the eastern coast...got married, Louis Terry, and had two daughters, Edith, who married Frank Holbrook, and from the union, was one daughter. And the youngest, Florence, who married Malcolm Lewis, no offspring.
CG: Adelaide's daughter, Edith, had one child named Adelaide after her grandmother.
JS: Adelaide's granddaughter was named Adelaide. She married Richard Walker, who had his own business, has two children Edith and Richard Walker. She had these two children. Have you got this straight? Adelaide Terry; Adelaide Walker, Adelaide Terry; Adelaide Smith Terry was my aunt. That's the one I started to talk about. Adelaide Terry had two daughters, Edith and Florence. Both taught in the Boston schools. Edith married Frank Holbrook. I have that. Now, let me see. Edith married Frank Holbrook, and she had one daughter, Adelaide.
CG: I see.
JS: She had one daughter, Adelaide, who is married to Richard Walker, who has his own business, in electronics, in Massachusetts, and they have two children, and one is Edith, and the other one is Richard.
CG: I see.
JS: Edith is teaching at present in the Girls' Latin School.
CG: Now what's Edith's name?
JS: Edith Walker. And the son is Richard. I don't know what he's doing. Now,
that's Adelaide. Now, Hinton Hill. I couldn't think of his name.. Georgiana Hill? Dr. Grant's granddaughter?
CG: Right.
JS: Yes. Dr. Russell's daughter, Georgine. The last one. Her husband's name is Hilton.
CG: Hilton Hill?
JS: Yes. She has two children, one boy, and he's in Bermuda working, with just what, I don't know. They live in Bermuda. That's their home. And the daughter is a graduate physician, and has been practicing in Canada. Graduate of a Canadian college of medicine. See, our family carries on.﻿61
CG: Right. That's quite a record of achievement.
JS: Let me see, I gave you Elizabeth, Georgiana; Florence, had no children.
She traveled back and forth. I didn't tell you, Florence was the joiner of the family. Florence J. was single and went to Washington to live. Very active in Saint Luke's Church, secretary for years of the Women's Guild, and teacher in the Sunday school, and a great worker at their entertainments, fairs and so forth. She was a member of the board of the YWCA. She joined the women's branch of the Masons, and became matron and grand matron.
CG: This is the Eastern Star?
JS: Eastern Star. That's right. You help me out. Taught forty-two years...
Principal forty-two years, forty years in Anacostia, and was much beloved, and frequently was called upon by various members of the community to make speeches, and to help with the community problems. And among her students,
one became supervisor and principal of the public schools for Washington, John C. Bruce; and superintendent of the schools, Garnet C. Wilkinson. Her niece, Julia Smith, was sent on promotion twice to her building, once as second grade teacher, and a few years later assistant to the principal (her aunt Florence) as group school principals developed.
CG: This is you, now, we're talking about, right?
JS: Yes. To teach the second grade.
CG: So, not only were you close to your aunt because she was an aunt, your favorite aunt in the family, who you traveled with, but you also worked for her for a while?
JS: Well, that's right. And I said to the supervisor, I said, "When you have a vacancy, will you please transfer me?" He says, "What's the matter? your aunt's a fine principal, and you're getting along nicely." I said, "Yes. I don't want to stay with my aunt. I want to make my own career, and I don't want anybody to say ... I work harder under her than I do with the other principals, because I'm not going to have anybody say, 'You're Miss Smith's niece. And don't say anything, because she can do as she pleases."' So he says, "All right, Miss Smith. I want you to stay there." I talked to the supervisor's son, and I punished, kept him after school one day, and some teacher went to his office to a meeting, and she thought she was smart and she said, to him, "Oh, Miss Smith punished and kept your son after school today." He says, "She did? Well, that's fine. That's the reason I put him in Miss Smith's room, because I know Miss Smith, she's one of the best teachers, and she'd make him behave. My son is a pupil in her classroom, and she'll treat him no different than she treats any other child." And that was my reputation. I taught children of friends of mine, but I never made any difference with any one of them. If they did something good, I praised them. If they did something that was wrong, I censured them. The children always respected me for it.
Now, going back to my aunt, a few years later, every year it seemed to me I was promoted, and I was moved from one school to another, and I taught under three principals named Smith, one my aunt, and two others, no relation to me, in different sections of the city, all three. And then the population﻿62
JS: (cont.) grew, and these graded schools, some of them had principals of small schools. My aunt had a large school, and they decided that they'd call them the group principal schools, and they would have an assistant. And lo and behold, I'm sent back to Birney School under my aunt, as her assistant, to teach eighth grade. From there I again asked to be transferred, at their convenience, which my aunt accepted, because she knew why I wanted to go. But the teachers all realized that I was Julia Smith. I'm not Miss Florence Smith's niece. I was Miss Florence Smith's niece on the outside, but I was a teacher in her building. I never called her aunt in the presence of the teachers, nor did she call me Julia. She called me Miss Julia, because there was another Smith in the building, that taught the sixth grade, who lived in Anacostia, who had been in that building ever since it had been built, so she was called Miss Emma, and my aunt, the principal, was called Miss Smith. So they had this distinction. So I was Miss Julia.
One day the teachers were assembled somewhere talking, and they stopped talking. Afterwards one of the teachers told me, said, one of the new teachers, had just been appointed, said, "Oh, here comes Miss Smith." And they said to her, "Don't you worry about Miss Smith's niece, Miss Smith is not Miss Smith's niece, she's a teacher in this building." And I said to them, I said, "My aunt was principal before I was ever in the school, and before I went to school," and I said, "if she doesn't know how to run her building, I'm certainly am not going to be an asset to her. She'll run her building as she's been running it." And I said, "What she tells me to do, I do, and don't have any argument with her."
So I have pupils whom I taught in eighth grade at Birney who are still living, were in Bronx, New York, and now they have come back to Washington. While they were in New York, they took a trip to Vermont, and they came to see me, remembering me as one of their fine teachers, and they invited me to New York to visit them. They've invited me to Washington to come and visit them any time. So these are former students. Many of my students have died, they've moved elsewhere, but the years when I was around, they were all doing very well. Some in the educational field; one of them is teaching in Brooklyn schools, I hear from her regularly.
I taught in three different group schools, all of them, two of them with principals by the name of Smith. I taught in three others, and from the group school I went into the high school, and I taught in two different high schools, junior high, high school children.
The early teachers in Washington were trained in the North, especially those in Dunbar High School, old M Street High School, which made it outstanding. Because we had the best-educated colored people in the country at that time. And all of the teachers in Washington, for years, had to have special training, teacher training. They weren't allowed to teach. All had at least one degree. And after every year they had to report on their educational training, work that they had done, and what studies they had taken. They had in-training courses, and summer school courses were considered, and some of them took courses at Howard. But as long as you showed that you were keeping up with the times... They had lecturers come from New York University and Columbia and Chicago.
CG: Now the lecturers were for the in-service training courses?﻿63
JS: Yes. And as long as you showed that you were progressing, you got
sufficient marks. Of course, you didn't hold your job if you didn't do satisfactory work. You got promotions as promotions were given, from grade to grade, and then you got the salary promotions. I started at the handsome sum of forty dollars a month, which was considered top salary.
CG: Forty dollars a month is... When you retired in 1947, what were teachers' salaries like then?
JS
I don't remember. It's nothing like it is now.
CG: You mentioned that you...
JS: I did keep the record, but as I say, so much of the stuff that I had when I was in my home I can't put my hands on. Of course, I had this terrible experience and I lost my health, and things just went.
CG: You mentioned that you never pursued a lot of degrees, but that you did continue your education.
JS: I was interested in education, and not in specialization. That's what I wanted to say. I took advantage of every opportunity that presented itself. I never was, what you might say, robust, and at a period in my life, my parents didn't think they would raise me, and that was the reason why I wasn't sent to my father's beloved Massachusetts to school, because my health didn't permit me to encounter the rigors of New England at that time. So my education, the main part, was in Washington D. C., but every summer I attended summer school somewhere. Ypsilanti, or Boston, Harvard, or Boston University, and attended lectures that they would have throughout the city. I remember some used to be in Boston... Some very lovely courses were given in literature at King's Chapel, and I used to go there...and lectures, wherever they were, on many, many subjects by some of the outstanding people who attended Harvard University, who had come here for special training from foreign countries...and in-training courses, in the school year, they would send professors down from Columbia. All of which we were given credit for. I was fond of music, and attended the Damrosch concerts and lectures when he used to come to Washington, and always gave a lecture course before he had his concert, which gave me my great appreciation for classical music, opera, symphony, and so forth.
CG: What was his name again now?
JS: Damrosch. In New York. That gave me a better sense of appreciation for fine music. Correspondence courses from Chicago University, and also from Massachusetts, on various subjects that interested me beyond my teaching program. I am interested in community needs, people, and nature. I found travel one of the finest things to broaden one's knowledge. You learn a great deal of geography, and the life and habits of people through travel, seeing them in their own habitat, and performing their daily duties, which I think is comparable, if not surpasses, possibly many courses that people take in college. And I'm very grateful that I had the opportunity to make a trip around part of the world. We say, around the world, which of course, I didn't do—but when you take fourteen countries, leaving Boston and crossing the country, stopping in Chicago, which is the biggest﻿64
JS: (cont.) city of the Midwest, located on one of the great lakes where
there's a great deal of industry... on to Los Angeles, the greatest port on the western coast, on the Pacific. Having dipped in the Pacific Ocean, crossed the Pacific Ocean, into Hawaii, and spent a few hours in Hawaii, had an opportunity to have a couple of Hawaiians travel with us on the plane to Japan. And to learn of the country, customs, see some of the people in Japan, which I will speak of later. I don't think I ought to go into that now, because I'm on my family.
CG: Right. Was Aunt Florence a great influence upon you in terms of wanting to be a teacher and wanting to travel?
JS: My Aunt Florence, I failed to tell you, was among, if not the first colored woman that made—I won't say she was first to make a trip across the continent—in 1898. She made the trip alone, which in those days was considered to be quite a feat, with salaries that were very small, because my grandfather had no money. He took care of his family, he was generous, and whatever money he had, he shared with somebody who needed it, especially during the slavery period. She made this trip to San Francisco, California. I was a little girl, about twelve, thirteen years old, and I remember her. She brought back from California...not much, because she didn't have much money, but she went to San Francisco— Los Angeles wasn't the blooming town then—where she had some distant relatives, who have since died. They were in the hairdressing business, I believe there, and had quite a business.
She brought back a very handsome piece of satin. It was black, with heavy embroidery of roses and went all down the front and around the border. It had been already made by the same modiste who made the graduation dress for me later. It was a princess-style dress, with a demi-train, and all around the border was this heavy embroidery of about four inches, four or five inches deep, and it started out narrow at the neck, and widened out down the front until it met the bottom and went around the border. It was black satin, so heavy it could almost stand by itself. Before she died, she gave me the dress. She wore it to Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration ball. And, oh, I think she went to some party in Baltimore. She was invited over to some social ball there, where she wore the dress; she also wore it in Philadelphia. I don't think she ever wore it in Boston, because Boston didn't seem to have that type of entertainment. She gave me the dress, and the dress I have taken care of, now it is at Howard University, waiting for them to do what they should, make it a specimen to put it in the museum. Not fold it, but show it as a museum piece, for there is not a crack or a break in it. Beautiful.
CG: You showed me a picture of it. It was beautiful.
JS: Florence was the goer of the family. My father used to call her "Gadder."
She's the joiner and the goer, and every Saturday she would take me somewhere, weather permitting, as long as she lived... every Saturday, to the matinee, or to public buildings. She frequently took me to the Smithsonian, which was a most interesting place, and showed me everything, had the guards explain to me the various things. Of course, she would go to all the different parts of the Smithsonian. We went to art galleries, and the Capitol, and later on, I used to take my children to the Capitol, also to Congress. My mother, she married and she devoted her life to her family﻿65
JS: (cont.) and to her mother's family when they needed her. When her mother was taken sick, I was around twelve or thirteen, or maybe... I was in grade schools, and she had to go to Baltimore. There's always one in the family that's, everybody seems to feel, if they come, they're the leveling one, so if anything happened, they'd always have to send for Junie. Her name was Julia, but they called her Junie. And she was a great homebody, and everybody knew she was home. So we had a lot of company, because they always knew my mother was home, she had gone to private school, was well trained, and she'd been a teacher, so she was up on affairs.
No gossip was ever in my home. My father wouldn't allow us to come in there with any tales from the street or newspaper scandals or anything. We children were allowed to talk with the family. Had any questions, and if there was something that they thought we should look up, go into the room there, the bookcase, and get out the encyclopedia and look it up. If you couldn't find it, or you didn't understand it, it was explained to you. So my memories of my family are very close and dear to me. I had a very happy home, and a very unselfish home.
I have very pleasant memories of my mother. She was a very fine woman, and she and my father's sisters were just like blood sisters. My Aunt Florence and my mother lived together in the same house before my father married my mother. So they were just like sisters.
My Aunt Florence was a lovely person. She could boil water without burning it. That's about all she could do in the cooking. But she was an asset, because if Mother was busy and had invited somebody to dinner, Mother was fixing the dinner, Aunt Florence could take care of the guests, and there was no worry about the guests having to be left alone. So she had her place in the family. We children, my brother and myself, loved her dearly, and she was our pal as she was so kind; my parents were kind, too. They just talked to us. We did what was right.
I guess I get my desire for going about from her. I like to see things. I like cultural things, music, lectures, travelogues, ballets, operas. I do not like gossip, and I will not participate in it. I like people, and I'll help all kinds of people, but I, for my personal friends, I like people who have something in common that we can talk about. I'm always interested in current events, and especially did I become interested in politics, because Washington, although the capitol of the nation, was not a political city. You can understand what I mean.
CG: In other words, you couldn't vote.
JS: You couldn't vote, for it was ruled by three commissioners. It was divided into four sections, Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, Northeast community centers, and I belonged to the Northwest one. When there was anything that the citizens felt should be corrected, we either wrote or sent a committee to interview the commissioners. Now, of course, Washington has its own rule and its mayor. At present, he's colored and a voter...
CG: Miss Smith, you were telling me that at the colloquium the other day, you
met a friend, Ellen Craft Dammond, who had ties to your family, social ties to your family.﻿66
JS: And the other day, when I was invited to the luncheon of the colored women at Radcliffe College, I sat next to the granddaughter of Ellen and William Craft, and we got in conversation. The day before, I had received a phone message from Newton...from Judge Bruce Robinson, who had talked with his sister in Washington, and I told her that one of her relatives had just died, Mrs. De Leon had just passed. She hadn't heard the news. And I said, "You may not know, but her father was Brom Craft, one of the sons, who attended St. Luke's Episcopal Church and sat across the middle aisle, right across from where my father's pew was, in St. Luke's Church. She was a member of the faculty in the high school where I taught...a very fine woman. She taught French... very quiet, very ladylike, and very refined." Now, going back to Mrs. Dammond, the granddaughter.
CG: Dammond?
JS: Mrs. Dammond. I said to her, if she had tried to reach me two years ago, when she came up here to Freedom House and gave a talk on her grandparents, and the head of Freedom House, assistant director, knew me, and she could have gotten in touch, but she didn't. But a friend of mine was there. She was very anxious to get in touch with me because she felt that I probably was the only living person who knew her parents, and she had come here to bury her father's ashes at Hyde Park Cemetery. So this friend said, "I know Julia Smith. She's a neighbor of mine. I can get in touch with her. What do you want?" She said, "I would like her to come to the burial, to the service at the cemetery." She said, "I will bring her, because I'm coming, and I will bring her. She's just two blocks from me."
So I went out there, and at the cemetery she made some remarks about her father, Harry Craft, and when she finished, there was a lull, and I had been asked to stand next to her husband. She nodded her head. She hadn't said anything, but was glad that I came. Nobody said anything. She nodded her head to me again. I said, "Evidently she must want me to say something." So I said, "I would like to say that I haven't been to this cemetery since Mrs. Dammond buried her mother, Bessie Trotter." I said, "Bessie Trotter and her father, Harry Craft, and some other young people were all friends here in Massachusetts together." I said, "After Bessie and Harry married, they came to Washington to live, because Harry was given a job in the YMCA, and we were very friendly, I saw a great deal of them, and," I said, "this young lady I haven't seen since she was a baby." They all smiled.
I said, "I haven't been to this cemetery since, because when her aunt, Mrs. Maud Trotter Stewart died, she died at the same time that my brother died, and Miss Gertrude Baker, who was the sister-in-law to Mr. William H. Lewis, three well-known Bostonians, all died at the same period, all buried within two days of each other. So I wasn't at that funeral." But I said, "I want to say that Mrs. Dammond had two fine parents. I had known them through the years, and probably I'm the oldest person and the only person probably left around here in Massachusetts who was a friend of theirs." I said, "Her grandparents, Ellen and William Craft, were friends of my grandfather's in Boston before I was ever born, and before she was ever born." The minister came up afterwards and told Mrs. Dammond, "You ought to get in touch with Miss Smith. You're writing history about your grand-﻿67
JS: (cont.) parents, and she might have some information to give you about some of your family that you don't know." So you see, my relationship with people has been through the years, through my family on both sides, and I'm not one of these people who are saying, "Oh, yes, I know him. Just met him." I said, "My family have known these people, I've had some association with quite a few of them."
CG: You visited...
JS: I have visited and some of the younger generation I have been friendly. Now this Miss Frances Grant as I said, Dr. Grant's daughter, I knew her father and mother. Now these people don't know these people. They write about Boston history, but they don't go back to the people who helped to make Boston history. Dr. Grant was the first colored dentist in Boston, he was first professor at Harvard Dental and no colored had ever been appointed up until 1974. They didn't have any since then, I don't know. It was '73 or '74.
CG: Do you remember your Aunt Harriet very well? She died young, I think.
JS: My Aunt Harriet died very suddenly. She was tall. I think she was the tallest of the aunts. She was- very fond of her two nieces, Edith and Florence Terry. After their mother died, she was rather strict, which sort of irritated little Florence, but they all got along. She was highly educated. They were always very well dressed, and at that time, Boston had what you might say, some society, and people came from other parts of the country to the Cradle of Liberty.
CG: When you said Boston had some society, you mean---
JS; They had some society in that time. That was around, in the early 1900s, because she died in 1916, and I remember...
CG: But by society, you mean people were visiting and having parties and...
JS: Parties, yes.. Not big balls, but they had receptions, and they used to
have a trip down the harbor, they used to call, which was an annual affair. There were luncheons and receptions, and the ladies had a book lovers club, if I remember correctly. They met around in the various ladies' houses. They were intelligent people. At that time, Mrs. Clement Morgan was a member. I don't remember who belonged, but in that period, when my mother came in 1919 to live in Massachusetts, there was Mrs. Doral Cole Lewis, who married J. H. Lewis, the tailor. She was from an old Philadelphia family.
CG: Was this the Mr. Lewis who had a tailor shop where Filene's is?
JS: Yes. He had a shop there. The Sampsons. Mrs. Sampson was a sister to
Lawyer Edgar, and Lloyd Benjamin. Edgar gave Resthaven to the community. Phoebe Glover had a dressmaking shop in the area of Newbury Street near the Boston Gardens, outstanding modiste. These people had a nice friendship among each other, as I remember once attending, with my aunt, some folks' affairs. We had been out to Ypsilanti to summer school, and some of the folks from Philadelphia I think were...three, four, five, six. Six of them came the﻿68
JS: (cont.) following summer to visit, and my aunt gave a reception at her home. These things were social events of that era.
CG: This was Aunt Harriet?
JS: Yes. At 45 Wellesley Park.
CG: Did Aunt Harriet get married? You said she was a Boston public school teacher.
JS: Yes, she taught at Bowdoin School in Boston. Talking about my Aunt Harriet, I went out to Wellesley College, I went all around wherever somebody was speaking. I had met Rayford Logan, who was just beginning to be in his prime. He made a speech at Wellesley. In those days, you could travel around in the evenings and nobody bothered you, so 1 went out to Wellesley to hear Rayford Logan. And after the lecture, I came out, was standing waiting for the bus, when this lady came up and said, "Could you tell me where the bus stops?" I said, "I'm sorry. I just came out from the lecture, but I imagine it would stop right here near the opening of the college." Well, she says, "Well, I'll stand here with you and we'll watch for the bus, and whichever one gets on first, we'll sit together." So we got on the bus. This lady looked at me, and said, "I can't help from looking at you because there's something about you that reminds me of a friend of mine. Not in looks particularly, but there is some resemblance. But mannerisms. We taught at Bowdoin School, and her name was Harriet Smith." I said, "Well, this might interest you. Harriet Smith was my aunt." .
This was one more of these experiences that I had that have been interesting. Unfortunately I don't remember the lady's name, but we had a very pleasant trip into Boston, and once or twice we exchanged telephone calls, but of course, in this rat race society that we have, nobody seems to keep up the friendship. Something happens, and of course, my brother became sick, and I was interested in him. That was Harriet Smith. And she was a very good teacher. But she had... What do you call that thing where you die suddenly? Not a stroke.
CG: A heart attack?
JS; No. What is it when you have, not a stroke. Well, anyhow, she wasn*t sick any length of time. Died suddenly, and my Aunt Florence had to leave school in June, for she died just before school closed.. My aunt got permission to leave, and had to have somebody else close up the school year for her, because she was the only sister. She and my father were the only members of the family left. She was a very fine person, and she dressed very well, and in those days they used to use the Irish point lace; I can see her now, in lace and flowers and jewelry.. Everybody knew her. She was brilliant, quite outspoken, for anything that was wrong, she was not a party to it, and everybody knew where she stood. She was interested in a home that was established down in Boston for the old colored people. I don't remember whether that was the home that finally Mrs. Hinton became head of. Around that time, the Episcopal sisters, the sisters of Saint Margaret... I don't know the dates, but I could get them. They started a home for aged, sick elderly colored people, Saint Monica's Home. Now they became interested in there, and I remember one lady that went there, Mrs. Gross, and I'm not so sure that Miss Eliza Gardner didn't end her days there. Miss Eliza Gardner was also﻿69
JS: (cont.) one that lived down around the West End, interested in the
abolitionist movement. She was a friend of the family, very brilliant, a very homely woman, but when she opened her mouth, you forgot about her looks. She went South and made speeches after the Civil War in behalf of the colored people's rights. She may have been the reasons why my aunt became interested in this home for the aged.
CG: This is the Sisters of Saint Margaret's Home?
JS: Yes. I don't remember whether it was Saint Margaret's Home, or whether it's the home, another colored home, or whether it was all the same, but I know it was down in the West End.
CG: You say your Aunt Harriet was very outspoken. Did she belong to any organized groups?
JS: I don't know what she belonged to, but she was generous. I just saw her in the summertime. She probably did, but I don't ever remember her visiting the home. I remember my Aunt Elizabeth visiting, and I remember my Aunt Addie visiting, and of course, my Aunt Florence lived with us. But my Aunt Georgia didn't. She died very early in life. Harriet and Georgia died suddenly. Addie had a heart attack. She had asthma; she was sick for some time. Now, I'm talking about my family, I guess I've gotten down to my father. Is that right?
CG: Why don't you go back and talk some more about your father. You were at the point now where he is retiring?
JS: My father kept his job in the government; also, he practiced dentistry because in those days dentistry didn't support anybody, and wages were even low in the government, although he was getting one of the, not the top salary, but one of the best salaries. But his health failed, and he retired at an early age, and lived five years after he retired. He returned to Massachusetts, and one of his coworkers who lived in northern Massachusetts or New Hampshire came by to see him when he came up on a vacation, and told him that his cases were still on his desk, because they hadn't found anybody who could finish the cases because the government didn't have anybody who knew what to do with them. I said, "That's just one of the things that the government does that shows you how inefficient our government is. That's the reason we have so many bad laws passed." Things they should give the attention to, they're too busy politicking and looking out for other matters when they should be devoting themselves to pertinent matters that are important to the people of a country. He lived five years in Massachusetts, and was buried at Cambridge Cemetery. Because of inefficiency of the Masons, the family didn't request to have a Masonic funeral.
CG: Oh. Because they are too long?
JS: No. We just wouldn't have a Masonic funeral. The type of people who were in control, because they did not live up to the practices of Masonry. And that was that. And I know my father would never have desired to have those people say last rites over him. So we had a minister Reverend Jobe who was the minister of Saint Peter's Church where we attended. He was very kind to my father. He preached the sermon. He's buried in the Cambridge cemetery where the rest of my family is. Where perhaps I may be buried. At least﻿70
JS: (cont.) my name is on the tombstone.
CG: In the last five years in Massachusetts, during the last five years in
Massachusetts, was this his most productive period in terms of photography as an art?
JS: Oh, no. No, no. My father developed the art of photography in early 1900, and these pictures that are being displayed, and there are more of them,
over a thou and The plates were taken over seventy-four years ago. I have held the plates, and everybody thinks it's wonderful that I had saved those plates; not one of them broken. There are about a thousand or more. Which I gave to the Afro-American Museum of History here.
CG: We've talked some about your mother.
JS: At this point I will tell you a little about my mother's family. My mother was born and lived in Baltimore, and her father, John Brooks, was an
engineer.
CG: Now, what was her name again.
JS: Her name was Julia Luke Brooks.
CG: And her father was an engineer?
JS: Her father was an engineer, and worked with his father and three brothers.
They built part of the Pacific Railroad, and Grandfather Brooks was killed in a dynamite explosion while in the West. And his wife, my grandmother, was pregnant, carrying her last child. Agnes Gratefield Brooks was left with three living daughters and an unborn baby. She was at the head of the steps when his telegram was given to her by her maiden sister that told of the death of her husband. Telegrams were nothing new. Whenever he'd get to a place where he could send a telegram, he sent it to his wife to tell her what he was doing. She fell backwards down the steps, injuring her spine. At that time medical science wasn't what it was today, so they didn't think she would live, being in the condition that she was. But she lived, and the baby, the fourth daughter, was born, and the baby lived to be eighty-three years old. Ripe age in those days but she was nervous. Very fine looking, and she, too, became a widow.
After she recovered, she had no means of support, except her sister, who was a maiden lady, and she carried the family until her sister could work. Her sister spoke French fluently, so she opened up a school in her home where she taught French to the white rich ladies of the Academy, because they had no white teachers in the Academy who could teach French. She taught French to these wealthy white students. Her four children were as fair as her students, but they were not allowed to go to the public schools because they were colored. So they had to go to a Catholic and private school, where they got their education. This is America. But these white students, these white ladies could come because she was the one who could give them the French. She was of French extract. Her name was Grushaw. Don't ask me to spell it... translated to English, Gratefield. So she educated her four daughters...
CG; This is Agnes Gratefield Brooks you're talking about?﻿71
JS: Yes. There was Elizabeth, who became one of the first public school teachers in Washington, D. C. Followed by Julia, who also became a teacher in Washington, D. C. She hadn't even finished school, and the superintendent was experiencing the problem of not sufficient teachers, educated. He went to Baltimore to the principal of the private school where she attended, and made arrangements—she was in the graduating year—that they give her lessons, and every weekend she would go back with her papers. They gave her an examination; she got herself a diploma. That shows you how difficult it was for colored people to get an education in those days. The superintendent was anxious, for she substituted while on her vacation. When he wanted her to remain, her sister said, "My sister hasn't finished school." So she was a bright student, so there... She, too, took private lessons, tutored, when she became a teacher. And of course, she married Hamilton Smith, and she had two children. We know that, Julia and John.
^Then Agnes married Henry Roberts; she had no children...a lovely couple. I was very fond of my Aunt Agnes. And Ella, I think her name was Helen Ella, they always called her Ella, married John Bishop. The Bishop family was well known in Annapolis and in New York. He died and left her a widow with two girls, Helen, named after her mother, and Lillian, whom she educated. Helen became a teacher in Baltimore public school, and Lillian died early just as she finished school. She wasn't strong, naturally. One of them would be, when the mother was the unborn child.* And Helen lived until 1968. I think she's been about ten years gone. She was my first cousin. My father was very kind to her, and we were more like sisters than cousins. Made frequent visits to and fro from Baltimore over holidays, except summertime, when we were away.
Now, my mother's father... My mother was five years old when her father died, so she never had the benefit of his fatherhood. She only remembered her father slightly, and he gave her the name of Junebug, and that's the reason she was always known to her friends as June, because she was the one of the girls that was swift of foot, and when anyone wanted an errand, her father was home, he'd always say, "June, you run to the store and get so-and-so." So she had the name of Junebug because she was so quick on her feet. She was very graceful, and very wholesome, very independent in her manner, very Frenchy, very kindhearted. As a single woman, very popular... both men and women liked her. She had many suitors, and strange to say, when she... A friend of hers introduced her one day, said she was going to introduce her, to a new gentleman who had come down from Massachusetts. "1 don't want to know that Yankee." So she wound up and married him, and they had a happy life together. They were married in '83, and my father died in '24. That's how many years? I'll let you do the mathematics. And they had a long and happy life.
CG: Forty-one years.
JS: Forty-one years, together. And then my mother lived twelve years after my father passed. And my brother lived ten years after my mother passed. No. She died in '36, and he died in '55.
CG: And you came here in '47. He got sick in '47.
JS: Yes. Yes. That's right.
* I.e., unborn at the time of the father's death.﻿72
CG: You said your mother was of French extraction?
JS: Yes. My grandmother...yes, they were French. I don't know too much about them because at that time people didn't bother too much about history. But they were well known in Baltimore, and in those days there wasn't too many records kept. They were Catholics, but she spoke French, my grandmother spoke French fluently, and my mother in her earlier days spoke French. I studied French. I could talk a little, but I had no use for it. Now I can understand a few words when I was traveling, but I don't know any French. I used to read a little. And I studied German and Spanish, but I've had no use for them, and like everything else, if you don't keep it up, you lose it. Just like piano playing. I used to play a little, but now, well, I couldn't stretch an octave, and that stopped me from playing.
Now I'll read... "wife Agnes Gratefield Brooks, and of French ancestry, with three daughters and an unborn child. Mother was only five years old at the time of her father's death. Her father was of Irish descent." Can you imagine such a combination? And I don't know much about the family because I wasn't interested. I knew one great-uncle, but my father's brothers never helped their sister-in-law. "And did she ever profit from any of the business? Falling downstairs on receiving the news of her husband's death, my grandmother injured her spine, and became a cripple for the balance of her life." Her spine was injured, and if she bent over, and you could see some of the spine bone and the vertebrae sticking out. Oh, she was a handsome woman. I'll show you her picture. "After giving birth to her fourth daughter, she and her unmarried sister, Julia Gratefield, lived together and reared the family. They were of French extraction. When my grandmother recovered sufficiently, she opened a private school teaching French to the wealthy girls in the Academy. Her sister was a businesswoman... In the 1880s Mary Elizabeth, my aunt, and Julia Luke Brooks, my mother, were among the first colored teachers in the public schools of Washington, D. C., which had been opened for colored youth in the late nineteenth century, in the 1860s." I'm not so sure that that date is correct, but it might be.
CG: I have a question.
JS: I don't think it was that early. I think maybe it ought to be in the late 1800s.
CG: I have a question. You said a great-aunt was a businesswoman.
JS: Yes.
CG: What kind of business?
JS: She worked for an undertaker or modiste. She made the shrouds, and things like that, as I understood it. She was on her way to church one Christmas morning, and stopped in a neighbor's house, a widow, and said to this friend she was Irish, I guess—"Oh, please give me some water." And before she could get the water, she dropped dead, right at the door.
CG: This is your great-aunt?﻿73
JS: My great-aunt. Oh, my family's had it.
Mary Elizabeth died suddenly.. What they call.... ..indigestion, which was after eating green apples, right out of Frederick Douglass's yard. "A few years later, Julia Luke married Hamilton S. Smith of Boston, and Agnes and Ella were modistes who married Henry Roberts and John Bishop. From the union of Ella and John were Helen and Lillian Bishop, of Baltimore, Maryland, home of the family. I gave you Helen's name, Helen Bishop?
CG: Yes.
JS: She married Aloysious Cuyjet—that's a mouthful. A-L-O-Y-S-I-O-U-S.
Cuyjet. And moved to___Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. C-U-Y-J-E-T. Also
with some French blood. One of the old families. "Moved to Philadelphia and had four children, two daughters and two sons," all doing well. Do you want to know what they're doing?
CG: Oh, yes.
JS: Lillian graduated from public school, studied art...graduated from college.
She married Henry Bailey, had three children. Henry graduated from college. They let him finish, and then he had to go into the armed services, so he preferred the air force, and now he is lieutenant colonel in the air force, and in July he's being sent to the Pentagon. He will return from Iceland, where he was sent for one year on special assignment. He will have returned to America, and he's being sent to the Pentagon for three years.
CG: He is the one who sent you that book on Iceland that you showed me.
JS: Yes, that's the one. And that's Lillian's son. Her daughter, Carmeleta, C-A-R-M-E-L-E-T-A, Carmeleta Bailey, married Fred Banks, and she has three children. Henry has two, two boys. I can't keep track of my relatives. And John, unmarried, and lives at home. That's Lillian's family. And I said Henry that's married and has two children, I don't know his wife's single name, so that doesn't matter. And John the youngest is Lillian's son.
Helen B. Cuyjet, the next daughter Cornele, is Helen Cornele, unmarried, and has been in special services of the armed forces of the United States government in Europe, in America, and in the Pacific area. At present she's in America, for she just returned two years ago. She's been all over... In Europe, special assignment. She is very, very capable, and she wanted to get out when she came back from Europe on vacation the last time, but they said they had nobody who could do her work. Now, Cornele has had a very, very interesting life. She likes her work. She works with the soldiers, and she's considered to be very fine. And at present she has, I think, two more years before she retires. She expects to live in New Hampshire.
CG: She'll be close by.
JS: Now that's___Aloysious is a dentist, and son of Helen Bishop and Aloysious
Cuyjet.
CG: Now this is Aloysious who married your cousin Helen Bishop?﻿74
JS: No. Aloysious is my cousin. He married and has three sons, all college graduates.
CG: This is Aloysious Cuyjet?
JS: Aloysious Cuyjet. And he's brother to Lillian, Huffman is her married name, who has these three children I just told you about. They're the people I just visited in Chicago.
These are my Aunt Ella's children. No. Helen and Lil were my Aunt Ella's children, and these are Helen's children. Aunt Ella's grandchildren.
CG: Oh, I see. I thought these were Lillian's children. I'm sorry. They're Helen's children.
JS:	These are Helen's children.
CG:	Okay. And Helen is the person who passed away in 1972.
JS:	Mmmm. Whatever year it was.
CG:	And so Helen was the person who married Aloysious.
JS:	Yes. Got that straight?
CG:	This Helen, Helen Ella is her name. Right.
JS:	Yes. No. That's Bishop, isn't it?
CG:	Helen Ella married John Bishop. Then gave birth to Helen and Lillian.
JS:	Now she had a daughter named Helen.
CG:	Right. Who's the teacher in Baltimore.
JS:	Yes. It's her daughter who married Aloysious and went to Philadelphia. Now these... Got that straight?
CG: In other words, she left her job in Baltimore and moved to Philadelphia with Aloysious.
JS: Yes. Her daughter married and went to Philadelphia to live, and she married Aloysious Cuyjet. Now she had four...I'm all... Now, wait a minute. I'm talking about Aunt Ella's family. Now this is Helen, and... let me see. Helen Cornele is unmarried, and served in the armed forces in Europe and Asia, and now in America. The next one is Aloysious B. Cuyjet, in the family, and he is a dentist, graduated from Temple University. All of them have college degrees. And he's practiced dentistry in Jersey and now is in the Catskill Mountains practicing dentistry. And John is married. A1 had three sons, Dr. Al, the dentist. Call him doctor, and that distinguishes him. And he has three sons, all college graduates. One an M.D., now in Africa for a while. I can't keep up with them. The next one is John, named after his grandfather, John Bishop. No, greatgrandfather. Ella Bishop's husband...
CG: ...grandfather.﻿75
JS: Helen Bishop Cuyjet's husband was named Aloysious. Yes. He was living in Philadelphia, employed in the U.S. government, and has four children, two sons and two daughters—three married. Now I think that is enough of that family.
CG: Now, Lillian's children are Henry and Carmeleta?
JS: Yes. And John. John is home. Another John.
CG: John is not married either.
JS: No. John's not married. Lives at home in Maywood, Illinois. Now I think I've got that straight. Too many of the same name. I know it, but when I get talking about it, it's something.
CG: Everybody in the family's proud of everybody else in the family. They keep naming everybody after each other.
JS: That's just it. Nobody ever named Julia. I'm a Protestant, see. They're Catholics.
CG: [laughs] And that's from the French side of the family, the Catholicism?
JS: Yes.
CG: Oh. So your mother was Catholic before she married your father?
JS: Yes. But she allowed his children to be Episcopalians. I don't know
whether you'd call her Catholic or not. She was a Christian. The family never showed any ill will toward my father, who was an Episcopalian, and she was very broadminded. I don't ever remember my mother attending the Catholic church. My mother's aunt was sister to her father, who had married...
CG: Wait, wait, wait. Your mother's aunt was a sister...
JS: ...to her father.
CG: To your mother's father.
JS: Yes. She was Mary Brooks.
CG: Oh, I see.
JS; He was John Brooks, and he had two sisters, Mary and Louise. Mary lived
in Baltimore, and married a man by the name of Jacques. This is very important. j-A-C-Q-U-E-S, Jacques...more French. And Mr. Jacques was the first caterer, colored, and probably the first, in Baltimore City, and used to serve in receptions for the wealthy people, for the diplomatic corps and the White House, and possibly some members of Congress in Washington, D. C. When he served the White House and the diplomatic corps, he didn't have to take his silver.. All he did was to send his waiters with the food. There were no caterers in Washington at that time. And he has a grandson named Jacques Hall, who is living in Washington now.
CG: Jacques Hall?﻿76
JS: They lived in Baltimore. And my Aunt Mary, my great-aunt, carried on the business after her husband died, until she lost her sight, and went blind. She was a fine looking woman. I can see her now with her silver hair curled around her neck. A man by the name of Hughes bought the business. They carried on the business until he died. His daughter carried on the business until, oh, the 1930s or '40s.
CG: The business survived the depression.
JS: Yes. And their specialty was frog legs, terrapin, soft-shelled crabs...
CG: Mmram, I love soft-shelled crabs.
JS: ...and a pudding, which they call monkey pudding, similar to plum pudding, but not as rich, served with hard sauce. And what else, I don't know. Anything else that they wanted that goes with specialties. And their grandson is named Jacques. They had, I don't know, five or six children, and no boys, as I remember. There was one of the sisters married and had a son, but I'm not going into that. But there were about five children from this Mary Brooks union. One of the grandsons has a top job in the Internal Revenue office in Washington. He's a great-grandson, 'cause his mother's a granddaughter. And she married a man who had seventy-five acres of land in Maryland. A successful farmer. He trained thoroughbred horses
for the racetrack___made a lot of money. His name was Basil Hall. Her
name was Alice Mitchell. She was a granddaughter of Aunt Mary Jacques.
There's some others that are living. There's some family in York, Pennsylvania. They have summer homes up at Oak Bluffs. And Alice Hall had three children, one girl and she's married, and she has three or four children. I don't know how many. That isn't important. The important part is that the father had this large farm, and that he trained thoroughbred horses for the racetrack. He was educated. Died just two years ago. And she now is in a home for aged. That I think about concludes my mother's family.
So you see, they have all done something. They all carried on. In the early days, they all had some kind of business, and in the latter days the women were teachers. Carmeleta, who had married Banks, she taught school, and Lil educated all her children. A1 educated all of his children. They all had education. Everybody in my family has been educated, and they all have, all these young ones have graduated from college. My generation up to the present generation.
CG: You established a fund also. You established a fund at a school, also, didn't you?
JS; I established a fund in Howard University, in memory of my father and brother, known as the Hamilton S. and the John J. Smith Fund. Out of my meager—what'11 I say—meager savings, I make a contribution every year to the university, bearing interest finally (at first it didn't), not to be used till after my death, for medical research or medical purposes to help allay suffering of human beings. Oh, it might be cancer, then, it might be diabetes. Heart seems to be taken care of now, with open surgery. But it might be epilepsy, which seems to be on the go, or it might be kidney. That seems to be developing. I'll leave that to the medical people. But I hope to get to Howard University to talk with them before I die. I hope I'm getting better, but﻿77
JS: (cont.) for the last four years I've had it. I've been to death's door three times.
As for travel, I feel it is the best type of education possible, and I take advantage of every opportunity to see things and places and people. My greatest and most thrilling adventure was the unusual, delightful, enlightening experiences I enjoyed on a world trip. This seemed to me to be divinely planned, for I had not given it any serious thought. A well-educated lady, who came to Boston as executive secretary for the Department of Education of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, Dr. Olivia P. Stokes... some years later she had a tour group going to Japan for the fourteenth conference of Christian education. We became friends, and she spoke about the planned trip, but I was not interested, because I was concerned about the possibility of perhaps losing my home, which is located in a residential area, because of a possibility of an inner belt road coming through the Boston University Bridge, through my street, which was almost direct to Somerville. I felt I should remain at home to watch developments, as I had no one to look after my affairs and my home, and protect my interests. Five weeks later, the city officials announced that they wouldn't do anything more about the beltway until October. My friend had called me up to tell me she was going away, that she would be back by such-and-such date. In the meanwhile, I said, "You have just called me in time, because I'm going away tomorrow for a couple of days down to my summer place." And I left with the impression that I'd see her off on her trip.
While I was away, I took along with me my Cambridge paper that had been delivered, put itin my little bag, and I took my trip down, which was forty miles, on the Kingston Bay, where my neighbors all welcomed me. Finally, on Saturday, I read the paper when they said they were going to do nothing later. Then I went to sleep, and out of a clear sky, I woke up with a dream, a voice saying to me, "Go on that trip. It's the opportunity of your lifetime." I paid no attention, went on back to sleep. I woke up around five o'clock in the morning, the sun brightly shining outdoors, and the same voice came back to me. I'd never had such an experience. I said, "Now, this means something to me." And I got up at my usual time, got my breakfast, and this friend had said she'd come up, who had made an engagement for the next day, somewhere. So when she came, I told her that something had developed, and that I had to go home. I made up my mind to return and catch my friend before she left. She told me about where to go to get the injections and my picture, and so forth. Then I went to the travel agent, had my picture taken, I got my smallpox taken care of, and the doctor wanted to know how he'd get those in. "I'll tell you. You tell me how many I have to have. I'll tell you how to do it." And she had sent me to the doctor, for she knew he would have the serums or whatever it was that they have that...I had to have. Then I called a friend of mine, as I had to go and get my passport.
And I called this friend, and she said, "Well, yes, I'll meet you tomorrow morning." I said, "No, I have to have it this evening." She said, "Well, there's nobody in the office; my husband is out. Until he comes back, I can't leave the office, but if he comes, I'll hop a cab and I'll come down." I said, "It closes at five o'clock, and I'll wait here for you." Five minutes of five, she bursts in, and we transacted the business—the identification that I was the person, and so forth. The travel agent took care of it, and took care of the visas, and brought me my visa and passport the night before I left. All of this was accomplished in less than three weeks, and I was off﻿78
JS: (cont.) on the plane. I had no desire to ever travel on a plane. But never gave it a thought, had no fear.
CG: It was your first plane trip?
JS: First plane trip. I didn't ever want to go on planes. I'd had friends who had been to Chicago and Denver, and wanted me to go with them. "No, I'm not interested. When I travel, I'll travel down on the earth in boats or trains or buses."
But however, I found myself on the plane two weeks and two days later. I thought I'd be afraid, but I guess I was too excited and thrilled, and everything had happened so fast, that I didn't even realize it. I had absolutely no difficulties, and everything went just as smoothly as though I had planned it...travel by air my first trip, and it was thrilling— flying above the clouds, over the mountains, the deserts, the plains, the lakes, the rivers, and the cities. I had a view that's indescribable.
My first stop was in Chicago, Illinois, where I spent an evening with my cousins, whom I have just recently visited...and on to Los Angeles. Everybody was nice to me, and in Los Angeles I was met by my cousin, Mary Smith Clay, that I haven't mentioned before, who had been born in Pittsburgh and reared in Pittsburgh, and was conducting one of the finest private nursery schools—it had two sessions—in Los Angeles. She met me, and she took me for a ride. A friend of my mother who lived in Baltimore when my mother was there, had moved to Brooklyn, and then she moved to California; she had met my cousin. She was an older woman, of course. I knew her, and she had visited in Washington, and I had invited her to a Brownie Club meeting that I belonged to. I only belonged to two social clubs, because I got so the thing didn't interest me much. I wrote her and told her that I would be in Los Angeles and that I would see her—I gave her the dates. She calls up the hotel and cancels the reservation at the hotel, and has me come and stay with her. So my cousin called her up, and asked her, would it be all right if she kept me until evening, because she wanted me to meet her husband, and they took me to dinner, to Disneyland, and all... saw all of Hollywood. And another friend who just recently visited me, one that was here yesterday, to Forest Lawn, where I saw two of the most gorgeous pictures of the crucifixion and the resurrection of Christ. A marvelous place, it has glass windows in it, and the Last Supper. I had a very lovely visit, and my friend was very kind to me. She and her husband were elderly. He was not too well. I returned to the hotel the day that I was supposed to meet the group, and we were off on our flight.
CG: What did you think of Disneyland?
JS: Oh, it was fantastic.
CG: 'Cause I've only been there once.
JS: Just fantastic. And I had a motor trip seventy-five miles down the Pacific Coast to see a friend of mine who was a former Bostonian. And I stopped on my way and dipped my feet in the Pacific Ocean. And as I say, I made hay before I left on our trip. I visited twenty countries, and all over Asia, Africa, Europe. There were twenty tourists from all over the country, and at the hotel in Los Angeles, they had a party for us, the travel people. The night before we left, we all got acquainted, and we kept together for﻿79
JS: (cont.) two weeks in Japan, which was a very lovely experience.
CG: Didn't you stop in Hawaii on the way to Japan?
JS: We stopped at Guam—that's just for refueling—-and then we stopped at
Hawaii, and Sheldon Bishop, whose father was minister of one of the largest Episcopal churches in New York City, well thought of—Reverend Hutchins Bishop, who was a cousin to my cousins, the Bishops and the Cuyjets— so I had a chance to say hello to him, as he was tied up in meetings there. In Hawaii, two Hawaiians got on, and they brought leis in and placed them around the necks of all of us Americans. We had a very lovely trip from Hawaii to Japan. Of course, Hawaii is the playground of the Pacific. And I was sorry that I couldn't have seen more of it, but you take what you can get and be grateful for it. So the trip to Japan was interesting. Of course, you're up in the air. The meals were very appetizing on the planes, and very kind and attractive hostesses, usually on all the planes that I've ever been on—two weeks in Japan, including one week of a sightseeing tour, throughout the beautiful country. Oh, it was lovely. And the cities were interesting, the people and the gardens were lovely.
CG: Which cities in Japan did you see?
JS: The people were small and dainty. They were kind and very polite. Many of them understood English, and the industries showed great artistic ability. They're the cleanest people. There weren't many sidewalks, and it was hot, so they sprinkled from a pail, water to keep the dust down. And the homes were so clean that you could sit and eat on the floor. Of course, most of the Japanese tables—they're short people—and the tables are about the height of our ordinary dining room chairs, and many of them sit on the floor at these tables. And of course they use chopsticks, which I could not get used to, but they were used to travelers, so they always had other tableware, cutlery. The young people had adopted the western clothing, but the older people still wore their kimonos. The kimonos were gorgeous and expensive. They, like everybody else, had learned to know that the Americans had money, and when you went by, they of course would charge you two and three times the real value of the article. But I was impressed with the Japanese love for beauty, and their respect for family ties. I can't say what's happened now, but at that time the young people had the highest respect for older people.
CG: Now what year was this?
JS; 1958. So, some time has passed, and we have this social revolution, and
of course, Japan is being hurt just like everybody else. It's the leading country at that time of the Pacific area. Of course, now China has come into the world, in a different way from which it was. Of course, China is one of the oldest countries in the world. People haven't appreciated the ability of the Chinese, so now of course, you might look to Peking to become one of the leading cities of the world.
But Japan, the people are smart. I had noticed in Washington during the war, and around in the parks and places where you wouldn't expect them to be,with their books and papers and drawings and so forth. And they, I guess, know more about America than the American people know about themselves, because, as I have grown older, I have realized that some of the things that I think﻿80
America should have put stress on, in their schools, they have ignored or just given a smattering.
Everywhere people seem to have known the English language. You had no trouble in being understood. They spoke their native language, and they maybe knew two or three languages. But in America, until recently, not much stress has been given to foreign languages, nor to their habits and what the other countries stood for. So that was a revelation to me. I wish that I had been younger.
They learned a great deal from America, and they had a lot of American customs that they were following. They had hotels and they catered to the Americans. The hotels were well equipped, served meals a la carte, and you could get American cooked food. Clean as they could be, and everybody was as courteous as they could be, which made its impression on me. We traveled through these various countries, and in the temples I was impressed. Every three years, the same city, I'll say, sends students to these temples.
And when I was there, we went to one of these temples in Kyoto. And they had these students, and the teacher was with them. Not one sound from one of those forty children in line. They were into that temple—and the people in the area, to worship Buddha—and not one person who was in that temple to worship, at least I found on the temples that I visited, moved a muscle. They went there to worship their God, who was Buddha, and Buddha was everywhere. He was on top of buildings, he was in pictures, and he was revered everywhere...and in the temples, all sizes, all materials, and all colors. I mean, you know, according to whatever the material was that the Buddha was made of. Not one sound—they didn't know whether there were two tourists or fifty or a hundred. They weren't interested. They went there to pray.
I couldn't help but think, in the American churches, regardless of denomination—and through my lifetime, 1 have visited Congregational, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal [which is what] I am, and Catholic churches—I have found that somebody coughs, they're praying, but they turn around to see who's coughing. Somebody comes in late, a board cracks, they're turning around. And I observed that these people had gone into this church to worship; they were worshipping their God, which is Buddha, and that impressed me. Whoever Buddha is, and whatever he means to them, has done something for them,because they radiated in their lives at the time I was there.
I was pleased with Japan...their cleanliness. We landed in Tokyo, and that was our place, and we stayed in two hotels in different parts of Tokyo. At the time I was there, you were safe on that street at midnight as you were in the daytime. Nobody molested you. They had trains that ran on schedule, and they were the cleanest cars I ever saw. And they had automobiles of various sizes and various prices, according to the cab that you rode in.
We had a bus that took us to this building, where they were having this religious conference. The speeches were wonderful. The people had come from Africa and Australia and Europe, and some of the people from Africa were in their native costume. Nothing like we see here today. I saw no hairdos over there from East Africa. Not too many of them, but they represented Christians in Africa. Long before this recent liberation of﻿81
JS: (cont.) the Africans, because at that time there were very few African
countries that were free, they were under the rule of Austria and French and English, and were being persecuted, as of course is the custom of the white man to get control and try to take everything away from the people, as he did the African he brought into America, and made a slave out of him. Many objected and jumped in the ocean rather than be a slave.
So I found all of them very lovely, the speeches were splendid, I enjoyed them, and Japanese were interesting to the Christians, and of course, our country had bombed part of Japan, and we weren't allowed to go there, because the radiation was still bad. But there was an Episcopal minister who became interested in two or three of us, being kind...and this lady and myself, one evening after the lecture was over—I don't know what had happened, but we went to the place where the bus stopped, to take us back, and the bus left us. Nobody realized it until they'd got there, we weren't on the bus. And of course, these Japanese didn't know anything about it, and she was very upset. I said, "Well, there's a train goes into Tokyo," so I said, "we'll at least get to Tokyo." Now I know the name of the hotel, so I said, "Don't get upset. God's going to take care of us. Where's your religion?"
So while we were walking, I asked somebody where the station was to the elevated, and they told me. Before we got there, here comes this minister, and he said, "Ladies, ladies, what's the trouble? Where're you going? I thought you were on the bus." She's too scared to death. I said, "We thought we were getting the bus, but the bus has left us, and we're going in to Tokyo on the train. We don't know the way, but I'm sure somebody at the station can tell us what station to get off at." Well, you couldn't pronounce the Japanese name. It was that long—"De-de-de-de-de." Never did get to pronounce it. So he said, "Well, I'll show you, I'll show you. I'll get your tickets for you." And we gave him the money, and he got the tickets, and he saw us on the train. Just as they're about to shut the door, he comes running in the train, saying, "Oh, I'll go with you. Afraid you'll get lost, afraid you'll get lost." And he took us to Tokyo, and walked, I guess it was about two blocks, to the hotel. He was going thirty miles the other way, we were going twenty miles the other way, just to show you how polite they were. And the funny part of it...
CG: Very considerate.
JS: ...when we left, [laughs] two ladies said, "Where have you been, Miss Smith?" I said, "I don't know, I was around here looking at something. You know me. I just like to see what's about." She said, "Yes, but Reverend So-and-so is about to go crazy around here hunting for you. He's your boyfriend." I said, "Oh, is he? I didn't know that." He had one flower in his hand, a gardenia, and a package of paper napkins, with about ten or twelve napkins in the package, that he had been selling, to get money to rebuild his church that had been bombed. That was his going-away gift to me. And they teased me terribly, but that didn't matter because we were leaving the next day.
So our trip was very, very nice. The convention was interesting, and I shall never forget those lovely people and the pleasant experiences I had. There was a young man that was interested... A young fellow, in his teens, who was in the university, and he offered his services as a guide, and one day he asked me if I would like to see the university. "I hear you're a teacher?"﻿82
JS: (cont.) I said yes. "I'd like to come to America. Can't come unless somebody sponsors us. Would you sponsor me?" I said, "If I'm living," but I said, "you know, I'm an elderly person." Well, anyhow, I went to the university, and everything was modern, and every place I went was spotlessly clean. I was impressed. So our visit came to an end after many pleasant episodes.
While I was in Japan, I had a birthday. I asked the cook to make some special dessert on this day. And then I announced, "Our dessert is my gift to you. This is my birthday." It was nice, and everybody was nice. I still hear from one of the ladies who lives in Dalton, Massachusetts, who was on the trip. And of course, Dr. Stokes and I are still friends. She's in New York. So we left the group, and they were to come back to America, and go back to their own countries. But the group that Dr. Stokes had brought to Japan returned to America, while she and I left them in Japan to take the plane; we boarded the plane, and we were off to Hong Kong.
CG: Ah, so you went to Hong Kong?
JS: Yes. So we were not allowed to get into the mainland of China, but we went to Hong Kong, which is the trading post, and those people know it, and they exploit the tourists. I didn't have that kind of money, and I just didn't want the things. I did buy one ring, but it didn't, didn't last. My friend, oh, she bought a sari in India, she bought everywhere. But I'll tell you an experience in Hong Kong. We were across the river in Kowloon, and we just took a ferry boat over to Hong Kong.
CG: Oh, Kowloon.
JS: Yes. You asked me where I'd been. As I talk, I'll remember. It was an
interesting city, and I was impressed. The British were in control there. They had a building with, which looked like the letter H and L, and a narrow walk about the size of an ordinary walk around it. These families that had escaped from mainland of China to get out of the Communist rule, and the poorer people, and they were in this building. These missionaries, a husband and wife from Britain, took us through—they had two rooms. There was a courtyard in the middle of it, and no refrigeration, smelling of dead, decayed vegetables—it was terrible. The children were given cups and little cards to get a cupful of milk. They had never had any milk till they had that milk center right across the street. I saw that, which was interesting. The children went to get some food. And the mothers were on the steps waiting to pick it up as they brought the food in. Then they had a little school, and they were the sweetest little children you wanted to see. The children were just so hungry for love. They sang for us, and when we left, they were all full of smiles, and they recited. You just felt like you'd like to take an armful and bring them back where they could have a chance to live.
Now in the main street, these refugees had come—a street I'd say, similar to Commonwealth Avenue. These refugees had sent or bought their benches that they had when they managed to escape. They were allowed to put these to show by day; they could sell their arts and crafts. And at night they slept on these things that they brought. They had started a YWCA, and I was interested in that; it had just started, but they at least were trying to do something for the people. We were taken out to dinner, a Chinese﻿83
JS: (cont.) dinner, where they had American food if you wanted it.
We went over to Hong Kong one day. We went in the shops, and my friend bought some material; I didn't buy anything. I had clothes; I wasn't going back to Hong Kong, if anything was wrong, then I was that much out, as I wasn't earning anything...living on a little pension. There was a man, a very wealthy man who had made his money off of a salve or something that was called Tiger Balm, similar perhaps to Cuticura or Alka Seltzer. I know the story of Alka Seltzer. A drunk went in a drug store in Baltimore and had this headache, asked the druggist to give him something for the headache, and this druggist mixed up this and gave it to him, and that relieved his headache, and he kept coming back, so finally this man made this mixture, called it Alka Seltzer, and that's where the Alka Seltzer came from.
So this man made this stuff and it was a cure for all ills, and he had that mountain—or maybe it was there, I don't know the whole story—but it was called Tiger Balm, where this little Chinese boy was a guide. This mountain was cut out like the caves in our country in different parts. Well, I was tired. I'd been in caves, and I'd been up mountains, so I went in a small part of the mountain, but it was high, so I said to my friend, "You go on through. I'm going back by myself and get the fresh air." She had bought some things for souvenirs. I had just bought a couple, but she had twenty or thirty dollars worth. And the sun came where I was, and I moved. Now I didn't have a thing in my hand but my little handbag, and this little bag, whatever it was. I moved over to the other seat; I was minus a package, and I didn't know what happened. When she came back, she said, "How are you?" I said, "Don't ask me." I said, "Something terrible's happened," and I told her. I said, "I'm ashamed to look you in the face, but," I said, "I'll pay for..." I said, "You can't go back, but maybe you can find something else some other place, and I'll pay you." "Oh," she said, "that's all right. Those things happen." So the little boy overheard the conversation—shows you how slick they are. When we started down our little mountain, he went ahead of us, and before we got out, hid the package, and we have never known where he got it, and he never would tell. Now, whether he picked that package when I left her and she didn't notice it, I don't know, but she got her package, and that was quite a relief. But Tiger Balm was dedicated in the memory of his wife for the people of China to visit, and they could go there, anybody could go in, you didn't have to pay any fee or anything, and the little that I saw was just like some of the things that you'd see in caverns.
I let her go because I still wanted to get around the world. So that was Hong Kong. And the American church was doing a very nice job there, as I saw it, but not as much as I think they ought to do, and for a long time the missionaries aggravated the people. When they found out that Christian people were human beings, they became more docile to the...and accepted the missionaries. But it's a long tough struggle for human beings.
CG: How did you like the different foods? Did you try the different foods while you were there, at these places?
JS: No,I didn't eat too many different foods. My friend, who was an M.D., white, very good friend, lived in Milton, told me to be very careful of foods, and unless the water was boiled, I didn't drink any water. I took little boxes of raisins, because they have iron in them, also I took these little packages of soup, you know? Little squares, chicken and beef.﻿84
CG: Bouillon.
JS: Yes, bouillon. And I'd ask for a cup of water, and I'd drop one of those in there, for I always explained I had a little stomach trouble. Well, I did. I had a little ulcer, duodenal ulcer years ago, and I hadn't had any trouble, so after my brother died, the doctor asked me, Did I have any trouble from ulcers? He said, "Well, you know, the physicians always say, 'There's no cure for ulcer.' But I think maybe you can say there is." I was very careful of what I ate. I wasn't hungry, as we were on the move too much anyhow, [laughs] But food was plentiful, real plentiful. We didn't know anybody in Hong Kong. She'1 knew the missionary, because of course, she had a Ph.D. in religious work, and had had contacts with these people, so she knew them. Everywhere we went, she had some contact, see? Which made it very much nicer for tourists than you would have been with a group that just runs you through from place to place hurriedly.
CG: ...like a machine.
JS: Yes, and people pushing you and some of them very rude.	So I enjoyed it,
and she was very lovely and very nice to me, and she was	forty-some years
my junior—I was in my seventies then—and very kind and	nice to me. We
spent three months together, and we're still friends, so	I think that speaks something for us...
CG: Yes.
JS: ...because we had to share the same room. We had separate beds, and to be
sitting on the plane next to somebody, you know, almost forty thousand miles, including everything. Let me see...
CG: You were going from Hong Kong...
JS: Well, I told you about the foul odors in the British...
CG: In Hong Kong.
JS: Yes. That was in Kowloon; we didn't get to the mainland. Now you can get in there.
And when you see the people, or at least when I saw the people throughout the world, somebody asked me, What was my impression? I said, "People are people everywhere. They're good and bad everywhere." But I said, "I have found out in most of the countries I visited, I sensed a sense of unity that I don't feel in America because," I said, "we are not united. We have people coming here who enjoy all the privileges of our country, but they know of all the tricks of the trade, and take advantage of the jobs and all of the free things. They get in on the government, they don't know what you can stand for, but because it's a political thing, and they can make some money." I said, "We find ourselves now with people in authority that no longer are interested in making our country what it should be." I said, "America is the greatest country in the world, the richest country in the world, but it's on a toboggan slide, and it's going to happen..." The same thing that happened to Jerusalem, which was the richest country in the world way back before we ever had any record of years, destroyed in the twinkling of an eye. It comes to Greece, Persia, and Rome, all great empires,
* Olivia P. Stokes﻿85
JS: (cont.) crushed. France, now the British Empire... When I went and
studied geography, the sun couldn't set on the British soil. Now where is she? Fighting for her life. And I said, "Today who understands our foreign policy? Where are we going? What do we mean? We can be a friend, but we have to keep our eye on Russia. When we could have made Russia understand if she wasn't going to behave, and make her behave just like you make a child behave. Now it's too late."
So my experience was pleasant, and the ambition of a young boy to get sufficient money to come to the United States made me see the character of the people. They have a purpose in life. So much in recent years, since the fifties in our country, has been to get by, not to give service, not to give your best. Get a piece of paper, because you have to have that, which you call a degree or certificate for the kind of work one can do. Do as little as you can, get as much money as you can, but are not interested in your employer's welfare or your job. And I said, "I don't understand this, so now we've developed crime."
Well, from Hong Kong, we flew into India, crossing the big sea, and arriving in Calcutta, a very large city. And found India a land of great contrasts. There are wealthy people in India, and they traveled everywhere we went. The men were in American dress, like our men dress. Most all of them were handsome people. They had a beautiful color skin...some of them olive, yellow, and straight hair...beautiful. The women's heads were full of hair, and usually black. And in traveling, the women had all sorts of handsome silk, fine material, saris. Saris included six or eight yards, which they wrapped around them. And they paid no attention to anybody. They didn't notice the tourists. Their hands and arms were full of jewelry, exquisite rings, with all kinds of precious stones. I mean stones, I don't mean glass. I mean the real stones, the emeralds, diamonds, rubies, and garnets...gold bracelets of all descriptions, not plain gold, but all embossed...beautiful... earrings, breast pins, so forth. You couldn't help but be impressed with those Indians.
You ride in Calcutta, and it made my heart ache. On the way to the hotel from the aiport, I never saw such human beings. They tell me they came from the countryside for work. There was no work. I can see one man now. He was one shade off from being a skeleton. He was so thin. It was hot, and of course, the whole upper part of his body had no clothes on. He just had on some little pants around his abdomen area. He was so thin, that all you could see was this skin over the bones, and it looked like any minute he might be dying. Of course, they have the caste system there, and they didn't pay any attention to those who couldn't talk to them.
The educated Indian was very interesting, very interesting, and we spent one afternoon with a man who was in the air force, and in his home, which was very nice. That wasn't in Calcutta though. They had a YW in Calcutta that was trying to do a pretty good job, but no funds. Of course, they had their businesses. I wasn't too impressed, except for the poverty and the size of Calcutta.
I was impressed with nature. The most gorgeous palm trees, and the dates hanging down in bunches from these palm trees. Oh, they were gorgeous... and the flowers. I said, "Well, if they don't have anything else, nature has been generous to them, giving them beauty." But hot as it could be.﻿86
JS: (cont.) They listed the shrines, and we found the same kind of temples
that we found in Japan, and the people going there to pray and not paying any attention to the people who were visiting. I was impressed with how emaciated the bodies were of the people, the poor people, that you saw. The contrast to me all throughout India made its impression—the very rich, and then these awful poor. I remember having heard Mordecai Johnson speak one time here in Boston, when Gandhi had made a request of the United States for wheat. Of course, the United States had to refer it to Congress, and it had to go to some committee, and then to go to somebody else, so the upshot of it was, in the meanwhile, Russia sent the wheat. Gandhi said he wouldn't agree to the proposition that the United States offered. He would not sell his country out for a bushel of wheat. They were dying there every day, and if he couldn't be honest with his country, he was sorry, but they would have to die, because he wouldn't sell his country out to the United States. I heard Mordecai Johnson say that at a lecture at Ford Hall where I used to go often. It occurred to me then that India is crowded with people, no money, ^and of course, they didn't have the knowhow for agriculture. Now, of course, they're better.
We stayed in a YWCA building, which I enjoyed, mingling around with the visiting Indians, and it was different and interesting, and the women in charge were very, very nice. But the help was clanking around at various hours during the day, and woke you up early in the morning. The Indian people really are very beautiful. Their colors varied from very light to almost a mahogany brown, but not a wrinkle in their faces. I didn't see anybody there that appeared to be old. They all had smooth, young faces, and nobody with gray hair. They may have been there, but I just didn't happen to see them. Of course, in a short visit, you just get to the outstanding places. But they were charming, and pleasant. All of their hair was dead straight. As I said, I didn't see any gray-haired people. But their stature was small, like most of the Asian... Let me talk about the Taj Mahal.
CG: Oh, you saw the Taj Mahal.
JS: Yes. The most beautiful building I have ever seen—a tomb, which was built by a wealthy man. I say it's the most beautiful tomb in the world. It's on a ravine at the back of a road leading up to it. I have these pictures of a road leading up to this tomb, on either side are flowers. And the tomb is down—I don't know how many feet—below the surface of the floor. On the sides of the tomb, the building, are precious stones. I didn't see it in moonlight, but they say in moonlight it's gorgeous. But to see it in the daylight, and the sun shining on part of it, it's the most gorgeous thing in the world. To see these two caskets down in, way down in the bottom, deeper than any cellar in any house, way down, to look down at those two mahogany caskets, and see this gorgeous marble all around. I'll read you what it says. "The Taj Mahal, the most magnificent tomb in the whole world, was one of the greatest points of interest, especially for tourists. It was built of marble on top of a hill, with a deep ravine at the rear side." I told you that. "A cement wall bordered on both sides with beautiful flowers." The grass was as green and as beautiful as anything you ever saw. "And the columns of this..."
CG: Oh, here it is. I had put everything together.﻿87
"...gorgeous edifice was studded with the most precious jewels. In the interior there was a mausoleum of this rich Indian and his wife. He built it in memory of his wife. It is a sight one should never forget, for the grandeur is beyond description." I can see it now. It all comes back to me. However, it seemed to me so incongruous, when India has so much poverty, and so much suffering and deaths of thousands of people because of starvation that this contrast seemed to be more than ludicrous to me. That's the way it impressed me. So that's the Taj Mahal.
The Indian temples were magnificently, intricately architectural, with deep rich coloring, and wonderful carpets. It's amazing to think of all this beauty, and all of this poverty. I just couldn't understand it. And it has been there for centuries...for centuries. That little thing on the top of that writing desk, that little piece of ivory and marble, came from India— just to remind me. Their religion seemed to mean a great deal to them, but I just couldn't understand the difference between this gorgeous tomb—the mausoleum, they called it—and then to see all of this poverty. I visited Gandhi's grave. It wasn't a grave, a marker—a simple little thing, flat on the earth, which you walk over a thousand times and never notice. This rich man, with his mausoleum, and you had to ask where Gandhi was buried, only a simple stone, the marker.
Our next stop was at New Delhi, where we stayed in a missionary school. Every morning at six an Indian would tap on your door, which I didn't appreciate. He would come knock on the door and hand you some tea. I'm not a tea drinker. We saw the work of the school, and I was introduced to the members of the school. I found both old and new Delhi very fascinating. We were entertained in the home of a captain of the air force...a handsome couple. He spoke English fluently.
Each city had its special points of interest. We had an experience in India that I thought was interesting, which I will relate. My traveling companion was a Ph.D. in religious education, and her passport was marked as such... marked "Doctor." The Indians couldn't conceive of a woman being a doctor, and when we were scheduled for a flight, at the Indian transport office, they held up the passport, so we were not allowed to get on this plane to go up into Pakistan, unfortunately. So we had to make provision to go by train. We had to go back to the school and tell them our predicament, because it was getting toward night. So they helped us out and maneuvered, took us to the station, where we had to go by train. Well, such a station I have never seen. I can see it now—a huge place, not too well kept, with crowds of people, Indians, milling around. They were speaking Arabic, and other languages, so you couldn't understand a thing that they were saying. Our friend at the mission got us the tickets as we were traveling first class; she got us to the station. By that time it was nearly midnight. However, the trains were very different and very strange. Nobody to tell you where to go, you saw no conductors, no trainmen, nobody.
My friend walked ahead of me and I was a little behind her, and outside of these cars I saw boxes looking like our little outside mailboxes (it's all black), and I saw one that has a paper or something in it. I glanced up and I saw a slip. She was about a car ahead of me. I tried to catch the attention of the passengers coming, and I finally made them understand that I wanted to attract the attention of that lady that had on that pink dress. I had difficulty, but finally I got her and beckoned to her to come back. On this piece of paper—I wasn't tall enough to reach it, she pulled it off—﻿88
(cont.) I could see my name, and there was the place, the car that we were to get into. There were two handsome Indians standing on the outside talking, and crowd was going on and on. Well, nobody said anything, so we Americans jump in. We didn't say anything to the Indians, and they didn't pay any attention to us; they carried on their conversation.
This car on the outside looked like any cattle car in this country; on the inside, just ordinary wooden doors, not even polished, with locks and bolts, thick like you'd see on the freight trains. On one side where we entered was a long wooden bench, and across from that was another wooden bench, and on each side was a window. In the rear, near where you got in the door, was another wooden bench, and a door. My friend got in first, and took the bench on the side where we entered. I took the other bench. We had no luggage, except oar little handbag and a little airplane bag that had a raincoat in it, because it was supposed to be monsoon season.
After a while, one of these Indians got in and he sat on the bench facing us. My friend said she only wished she had her camera, because she said, "If I could have caught your expression." The doors were shut, and the bolts clanked terrifically. We hadn't seen a single soul, except this crowd that was passing, and they were not traveling first class, I want you to know. And this is midnight. We are going up to Pakistan. I was weary because we had been sightseeing and it had been hot. I was forty years her senior, and had got all upset because we were going by plane and shouldn't be where we were, long before, and then had to find a place where we could send a cablegram to these people in Pakistan to tell them that we had some trouble, and we're coming on the train.
And the train stopped. Such an experience. I'm glad I had it, but for a few moments it was very upsetting, and I sat there, half reclined, praying. Here's this strange man with two American women, Indian, in this car. And after he got in, he had one of these Indian bags that are... I always thought of carpetbaggers, where they would roll them over, you know. But they were long, oh, I guess they were about eighteen inches long. He sat down on his bench, he spoke. Of course, my friend had been to Europe, and she was young, I suppose, fearless, or thoughtless...no, she wasn't, she wasn't thoughtless, for she was highly educated.
Just fearless.
I guess she knew her way around. So I just lay there. He spoke, and I nodded my head and spoke- So he handed her a card, and she passed it to me, introducing himself. He turned out to be one of the outstanding merchants in India, and had come down to New Delhi on business. He exchanged a few words, and he unpacked this bag, opening it up. I'd been curious to wonder what these Indians were carrying around in these beautiful leather bags. Well, he opened it up. Guess what was in it—bedding. He made his bed on this'wooden bench. When he finished, he asked my friend if she would like to have some bedding. Of course, she accepted. I was supposed to sit up, poor old lady over there. So he said, "Would you like to have a blanket?" And me, my polite self, I said, "Well, I don't want to deprive you." "Oh," he says, "oh, no." So I got a blanket. I think she got a sheet. I didn't get a sheet, but it didn't make any difference, because I had my clothes on, and they stayed on. So he goes back and goes where the door opened, next to this bench, so he went in there, and I could see as he went in, I found out,﻿89
JS: (cont.) it was a utility room where they had a basin and a toilet. He
comes out with his American clothes off, in a white suit, which evidently was white pajamas and pants, a white suit, and he goes to bed.
We ride about two hours, when the train stops. "Toot, toot, toot." Almost threw me off the bench. And it stopped on my side where the window was. "Rap, rap, rap," pounding on the window like mad people, yelling out. Never heard so much noise in my life...and milling up and down on the platform, pounding on the door and yelling. I just slipped down underneath the window so they couldn't see me. I didn't know what was happening. Nobody said anything in our car. I didn't open my mouth, but I lay down below the window so they couldn't see me, whatever it was. If they were going to throw something, at least they wouldn't throw in my face. So that went on until they got the passengers on the train off. Then the train started up. He went on about his business, and everybody supposedly went back to sleep. Around five o'clock it stopped somewhere; he got out. He had gotten up and gotten dressed. All this, I'm looking, he not knowing I'm looking, see. My eyes half shut, and position that I think he looked in, that he was a perfect gentleman. He got out, and he said, "Ladies, would you like to have a cup of coffee?" I don't remember whether my friend took coffee or not. I'm not a coffee drinker, and I wasn't drinking coffee at some place I didn't know anything about. Anyhow, he got out and stayed a few minutes. Evidently he just had a little time at that place when he came back.
We rode for about an hour, he got himself together, and said that he was ending his journey. After we got started again, then I pulled myself up, and I said, "Excuse me, but will you tell me what all that noise was when we stopped at the station?" I said, "And they pounded on the window and the door." He said, "They were looking for American women for hostages." I was told that he was put in that car to protect the American women. Isn't that an experience? You can imagine how I felt in a train with a strange man,and two lone American women. And when he told me that, I said, "Well, I'm glad I had the experience because nobody would believe it." It was strange, and it showed me how the people traveled. That was first class travel, so they told us.
CG: Benches!
JS: Tough wooden benches! The hardest looking benches. We have better things in our parks...looked just like a cattle car. Well, we got to Pakistan. The next stop was the end of the trip- Our American friends were there at Pakistan. They turned out to be Benjamin Mapp who lived in Springfield, Massachusetts, and his wife, who were very nice. He was of the American intelligence officers, the first colored that ever had the job, and we were guests in their home...paying guests. Olivia took care of all of that. And they made us feel very much at home, and we saw Pakistan. They got the cablegram, and they were at the station, inquired about these Americans that were on the train. Oh, they didn't know anything about it in Pakistan. They were just about to leave the station when they spied a colored woman, who was me, whom they didn't know, but then they waited, and come to find out, we were the two colored ladies, for which we were grateful, because here we were in another country, and didn't know a single soul.
Pakistan was a very interesting place, and Benjamin Mapp had done a marvelous job there. They had had a white man there in the intelligence bureau, but we﻿90
JS: (cont.) understood that he had done a better job than the white man.
Because those are dark-skinned people, you see. All those people in that area, and the white people don't realize that at least two-thirds of the world are the dark-skinned people. Nothing special, but the trip, I really enjoyed. I was stunned. It happened so fast. I just didn't know what was happening. And there I was in a foreign country, in a foreign nation, altogether, with nobody speaking English. So that was Pakistan. And the only Americans we saw there was Benjamin Mapp and his wife. They showed us every courtesy, and we had a very relaxing visit as they were the only colored Americans or Americans we had seen on our trip. Therefore, we knew how these people lived, thought, and reacted toward Americans.
In spite of the depressed feeling we had towards the poverty, and the backwardness of the people and the country, I was uplifted by the beauty of nature. There were lovely date palm trees, with huge clusters of dates hanging from them, high above man's natural reach. There were also banana trees, huge cactus plants, which were the largest I have ever seen. I'm sure the people enjoyed nature's beauty, for the educated, rich Indians were dainty, lovely, beautiful people. Doubtless they also appreciated the grandeur of their religious edifices, where they worshipped faithfully.
The cow is sacred in that country, and we were on our way to our destination, when traffic was held up and jammed because a cow was crossing the street; Lady Cow decided that she'd take her time, and it made no difference whether you had a plane to meet, flight to take, or what, you waited until Lady Cow decided she'd get across the street, because it was a sin and a penalty to injure or kill a cow. So one dared to disturb the cow. Fortunately, we were not trying to make a plane flight. But it often delayed people who were on business. More and more I realize that people are people all over the world, regardless of dress, color, religion, or racial identity. It is honest, sympathetic understanding that we need before we can have harmony and peace. That's India and Pakistan.
Now our next trip was to Thailand, where we didn't stay any length of time, but we found out that they still had their mosques and they carried on the same sort of religion that we had found in India. Our stay in Thailand was very short, as I was taken sick there, which later on developed into a very nasty fungus infection, which I carried with me until I got into Europe.
Next we were off to Bangkok, another special Asiatic city...a typical Asiatic city. It is here that I purchased a half dozen coffee spoons, which got lost in moving.
Then we went by plane, across the Indian and Pacific Oceans to Cairo, Egypt, which is a very fascinating and ancient country—city and country. It has a great desert, and pyramids, which I entered. I went as high in the pyramid as I was permitted. I ventured to take a ride on a camel in the desert. I could not help marveling at how these great stone face monuments, situated... how that rock ever got there and had this face in it, has still been a mystery to me, and I haven't as yet had time to go and see if I can find more history about it, but I witnessed the rigors of time and the weather through these countries. It is in the midst of the Sahara Desert, and it's beyond description. It's a perfect place. Then, the only thing I've ever seen that reminds me was the Old Man in the Mountain up in New Hampshire. The﻿91
(cont.) great stone face, massive, attractive, naturally carved out of a huge rock was mystifying, and very impressive to me. One wonders how the ancient men accomplished the, transported the stones to the ravine in the desert.
Well, I'll go back to Egypt. Going to Egypt, my friend had to leave for a couple of days to make a lecture in Alexandria, when they found out she was there, so I stayed there and met some Egyptians, who took me sightseeing. I found Cairo, Egypt, a very interesting, big city. They had the museum. I saw the mummies, and I just wondered how the Egyptians had the knowledge to preserve bodies like they did. When you go into Asia and into Egypt, you marvel at the genius of the people. The carvings in Asia were beautiful, and the same thing with paintings, especially, in Japan, and the love that they had for beauty, and the perfection. When I look at our modern art, with a dash here and a line there, and that's so-and-so, and you look at it... I call myself with a little intelligence, I don't know what, I can't see a thing that it represents, but just a dash of paint of different colors, or different colored lines somewhere. May mean something to the artist who produces, but it certainly doesn't mean much to a person who hasn't been trained in that sort of art—I guess they call it.
But they had the most interesting thing in Egypt, which was the bazaar. The only thing in my life that the bazaar reminded me of was a three-block open market in Baltimore, known as the Lexington Street market, where they sold everything from paper pins or a pair of shoestrings to food of all kinds, and clothing, and this bazaar is one of the largest and most noted in the world. They had jewelry, beautiful jewelry. Egyptians are handsome people.
Those people in those southern foreign countries like India and Africa are various hues. When I was a child studying Africa—and didn't get very much except that Africans were savages- -we got the impression that the savages were killing one another, and that all the people in Africa were black. We got the impression that they weren't educated and didn't mean much, which of course, as I have become grown and studied history, I have found as being very false. It has a very bad impression to the earlier generations, because these people in these foreign lands that we have scorned and looked down on, have showed that they've had culture before America was ever born. China had culture before America was ever heard of.
This bazaar was most interesting to me, because everything was sold there. It was open in the air, of course. It was warn when I was there. The young man who was interested in the bazaar was related to one of the head rulers of Egypt. He became a little interested in my friend. I was amused, but fortunately it didn't amount to anything, because she's a religious person, and he was a believer of Mohammed, so of course, that wouldn't do...but very nice This Egyptian and his sister took me sightseeing while she was away two days on a lecture tour. I saw much of Egypt, which she didn't see. And this young man, who had his interest in the bazaar, has since died. He invited her to get a sail on the Nile River at moonlight, midnight. She invited me to go along. I said, "You know, when I left, I told you anytime you had an engagement, any young man wanted to pay any attention to you, you just forget about me. The hotel's there, and I can always find something interesting, and people are around, and I can talk to them." "I am not going unless you go." So this other young man who had been taking me was supposed to go with me. Well, he didn't turn up, and so I said, "Well, he hasn't come,﻿92
JS: (cont.) and I want you and—" whatever his name was— "to have a pleasant evening." She says, "I will not go unless you go with me." So I let them sit in the far end of the boat, and I sat in the back.
It was a three-mast sailboat on the Nile River, and I had never been on a boat, only with one sail, for a very short distance on the Charles River once. But this had three huge sails on it, and I got interested in watching them manage. There were two men working with these sails, and they had to shift them back and forth whenever the wind changed. So it was very interesting to me, and the Nile River at midnight was beautiful. It was blue as it could be. I did have one of the nicest trips in the world. I didn't interfere with my young friend; all was well, and I just let them have a nice little conversation, and she got provoked with me, because she thought I should have come up there with her. I said, "No, I've been young. There'd be no harm in him," I said. "He can't do anything on this boat. Now just go ahead and enjoy a nice little talk, and talk about the country, for he's invited you. I'll be your chaperone, but I'll be a chaperone in the other "part of the boat, and all's well." So we had a very lovely trip. I saw more how the boat was manipulated, the sails, than she did. She was on the other part of the boat.
I went into the desert and rode on a camel, and rode up to the pyramids, and went up into the pyramid as far up as they would let people go into the pyramid. And that was a wonderful experience.
CG: You actually rode on a camel?
JS: I rode on a camel. Yes'm. I wondered how these traders could go through
the desert with these camels, because riding was anything else but pleasant. They had the camels there for tourists, and they only went a certain distance. You wouldn't want to go very far, but you had the experience of riding on their hump. It isn't a journey that you would want to take to Providence— a camel's travel. But it was a new experience, and I enjoyed it because it made me appreciate what the early traders went through, and how these people who have made history and survived with the handicaps that they faced. When I look today at modern technique, I just wonder. We have made advancement, but I wonder if we're making the best of the knowledge that we have, when we are developing people who don't appreciate what they have, many of them. We have youth today who are not trained for jobs. If they are, they can't find jobs, and they're into trouble, and many of the families cannot, the fathers, if they are living with the wives, can't support the families. Many of the mothers are husbandless, so have to take care of the children; hence the children grow up in the streets. We just don't have the kind of society that we had years ago.
When I was a child, although I told you that I came from a family that was considered more or less fortunate, and I think they were comfortable, not rich, by no means—some of my friends' parents were financially much better off than my father—but we were all comfortable and had everything everybody else had. Maybe we didn't have as big a house, but we had ten rooms and a playroom. Even the poor people, their children were taken care of, and they were at home. Today, they're thrust into apartments with no place to play, and the mothers have to go out to work. The children go to school when they get old enough, with a cord around their neck with a key tied to it, to come home, to go to an icebox to get something to eat when they're hungry—even though they're serving lunch—before the mother gets in at four or five o'clock﻿93
JS: (cont.) at night. And many times they're not properly fed. I look to those people in other countries, and it seemed to me that their way of living in many ways was, to my way of thinking, more adequate than so many of the Americans are finding today.
It was interesting to go up into the pyramids, and to see how those people brought stone and built them. The desert is sand. There's nothing in the desert, and long spaces of area. There's a little oasis where there's a little green grass and a little bit of water, where the travelers on the camels would fill up their bottles to carry them to the end of their journey. When you think of those pyramids being built by men, and having stood all these centuries, the kings living, you just wonder at the ingenuity of man.
Cairo is a big city with a lot of big nice stores. I found the people very interesting. They had large mosques there, which almost served as universities, and the Persian rugs that had been there through the years, but they were still Persian rugs, and you would find the students lying on the floor with their books studying. And the glass windows were gorgeous, gorgeous. Those students paid no attention to them. They were studying. They were lying on the floor with their books, and you walking down through those mosques, some of them were huge places, and I can't describe the windows, the coloring, and the glass there. Oh, they were perfectly gorgeous. As I said, these Persian rugs...nowadays there are very few real Persian rugs. As time goes on, I guess they won't have any. And of course, most of the people today don't know the difference anyhow—imitation. The rugs, of course, had been there for years, but being Persian, and being woven as they were, they have stood the traffic, and ours don't stand traffic for five years, our carpets. There are not too many people who have Persian rugs. We never had the pleasure of having a Persian rug in our house 'cause we weren't rich enough.
Well, the stores were interesting, and expensive, the people were nice, and most of all that I saw were kind-looking people, with beautiful complexions, with various hues from light yellow down to mahogany. Their hair wasn't as black as the Indians' hair, but their hair was stripped, and I didn't notice any gray-haired people. And one thing that interested me, we were on the main street in Egypt, Cairo, and the Moslems, they're the predominant people... we were talking along, bells tolled, and these Egyptians, Mohammedans, at the sound of the toll of the bell, knelt down wherever they were and stood in the middle of the street; the traffic stopped, and that impressed me. I enjoyed my stay in Egypt.
I was determined to see everything while I was there, and to go and do all that I could, and the ride [on the camel] made me appreciate more than ever the hazardous and tiresome journeys of centuries, ages ago for the traders traveling through the desert.
CG: It must be an incredible feeling to just feel like you are plugging into history.
JS: It is history, and as I said, to go into the museum to see the mummies was quite a revelation. The Great Stone Face, and the sail on the Nile River, which I never expected. In fact, I never even expected to take this trip, and really had never planned it. I had always felt that I would like to go to Europe, but when it came to going to the Pacific, I'd never given that a thought.﻿94
CG: I did some quick mathematics. You were seventy-three years old when you were traveling on this trip. And you were riding a camel!
JS: I said, the sincerity of the Moslems interested me greatly. I just spoke
about the bells. Cairo is the largest city in the Middle East, and there's one... I said what fascinated me was the bazaars located away from the bustle and business of the city. You had to go to it. Everything was sold there, and even down to the desert flowers. Of course, my friend bought some jewelry. Her friend was in the business, and of course, it was genuine, of course. I had diamond rings, I had an amethyst, so I didn't have to buy.
CG: That is pretty.
JS: This one belonged to my Grandmother Smith; this one my father gave me when
I graduated. And I have an emerald with some diamonds around it so I didn't buy... Of course, she was young. There were multitudes of people trailing around in the bazaar, and they'd spend their money. Many of them were speaking Arabic, from different parts of Egypt, they'd come in to Cairo. Although I had studied some French and Spanish and German, I used my English language, but the young man and his sister who took me sightseeing, both spoke four different languages. I felt like a dumbbell, so I kept my mouth shut, I didn't say anything about being a teacher. I just felt embarrassed.
CG: Miss Smith, are you getting tired at all? Do you realize you've done three, almost four, over four hours' worth of taping?
JS: Oh, is it five o'clock? I've got a pain in the back of my neck. Well, I
guess I'll end up with Egypt. Now let me see. The archeological museum is one of the greatest in the world, and the collection is there. I mentioned about the mummies. I didn't say it was an archeological museum, which is important, I think. And one of the world's wonders are the mummies. The ten days we spent in Egypt went by very rapidly, and I shall always remember how fully they were, excitement and adventure. So we'll move on to Jaffa and to Tel Aviv at our next meeting, [break]
CG: You had just begun to talk about the desert and the pyramids.
JS: "The Great Stone Face, a massive structure, carved out of a huge stone was
mystifying and impressive. One wonders how ancient man transported the stone or how he got into the ravine in this desert." The sand is back of it, and there's this ravine down the bottom, and the stone is there. I haven't had time to look up and find out if the stone was there by nature, or if man brought, and that question has bothered me, but I have so many problems with personal illness, and family illness, trying to stay alive, that I haven't been able to do the research that I would like to do. But it's a huge thing. The Man in the Mountain is the nearest thing that I could remember having seen. But to see this, in this desert, with nothing but sand all around, and a space between the stone face and the desert was, oh, that wide, and this stone sitting there, with this ravine way down. Of course, nothing is beyond nature, because that's God's work. So the stone may have been there long before man was ever in that area, and probably the weather blew the sand away from the stone, and left the stone there. Just you marvel about the oasis being in the deserts at various spots, and that's the only way the traders got water, was to get to an oasis.
CG: Did you go inside any of the pyramids? Did you go inside any of them?﻿95
I went inside of the pyramids, as far as they would allow you. To think that the early emperors of that era lived in those pyramids, that's what was told to me. And they're beyond description. They haven't done anything to them. They're stone, and they're in these deserts. I think there are twelve—I'm not sure of the number—in the Sahara. But these are not very far from the city of Cairo. Fortunately I was able to get into one, and to see the Great Stone Face, which I considered one of the marvels of the world, along with the Egyptian museum where they have the mummies.
Their architecture is marvelous. Throughout the East and Mideast, I was greatly impressed with the love for beauty and the accuracy, perfection, of man's work. The carvings were beyond description in both wood and stone. Mahogany was found in that area, and marble, so the carvings were gorgeous.
Several exciting things happened in Egypt, which I will always remember. The museum is supposed to be one of the oldest in the world, and was very impressive. Cairo was a large and busy city, and everywhere I went there were mosques. In the streets when the bells tolled, Moslems stopped, paid no attention to who's on the street; if they were crossing the street, traffic stopped. They knelt right down in the middle of the street, or wherever the spot they happened to be on, in the sidewalk, and said their prayers. It impressed me, as they worship Mohammed. And I said, well, if Mohammed is their god, they certainly show apparently a great deal of reverence for their god, comparing them with Christian belief. I don't remember any church of any denomination where I have seen such complete devotion to a superior being as I have when I saw the people in the Far East and the Mideast worshipping Buddha and Mohammed.
The Egyptians are, as a rule, very fine looking people. They were of average size, a little larger than the Chinese and the Japanese, and very courteous— those whom I saw.
I walked through, not the whole extent of the bazaar, because there were other things that I wanted to see. My friend was deeply interested in jewelry, and the man who had charge of the bazaar was interested in her, but she was a Baptist, a confirmed Baptist... Employed by the Council of Churches, head of the Department of Education in Boston,Massachusetts. He was Muslim. Nothing happened.
That's Dr. Stokes.
Yes. But he was very nice, and extended the courtesy of inviting her for a moonlight sail on the Nile River.
Did you try any of the foods in Egypt? How did you like Egyptian or Middle Eastern food?
Well, I was very careful. I have had a duodenal ulcer years ago, and I was very careful of the food that I ate. In most places you could get simple food. They didn't call it always American style, but I picked out a few things, for I had to be very careful.
They spoke many different languages, and I was quite embarrassed, although I had studied Latin—I beg your pardon—German and French and Spanish. I had no occasion really to use them, so except for the French, I could understand a few words, but I had lost my ability to converse. However I even read a few of the signs. You had no trouble speaking the English language.﻿96
(cont.) There was always somebody who understood you. That impressed me, and until recently when we have developed more oceanic travel, and more airplane travel... People are getting about. Our schools now are beginning to give more courses in foreign languages, as we are sending representatives, they have to know the language of different countries, because they're meeting these various representatives and diplomats.
There were a few Christians there, and those that I associated with were Christian people, but the sincerity of the Moslems impressed me. I spoke about the bells, and Cairo is one of the largest cities in the Middle East— Mideast or Middle East, which we used to call it.
I was interested in learning how the people lived, and their philosophy of life. The one lesson I got was that I felt that people are people the world over. They have the same bodies, the same desires that all other people have. For many, it's a struggle for existence because of a large population and a lack of food, but I found people very human and understanding. They had their problems, as the Americans have theirs. I realize that God is the father of all people, regardless of nationality, race, color, creed. I regret today to see the world in, changing, and the turmoil that is existing, and nations fighting one another, people in a nation are fighting their brothers and sisters, when all of us are God's creatures, I just can't understand that.
Now, from Cairo, we went to Rome.
Didn't you stop at Jaffa and Tel Aviv before you went to Rome? Yes, that's what I was going to talk about now. Oh, okay.
Next, "The time was spent rapidly, and we found ourselves off in excitement for more adventure...off to Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Beirut, and Lebanon. I will not go into separate accounts, but the hotel at Tel Aviv was the most beautiful location. It was surrounded by lovely gardens in the courtyards, and on the other side was the lovely Mediterranean Sea. The view was very restful, the sea blue, and there were so many places of Biblical history in this area, including the churches, Mount of Olives, the Way of the Cross that Christ trod to Calvary, Old Jerusalem." And a bazaar there, of smaller size. We were taken by auto for many, many miles to the river Jordan, where I had the sign of the cross made with the water from the river Jordan, went to the Dead Sea, where they had discovered the scrolls. It was most interesting in Jordan. I was much impressed with that portion of the Holy Lands that I saw, and a bit shocked because after they had the skirmish in Jerusalem, after the United Nations separated what I had taught in my history as Old Jerusalem, where the Jews and the Arabs had lived side by side for years and years, they had this eight-day skirmish...
The Six-Day War?
No. They separated and gave the Arabs part of the land, and the Jews the portion where the University of Jerusalem is located. Quite a modern place where the scrolls from the Dead Sea are housed. In Jerusalem the Jews have done a marvelous job. One of the oldest YWCAs was in New Jerusalem...
I was telling you about the division of the old Jerusalem into two parts.﻿97
JS: (cont.) Jerusalem, as it's known today, New Jerusalem and Jordan. The
part that was given in Jerusalem to the Jews had a lot of vacant land, but they have taken care of that. From the time the Jews got control of that section, every time there was a death, they asked for a dollar to plant a tree. So they planted trees while we destroy trees. They know that if they plant trees, that helps the soil and the moisture. Then they irrigated the land. What I saw, they had done a marvelous job.
The Jews are united. They have been persecuted, and that's one thing I can't understand. They're God's people. Of course, history does not tell you that Christ was a dark Jew, for in that area the people are dark-skinned. I don't mean black, but they were dark, darker skinned than most Jews we see. But most of the portraits we have of Christ, they portray him lily white; also the Wise Men, one of them was dark. There's been a black madonna, but you don't see that often. I can't understand why the Jews have been all these years still suffering, when they're supposed to be God's people, who claim that they have the religion. Of course, Christ didn't start Christianity. Christianity was started by the Catholic church, as most students of religion admit. But I won't go into religion. That's not the point.
From Jerusalem we went over into Jordan, and we stayed at a YWCA in Jordan, or had planned to stay there, when we found somebody was looking for us. The telephone rang later, and someone asked to speak to my companion, Dr. Olivia Stokes. On the line was the brother-in-law of a young man whom Dr. Stokes had had in one of her classes in America; he had written to his mother, and told her that she was traveling, and would be in Jordan, to get in touch with us, and show us the sights of Jordan. These were Arabs. They were the Christian Arabs. They were the loveliest people I have ever seen in my life. They called up and said, "He will be there the next morning." This was the day after our arrival there. So we didn't stay at the YWCA. He came for us, and off we went. He brought his mother, and took our bags. He worked for the British commissar in Jordan. He went to work, and he turned us over to his mother. She got conveyance, cab, and took us sightseeing, and he came home from work, and for two days he stayed off from work and carried us to the river Jordan and to the Dead Sea, and to see the sights of Jordan. It's in Jordan that I saw much of the biblical history that I was familiar with: the Way of the Cross, Calvary, the Sepulchres.
CG: How did you feel when you saw these places that were from the Bible?
JS: I was so thrilled and overpowered, that I just don't know how to express it.
Going the Way of the Cross, when I saw the donkeys walking down...and then I thought of Mary and Joseph going to pay their taxes, and she riding on the donkey's back, what a trip that was for an expectant mother. When I saw this land that Christ had trod, I was awed; I just felt so guilty. I said, "I'm not worthy to put my feet on the soil where Christ has trod, because I'm so far below the man or the power that God placed in me, for I'm nothing without the spirit of Christ." And that was my reaction. But as time has gone on, I have felt it was a wonderful privilege. Saw the Sepulchre, and the well where he met the Samaritan...
CG: The Samarian woman?
JS; Yes, asked for a drink of water. These people, the father of these Arabs had﻿98
JS: (cont.) been killed in a skirmish, the mother was very hurt and felt the injustice, for they were the loveliest people I ever saw. You felt as though you had known them. They had a modern house; they were driven out of their home that they owned in Jerusalem, with the clothes on their back. They didn't salvage a thing, and it has never been settled. Israel, Jordan, and the League of Nations each blaming the other and unfortunately the hatred is paramount.
CG: Oh, you're talking about when partition came, when the British partitioned off the section for Israel, and then the Palestinians were pushed out?
JS: Well, they didn't say anything about the Palestinians.
CG: Well, the Arabs.
JS: The Arabs. But the Arabs were in a separate new place...in one section. They had stores, they had one of the oldest churches, and they had the Church of the Shepherd where Christ preached, and they had a small bazaar there...interesting places. Just a minute, I'll show you something I got from there.
CG: These are the people in Jordan, now, who were so hospitable?
JS: We stayed there, but they were located, not in the business section of Jordan. Where they lived, you could see the hillside, and nothing but shale. I never saw so much stone in my life. They were back from the road, and fortunately we had been wearing our shoes for some time, so it didn't matter if they got scratched up or not. We wore them ending up our journey. They were hospitable, very kind, and when we left, the young man drove us to the spot where we entered Jerusalem. I got this backwards. We went to Jordan first, then went to Jerusalem.
CG: Israel.
JS: Yes. Israel, yes. When we got to the borderline, there wasn't any mark or demarcation, any more than I have going out of my room and going into the hall, where he stopped. In the distance, about the length of this building, was a man seated at a desk who looked your visa over to admit into Jerusalem. He wouldn't let that Arab bring our bags up to his desk. That was Jerusalem soil. The hatred was so great between the Arabs and the Jews that it hurts me. I couldn't believe it. I wonder, are we ever going to'have peace, are they ever going to learn that they are all of the same blood? Those people are the same blood. And when I saw that hatred — We had to drag our bags that distance, two women. I just could not understand such injustice and bitterness.
CG: Because they didn't want him coming into Jerusalem.
JS: They wouldn't allow him to touch that soil. Now, at certain times of the
year, in certain parts of Jordan the Jews are allowed to come on some special days' back to Jordan. But much of the Biblical history that I know is in the land'where the Arabs live. At least that's what I felt. So it was impressive.
CG: Were there any particular features of Israel that struck you as different from the rest of the Middle East?﻿99
JS: No. Of course, the Jews are very smart people, and they had that
university there, but I wasn't in Jerusalem too long. I think we were only there about two days and one night, or two nights and two days, a short period of time, because time was catching up with us, but I was impressed. The Jews were nice to us. We stayed in this YMCA, which was immaculate, and everybody was very polite to us. I was surprised with the progress they had made with this arid land. It was fertilized and crops growing. The part of Jordan where I stayed with this family was a new area for homes. They couldn't grow anything. They had to import everything, because nothing but stone for miles. The sheep were grazing around, which interested me. The shepherds dressed just like they did in Christ's time and before. I just wondered what those sheep found to eat in the stony land. We spent four or five days in Jordan, and I then began to feel sick, a little inconvenienced with the fungus that I had, but I didn't give up. I'm not the giving-up type, or I wouldn't be here to tell you about it now.
CG: You were talking about a curfew here, and you were saying that there were colored American soldiers on duty. This was in Lebanon?
JS: Yes. I said living costs were very high in Jordan because they had to
import all foods. It was different from any country I had visited, that portion of Jordan that I saw, where I was living. But they had main streets, and they had these churches that had been built, where Christ had preached, and in another section, stores. It was quite impressive.
When I left, I had a nylon dress, and the mother admired it, as I kissed her good-bye, and I left her the dress. It was brand new, I don't think I had had it on, maybe twice, and I gave it to her as a token from America. She longed and wished she could come to America. I said, "If you will accept this, I'd be glad to give it to you. You can always think of American folks who stayed with you." They had two children, little girl about five years old, and a little baby brother. Of course, she had been the queen of the roost, and she was very disturbed over this newcomer in the family, so every time she got an opportunity, and nobody was looking, she'd give the baby a little slap, which was cute and wrong, but she didn't know any better. She was a dear little thing. So many times her grandmother would take her on the trips when we went. They were marvelous to us, and for a while we corresponded, but now times have changed. All of us are finding life very different; and our patterns of life have changed.
Well, from this area, we moved into Lebanon. To my surprise, when we left the airport going into the city, I glanced out the window of the bus that was taking us to the city, I said, "Look, those are American soldiers." I was shocked, to find that Lebanon was under military control, and nobody was supposed to be on the streets after eight o'clock at night. A fine was imposed upon you if you were on the street. Well, there was a gentleman whose son my friend had taught, and he had negotiated—just what his position was, I don't know; I never did find out. Things passed too fast, and developed, that you didn't have a chance sometimes to even think sensibly, or ask ordinary questions. But he met us. He had an automobile, and before we got to the hotel, he took us sightseeing. We were able to see, not close to, but near enough to appreciate, the trees of Lebanon.
CG: Oh, those cedars, the ones that are called cedars of Lebanon.﻿100
JS: Yes, the cedar trees of Lebanon.
CG: Oh, the one that Solomon brought in the...
JS: Yes. We were not too close to them, but we were near enough to appreciate that we had seen the cedars of Lebanon, that have been referred to in the Bible, which I consider quite a privilege. We passed by the soldiers, we saw the points of interest, and we landed at the hotel in the late afternoon.
CG: Now, this was in Beirut?
JS: This was in Lebanon. Yes. I'd left Beirut.
CG: No, Beirut is in Lebanon.
JS: Yes, but I meant I left the city. I didn't mention the fact that my friend
went off to another city for a day, and I stayed right in Beirut, and enjoyed
the Mediterranean, and rested up. I took care of some mail for her, just for the day. But I won't go into that.
CG: Did you get to put your feet in the Mediterranean at all?
JS: Yes, I stuck my feet in the Mediterranean Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.
CG: Good. Okay.
JS: ...and my fingers in the Nile River. In Beirut, next door to where we were staying, were two Americans, Professor John Hope and his wife, whose brother was president of Atlanta University, and whose family, and his nieces, I knew very well. We spent our evenings with them, because we discovered that we could get out the back door of the hotel, and go into the back door of the apartment where they were living. So the military control meant nothing to us, because we had no business on the streets, nothing we wanted on the streets anyhow. We spent the evenings with them. They invited two friends in one evening to meet us, so we had a very enjoyable time. She had a sister living in Boston, whom I'd talked with, but never got a chance to get to see her. They are now living in Washington. Mr. Hope's brother-in-law was registrar of the Treasury, Judson Lyons, whose name was on every United States paper bill, regardless of its value, from a dollar up to as many thousands of dollars that the printing office printed. I knew his sister, Mrs. Lyons, and his two nieces, Hope and Edith, who were teachers in Washington.
CG: John Hope is the person, the historian, right?
JS: Yes, and he's brother to the president of Atlanta University. I haven't seen them since. I corresponded with them in Washington, but I haven't been to Washington, so I guess by now, with those whom I knew all gone, life is different. I didn't know her, but I knew the family. So we had a very pleasant time in Lebanon, It was a break, and now when I see what is happening, and soldiers killed in Lebanon, it makes me feel kind of sad, because it doesn't look to me as though we're making too much progress. Now, from Lebanon, it seems to me we went to Rome... From Tel Aviv we went to Greece, where we arrived about 2:00p.m., and went on a sightseeing tour.
CG: Do you remember what city in Greece that was?﻿101
JS: I visited the famous monuments, and, which was the gateway to the Acropolis, erected by Pericles. It had five doors, with Doric columns, supporting a frieze above, with a marble ceiling, through a central doorway with three Ionic bronze columns—kings lived in the Acropolis—and the statue of a champion, twenty feet high, was there. The Acropolis was interesting, and the Greek art impressed me. The Parthenon was the most perfect example of ancient architecture. The marble forty-four feet high, one hundred feet wide.
Life in Athens was amazing, when you look and see how it was one of the great powers of the world, and how it fell to destruction. We only spent a short time in Greece. We were anxious to see the Acropolis and the Parthenon. And as for the rest of Greece, we'd have to postpone that, if we ever had another visit. So then we went on to Rome.
CG: You kept a diary, a travel journal, wherever you went.
JS: I tried to, I did the best I could.
We went to the church of Saint Peter's, with statues of all descriptions, but the Pope happened to be at his summer home. Thousands of people, in and out of the square; the Sistine Chapel which was built in 1642, and Saint Peter's, years and years ago, from the fourth century...and a memorial to the emperor and the tomb of the unknown soldier was in the area. Julius Caesar was ruler on the Roman forums. The American archaeologists were not available then, but Rome was interesting. Rome was something. The ravages of war..:
CG: They still hadn't recovered, then?
JS: Yes, they hadn't recovered. The proprietor of the hotel came and spoke to me when I was paying the bill, when Dr. Stokes went to the telephone, and asked how we enjoyed the city of Rome. I told him we were pleased, and sorry our visit couldn't have been longer. "How was everything in the hotel?" I said everything was satisfactory. Then he astonished me by saying they did not cater to American tourists. I said, "No? May I ask you why?" He said, "We do not cater, because we have found the Americans are not too agreeable people."
CG: Oh, really.
JS: "They flaunt their wealth in our faces, rude and inconsiderate, and we have been suffering from the ravages of war." But he says, "You ladies are very different." And all the guests in the hotel the two days you were here spoke about you, and how different you were from most of the Americans they met. "Well," I said, "I'm sorry and I'm hurt to hear that you have that impression of Americans. America has tried to be very sympathetic and kind to foreign nations who have suffered from the war, which was not of her making, and" I said, "we have been taxed to help the Europeans, and I'm sorry to hear that." "Well, you ladies will be welcome any time you want to come back." I said, "I'm afraid you won't see us again, because I'm traveling on a shoestring." But I said, "I enjoyed the antiquity of Rome, and the little history that I remember has been refreshed by my visit to these points of interest; I'm sorry that I don't have more time."
I found in Rome something that I wish we had adopted in our country, especially﻿102
JS: (cont.) in the area where I've been living. They, too, have suffered from population growth, and have had the good sense to leave Rome, old Rome, as Rome existed. They have built new Rome around it, away from it, which makes it interesting for people to come to Rome. That's the reason people visit, because they like to see the things that man did centuries ago. We went to the Coliseum, which was an interesting place, where they hold their conventions and meetings and so forth. There were the ruins of Saint Peter's Church, spectacular and gorgeous beyond description; paintings by Michelangelo; Tiber River; Sistine Chapel, 1642; Roman Forum; Saint Peter's; the Vatican, seat of the Pope, which is one of the main places of interest, with the statues of the Saints... stations for prayer, ornate with marble and gold, beyond my power of description. Of course, the statue of Julius Caesar—Trojans—all of which make ancient history.
From Rome we traveled on to the quiet little country of Switzerland, which has been smart enough to stay out of all of the encounters that the Europeans have engaged in through the centuries. We stayed in Geneva. Geneva was a beautiful, quiet city...went to church, heard a very good sermon. Wherever we could go to church, we did. My friend's brother-in-law, Dr. Wilson, who was an African, met us one afternoon, and spent the evening with us, and we walked around and saw some of the sights of Geneva. And one thing that interested me was a clock of flowers.
CG: A clock of flowers?
JS: Natural flowers, that were in the garden, parkway, where people gathered. The most beautiful thing I ever saw. By the time I reached Rome, I was suffering quite a deal from this fungus infection, that afflicted my arms, I was suffering a pain in the back of my head. So Dr. Wilson invited us up to Lucerne, where he was making his home, as he was continuing his studies. I had met Dr. Wilson in New York City, when he was interning in a hospital, studying in America. He had been to Paris, and he had been to Geneva, and then he was in America. Now he was in Lucerne, furthering his studies, because he was returning to Africa, where he is now in the medical profession. He invited us up one afternoon to Lucerne, and we spent about an hour and a half or two hours, and had tea with him. I asked him about my physical condition, so he put me in touch with a hospital and a friend of his, who was in a hospital, to contact this specialist, because by that time this fungus infection had reached one of my legs and was beginning to be painful; but I didn't mind that as much as I did the pain that was in my head. I had taken aspirin; I was not subject to headaches, and it had no effect upon me.
So the next morning, this friend had made an appointment for me, so I went into the hospital for an examination, and the kind doctor there was nice enough to tell me I had a fungus infection. He didn't know what kind it was, but I could stay in the hospital for three or four days, so I looked at him and I thanked him. I said, "Well, I'm sorry, but I have a flight scheduled for Paris tomorrow, so I won't be able to stay in your hospital, but I will give you the name of my physician in Massachusetts." "Well,^when you get to Paris, you take the first flight out and go back to America." I looked at him. I wasn't upset. It was painful, but I had pain before, and I had faith, and I had made this trip. I was willing to be examined, because it was only fair to my companion. I could see she might be getting upset. I wasn't upset at all. He said, "It probably has affected your arteries and your bloodstream, and you've been a long period going down, and you need bed﻿103
JS: (cont.) rest." So I looked at him; I said, "Thank you." I said, "Would it be possible for me to have a blood test?" And he looked at me. He says, "Yes, I'll see that you get a blood test, but you'll have to come back about six o'clock tonight to get the report from this blood test." Well, I said, "Thank you. I'll leave you the name of my physician in America, and I will pay for the cost, and you can send him the report. You told me I needed some rest, so I'm going to take the rest today. I'm not going to do any more sightseeing. I'll go to the hotel and I'll rest until it's time for me to leave tomorrow morning."
I suppose he thought I was one of those smart Americans. Oh, so I said to him, "I don't know why I couldn't wait and get the report of the blood test. My brother was a physician." With that, his countenance changed, and I had the report of the blood test in a half hour. And whatever was ailing me was not in my bloodstream. That's all I wanted to know. I continued my travel.
CG: 'Cause it was on your skin, right?
JS: On my skin, yes. And probably some bug or something that's in the... And that afternoon, my friend wanted to go back to the hotel with me. I said, "You're going to keep the appointment with the bishop that we had the appointment with, and he's going to take you to the building where the United Nations makes their decisions. I've seen it on the outside. Now, I'm going to take this cab, and I'm going back to the hotel," which was across town, "and you enjoy the day." She reluctantly accepted what I said, and around three o'clock that afternoon, there was a knock on the door. I had not locked the door. I said, "Come in." She says, "It's Olivia, and I have company.!' I said, "Come in." I had not undressed, I had taken my shoes off, and I propped myself up in the bed, there was a radio there, and I had books. I was very comfortable. I was given some medicine which was written in French, and I translated part of it to be sure. I asked him to put it in English for me, and I made a schedule, and two different medicines, two different times, and I took it regularly, and by three o'clock she came. And she says, "Well, we came to see if you felt better, would you like to join us?" I thanked her, and I said, "Discretion is the better part of valor Since I have this medicine, I'll take it, and I've seen the outside, so if I don't see the inside, it's just another building. You can tell me about it."
She was called to the telephone and left this bishop, minister, with me. He was the handsomest man I think I have ever seen. I should say he was in his late fifties or early sixties. He talked to me, and he had had this same fungus, similar fungus infection in Tel Aviv, where he got treatment. I wouldn't stop in Tel Aviv, because they were all speaking Arabic, and I wasn't going to be there and not know what was going on. I think my friend was more concerned than I was, and she came back to see how I was doing. Then I sent her on out and let her go to do whatever, go wherever they wanted to go. He prayed the most wonderful prayer that I have ever heard. I never saw a man with such a sanctified look as he had in his face—that was in August—and they left. I read, I got some dinner, and some supper, and the next morning I woke up, I was ready. We had our breakfast, and we were to get a nine o'clock plane for Paris.
When we got to the airport we had to wait. Something happened to the plane and they had to send another plane. I said to her the prayer that the bishop had—I cannot spell his name, nor can I pronounce it, because it was too long﻿104
JS: (cont.) it was wonderful, and I said, "I would like to speak to him."
We went to the telephone and looked up his number, I talked to him and thanked him. He said, "I prayed for you last night, Miss Smith, and I'm glad to know that you're better." And he says, "You'll be all right." He told my friend, "You do not have to worry about your friend." On our way to Paris, she says, "You know what the bishop told me?" I said, "No, how would I know? I wasn't there." She says,'"You don't have to worry about your friend. Your friend's going to make her trip, and she's not going to be inconvenienced, because she's not going to be too sick, and you don't have to worry about it.'" So I had a nice conversation with him, and thanked him for praying.
The plane came, and we were off to Paris. With very pleasant memories of Switzerland, a little country that minds its own business; a lovely, quiet, industrious people with mountains surrounding them, snow capped in mid-August.
CG: ..What was Paris like for you?
JS: Paris?
CG: Yes.
JS: Paris, I guess it would be a disappointment. Most people are enthused over
Paris. Paris was wonderful, and I should say—I'll give it a new name: it's the society city of the world. That's where there seemed to be life, social life. Operas were always known in Paris, and what impressed me, before reaching Paris, we took a flight from Geneva to Paris, which was impressing. When we got to Paris, it took us as long from the airport at Paris to get into the hotel in Paris, which to me just seemed dreadful, because it seemed almost an hour—too long a time—to get to your destination. From one country to another, and in the country, taking you one hour to get where you wanted to go. It wasn't like we were going to the outskirts of the country. We passed the Versailles. We didn't stop there, so I didn't see that on my trip. I saw enough. We stayed in a YWCA in Paris, which was very nice. It was within walking distance of some of the places of interest. What impressed me most... Of course, they had beautiful stores, because Paris at that time, was the center of the world for fashion.
There was poverty in Paris, due to the war, and they had these sidewalk cafes. Many of the people would come out early in the morning for a cup of coffee, and they would sit there, apparently nothing to do, no work, as they were middle-aged people, most of them. And you'd go on sightseeing, come back, and you'd see the same people there, with little money, but out in the fresh air, and getting a little something to eat. I didn't eat in one of them, but always saw people there. Of course, everybody knows about the urinals in Paris, which to me was an unusual thing.
There were sightseeing tours that we took. Dr. Stokes had a friend who was very kind, and invited us to his home to dinner—a typical French home, with French furniture, which was very interesting and very beautiful. A quick look at one of the fine stores, with the prices far beyond my pocketbook, so I lost no time in them...the flower shops were really gorgeous, with fresh flowers daily in the flower markets. Everywhere you saw flowers...and lights constantly in power. We took a trip to the Eiffel Tower and walked as high as I cared to go, got a beautiful view of the city. The flower markets were really very gorgeous, and they were entrancing to me, because I just thought﻿105
JS: (cont.) we might have a little bit more beauty in American parks than we
do have, and maybe we wouldn't have some of the terrible things that happen. Unfortunately, the opera wasn't being held there, but I went into the Louvre, which was most interesting, where I saw the statue of Moses, a marvelous statue. And the Mona Lisa.
CG: Mona Lisa.
JS: Mona Lisa. Joan of Arc, and many more, all beautiful statues, which I
enjoyed. I was only sorry that I couldn't make another trip to the Louvre. It's a marvelous place.
CG: Wasn't it impressively big? It's so big.
JS: Big, and huge, and marvelous. Everything was wonderful. Then they had the tomb of the unknown soldier and the flowers were fresh every single day, which was quite a sight...Palace of Justice, and the courts, and the Sorbonne, where I had a friend. The principal of M Street High School in Washington, D. C., had been a student at the Sorbonne, so that interested me immensely.
CG: Now, which principal was that?
JS: Anna Cooper, Dr. Anna Julia Cooper.
CG: She got a doctorate from there.
JS: Yes. A doctorate. The statue of Napoleon, who was a brother, Napoleon
the Third, and his son...and, of course, everywhere you went you saw Napoleon's name, and you couldn't help but think of Marie Antoinette, and the spot where she was guillotined.
CG: Oh, you saw that, too?
JS: Yes. Paris was an interesting city. You were much impressed that the people were pleasure lovers there, more so than in the other countries that I had visited. I found the Parisians that I associated with very kind, and of course,'Parisians are very polite. They're very courteous, and their little French'manners. It's not seen in any other part of the world as you see it in Paris. Too bad, the time catches up with you, and Paris life had to end, so we were off to Brussels.
Brussels was where they were having the World's Fair. So we had an opportu-nity to visit the World's Fair, which was most interesting, for we saw so many exhibits from places that we had visited, and also other exhibits from those that we hadn't. I was pleased to see the Argentina display and the ^ Russian display...a little disappointed in my own country's display. I didn t feel it was very good. I've got a souvenir from the Russian display.
CG: What impressed you most about the Russian display?
JS: The Russian display, exhibit, was very thoughtfully planned, and it showed
you the ability of the Russians. I was impressed with their ingenuity. I ve got a little souvenir, which was a doll, which had five dolls on the inside. The only other thing I had seen was one in Japan that was made of eggs, had little eggs in it. This one of Russia attracted me because they had the painted dolls on the inside. When little children come to see me with their﻿106
JS: (cont.) mothers, I entertain them with this one doll that's a souvenir I
brought from the Brussels World's Fair. I had been to the World's Fair in New York, I had been to the World's Fair in Chicago, so I didn't spend too much time with the World's Fair. But it was interesting, and I was glad to get there. It does something for people who don't get a chance to get around. They do get a chance to see what is going on in other parts of the world at these world's fairs.
I didn't see too much of Brussels. The main reason for going there was just to slow down our pace and to see the fair and countries we had not visited. There were throngs of people from everywhere, orderly, courteous, and interesting.
A typical European breakfast was coffee and roll, a sweet roll, as a rule. I didn't see too many doughnuts, but I did see buns, we call them. They're really sugar coated.
CG: Croissants?
JS: Coffee cake or buns, in America, and that was a typical European breakfast.
What I saw of Brussels, it was a typical city, and not having known anybody from Brussels, I wasn't particularly interested in Brussels, because so far as I know, it hadn't been outstanding, as was Paris. Let me see if I have any more on Brussels.
CG: You went from Paris to Brussels.
JS: No. From Brussels to Paris, one-hour flight.
CG: I wanted to ask you, when you were in Paris, did you meet any of the black American expatriates?
JS: The only black Americans that I remember were the people we met in Pakistan.
CG: I see. And then the soldiers in Lebanon.
JS: Yes. We saw the soldiers in Lebanon, but they were outside of the main city. There may have been one, but I wouldn't like...no. I remember the folks in Lebanon, and the soldiers. Those were about the only black Americans that I saw. I didn't know any colored people in Europe at that time. Since then, I have known some, but before then, I hadn't known any. Usually they were in Paris, but I didn't see any of them in Paris. Dr. Stokes's contacts mostly were with white people in the church movement, and they were all very nice. And in Paris, this gentleman took us out and invited us to his house to dinner to meet his wife, which was very, very nice. But as for meeting people, I'm trying to think what other place... We met the head of the intelligence bureau of America in Pakistan.
CG: You met the head of the intelligence department?
JS: In Pakistan. In India, we met the head of the air force, and we were invited
to his house. I met his wife, and had dinner with them. We had a few personal contacts, and in Rome, we were invited to dinner with a friend, an acquaintance of Dr. Stokes. But we didn't have too many clothes. We didn't go really for any social entertainment. We went mostly to see what was worth seeing, and﻿107
JS: (cont.) to enjoy people, and find out about people in the world. For me, it was a goodwill trip. I hope that it made some impression, because many of the people have read American papers, and too often the American Negro has been portrayed as being a vicious person, and I don't think he was known to many of the people, so I hope that we made a pleasant impression, and that they have changed maybe their opinion of the American Negro.
CG: I have another question. You mentioned the incident in Rome, where you
stayed in a hotel, and they told you they hadn't normally catered to Americans. But that you were different. Do you remember any other incidents where people said they were quite surprised to meet you, that they thought colored people were different, or that you were different from the typical American?
JS: He didn't mention the word colored. He said Americans. And the next experience, I'll tell it when I'm on my way to London. I'll tell you an experience there. But I think they hadn't been used to seeing women travel. And I think that was a new experience for them, and in many instances,
especially in India, they couldn't accept a woman being a doctor, other than... They only knew of medical doctor.
CG: I see, but not a learned doctor.
JS: So, it was a little difficult for them to accept the fact that Dr. Stokes was not a medical doctor, and that's the reason we had to travel on that train, for which I'm glad, because it was an experience that I wouldn't have otherwise.
In London, and London seemed nearer, one of the cities that was more familiar than some of the others, because it was supposed to be the largest city in the world, and the trade center of the world being in England. At that time, when I was younger the sun didn't set on English soil, and I've lived long enough now to see that the little island of England is all that is left of all of her vast possessions. We arrived in London, and my friend's friend, Mr. Douglas White, called for us that afternoon and took us out to his home. After showing us, riding around London a little while on his way to his home outside of London, where we had English tea, afternoon tea. He showed us Winston Churchill's home, and where Thomas Jefferson stayed. We spent a very pleasant afternoon. They had three interesting boys, young, all under sixteen, now all grown, some married, and I still hear from the family. They invited my friend to spend the night with them. Sorry they couldn't accommodate me but I was glad to just have a little time to myself, so they brought me back to the hotel, and I stayed there. They brought her back the next morning. We went around and visited Saint Paul's, the Episcopal church that had been bombed and was still just beginning to go through renovation, which was interesting. And of course, Big Ben, and the Thames River, and worshipped in Westminster Abbey, where we had communion.
My friend's time had ended, and she had to return to America. So, speaking English, although the British English is much -more—beautiful, should I say?
__or different than American English, I understood what everybody was saying,
I felt quite at home, so I decided to stay in England by myself. I was very comfortable in the hotel, and they were very kind. Each day I planned where I wanted to go. I developed a very good friend, who was an English policeman, who was called a bobby, with his high hat and his uniform. Anything you asked, they could always give you information. They were very courteous and very solicitous about you understanding and helping you to get where you wanted﻿108
JS: (cont.) to go. So I saw Buckingham Palace, and the changing of the guards with the horses and the soldiers in their uniform, which of course meant an expenditure of money for which the English people are being heavily taxed, and at that time were feeling it quite heavily. I visited some of the stores, and I went to Canterbury, and enjoyed that very much. I went up into the land of Shakespeare, where his home was, and was fortunate enough to see a play in the Shakespeare theater there, Anne Hathaway's home, and the Harvard house. I didn't mind being alone. I visited the gardens that were around.
I made a trip to Windsor Castle. There weren't many people in the castle when I was there, and I could feel somebody, well, looking at me. It was huge, showed the queen's playroom, very beautiful, with war relics, and the helmets, and the armor was being displayed, and gorgeous paintings. When I was about to leave, this guard approached me and he says, "Excuse me, but I've been interested in you." I said, "Yes? What's interesting to you?" He says, "First of all, are you South American?" That's the first time I had had any reference made to me as to my nationality. I said, "No, I'm an American." "An American? You're not a South American?" I said, "No. I'm from North America. Have you ever heard of Harvard University? Or Harvard College?" He says yes. "Why," I said, "I live in the city, Cambridge, where Harvard University or Harvard College, as it's sometimes called, is." "Oh," he said. "Well, I've been interested, because you seem so interested. People come in here, and they start at the door and they walk on out, and they're hardly in here ten minutes. But you stopped and looked at everything." "Well," I said, "I'm making a trip because I wanted to see things." "Well," he says, "have you enjoyed it?" I said, "Yes, you have a wonderful display here, and I'm very pleased." I said, "I have visited the tower where they have the queen's jewels, on the Thames River, and I've been to Westminster Abbey, and I have prayed and had communion in Westminster Abbey, which I consider quite a privilege. I have enjoyed what I've seen of London." "Well," he says, "it's been interesting talking to you. Saint George's Church is on the castle grounds, and that was built by Henry IV," I believe he said.
I visited whatever churches that I could, and small chapels to see the difference in their architecture from those of ours. Westminster Abbey, of course, is beyond description, and the nearest thing that we have in this country that I have seen, has been the Episcopal cathedral in Washington, which at that time, was nowhere's near completing, but I've lived long enough to know that it was completed last year. Now, let's see. I visited every gallery that I could. There was a Victoria gallery that was very interesting, and I went to All Hallows, which was in East London, the oldest church in London, bombed in World War...
CG: In World War II?
JS: Yes. And there were flowers. One interesting thing that I did find in
London was where the crown jewels were kept, on the Thames River. Wonderful to see all those jewels in various shapes that were placed on the queen's head for what, I sometimes wonder. A unique experience was traveling to Petticoat Lane. Somebody said to me, "Have you visited Petticoat Lane?" I said, "Never heard of it." "Well, be sure to see Petticoat Lane." So after going around visiting all the museums, natural history, castles, churches, and places of interest, and the Old Curiosity Shop, which was interesting to me, then to Petticoat Lane; I imagine, they got their idea from the bazaar that was in Cairo, Egypt. This was in East London, and I imagine East London was where the poorer class of people lived, from what﻿109
JS: (cont.) I saw, where they had this open market, where they were selling everything from shoestrings to clothes and food, so I indulged myself by buying a lace tablecloth that I enjoy using and relive my visit to London.
CG: Oh, you got this there.
JS: Yes. I've had this on the table, and this thing was given to me, so I just put it on there. I bought that in Petticoat Lane. It's the only practical thing that I had. I just wanted to get something that... They had jewelry, not expensive, mostly, and clothes. They catered to the poorer class of people, at moderate prices. It was interesting to see that, and contrast that with the crown jewels, same as I saw this wonderful temple in India, and then to see the poverty in India. To see just the little marker of Gandhi's death. The difference in appreciation of values, just the same, I still don't understand it. The rich and the very poor, for it is symbolized, all through life you see this distinction, when man ought to be able to enjoy, all men ought to be able to enjoy everything that they're capable of enjoying, and have the opportunity to enjoy.
Well, at Canterbury...every cathedral went back to the history of the Romans, and the crusaders, and the pilgrims, who were dissatisfied with Norman adventure. Of course, it had been attacked during the wars, of years back. The history went back to the archbishops and the home of the weavers, and the rulers of the Huguenots. The fourteenth-century chair and organ were on display there. These people have these things, and they have saved them, and it means much to their history and to their way of life to know that they have existed for centuries.
I enjoyed London very much, I think there are some things that I saw in London that might be very helpful if we would adopt them. One was the poise of the Londoners. Nobody seemed to be rushing, and when they had certain spots where certain buses stopped, they stood in what they called a queue, in line, no pushing. The first person that got there stood at the door, the entrance, and then the people followed. Sometimes the lines were quite long. Many of the buses were double decker, and you could go up the stairs and see the city from the top of the bus. I felt, how much nicer that would be than to have the rush that we have to experience to board our buses, and we're having the young people almost knocking older people down so that they can get in the cars or buses and get a seat...
CG: Isn't it terrible?
JS: ...regardless of a person's age or physical condition.
CG: That is an impressive aspect of England, how orderly the people are.
JS: Yes. I was impressed throughout my travels to see the calmness—I don't know how to express it—the soberness, perhaps, might be the word, of the life that I saw. 'Course, I wasn't in any place long enough to make too much of a comment, but I was impressed that, whatever the people were doing, or were not doing, whether they were working or whether they had no work, I didn't feel in any place that tension that you feel in America, and that I had felt, even in my younger days, even earning a living. You always had to be getting more, learning more, in order to feel that you were going to﻿110
JS: (cont.) achieve. They may be doing the same thing in Europe—that I don't know—but the reaction that I got from meeting the people, and the courtesy that I received from people on public transportation, in airplane travel and all of it wasn't American—some of it was Swiss, some of it was Indian, and American—but everybody was courteous. I spent ten very enjoyable, happy days in England. The last day I spent with these friends who had called me a couple of times after my friend had left and gone back to America...and insisted that I spend a part of a day, or a couple of days with them. Well, I had gotten through London, and had seen what I felt was important, and it was getting time for me to come home. And I traveled across the London Bridge—that was an achievement.
CG: Did you throw your penny into the Thames?
JS: Yes. Yes, I threw my penny in. That's the last day I was there, a
Sunday, and my plane was leaving at midnight for America. I left the last thing to see was the British Museum, which was within walking distance of the hotel where I was staying. At noon I took a train to spend the remaining time with these friends who met me at the station, and they took me to their house, and we had afternoon tea, and then took me for another ride, where I saw the meridian...
CG: Greenwich!
JS: ___which was a wonderful experience.
CG: At Greenwich?
JS: Yes, it's the Greenwich meridian. I had a very pleasant afternoon. I saw
Thomas Jefferson's home, and other prominent people in English history, which I enjoyed very much. General Wolfe's house, and Henry VIII's castle. We returned home and had dinnner; we sat and talked. When the time came, this friend was taking me to the airport, which was miles on one side of London. This friend took me through London, where I had stayed at the hotel—my baggage had gone on to the airplane—so took me to the plane, stood there until that plane left, and waved his hand farewell, I have corresponded with them ever since. I made my flight back to America. When we traveled two hours, we got to Ireland, where they were changing for fuel, and we got out as they had a little gift shop there, so I had my feet on Irish soil. The hostess on the plane was much interested in me, a lone elderly woman—I suppose she was an American—a colored woman in her seventies, and probably she had never seen many of them traveling alone.
CG: Oh, the stewardess was an American colored?
JS: She was white. I said, they hadn't seen any colored... And she was very
kind to me, I had a pillow and was very comfortable. Arrived in America at eight o'clock a.m., and my friend who had seen me off and taken me to the plane was there to meet me, as happy as though she had made the trip.
CG: To herself. Right.
JS: So that was my trip...had a nice flight overnight. I wasn't a bit
frightened the whole time I was in England, and the only time I got rain on the whole trip was the day I went to Shakespeare's home, Stratford-on-﻿Ill
(cont.) Avon, and that day it rained. That was the one day that I had left my galoshes in the hotel, because I didn't think I'd need them. But that was it. Now I'm back in America, and maybe I should say one or two words to fasten this story. Whether I have anything worth recording, I don't know. Now let's see. I don't know whether I wrote anything or not. Now I'm home to relax. But I haven't finished the story of my life.
No. 'Cause this is 1958. This is 1958, right now...
Yes, when I made the trip. "Now I'm home to relax and praise God for his great blessings that I was able to have the opportunity to make such a wonderful trip, and meet such fine, understanding people, and feel that, with all the wars, problems, and trials, man still is seeking a better knowledge of God and Christ's teachings, that will eventually lead to a much finer world, in which to live." I did not have long to relax and rest, because the belt situation became alive, and I found myself concerned, deeply involved, all of which I have spoken previously. Didn't I?
Right.
Back, rested, I was sought to help preserve an area in the Riverside area of the best integrated community of Cambridge. Harvard College was in the habit of buying up as much property as they could in various sections of the city. They became interested, and wanted to get this part of the area known as the Riverside area, from Massachusetts Avenue, Western Avenue, through to Memorial Drive. Well, low-income people had their homes, and they had no place to go, so unknown to the people in the community, I was sought to help them. I attended a meeting where the city planner was, and he showed some map, which was ten years old. I had been to these meetings years back so I knew that the map didn't show the picture of the area as it now existed.
Oh, my goodness.
So I went in and offered my suggestions and helped, and advised the people to get together and improve their houses. At that time, money was scarce. I said, "You artisans, get together. Somebody needs paperhanging, and you're a paperhanger, go to some of these places where they are selling just certain rolls of paper cheap, you get something, and you go in his house, and you paper his room." I said, "And you, plumber? He needs a faucet? You go in his house and put a faucet in, or pipes, or what he needs. Somebody else is a painter? Or one of you painting? Then painter can go and... You need a paperhanger? Then you exchange. And improve your houses, and we'll work and see that the city improves some of the streets." And in that way the area was saved. And the community school is still in that area, not functioning as good as I'd like to see it function, but the new Martin Luther King School has been built there. Harvard built a building on the other side of Memorial Drive, and the children from the Riverside area and from Harvard's building, where they have their graduate students live with families, all attend...
Peabody Terrace.
...go to this Martin Luther King School, and I have a friend who is a teacher there.
Now, who's your friend who's a teacher there? Your friend who's a teacher﻿112
CG: (cont.) there?
JS: Her name is Mrs. Frances Pierce.
CG: Oh, Mrs. Pierce. Mrs. Pierce. Do you know Miss Key? Miss Regina Key?
JS: I might know her by sight. I have tried to help, and, well, the three
big things I think I have done since I lived in Cambridge has been, first, joining the Cambridge Community Relations Committee, affiliated with the Y, and a member of the Y, on three different committees for fifteen years; the person who was really responsible for keeping the inner belt route out of Cambridge; and protecting the property of the citizens in the Riverside area from being destroyed by ambitious Harvard University.
I have been concerned with the Afro-American Museum from the time Mrs. Howard Thurman—Mrs. Sue Thurman—started the museum. We have been successful in getting it a national shrine. Unfortunately, they haven't had any money, and I have been sick, but we're hoping, or I'm hoping, that we'll get sufficient funds to continue the proper renovation due to fire which destroyed the roof, which was very costly, and part of the building—and get it open before I close my eyes in death. I was one of the members of the first board. I still hold interest in the Afro-American Museum. Perhaps the biggest gift that I have made in my lifetime, has been the donation of twelve hundred glass photographic plates to the Afro-American Museum taken by my father, Hamilton S. Smith, as his hobby, an expensive hobby. I brought them from our home in Washington where my father packed the boxes. I've taken care of them, and helped to develop some of the plates, and given them to the Afro-American Museum. I hope that I may live long enough to see more of the plates developed, where they may be able to hold a historic exhibit, because he has some very historic pictures that can be made from the plates that he took over seventy-four years ago, and not one single plate was broken. I've been given credit for holding them for seventy-four years. And that's my last contribution, so I am working to try to see if I can help them in any way to get funds to complete the building.
Now, in my old days, I have lectured on the exhibit that has been made out of the photos, telling the story of my father's family life, at the museum, at city hall in Cambridge, and a guest, with a reception, at the public library in Cambridge, with three talks on the history of my family. Now, I am being subjected to making, telling the story of my life, which may be a little spasmodic in spots, and not as organized as I would have liked it to be. But through my life, I've said nothing about it, I never was strong. I was out of the teachers' training school more than off and on—a half a year, from time to time—and came out with the first top ten. I had two periods of illness while I was teaching. One, I was taken sick in October, and I went baek with a substitute to hold my job, and took a trip to Bermuda. Did I mention that?
CG: No, you didn't.
JS: In 1936, I took a trip to Bermuda with a group of teachers who were on the boat. I was out of school because of ill health. Having been overworked, with crowded classes and a classroom used for a laboratory for training teachers, my nerves just collapsed, so I took this trip for two weeks to Bermuda by boat. It was a nice trip, and the interesting experience was that the boat was too large to get into the harbor, so it had to anchor outside of the harbor, and we were taken in on little tenders...a new experience to me. At Bermuda I found one lady who lived originally in Washington, a member﻿113
JS: (cont.) of the Brownie Club, which I mentioned some time ago, that my aunt
belonged to. She was so happy to see a group of Americans, colored Americans especially, and to see me whom she had known, because she was a friend of my aunt's, and had attended Saint Luke's Church. So I saw Bermuda, got around to Saint George's and Hamilton, the three islands, and had a very nice time. I found the Bermudians thoroughly English, very fine people. Later on, one of my cousins in Boston married a Bermudian whose father and uncle were members of the legislature. At one time, he too was a member of the legislature; he is now concerned in airways, promoting airports or developing airports between America and Africa.
CG: Now, this is the Grant family, right?
JS: Yes, the Russell family.
CG: Oh, the Russell family.
JS: She was Grant. The trip to Bermuda was interesting, and the salt air
invigorating. In those days there were no automobiles in Bermuda, there were horses and surreys. The day would be bright, the sun would be shining, and all of a sudden it would cloud up, down would come the rain. You scattered to a store or shelter, but in a little while it was all over and the sun was out again. And I was interested in the fish at the bottom of the sea there, and you took a boat, rode where you saw these fish in the bottom.
CG: Oh, the glass-bottomed boat?
JS: Yes, the glass-bottomed boat. I have fought...
CG: That was a good way to rest yourself in order to get well for school.
JS: Yes. There were several entertainments in Bermuda by the Bermudians, and strange to say, one of the families that entertained us and took a liking to me, eventually my cousin became a member of that family. They, the older members have been to Boston several times since this cousin married, and they have spent the day with me. I took them to Harvard, and showed them the wonderful glass flowers at the museum there, for I have enjoyed them. They, too, like the rest of my family, have passed on. But I have pleasant memories and have met the younger living folks.
CG: They're not the same family, now? They're not the members of the Grant family? This is a different family.
JS: They're all Bermudians. Now, I have struggled along with health, and nobody has ever known it. Whatever has, it has been nerves. I've always been told that my brain was too active for the amount of blood that my body produced, so eventually it caught up with me, and in these latter years, where I have tried to help in various causes, I had the misfortune, after my brother passed, and living alone, and when the crime area developed, my place, my home, my family home, was attacked three times by youths. The last time, two youths entered my home—how, the detectives have never been able to find out, because I had security locks, an alarm system, bolts and chains, and weatherstripping. They didn't break a glass, and they didn't break a lock, but they managed to get the metal weatherstripping loose, they located where the lock was, the bolt, and they got that loose, and in some way they were able to manipulate﻿114
JS: (cont.) to get the door, doors open. They entered my bedroom. God was with me. I was alone, I kept my brother's hat on the post of the steps. The stairway was wide, the house was large—it had twelve rooms—and there were four bedrooms on the second floor. The third floor I didn't use, but it was clean and well kept, and a bath on the second floor. And I had not gone to sleep. It was a little after nine, and I was lying on the bed when I was reading, and there was some light, it was daylight savings, and the light... I stopped reading. My telephone rang beside my bed, and I answered the telephone. That's how I happened to be on the bed. I could sit myself on the bed while I answered the telephone. I had not put a light in the hall downstairs, and neither did I have a light in my room. So naturally, they thought the house was empty. They approached my bedroom and stood at the foot of my bed, near enough to put their hands around my neck. God was with me. I gave a scream, I called my brother's name. "John," so loud — I didn't know I could scream. I'd never had an occasion to. I called his name twice. They were sneak thieves, they left the impression on the steps, but they flew. But what it did to me, it shattered every nerve in my body and now I have no reserve energy.
CG: I can imagine.
JS: And fighting to overcome the shattered nerves. Of course, I saw the doctor, who thought, when he saw me, that I'd had a heart attack or a stroke.
CG: That was such a fright!
JS: I always felt that I had a slight stroke, and I never have gotten the doctor to really say anything about it. He said, "Every nerve in your body was shattered to pieces." He never went into it. I told him to tell me, that I wouldn't be afraid, but I guess he thought it was wise not to. I didn't realize what had happened, but he did tell me, "You can't stay in that home, Miss Smith."
CG: He said you couldn't stay in your home?
JS: He said, "You can't stay in that home any longer. It isn't safe for you to be there by yourself. You will relive that experience, so you're going to have to move." Well, breaking up a family home wasn't easy, and nobody to come to you. Everybody willing, always said, "Any time you need me..." But when I needed them, oh, the weather wasn't warm, and they were getting ready to go on a vacation, and this and that and the. other. So just one woman came a couple of hours every morning. I felt myself going. I knew I was sick. I knew I had to get out, and I was the only one who could do it. People, my relatives, one of them wanted to come, but she would have been more hindrance because she didn't know Cambridge. She couldn't help me. She wouldn't have been able to do any errands, she didn't know what I wanted, and this and that. So I managed to get through. By the time I did get moved, somebody picked out this apartment for me—I didn't know anything about it—I have been here, and people have been very kind to me.
After a year, the doctor informed me that I struggled so hard with these shattered nerves' that what little strength I had, had been completely used up, and I had absolutely no reserve. So I've had to hibernate for three years. I have suffered all kinds of Dain, and all kinds of problems, all unforseen. and deaths in my family, but here I am, approaching my ninety-third birthday,
with God's will I have come through. This winter I wasn't able to walk for﻿115
JS: (cont.) eight weeks, only hobble around, and catch hold of anything, even lean up against a wall to go from one room to another. But I am stronger, and I can walk a few blocks now. I have been able to go out occasionally, door to door in a car, and that's the only way I can go now any distance. I thank God for His goodness, and people have been very kind to me. I've been spared for something, and I'm not the Christian that I would like to be, but I hope God will reveal to me His message, and let me do His will, not mine. He's seen fit to let me stay here, so I must be staying for some purpose. So, what it is, I wish He'd let me know, and I'll find out and I can...
But I have always felt that love is the center of all happiness. The spirit of God reigns within us. The only thing that we cherish is, we're made in God's image, and that's what we sometimes call the soul. This body that people put so much emphasis on, how to dress or what to eat, is the temple of your soul, and if you don't respect your soul, which is part of Christ, how can you expect to have a better life? Christ was a man of love, gentleness, kindness. He wasn't a man of jealousy, he wasn't a man of hate, he wasn't a lazy man, and we have entirely too much of that today. Unfortunately, too many of the churches are not preaching God's word. Evidently, they too are confused, because they are getting rid of some of their years' customs, and when they get rid of the Lord's Prayer, which is written in the sixth chapter of Matthew, and in Luke, and they write another prayer, a Nicene Creed, it shows that man hasn't gotten God's message.
I think that I've tried to live a life that is worthwhile, and a kind word daily to somebody might make somebody's life a little brighter. I avoid trying to hurt people, but be big enough, if I've found out somebody's been hurt, by word or deed, done by me, I try to make amends, and make life a little easier, for life is only what you make it. Unless you have love in your heart, life means nothing.
CG: It's just like the scripture in Corinthians. It's like, if I'm, you know, do all of these great works and have not charity...
JS: That's it, that's it.
CG: I wanted to ask you about political affiliations. You've been quite active
in Republican politics, and many people changed their party affiliation during Roosevelt's term of office, but you didn't. Are you glad you remained a Republican?
JS: My people have been Republicans ever since political parties developed. My grandfather was one of the first men to attend the meeting in Worcester—the date I don't remember—but he's been a Republican. No, I didn't change. I had younger members in my family who changed their political affiliations. I am not a politician. I lived in the city of Washington where they had no vote. But now Washington has a mayor and a government, known as the District of Columbia government. All pensioners from Washington now receive checks no longer written by the United States Treasury; they are from the bank in the District of Columbia government, which has just started in the last two months. It caused me a lot of concern, because I had to try to find out whether this money in these banks is being backed by the United States government, but I understand it has, and I had to go to the bank this week. I had to get a check cashed to see if they would accept this check, and I had no problem. But﻿116
JS: (cont.) having had no political experience in Washington, but having been in Massachusetts and a resident in Massachusetts, and a taxpayer, I got an absentee ballot, so I voted.
When I retired from the school system in Washington and came to Massachusetts to live, I said, "Now, I don't know these people for whom I'm going to vote; I must know who I'm voting for." So I became interested in the people who were candidates for various offices in the city and in the state, and I started my—I shan't say, political career, because I don't call myself a politician— but my interest in politics, in order to vote intelligently.
I had been in Washington when Roosevelt was president—that's Franklin—and lived in the house, in an apartment in the house with a man who was well known. Of course, they had no vote then, but he was very enthusiastic about Roosevelt. I never changed my politics, and I never said much about it. I never said much to the people that I had the privilege of a vote, because they didn't have it, -and no need of agonizing people or annoying them. So I watched the colored people, and they fell hook, line, and sinker. And of course, Mary Bethune was very friendly with Mrs. Roosevelt, and that pleased the people. But I never changed my politics. I knew Mrs. Bethune slightly—I never joined the organization. I'm not a joiner. I don't like big movements, personally, to be a part of them. I will help a movement that is good, but to be a part of it, and traveling here, there, and thither, that doesn't interest me. No. What little I can do, I try to do, cast your lot where you are, and try to improve situations around you. So I never changed my politics, but I do feel that the time has come, that there's very little difference in the Republican and Democratic parties, and I think it was shown the other day very definitely last Tuesday, when Mr. Brooke and his opponent met in debate.
CG: Madison Park High School?
JS: No.
CG: The debate between himself and Avi Nelson? In Attleboro.
JS: Yes, in Attleboro. With Avi Nelson. I do feel that, reading the paper,
there's very little difference in Nelson's views than there are in Brooke's views. But what I fear, if the people keep on, and especially the colored people, we won't have a two-party system, which we need. If we don't have a two-party system, we are very apt to develop some sort of socialism that might not be too advantageous to us. I'm afraid we'll lose our democracy... two-party system is part of the democracy. I hope that our group of people, at this stage, if Mr. Brooke is cleared and can run, that they will first, register—those who haven't registered—and get registered before September, and then change and become Independents, which will give them an opportunity to vote for whomever they please. I hope that our leaders, whoever they may be—maybe you know; I don't" may spring up, and advise the masses of the people for once to get united. Now, I wish you'd asked me that before I'd had my closing words.
CG: Oh, I'm sorry.
JS: If Mr. Brooke is cleared—unfortunate that he made a mistake, but who are
we to judge the other fellow. He's not the first man in Congress who's made a mistake. His mistake has been a domestic mistake. It has not been a political mistake; I hope that politically, he will be cleared. Domestically,﻿117
JS: (cont.) it's his affairs and not mine. I wish him well. Politically, I will give him what support I possibly can; I'm sure that I can give him some help, because I have been recognized by the secretary of state as being an outstanding Republican in the city of Cambridge. I forget what they called it.
CG: Ah, you didn't tell me that, being an outstanding Republican.
JS: Well, I didn't speak of that. These things come to me. I don't think too much of them, because, I mean, they just come along, and I'm not a person to boast, and what has happened has happened. That's all. I haven't asked for it.
CG: What other awards have you received that you haven't told me about?
JS: Well, I don't know. I never got anything, but of course, nobody's honored me at all. Now I'm fighting these awful fences around here, that belong to the government. The mayor was at the meeting the other day, when they had a program for senior citizens, and he saw me and he said, "Well, Miss Smith, how are you? I haven't forgotten you. I'm working on those fences." They know, if they don't want to hear from me, they know that when I say something, that I'm right, and they know that I'm not going to let it go. I'm like the dog chewing the bone. I'll let you alone for a while; if I don't see any progress, I'm going to get somebody else to come along and work with me. But these people up here...[interruption]
...because I feel homes are here, they're paying taxes, but they don't have the same privileges as other sections because they don't request them. They don't have any trouble here. Every other section has a neighborhood problem. And every other section is getting some of this money that's provided to improve the area through revenue sharing.
CG: The block grant.
JS: Not up here. These streets are terrible...high rent, and meddle with your
business. So they're not interested; many don't vote. This neighborhood is a very peculiar mixed group—Caucasians, Afro-Americans, West Indians, Portuguese, and Nova Scotians. There is no friction, nor any unity. Each group remains to themselves, hence no leader and no growth—a most unfortunate situation. I just don't understand their indifference and dislike for one another. Nothing in life is successful unless love, good will and the Spirit of Christ reigns.﻿118

JS: Since I was taped, Brandeis University honored me by having me talk to some of their students. Simmons College had me as guest Negro History week and presented me with a beautiful locket, honoring me for what I have done and not living on the accomplishments of my family.
Others in my family have lived good lives and are making a name for themselves that I did not mention.﻿
