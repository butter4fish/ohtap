 Finchum  Keith Smalley  Today is February 21, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project called Centennial Farm Families. We   re here today in  Coyle,  Oklahoma  on the Hill Haven Farm with the Smalley family. We  have Keith, Todd and Kim Smalley. Thank you for joining us today. Let   s  start by having Keith tell us how the family came to have the farm to  start with.  The farm was homesteaded by a fellow by the name of Cannon, and as  soon as he proved up on the homestead, he sold it to a fellow by the  name of Bras, B-R-A-S. Then in December of 1904, my great-grandfather  bought the farm from Mr. Bras. The Bras family was from  Pennsylvania and they gave two acres right out here in the corner to the  Quaker Church organization and there was a church built out here for an  Indian mission. It has been gone, of course, I don   t even remember. My  great-grandfather, Isaac Smalley bought it, as indicated, from Mr. and  Mrs. Bras. Then when he passed away, my grandfather, Jeff (he went by  the name of Jeffie Smalley) came into possession of the farm. I don   t  know exactly how that happened, through inheritance or if he bought it  from the rest of the family members or what, but then when Jeffie  passed away, the farm went to his wife, Joy, and my father Keith  Smalley Number One  Senior . My father at the time was a minor, even  though he was married, and then his mother deeded the south eighty,  which I currently own, to him.  My mother and father bought the north eighty from my grandmother  who was Joy Smalley. Joy, her maiden name was Walker. It was deeded  to them as joint tenants, the north eighty. The south eighty was deeded  strictly to my father and when he passed away, which he did at the age  of forty-one. The south eighty  was divided with  my mother owning a  third of it and my two brothers and sister owned two-thirds of the south  5  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  eighty. (We were all minors at the time.) When my mother passed away  and they settled the estate, Todd and his sister  Kelly  got the north  eighty, and my brother and I, Dr. Tim Smalley (he lives in Stillwater),  got the south eighty. I purchased his interest. And that is where we are  today, I guess.  Well in   91, then I bought Kelly   s interest in the north eighty, so I own  the north eighty and Uncle Buddy owned the south eighty.  So we are in the fifth generation?  Seventh.  In fact, there are five generations of Smalleys buried in this cemetery  over west of here.  Seventh. We   re short livers.  Isaac Smalley, I think he was in his sixties when he died.  All the rest of them died real young.  Jeffie Smalley died when he was thirty-nine and then my father died  when he was forty-one.  They both died, not in this house, but in this house (shows photo), in the  same room. Both of them had heart attacks, right?  Just hard workers. Where did the original Smalleys come from, do you  know what state?  They came from Ohio. Isaac Smalley, the one that purchased the farm,  originally came from what county?  Upper Sandusky,  Wyandot County .  And what brought them to this area?  Well most of the people that came to this area came when the Run was  made for the land, the free land, but in this case, I don   t know.  Well, Isaac homesteaded over a mile east and two miles north on that  corner there, and then Cimarron City was built and the tornado hit and  wiped it out and then he bought the Cain place and then bought this  place and then some other stuff, and then ended up in Coyle.  6  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  But he was a businessman. He had a hardware store in Cimarron City,  which, as Todd indicated, was blown away by the tornado in 1893, I  believe it was.  Something like that.  What did they originally farm? Cattle? What was their income early on?  Well, most of the farms back then had cattle, they had hogs, they had  chickens, and a variety of enterprises.  On this farm there was corn, cotton, wheat, what else?  Well, dairy cattle and beef cattle and hogs, and everybody had chickens.  Did you have to pick cotton?  Yes, I had to pick cotton, but I am a lousy cotton picker. (Laughter) I  was.  We hear that a lot. And so what does  the farm  do today? What its  source?  Wheat and alfalfa, cattle. Have you got any chickens?  No. I am going to get some.  Wheat and alfalfa now. I   ve grown some milo too. I do it when  something else fails.  Through the years has there been supplemental income or has it just  been strictly farming to make ends meet?  We   ve all worked. You know, one of the memories I have here was  (used to be the black families picked the cotton and things like that)  hearing them in the evenings singing out in the cotton field. They would  harmonize and they were just beautiful.  There were a lot of sharecroppers when Keith was growing up that  would run around and do the sharecropping and there was a ball  diamond out here that they   d all get together and play baseball and such.  It   s still there.  So about when did the farmhouse burn?  Oh, it was      7  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  1978?  Here is the ball diamond.  No, it was    86.  So you two would remember having Christmas and holidays down  there?  Oh absolutely, yes, everybody came, the Smalleys and the McGuires  alike. Grandma was a McGuire. She had a whole house full. She was the  only one that had a house big enough to pack everybody in.  And it was heated by wood you said earlier?  It had supplemental gas too, but she had a big woodstove in the front  room.  And what was its water source?  Well.  And on the property are there any ponds?  Several.  Natural ones or man-made or a little bit of both?  They are all dammed.  So you had some help with the Soil Conservation Service?  Several times. (Laughter)  So how many ponds total?  Well, there are two big ones and two or three water wells, too.  Terracing, did you have to do any of that?  There is some terracing. Lots of trees still. Shelterbelt that was planted  in the    70s. Grandma was real big on, she did not want the Dust Bowl to  reoccur so she enlisted all of us to plant a shelterbelt so it would help the  soil.  And it is still there?  8  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Still there.  She would order 500 trees through the Arbor Foundation every year and  we got the pleasure of going out north and digging holes and carrying  water and planting trees.  And about half would survive?  Probably      Quite a few of them did. Not half of them, but enough that made a nice  shelterbelt.  That is neat.  That ought to show up on that map.  I   m sure it does. It   s right in the middle of the north eighty.  Todd mentioned that they had a ball diamond out here and I think our  claim to fame was   I guess it is true that Satchel Paige played out here.  She probably don   t know who Satchel Paige is.  I do. He played in four decades. (Laughter)  I recognize the name.  He is in the Hall of Fame.  And so you all had chores growing up? I am assuming that all three of  you did. Was milking part of it?  We had to get up and get the chores done before we went to school and  get home and get them done in the evening.  And how close was the school?  Well      Grade school      I went up on the   you probably   which way did you come in?  I brought them in the other road. I brought them in down Redlands.  9  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  A half mile east and a mile north is a country school there. Or there was.  Progress School.  The one they moved a few years ago?  No, that was IXL. That is a different one. This is Progress and the  building, the Progress building, was quite substantial. It wouldn   t move  very easy. It is cement.  We will have to go back that way.  My grandma taught there.  My mother taught school there and she taught my father in the eighth  grade.  Made for an interesting home life, didn   t it? (Laughter)  I think she probably spanked him too, did she not? (Laughter)  Yes, she used to take his cigarettes and pipes away from him and      And at one time there was a gas plant on the place. Grandpa drove a  gasoline truck for awhile.  A truck, yes.  Texaco had a plant that was just on the north eighty on the hill and there  was such a large, substantial amount of oil and natural gas in the area  that instead of pipelining it or whatever, they just built the plant and they  took the plant out in    64, was it?  No, it was before    50. About      I know all the buildings were still there when I was growing up because  we used to go out there and play around in those buildings until we got  caught by Daddy or something, and he would,    Get out of there,    and  we   d go back to the house and as soon as he would turn his head we   d  go back down there and play some more. (Laughter)  Incidentally, they made gasoline and propane, and they made it from  natural gas. Now, my dad worked as a   they called him a distill man  there in the plant, and they had towers and all and he would take me  through the plant and show me what happened in this particular part of  the plant   what they brought the natural gas in, compressed it, and made  10  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  gasoline and propane. I didn   t pay any attention, thought I wasn   t  interested, but I wish I had paid attention. But what I can   t understand is  why they can   t do that today because they were making gasoline and  propane there out of that natural gas.  There   s still a lot of oil field activity around here as far as natural gas, a  large amount of natural gas under this property and under the properties  around. In the last several years, they have drilled eighteen, nineteen  wells.  Successfully?  Yes, very successfully.  Of those producing gas from this farm right now here   they did the  horizontal drill underneath here; it is very high quality gas.  Helps with making ends meet. Do you get any royalties?  Over the years they have diluted the shares of royalties so much that we  hardly get anything. When we first got the lease papers for this particular  well, I think there were 450 or something royalty owners under this  place, so it has been diluted quite a bit.  When you were going to school, where did you go?  I went to school at Perkins. They shut down the school in    64,    65, right  around that time. And then the Perkins and Coyle line runs through the  middle of this section and we lived on the east side, so we went to  Perkins and everybody on the west side went to Coyle.  Did you ride the bus?  Yes.  And you were close enough to walk?  I walked to school every day, when the snow drifts were seven foot tall,  both ways     (Laughter)  I do not believe there was a hill in there though. (Laughter) So in the old  farmhouse, what was your favorite room?  Oh, anywhere upstairs because that was where they couldn   t catch you  doing stuff. Grandma always had some really neat toys that I guess were  new to them when they were kids, but she had an old choo-choo train, it  11  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  was the big one, you know, the G scale, or whatever choo-choos. I guess  you and Daddy and Uncle Tim played with them when you were kids  and they still worked when we were kids so we would always sneak up  there and play with those old toys. Grandma had a heck of a library and  if you ever were doing any type of schoolwork or anything like that, it  was before the days of computers. She had a library that was probably  better than most schools around, so we   d always come to Grandma   s  house to do our homework when we were doing research. Well she was  a lifelong teacher.  Probably had a set of encyclopedias?  Oh, she had more than a set of encyclopedias. I think she had every  National Geographic from about 1900 to 1950 in a wall case that you  could literally walk up and peruse. Then she had every research book,  and every pamphlet that was ever written by a certain organization or  whatever. If you were doing any research or anything like that, you  came to Grandma   s house.  She went to school her whole life.  Was she involved with the home demonstration clubs or anything?  She was a WCTU member. (Laughter) A life-long Quaker lady so she  was staunchly against alcohol.  Did she quilt?  Absolutely. Matter of fact, the day the house burnt down, she had made  my dad a quilt. It was a rose quilt, it was just absolutely beautiful and  Daddy had died prior to her finishing it. When I come over to check on  her the day that the house burned, she had taken me upstairs and she  said,    Now when we get back from feeding the cows, you take this quilt.  It was your dad   s. You need to take it home with you and I will give it to  you.    And, it was one of the things that burned up. We saved two chairs  out of the house and that was it. So, that pretty rose quilt    but she had  probably fifteen, twenty, thirty beautiful quilts that she  had made . She  always had a quilting rack in the front room. She would work on it.  Got some pictures of some of those quilts here somewhere.  Did she enter them in the county fair?  I am sure she had. But she also belonged to a quilting bee, too. The  women of the Quaker church were in a quilting bee and would     12  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  They still meet up here on the corner in the old schoolhouse once a  week.  And still quilt, too?  Yes.  Grandma was a staunch believer in education and so forth.  What I got from her for my high school graduation present was a  dictionary. (Laughter)  There are pictures of the quilts that she made there.  She did some appliqu   and     She did it all by hand, it was not machined, so it was good stuff.  That   s a pretty iris one. So if she entered those in the county fairs, were  you involved in 4-H while you were in school?  A little bit. I think you guys probably were, too.  Yes, 4-H was pretty prominent in the schools. They used to come around  to the schools and organize.  Now I   m assuming you had a big garden?  Yes.  Did your own canning?  Yes.  You are laughing. So was there a story there?  That was one of the things that survived the fire. Grandma had a full  basement and there was tons of canned food. She was recycling before  recycling was cool. She grew up in the Depression during World War II.  She saved metal cans, bottles, whatever. You know, during World War  II everything was so scarce. You would go out there on the pantry on the  backside and she would have feed sacks full of smashed steel cans and  lids and bottles and everything else that she would take and recycle, far  before anybody else ever thought of doing that type of thing.  So the cellar was in the basement and it was a large room?  13  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Great big cellar. Rock cellar. Still there; it survived the fire and built the  house up on top of it. But, it was stocked completely full of canned food  and garden material      I suspect then there are still a lot of our old canned     Yes.  I wouldn   t doubt it.  We knew growing up that if we didn   t eat something for dinner, or lunch  or breakfast, you were going to get it in some form or fashion the next  meal. She didn   t waste anything. She saved rags, she saved   well, that  is part of the quilts. I think I was maybe ten or eleven years old before I  can remember her ever having a soda pop in the house. The water here  was real high in sulfur. At the time, we lived in Nebraska and we would  come down and Grandma would always go up to my aunt   s house and  bring well water back and keep it in the icebox because it was a little  better to drink than what she had here. She always claimed that there  was minerals in the water and it didn   t bother her, you know, but    Yes,  I was probably ten or eleven before I remember    And she always had  Pepsis. You know, Pepsi in the big sixteen-ounce bottles. There was no  such thing as a soda pop around here.  The breakfast; now that is one of the things that I remember is the  breakfast that she always made, the eggs and the bacon. She would cook  rice, and I always thought that was weird eating rice for breakfast. We  would have homemade bread for toast and orange juice and milk and     You were asking about the water supply. Right now, we have what is  called the Rural Water District. We just turn the faucet on and water  appears. But when I was small, and up until I was probably about twelve  years old, there are two wells just right out here but they were not good.  And right at the base of this hill down over here was the well, and it was  what they called a sand point. They just drove it into the ground about  six or eight foot and get plenty of good water and we carried water from  down below the hill up here. It was our source of water because these  two wells were not any good.  When did she drill the one out here? Do you know?  I don   t know, Todd.  Because it was half-way decent.  I remember as a kid when they dug the ditch and laid the line and the  14  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  electricity down there because I remember running up and down      Between the trees?     the trench that they dug. I don   t remember how old I was. I was  maybe ten or less, I don   t know.  And we lived on the other side of the farm and it had good water.  (Laughter) Lots of good water.  So describe a family gathering for us. Like on Thanksgiving or  Christmas. What would be on the table?  Lots and lots of good stuff, for sure. Grandma always made bread and  that was one of the hallmarks. She never bought bread, it was always  homemade. And she had what we always referred to as the industrial  oven. It was a great big, red oven that was a stand-alone unit that I don   t  know how many     I forgot what the brand name is but it   s out here in the barn.  It   s huge.  Magic Chef.  It was huge. It could probably cook twenty loaves of bread in it at one  time. It was one of those things you would see in a restaurant. I mean, it  was huge. It took up the whole kitchen.  It   s red enamel. I kind of dabbled in antiques a little bit and I   ve seen  one other red stove like it. So, I don   t know if they are that rare or  whether I just have not been around enough, but I   ve seen one other red  stove like this stove out there. I don   t remember how many people it  took to move it. Four?  A bunch.  It is all there.  She would start cooking bread on a Saturday morning and we lived a  half a mile across the pasture, and when she   d set the bread out to rise,  you could smell the yeast at the house across the road. My sister and I  would smell that yeast on Saturday and we knew it was about time to get  on over here so we could get the good bread. She made her own butter  and stuff, too, so she would take the loaves out and put that real butter  on top of them and then cut it out of the pan and we   d eat bread. It was  15  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  good. She was a great cook. But you never knew what type of things that  you were going to get. I mean, you would get rhubarb pie, you would get  mincemeat pie, you would get, oh, fifteen different kinds of pies for  Thanksgiving, Christmas. But you never knew exactly what it would be,  whether it would be   well, there would be a choice but they would be  all sitting there together and if you were the first one to cut in, you didn   t  know exactly what kind of pie you were going to get right off the bat  because I mean, there would be cobblers, peach cobbler, blackberry  cobbler and rhubarb pie and strawberry rhubarb pie and vinegar pie,  which she always used to say that    I don   t know, you probably had a  few vinegar pies in your life; it was kind of like a lemon pie, but it was  vinegar.  Not if I could get out of it. (Laughter)  And then there was always brisket and turkey and fifteen different kinds  of cookies and different kinds of vegetables and stuff and four or five  different kinds of pickles and various canned things she   d grown in the  garden.  And she raised her own chickens and ham in the smokehouse?  Well, these two guys, and undoubtedly probably you two both, the  family ate three meals a day together. They gathered around the table.  Nobody started eating until everybody was seated and you were  inspected to see if your hands were clean. And his dad always had to go  back and wash his hands again. (Laughter) Held up eating until he got  cleaned up  (Laughter)  He just wanted to be the first one to the table, huh? (Laughter)  Yes.  Like I said, she did not waste anything as far as food. I guess that is  because of growing up during the Depression. But, probably the one  thing that I remember, I was down here one time and she made hash.  And I don   t know what was in it, but it was good. It was one of the best  things that I can remember that got reheated that we ate and then in the  next meal that was halfway good    (Laughter)  Edible? ( Laughter)  Yes. (Laughter)  Well was this red stove electric or gas?  16  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  It was gas.  It was gas.  And then the woodstove, was it strong enough to heat the second floor?  Would you have to     Oh, there was no heat up there. The winters were cold and     There was twenty blankets on each bed.  A lot of people don   t like rain, but in the summertime when the rain  came it cooled it off and it was a lot    It was a story-and-a-half house. I  always liked rain because it cooled things off. (Laughs)  There was a water cooler in the house. There was no air conditioning. In  fact, she probably even fought her water cooler, too.  She didn   t run it very often.  She was a tough old bird.  Did she have indoor plumbing?  Yes.  When we were around. I mean, when they were little I don   t think they  had      No, we didn   t. When we carried the water up, no. When they remodeled  the house, they put in a bathtub, but no running water. We had no  running water so they carried the water up here, poured it in the bathtub  and first one in got the best water. (Laughter) The water was re-used.  She used to have a bamboo planted out back here and there was a garden  hose with a showerhead and I remember as a kid taking a shower out  there with cold water. I don   t know when that went away, but it was like  an arbor, you know, that was out there.  The first running water was one faucet in the house   one cold water  faucet. That was a real treat. (Laughter) That was before the Rural  Water. We had a pump on the well below the hill there.  I remember working on that pump down there below. Eventually it was  shut off and she went to this one out here.  17  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Yes.  And you had how many brothers and sisters?  Had two brothers and a sister.  Did she divide chores based on gender? Did the sister have to spend  most of the time helping with the cooking?  Well, my sister, she primarily did help around the house. My two  brothers and I, we helped with the cows and the hogs and did the chores.  Do you remember the first tractor?  Yes. It was an old Fordson tractor. Very, very old. I don   t have any idea.  It was probably, oh, in the late    30s, we got the old Fordson tractor and I  remember where they had horses around and to start it, they would hook  the horses up to pull the tractor to start it. The next tractor was a B John  Deere, which was about a twenty-five horse, and it was a real  improvement in the farming operation. (Laughs) We still have that old  tractor up at      Yes.  I still remember      Still had it until they hauled it off back in, probably early    70s.  Yes.  And then Dad decided he wanted another    B    so he drove to Iowa and  bought one and hauled it back and it   s still parked out here.  This gasoline plant that Todd talked about, my dad worked there, and  the John B John Deere, it was a hand-crank. You had to spin the  flywheel to start it and we couldn   t start it so before he went to work, he  would start it and send my brother, his  Todd   s  dad, out to the field  together to plow or do whatever he wanted done that day and we were  probably   I might have been eight or nine and my brother was seven or  six, and to think back about two of them on the tractor it was awfully  dangerous. One was dangerous enough. Pat  Smalley  was my brother,  Todd   s dad   s name. He was always big for his age. I made the joke that  mother weaned him when he started carrying her around nursing her.  (Laughter) He started school when he was four years old. Anyway, one  time he and I started to go somewhere on the tractor and it had a hand  clutch and you pushed the clutch in and I shoved it in and he was  18  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  standing beside me and it threw him forward and straddled over the  flywheel and it almost ate his leg off. He was so big and strong, so much  bigger than I was, when he fell forward, he grabbed the clutch and I  couldn   t pull it back and I don   t remember how we got the tractor  stopped. He cried all night that night. They did not even take him to the  doctor. You didn   t go to the doctor for minor things, but he had a big  burnt place on his leg here, on his calf of his leg      And the hair never grew there after that.  It didn   t bother him because he went on to play professional baseball.  Could hit a ball a mile.  The next tractor after that was a    G    and that was the tractor that I grew  up on was the    G    and I   ve got one like it still. Then in 1972 we moved  into the diesel age so we bought our first diesel tractor in 1972, which  was a John Deere 2010. We kept it up until the time my dad died and  then I had some hydraulic problems with it or something. It was in about     81 or    82 and I decided that at that point if I was going to continue to do  this that I wanted a different tractor, so I bought a different tractor,  which was a John Deere 2640 and they have one now, too. It burned up  in a barn fire and so at that point then I bought a 3010 from my uncle. I  bought some more land and decided that that one was not big enough  and I bought another one, which was a 4430, I guess then. And that  burned up in the field and then I bought a 4440 and since then is when  we got a 3010, a    G   , a 4440 and a 4020. And they   ve got a 3020 and  a     We had a 3130.      3130 and a 2640.  You can   t ride those all at one time so you must have help? Are they  used for a particular     You can never have too many tractors. (Laughter)  We   re always getting stuck or something. Christmas this past year we  would not have got out if we would not have had that one. It was drifted  up so bad that you could not move around out here.  Where would you have to go to get them?  Mine are parked in three different barns around. I have got land across  the street, land up north and over there where I live and then over west  and usually I have at least one tractor on each place. The smaller tractors  19  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  I use for hay and the big ones I use for tilling the ground.  Have you participated in rings, where you help your neighbors?  Yes, we do that a lot. Well, I was helping a neighbor yesterday, as a  matter of fact. Yes, I mean, you do not survive out here without  neighbors because you   re always in a bind for some particular reason,  whether it is weather related or if you have done something you should  not have and need help. All the properties around here have been held  within families for generations and that is why, if something comes  open, you buy it because it won   t come around for another generation.  The people that own the north section up there, the Cundiffs, they   ve  been around forever, and the Downeys and so on and so forth. The  Harshmans, stuff has been passed generations down through the years  and you know, the land never comes up for sale; it   s just passed down.  So your closest neighbor is a mile or half a mile away?  Half a mile, yes. Well, depending on how you go, it could be a mile if  you go the other direction. Yes, everybody gets along real well and helps  each other as time goes on. You know, you always have a cow that gets  out and you need help or you need help getting it back in and they say,     Oh, don   t worry about it. We   ll get it in when we get our cows in here  in another week or two and you can pick it up then.    The community as  a whole is a real tight-knit community.  So you have more than your eighty acres?  Oh yes, yes. So does he.  How many head of cattle?  I own about a hundred cows and then, of course, subsequent calves and  bulls and stuff like that. How many you guys got?  I think we got thirty right now. Thirty head. We sold half of them about  the first of the year. My brother was involved in an operation and he  decided he was going to get out so he took half the cows and sold them.  Any donkeys?  I had one one time. That was an experience. I don   t think I will have  another. We had a coyote problem for awhile and somebody told me that  donkeys would take care of the coyotes pretty good. Somebody failed to  tell me the fact that after they chase coyotes, they like to chase cows,  too. Jerry was his name, he liked to chase the cows so I finally had to get  20  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  rid of him.  Jerry, the donkey?  Yes. (Laughter)  We had heard that tale too, that they were good for chasing coyotes.  When there are no coyotes around then they like to chase cows, too.  So when you were a child you plowed with a horse?  Most of my childhood. My sister Kenita graduated from Oklahoma  A M and she taught school for several years. I graduated in 1958. I  started in the fall of 1950 and during that school year, my dad died and I  didn   t want my mother to have the expense of sending me to school, so I  quit for a while. I started back in 1954, I think, and then graduated in  1958 and then I went to Nebraska and taught school for seven and half  years and had to quit because of my health; I was slowly starving to  death. And so I went to work for the government, the US Department of  Agriculture. I worked then until 1965; that   s when I went to work for the  Department of Agriculture and I worked there in Nebraska until 1972  and I came down to the University of Oklahoma and opened up a  training center for the Department of Agriculture, the Farmers Home  Administration, and we trained the employees for the entire country. I  was the director of the training center and then we moved the training  center to Kansas City in, I think late 1979. Then in 1980 I went into  Washington, D.C. and worked in Washington, D. C. until the house  burned down in    86. I came back after the house burned down.  And then moved to Shawnee.  Wilburton.  Yes. Then I met this lady over here and then I went back to Washington  and was the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs up there until  1994 when I retired and came back here.  So it has always been home even though you moved      Always going to be home.  Do you want to  tell us about your life  from high school forward then?  Well, my dad died when I was fifteen in 1979.  He was  still gone at that  time and so after Daddy died then I took over farming, which I was  21  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  farming for Daddy at the time up until that point. So I guess in    79 when  my dad passed away then I kind of took over the operations here and I  graduated from high school in 1980 and went to college. During the  summertime I   d come back and farm but in the wintertime then  Grandma and my mom and my brother-in-law fed the cattle. After I had  graduated from college I went to work at Oklahoma State in the Disease  Laboratory and farmed on the side and worked there for several years  under Dr. Morton. I left there and went to work for Baxter Health Care  and continued to farm. Worked there for seventeen years and went to  work for Mercury  Marine  and then they decided to shut Mercury down  here so I went to work back over at Tulsa, so I still farmed and worked  my other job.  It is quite a commute.  Quite a commute.  And you live on the farm?  I live a half mile west of here.  I   m assuming you graduated from OSU then?  I graduated from Oklahoma Christian University.  Not the other one further south?  No, no. I got my degrees in chemistry and microbiology; dual degree in  chemistry and microbiology and I played baseball. That is the reason  why I chose there and I got to go to school free for playing baseball.  And that   s not too far from here.  Yes, it   s fifty miles, or forty miles.  And you have one sister?  I have one sister and three kids, two girls and a boy. The oldest daughter  is a dental hygienist in the Air Force. She just got back from Germany  last week. She had been over there three-and-half years. She has three  little boys, her and her husband do. Then my son is in the Coast Guard.  He is a rescue swimmer. One of those crazy idiots that jumps out of a  helicopter to save somebody that messed up bad. He is stationed in New  Orleans. Then I have a daughter who is a junior in high school and she  helps me more than any of the rest of them do. (Laughs) She is quite an  accomplished tractor driver.  22  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  I was going to ask if any of the three are interested in staying on the  farm or at least keeping the farm?  I think Terry, the son will come back when he gets out of there, and the  daughter, you can turn her loose on anything and she can go do it. She  does not like to drive the combine, that is the only thing, but any  implement behind the tractor she   s comfortable with.  Were they in 4-H while they were in school?  FFA  Future Farmers of America . All three of them were in FFA but  none of them were in 4-H.  So they would compete in the county fairs too?  No, they never did. They played baseball and softball and stuff like that.  Those seasons kind of comingled with the fair seasons so they never  showed, but they know their way around a cow, so it is okay.  And for a while it was a dairy?  They had dairy cattle. We had one when I was growing up that we  would milk, but then most would be Herefords. They   ve got Limo,  Herefords and Angus, but I have got primarily Hereford cattle.  I just wondered if the granddaughters could milk.  Well, Brianna has milked out a cow or two when there was a calf that  had trouble, but they haven   t had to milk every morning and every  evening.  They   ve taken us through their lives up to this point, so do you want to  chime in from high school forward?  I graduated from Cushing in 1976 and when Dad was running the  training center down in Norman I went to school down there for two  years at the University of Oklahoma and decided, I think, that school  wasn   t for me. I went to work, got married and I have three kids also. I  have two girls and had a boy. That is kind of how I wound up here. My  son was living with my brother in this house. In 2002, three days before  Christmas, he got killed in a car wreck and I knew my brother couldn   t  do this by his self out here. I packed up and moved into Coyle.  There   s  a  lot of work out here. I drive a truck; I have worked for Nabisco,  National Biscuit Company, which is owned by Kraft Food now, for  twenty-six years. I get up about one or one-thirty in the morning and I  was working in Oklahoma City and, just like all the other corporations in  23  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  America right now, they are downsizing and they fired a couple of guys  up in Tulsa. I volunteered to go up there about five years ago and I have  been there ever since. So I drive eighty-six miles one way to work. I  usually have to be up there by three or four o   clock in the morning, so it  makes for a long day.  And get off when, if you have to be there so early?  I usually get home about one-thirty, two o   clock in the afternoon and try  to get done what I can get done out here.  Four more years and you can retire?  I am hoping. (Laughter) I do not know if I am going to last that long or  not. It   s wearing on me pretty good right now. I can retire and take a  hickey on my retirement if I want to and I may chose to do that, I don   t  know. We   ll see.  And go back from driving the truck to the tractor?  Yes.  We share weather reports quite a bit.  Yes, I leave before he does      He calls at seven o   clock when I am on the road and says,    How much  did it rain last night?    and I will tell him and then he will say,    Well,  okay, I will call you when I get home.    So, we share weather reports all  the time.  During the snow here awhile back, it took me three hours to drive eighty  six miles and I came home. It took me two and half to get home so I  spent five and half hours on the road that day and wound up working  a   I went all the way to Stillwell, so usually when I get home I have got  300 or 350 miles under my belt for the day.  You need the gas plant on the property again, don   t you? (Laughter)  From when my mother died in 1989, and that fall, Kim   s brother, Kirk   Smalley , he   s just younger than Kim, he moved out here on the farm.  He was working in Dallas at the time and then he was the operator from  1989 until this past year when he went in partnership with Kim two  years ago. Kim always had livestock here and helped when he could, but  they decided to split. Kirk is a sheet metal worker and he works almost  entirely down at Tinker Air Force Base, he has a full-time job down  24  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  there.  Matherly Construction Company. They   re the largest sheet metal  company in Oklahoma.  But this past year, he built a house up on another place we have up here  and is now living over there and does not have an interest in the  operations.  So what is the total acreage for today?  For me? About 400 acres. I don   t know how many you guys got.  Around 200.  Yes.  A piece? So have you walked all 400 acres?  I know most of it.  You know where every tree and rock is?  Pretty well, yes. Because you   ve got to hunt for cattle every once in a  while.  And growing up did you swim in the ponds?  Oh, absolutely.  I think as a kid, the cooling tower from the old gas plant drained into the  pond down here and Dad would always tell us how cold the water was.  You know, it was always full. The ground out here is pretty sandy and it  soaks the water in pretty good. After they tore the old gas plant down  and the cooling tower, I guess most of the water went away and  basically there for awhile it was just basically a mud hole. It would hold  a little water and during the summer it might be yea deep and full of  tadpoles and that is about all it was good for until we had all that rain a  few years ago and washed the pond dam out and he got with the SCS   Soil Conservation Service  service and had the dam rebuilt and so far  it   s held water and has not ever gone dry.  So when a piece of machinery would break down would one of you be  able to fix it or would you have to have someone come in to do it?  For most minor things, anyway, if it   s not an engine overhaul or  25  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  something like that, then we can fix it. The engine overhauls, we  typically enlist the help of neighbors. (Laughing)  I overhauled one of those old John Deeres with a screwdriver and a pair  of pliers.  You   re more talented than I am. (Laughter)  Bailing wire and duct tape      One of the old two cylinder jobs.  My wife works for P K so that helps. She is a parts gal, so     Well, that helps, I   m sure.  Yes.  So when you bale hay do you do the square or the round?  Both.  I try to do round bales. Todd does square bales, has people haul them,  but it   s too labor intensive as far as hauling hay. The first year I was up  here I hauled probably 1100 or 1200 bales off of the place we did. When  you   ve got a tractor that can pick up a round bale versus a bunch of  square bales it   s less time consuming.  These guys have got it easy. We used to have an old baler that threw the  hay in with a pitchfork and tie the bales. The first job I ever had was  riding a horse, that horse-powered baler that a horse went around and  around. Got fifty cents a day to keep the horse moving.  And how did you keep it moving?  Lead it or ride it?  No, ride it. Just kick him in the ribs.  So you got tired of going around in circles yourself?  We used to have an old man that lived down here in this house down at  the bottom of the hill. He would lease his place over here. I think Todd  told me a story one time about his dad baling hay down here in the  bottom and how many bales he got off this place and the old man talked  Todd   s dad into bringing over one of the old hand-fed balers; I think he  26  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  got four square bales off of it.  Yes, and Daddy was getting like 350 square bales that he baled.  (Laughter)  And these bales would be like ten or twelve foot long. (Laughter) And it  would take four or five people to pick one of them up. That is how they  operated. I guess they compacted the hay in there so tight that     And you better get it put up before the rain came?  Yes.  Or it would be twice as heavy.  I put all the alfalfa in square bales and everything else I put in round  bales. Square bales go in the barn     I understand there are two different sizes of round? Someone was telling  us     There are several, there are several.  Several.  There   s four, five and six foot and then now there   s three or four  different sizes of square bales too. The regular standard square bales and  then they have three by threes and four by fours and four by sixes.  So in your youth you had to help bale hay as spending money?  Yes, these kids now, the most I ever got for hauling hay was three cents  a bale and now the standard is about twenty cents a bale. They   ve done  well on their inflation period, I guess.  What would be one of your favorite farm stories? It could be anything.  Favorite memory of the farm.  I think the thing that stands out in my mind, which Uncle Buddy said  that   I call him Uncle Buddy, it is Keith, but we know him as Buddy     when I was a kid, we had an old truck. My dad was a big guy; big and  strong. And we were hauling hay and I was up about, I don   t know, eight  or nine bales high sitting on top of the truck and Daddy was taking them  and throwing them up to me and I was stacking them. I had stacked it  out and there were a few bales left and I was probably up ten, fifteen feet  high and Daddy asked me, said,    Where do you want this one?    I was  27  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  twelve, thirteen years old and I was kind of smart aleck kid I guess and I  said,    Oh, you can   t throw it up here.    Well, it was the wrong thing to  say because he hit me in the chest with it and knocked me off the other  side of the truck. (Laughs)  So that was a good story and then, my cousin and I, Bill Luster, which  he was telling about his daughter, were hauling hay out of the bottom  down here and Grandma was helping us and we put it in the old wood  barn out here. It is kind of hard to neck it up in there and back up.  Grandma would drive the truck in the hay field but she didn   t like to  drive it up the hill to make the corner and put it in the barn. She was  probably eighty years old, I would imagine, at the time; seventy-five,  eighty. So we were hauling the hay and we finished stacking up the back  and getting ready to head up the hill and Grandma yelled at me and says,     Todd get up here and drive us up the hill for me.    I jumped up in the  front of the truck there and right as I opened the door, a whisk of wind  came up in the truck and Grandma was sitting there next me on the seat  and she sneezed and she spit her teeth out on the floor and she looked at  me with the straightest face as anybody could see and just said,    I bet  you can   t do that.    (Laughter) But I   ll never forget that as long as I live.  I laughed and laughed and laughed.  And do you have one or two?  I can   t think of any right at the moment.  Any mischief you got into?  The discipline today would have got your parents in jail because  whenever you were told,    Whenever your dad gets home you   re going to  get a spanking,    it was pretty bad. (Laughs) That wasn   t something to  look forward to. I wasn   t old enough to remember  this story,  but my  parents had been to town to buy their monthly supply of groceries. And  when they came back, my sister and I (we were the only children at the  time), she was a couple of years older than I am and according to the  story, my parents went out to do the chores when they got back and they  just set the groceries in the house. When they came in from doing the  chores, we somehow had gotten a fifty pound bag of flour open and my  sister had dumped it all over me and I had been all over the house and I  guess scattered flour all over the house. My mother said she just sat  down and cried because she said she didn   t know how she was going to  feed us for the month.  Did you get punished for that?  Oh, I don   t remember. I was not old enough. I don   t even remember the  28  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  event but that was the story. But we were a very close-knit family. We,  of course, had fights, but everybody was pretty close-knit.  Did you go to church a lot? Was that important?  Yes, to the little church you came by up there. It   s a Quaker church. But,  very seldom with the parents. They would take us to church, but they  didn   t go. They had chores to do and things.  With how everybody has the second job, you farm part time and you  work full time, what are some of your bigger challenges that you face  today with keeping the old place running?  Well, I think the biggest thing is speed. I have upsized equipment in  order that it doesn   t take as much time to do it. You can run over a piece  of ground with a 150 horsepower tractor and a five bottom plow a whole  lot quicker than you can run over one with a forty-five horsepower and a  three bottom. And so I think probably speed is how I have dealt with it.  And the kids help out a lot and that   s another reason why you have more  than one tractor because you can be running one and somebody else can  be running one at the same time, so that helps a lot. It   s easier now than  it was, I guess, because things always shut down during baseball season.  You know, the kids all played baseball. We played baseball. And when  there was a ball game, it was time to shut down, it did not make any  difference what was going on. You went to town to play ball or  whatever. So now the kids are grown. I coached the American Legion  team in Stillwater for seventeen years and I have given that up so I don   t  have to work stuff in and around American Legion baseball games now  either, so that helps quite a bit, but you hurry up and get everything  ready to go and go to a ballgame. (Laughs)  I think Todd hit it on the head   time is everything for me. There is just  not enough time to do everything out here that needs to be done. I have  gone out and I have bought a disc mower and I can mow twenty acres in  six or eight hours versus spending three days down there with a swather.  Todd and I help each other out quite a bit. I get off earlier than he does  and I will cut the hay and lay it down and get it raked and he will bring  his round baler over and he will roll it. Back when the weather was so  bad here, over the last couple of months I have fed his cows for him  before he got home in the evening so he wouldn   t have to get out there at  dark and try to mess with it. We pretty well help each other out, when  we can.  These guys are what are known as sun-downer farmers. They do most of  the work after sundown.  29  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Lights. Lights were a good thing. When they developed lights it helped.  Headlights on the tractors. They even have windshield wipers now we  are told. And air conditioning in some of them.  Yes.  Well is the baseball or softball field still used?  We   ve had a few ballgames out there.  Yes, we   ve had a few Fourth of July ballgames out there.  It seems like it   s still a family affair then?  Pretty well. We get along pretty good.  So what do you see for the next hundred years?  Well, we are getting kind of thin. I think I   ve got the only male Smalley  still of the next generation. Kim   s son was killed in a car accident. At  least my portion will go to my son to keep it in the family. Don   t  know     I   ve got two grandsons coming up. I don   t know what that   s going to  turn out to be, but neither one of my daughters, I don   t know that they  would ever wind up out here. Of course, you never know, you know?  There may be a surprise somewhere down the road.  Of course, Kim   s son that was killed, Jarrod  Smalley , he was really in  love with this place and we depended on him to be the guy that filled in  the gap, but it wasn   t to be.  Well, maybe a son-in-law?  My oldest daughter has indicated that she is going to move back after  she gets out of the service and they   ve got three little boys, so that will  help a lot when they move back.  Well, it is a pretty good location. You can get to Stillwater or Guthrie or  Oklahoma City.  Pretty easy.  Tulsa is a little bit far, but do-able.  30  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Todd Smalley  Kim Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  I like being out here because, I mean, you don   t realize how peaceful it  is when you can come home from Tulsa or come home from Oklahoma  City or whatever and just come out here and you don   t have the noise,  you don   t have the traffic. There   s nobody around. You can walk out on  the porch at night and you can hear the coyotes or the geese or whatever,  and it   s just    I never really understood the Hillhaven Farm concept. I  knew Grandma always enjoyed it out here and that Haven name has  really taken a new meaning for me, you know, because it   s a haven out  here, it really is.  There used to be a train that ran across the river. The river is about half a  mile south here, the Cimarron River, and there used to be a train track  that came from Cushing and went to Guthrie and I don   t know where all.  At night, it used to be the train would go through and the coyotes would  all began their orchestra. I do not know if you can still hear them     Oh yes, they still howl pretty good at sundown.  That was really something neat to hear those coyotes. They were just  like an orchestra.  And the train does not come through anymore?  The rail bed is still there though. If you go on the south side of the river  it is still there.  When the oil companies came in out here and drilled the wells they had  the pump jacks out here that had the big mufflers on them, and I can  remember being upstairs as a kid and you could hear those pump jacks  and the mufflers just echoing. You know, Todd had one right outside his  bedroom window. I am sure that he was glad when they finally took  them out and did away with them.  You get used to it.  Right across the river over here is a place known as Horse Thief Canyon  and the outlaws used to hide out over there. My mother told the story of  being over there one time when the outlaws would carry ears of corn to  feed their horses and they had a feedbox built back under in the canyon  there. She was over there one time when the corn cobs were still wet  from the horses being there. They had just left. My grandmother told the  story about seeing the bounty hunters come by with an outlaw tied to the  back of a horse.  And with the train, there might have been some hobos?  31  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Kim Smalley  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Keith Smalley  Finchum  Keith Smalley  Todd Smalley  Finchum  Might have been.  Is there anything else you want to make sure we get down before we  close out?  Well, Kenita   s gone and Pat   s gone and it   s only you and Tim left of the  older generation.  Yes, just Tim and I are left. Pat, Todd   s dad, had a heart attack and died  in    79. And my sister died in    98. She was older than I was.  You   re the oldest one.  I know. Every breath I take I set a new record. (Laughter)  They need to listen to you a little bit then, don   t they?  Yes, they ought to. Of course, on my mother   s side, she was a McGuire,  Irish people and her family, you couldn   t kill them with an ax. So, I  think I got those genes.  Yes, they all lived a long time.  Well, we appreciate you giving up your valuable time to talk with us  today. It has been a pleasure hearing your story and hopefully in the  next 100 years there will be good ones, too. So thank you very much.  -------  -------
