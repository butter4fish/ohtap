Speaker 1: All right my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am can you please state your full name and spell it for us please.
Speaker 2: Jane Darwin McBeth Walton [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton].  D-A-R-W-I-N, M-C-capital B-E-T-H, W-A-L-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Charlotte, North Carolina, September 16, 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay, and ma'am what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a retired public school teacher, and I guess you'd say I'm an author of children's books and I am on the adjunct faculty at National Louis University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And you were also a popular singer at one time too--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) professional singer, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there are three different occupations to get to today.
Speaker 2: I think they all sort of go together though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean it's, it's all, they all have served my purpose. I mean being a, a singer certainly helps you with teaching and being a writer is sort of a byproduct of being a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's--my inspiration for writing came from, through my teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date November 23rd--22nd, nine- 2008 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at my home.
Speaker 1: Where in?
Speaker 2: In Lombard, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.
Story_ID: 613662
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management has compelled me to ask of everyone and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Oh my.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food. Gee I have too many favorite foods, that's my problem.  I'd say I, I really prefer vegetables.  You want me a special favorite?  Well then I guess, you won't believe this, but broccoli is one of my favorite foods (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, broccoli.
Speaker 2: Yep broccoli is--
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: A favorite color, yellow.
Speaker 1: All right, favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Now that's a difficult one because I, I love all time, all the seasons, I love them all.  There's something about fall that sort of, there's sort of an expectancy about fall that seems to be a little bit more mysterious than even spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I guess I'd have to go with fall.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Back home in the Carolinas I really like to go back to North Carolina and South Carolina to visit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I feel like I'm in touch with myself when I go back there.
Speaker 1: The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, one I say, do you mean my own personally- personal philosophy?
Speaker 1: Sure, it could be yours or someone else's, as long as it's your favorite.
Speaker 2: Well, everybody talks about ageism and I would say that age is what you've done with what you've had and what you have left to work with.
Story_ID: 613663
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John McBeth] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mary Simons, S-I-M-O-N-S, McBeth [Mary Simons McBeth].
Speaker 1: Okay, and was Simons her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and, well what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in South Carolina, October 24, 1905 [sic.].
Speaker 1: In South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you know exactly where?
Speaker 2: In Blaney, South Carolina [Elgin, South Carolina]. Columbia [South Carolina] I imagine was the nearest place, nearest big town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course I'm, I'm sure in those days they had midwives, so there would be no hospital so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay, Blaney near Columbia, okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors, your ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that group of people?
Speaker 2: Well I can actually go back to my, my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Nora [Nora Simons].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, she was part Irish, Indian [Native American], and I'm not sure, I'm not, I'm--actually my--something happened there.  There was a divorce or a separation or something of the, of the, the great-great-grand fam- grand- grandparents.  And so I'm not sure where the African American came in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, but she goes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But my grandmother she was, but she was half Indian, Cherokee Indian, and my grandmother was, looked more Indian than anything, but she married a, an African American man, Napoleon Simons.  Her name was Rena [Rena Simons].
Speaker 1: This is your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Grandmother Rena.
Speaker 2: But, I can't remember Grandma Nora's--she was a Simons also.  Both--
Speaker 1: Nora was a Simons too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a Simons also.  Both my grand- my, my mother, my grandmother and grandfather had the same last name.  They were not related, but they had the same last names.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandmother was Rena Simons, and she married a Simons?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, well this takes, I mean your great-grandmother goes back to--if your mother was born in 1905, then your grandmother was born in the 19th century and about 1880 or so or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she was born in, in the, yeah in the late '80s [sic.] because she--let's see I should have figured that out.  You should have told me because I could probably have figured that out.  I do have a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now 18- 1880s and that means her, your great-grandmother then goes back maybe to the 1860s.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's right after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.  So are there any stories that are passed down on that side?
Speaker 2: No I don't, you know I never heard any stories of slavery.  Nobody told us any stories of, of slavery in, in the family, so, and of course I didn't think about it at the time when I was young enough to, to be aware that this, this kind of thing that there had to be something in there, but I don't, I don't, I don't recall--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) my grandmother speaking of having ever been a slave.
Speaker 1: Okay or those days.
Story_ID: 613664
Speaker 1: Now my [maternal] grandfather was, my grandfather was different.  He was, he came from a, a family and he inherited a lot of land from somebody.  So, I'm not sure how that goes and I guess I, I should find out about it, but I hadn't thought about it.
Speaker 2: What was your, what's your grandfather's name?
Speaker 1: My grandfather was Napoleon Simons.
Speaker 2: Napoleon Simons okay.  Simons an interesting name 'cause sometimes it's Jewish, sometime it Catholic.  You just don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: --I mean I think more it's, I think French or French extraction.
Speaker 1: And, and then Napoleon is such a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --different name also.
Speaker 2: I think it may have had something to do with, I mean is, has a French derivation Si- Simons does, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I don't--so there are no stories about where, where the Simons came from?
Speaker 1: There were a lot of Simons down there.  They were just, just a tru- just all over the graveyard, all over the cemetery there, Simons, and some of them were relatives and they aren't--some of them are not relatives and some of them you know, so I'm, I haven't spent as much time as I probably should have to collecting the stories.  I, even though I went back and took pictures and interviewed people and I haven't had time.  I haven't taken the time to connect all of the, the sentences.
Speaker 2: Okay, but you said your grandfather, Napoleon, inherited land?
Speaker 1: Yeah,--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he had, yes in, in Blaney [Elgin, South Carolina] he had, they had, he and his brother, Walt [ph.], which is another interesting thing two brothers married two sisters.  And he and his brother inherited this, this, about sixty acres there and they farmed this land together.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Predo- predominantly cotton.
Speaker 2: So, so his brother, Walt, was also your, your Uncle Walt--
Speaker 1: Yeah, my un- my--
Speaker 2: --also married, he married your, your grandmother's sister.
Speaker 1: My grandmother's sister.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Okay, do you suspect that they probably inherited the land from some white person in the pa- in the past that owned it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I suspect that.  I, I strongly suspect that.  Yeah, I'm sure they were, they were mixed, you know they were, they were definitely mixed, mixed race.  So, I'm not sure how that came about.
Speaker 2: So some white paternity.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess the bottom line is that they either were--passed land down to them because he owned it, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay. That's often--
Speaker 1: That's what I suspect.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it makes sense.
Story_ID: 613665
Speaker 1: So are there any other stories from these, from the, the Simons on either side about life in Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I know that I have lots of stories.  I'm not sure that any would be especially applicable here.  I just spent a lot of my time on the farm as a child. My--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: My mother [Mary Simons McBeth] used to pack us up on the train when school closed in Charlotte [North Carolina]. I'm living in Charlotte now, and she would put us on the train and we would go to South Carolina on the train for the summer vacation and we spent the summers running around the farm and, and helping with chores and just growing up in general as farm children.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 613666
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Mary Simons McBeth] have to say about going--did she go to school in Columbia [South Carolina] or, or no?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to Mather Academy [Camden, South Carolina] and--
Speaker 1: Is that like a public school around there or?
Speaker 2: Well actually Mather Academy was a private school.  It was sort of a, I'm not sure how they did that, but there, she was a farm girl and they didn't, and she, of course the schools only went to--if there were any, there was a small, it was a little school house.  I remember the school house, but it seems like a couple, couple of rooms.  But, she did go to, she went onto eighth grade I guess it was at this academy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was it like a special school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Most of the, the girls, most of, seems to me my aunt went there and so I'm sure, and then my cousin attended there, so it was not, I'm not sure, I'm sure it wasn't anything exclusive, but it was just something that people who could afford to do that just did.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it--
Speaker 2: And, huh?
Speaker 1: Was it run by the church or something or?
Speaker 2: I don't have any clue, I don't know, but I'm, I'm pretty sure it hasn't been, it, it probably is still there.  I probably could, could find out about Mather Academy because I know my cousin, Elizabeth [ph.], went there before she came to Chicago [Illinois] to go to school with us, I mean to Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She came to Charlotte and spent some time with us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did your mother have a chance to go to high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Story_ID: 613667
Speaker 1: How did she end up in, in Charlotte [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, she married my dad [John McBeth].  He lived in Columbia [South Carolina] also, and they met at a church conference as I recall and they married and Daddy moved, they moved to Greensboro from there, from Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay, Greensboro, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Greensboro, North Carolina (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) North Carolina okay.
Speaker 2: And they lived there for, oh long enough for my older sister to be born, and then, then they moved back to Chi- to Charlotte, moved to Charlotte and that's where we spent mos- I grew up in Charlotte.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of us were born there.
Story_ID: 613668
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: John McKinley McBeth [John McBeth].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Columbia [South Carolina] in August, August 3rd, August 3, 1904.
Speaker 1: Nineteen o-four [1904], okay. And so what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace the McBeths?
Speaker 2: Not much.  It seems as if dad were sort of a maverick, and he left home fairly early because he didn't like farming.  His dad was a farmer, and he didn't like farming and there was Irish and Scotch Irish and Indian [Native American] also in the background there.  And, and there, of course there, there is no record of slavery in my dad's side either that we know of.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents on that side?
Speaker 2: I did not know my father's--grandparents.  As I said, he left home and I'm not really sure under which conditions he left home, but I sort of suspect that, I suspect that he was rebellious and just left home and we never, we never went to visit his parents--
Speaker 1: So, it seemed like something--
Speaker 2: --which was really weird.
Speaker 1: Something very serious dramatically happened huh.
Speaker 2: Something dramatic.  However, none of my, my cousins or my dad's--I did meet his, his sister, his siblings and, and many of his cousins because they still have the McBeth reunion there.  We still have a McBeth family reunion, but nobody seems to know what really happened with Daddy except that he had gone to, gosh I can't remember, isn't that terrible? The, a, a junior college there, college there in, in Columbia.  Gosh I can't, isn't that terrible and I, I visited it when I was in, in, in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Was it Ben- not Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] I guess huh, not?
Speaker 2: Benedict is in North Carolina [sic.].
Speaker 1: No, okay.  Was it Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina], which, which one is it Bennett there?
Speaker 2: Isn't that awful.  No Bennett is in North Carolina too.  I'm gonna try--it's in, this is Columbia.  Isn't that terrible?  I'll think of it, I'll think of it.  But, that's where, but he did go to school there and he took, now I guess it was some sort of--he studied to be a barber.  He was a barber and--
Speaker 1: There's Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]. I don't know, I'm guessing those names I assume.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's terrible, it's just, well.
Speaker 1: Livingstone [Livingstone College, Salisbury, North Carolina] is in North--yeah.
Speaker 2: As I said I'll, I'll, maybe I'll, I'll, maybe it will come to me.  Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina]. Duke keeps getting into my mind, but Duke is in North Carolina too and it's not Duke.
Speaker 1: St. Augustine [Saint Augustine's Junior College; Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], Claflin.
Speaker 2: Isn't that terrible.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, well we'll just--
Speaker 2: I'll think of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he did go to school.  He studied to be a barber?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did go to school.  He was an educated man. But he left home and I think that he was probably a snob and felt that he wanted to separate himself from his, from his farm background and so he moved, moved to North Carolina and we never, we never mentioned his parents and I have no clue about, even though I have pictures of their graves, et cetera, et cetera. And the dates on there, I can't remember them offhand.  Because when I went back to South Carolina I got those.  I got that.  I did--I went to the cemetery and I found out a lot of the history of that time, but I never have been able to connect the, the, the interpersonal aspects of it.  We had the statistics, but that's about it.  But he left and went to North, went to North Carolina and we just sort of adopted my mother's family and we spent our vacations with them and that was it.  And then I did meet my cousins and other relatives later on after, when my mother [Mary Simons McBeth] died.  She died very, very, very early, very young, thirty-nine.  I, after I, we came, went to Washington [D.C.] to school. Daddy moved to, to Ohio where we had, where he had some nieces and nephews and other relatives.
Speaker 1: Now this is, this is much later (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When is this?
Speaker 2: Well that was in the late '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 613669
Speaker 1: Well I don't want to get too far ahead, I--but my question right now is, is there a story about how your parents [Mary Simons McBeth and John McBeth] met that they tell?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I guess actually, I have not a clue how they met and fell--I know that they just courted through the church functions, that's all I know.  My uncle was, was a preacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he was, he did the, this, the, the churches, the black churches and of course he would occasionally be, he would visit Blaney [Elgin, South Carolina] and Sutton, Sutton Branch Church [Sutton Branch Baptist Church, Lugoff, South Carolina], I remember that, and Daddy would go there and that's why, that, that's what Auntie talked about all the time.  So--
Speaker 1: Now was Sutton Branch Church was--
Speaker 2: Sutton Branch Church was the name of the church.
Speaker 1: What denomination was it?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have been there, but I'm not sure of the denomination.  I went there when I was a little girl.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so you don't know how they met, but--
Speaker 2: You should have warned me of this, and I could have gotten some of his together you know.  I, (laughter) a lot of it I knew and I just--
Story_ID: 613670
Speaker 1: Well you'll know this part. When you think about their personalities and their talents and their dispositions--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, well--
Speaker 1: Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mo- my father [John McBeth].  I definitely took after my father.  He was a mu- he was a musician and he sang in church, started me singing in church when I was a little girl and that's how, how--my mother [Mary Simons McBeth] was musical also.  She played the piano.  The, played the, as a matter of fact they had an organ in, at her home and she played the old foot organ.  And, but my daddy was really the, the ham of the family and I suppose I took after him.
Speaker 1: Now, now what would he do?  Why, why do you say he was the ham of the family?  Did he always sing in public or in church?
Speaker 2: Oh, he, well he sang in church.  He loved to sing.  He loved to sing, and he was very, a very outgoing person and very, very sociable, a people person.  So, and everybody loved him.  He was very handsome and dashing and even my girlfriends liked him when I was in high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] (laughter).  So, he's, he was quite a guy.
Story_ID: 613671
Speaker 1: So, do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had four sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, and where do you fit in?
Speaker 2: I'm number two.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you name your sisters for us and just tell us a little bit about them?
Speaker 2: Curlese Bostick [Curlese McBeth Bostick (ph.)], she, Curlese was my oldest sister and she--well Claudette [ph.]--Curlese died fairly earl- fairly young also.  She, she moved from Charlotte [North Carolina] to Washington, D.C. and married Elliot, Elliot Bostick [ph.] who was a, a professor at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] at the time and they had one son and they, then she and Elliot divorced and she moved to New York and there she, and she died in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then my next sister, Mary, Mary Rapp [Mary McBeth Rapp] married Colonel John Rapp of United, of the United States Marine Corps, and they moved to, ultimately they retired to Anderson, South Carolina, and she lives there yet.  Now John died several years ago, but she's still in South Carolina, in Anderson.  Then my next sister, Eunice Tate [Eunice McBeth Tate].  She married Earl Bruce Tate, Jr., of Akron, Ohio, and they had one son, Earl Bruce Tate, III, and Eunice died in nineteen ninety--1994 I guess it was.  And my baby sister, Altonell Burhanan [Nellie McBeth Burhanan] lives in California, lives in Ca- California now.  She married Carl Burhanan who was the helicopter pilot that lifted Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] off the lawn when he left. And Carl, now Carl is a person whose life really should be told.  He has a fascinating life.
Speaker 1: So do you, do you know how to get in touch with him?  I assume you do.
Speaker 2: Oh sure I do.
Speaker 1: If you can give us his phone number we will.
Speaker 2: I sure will because now this is, this is somebody who truly--
Speaker 1: Carl, C-A-R-L--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Bulhanan.
Speaker 2: Burhanan, B-U-R-H-A-N-A-N.
Speaker 1: B-U-R, Burhanan okay, all right.  Nixon's helicopter pilot.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, he was, he worked for, for Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] also.  He piloted Johnson around.  He was really the, one of the experimental pilots, boxcar helicopter pilots during the war and, well he has a fascinating story, fascinating.  As a matter fact, I told Glennette [HistoryMaker Glennette Tilley Turner] about him and I really, he really should be, his story should be told because he did a lot of first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Really a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff.  So, and that's the family and Carl and Ellie have two children, two, two kids.  They are a boy and a girl, and they live in California also.
Story_ID: 613672
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest memory in, in the household?
Speaker 2: An earliest memory--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of myself (laughter)?
Speaker 1: And in, in the rest of the family, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember I suppose some of the startling memories that I had were, was when my, when the, my mother [Mary Simons McBeth] had diapers hanging in the kitchen. My baby sister, it was wintertime, and she had diapers hanging across the kitchen line because that was before diaper service or any other kind of di- so you had to wash those diapers.  So, and somehow or another the diapers caught, a diaper caught on fire, and my mother wasn't there.  So my sister and I pulled this, this line of diapers down (laughter), yanked the whole thing down and stuck it in the sink right fast.  It was just one of those miracles that we did that because it could have easily gotten out of hand, but I can remember that.  I remember another time, I remember when, when the Depression [Great Depression] hit.  I guess I, well when Daddy [John McBeth] got hit by the Depression, he had at that time a dry cleaning store and a, and a lawn- a barber, dual sides, a barbershop on one side and a dry cleaners on the other side. And I can remember gradually people stopped going to the barbershop and then they stopped getting their clothes cleaned and so Daddy was in trouble.  So, I remember when things were being sold.  And I remember the, the dining room set left first.  And I remember the piano.  I remember those things gradually being taken out of the house.
Story_ID: 613673
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking about the Depression [Great Depression] when the Depression struck.
Speaker 2: Oh right, so what--can you describe the neighborhood you lived in and--now you were born in Charlotte [North Carolina], right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The family is already there.
Speaker 1: You know I have the, that pictures right on the, the--
Speaker 2: That's fine we can get the picture later, but, but this is verbal.
Speaker 1: Well I, I grew, it was a neighborhood, it was a very, now that, the neighborhood is still there.  Of course they have, they put housing developments all down in the woods, but we, we lived in a community very much like this was (laughter) as a matter of fact. I mean not as, as, as high, socioeconomically, but we had, the homes were very nice homes.  They had indoor plumbing, central heat, bathtubs.  I mean we were, it was really a nice community when you stop and think how far, (background noise) long ago that was and how--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: It was, it was, I guess you would call it a middle class community or, at that time it was a middle class, nice, very nice homes and--
Speaker 1: Where there a name for the neighborhood at all?
Speaker 2: It was call, it was called Sel- they called it, they changed the name of it.  At the time, it was called Selwyn Park [sic. University Park, Charlotte, North Carolina], but it's, it's changed now.  And then they put, was it on, off of Double Oaks [Road]? Double Oaks and Oakland Avenue [sic. Oaklawn Avenue].  It was a small community on the (pause) northwest side of town, really on the fringes of, right near the edge of the, of Charlotte city limits.  Of course, the black community it went around the edge, the west edge of Chica- of Charlotte, and there was another community on the, in the Second Ward which was across town all the way on the other side of Charlotte.  So, the two communities were like that, but west Charlotte where I lived sort of blended into Biddleville [Charlotte, North Carolina], which is where Johnson C. Smith University is, is located.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but that was the, and still is the, the largest black area, diversified, so.
Story_ID: 613674
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question like this, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  Well, of course, I lived as I said we lived on the fringe of, of town, so the wooded area was down behind where I lived.  As a matter of fact, I have a novel I'm working about that.  It was woods, and the things that I can remember are the sounds of the woods, the sounds of the woods and walking through the woods and trampling through that there.  Some of the, there was a ballpark directly acro- sort of an open field really, but it was used as a ballpark and the--
Speaker 1: So, by the neighborhood kids or, or by--?
Speaker 2: By the neighborhoods and actually I believe some of the, the, they use it to practice, some of the black pros.  They would have big games out there, people would gather up there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh the Negro Leagues, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, across the street from where I lived on the other side.  The woods went down the hill that way and the ball field was on that side and that is where they ultimately put in the Fairview Homes [Charlotte, North Carolina], which was a housing development put up maybe during the early parts of World War II [WWII], a housing development which was beautiful home, Fairview Homes.  If you lived in Fairview Homes then it was, it was also designed for lower income people, but it was nice.  It was lovely.  And the sounds of people singing.  I grew up with a lot of, with a lot of music.  It seems to me that people sang more than they do now (laughter).  When we moved from this one--now I, the reason I can hear the sounds of music so clearly is because we ultimately moved to another house when, when--during the Depression [Great Depression], we moved into another house and it was right next door to a church.  So, I mean I can just, just the part of my, you know I heard the singing all the time because the sing, people were there singing.  I can remember the sound of the wagon, the man who sold vegetables and there was the ice truck and there was--
Speaker 1: Was it drawn by horses?
Speaker 2: Horses, horses and a wagon, yep.  We used to chase after them and jump on the back and beg for chips of ice.  And the usual growing up, things that almost every semi-rural child grew up with or child grew up at that time because we didn't consider ourselves country, we were city folks by comparison to my farm cousins.  So--because they had outhouses and no, and, and well water and we had a faucet and a toilet you know so, (laughter) and electricity so we were, you know that was city.
Story_ID: 613675
Speaker 1: Now when did you, I guess when did the family discover or you discover that you could sing?
Speaker 2: I think I sang my--at my--the first time I was told that I--I remember, I remember the time, but I didn't realize I was as young as I was.  I sang at a wedding when I was six years old. So I remember singing, "I love you truly, truly dear" ['I Love You Truly'].  You remember that?  You know that song don't you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, I think there's, they have Alfalfa sing, singing on one of the 'Our Gang' comedies.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, they sing the same song.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "I love you truly," yeah right.
Speaker 2: I remember singing that in, at this wedding.
Speaker 1: So you were six, so somebody discovered that you could sing.  Was it your mother [Mary Simons McBeth] or who, who?
Speaker 2: Well, my daddy [John McBeth] was a singer--
Speaker 1: You dad okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and then, oh yes we all, we were a very singing family.  We sang all the time, so it was not, and I don't think that I really was the best singer in the family.  I think my baby sister really had a better voice than I did, but you have to have more than a voice to sing.
Speaker 1: What do you have to have?
Speaker 2: Guts (laughter).  You cannot sing unless you have guts, you know.  It's like you just have, there's something else that's required.  I know a lot of people who can sing better than I do, but they don't have the guts that I have.  You know, that, that's what it is, and I don't really know what that is, but.
Speaker 1: So, it takes some nerve then.
Speaker 2: That's what it is, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Just nerve, yeah.  Because I've heard many people sing beautifully when just sort of off the wall.  I have many friends who, who could beat me singing any day except they just didn't, didn't want to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess I always knew I wanted to sing.
Speaker 1: Now, did that kind of energy translate into other things too?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I think being a singer does put you in, it, it's always, there's always that, you always have that special feeling.  People seem to always treat you a little bit differently if you are going to add to the fun, and I think it's just what do you bring, what do you bring to the table and many opportunities arise out of just having--and it doesn't have to necessarily be singing, but just be prepared to bring something whatever you do and, and be willing to share it.  The most important thing is just you have to be willing to share it. And I, I would, I hope to, to think of it being as a dual reward in terms of my singing.  I think that the best part about of it, about of it is that people seem to enjoy it, you know, and I bring joy to other people.  I mean otherwise why would they ask me to sing at their weddings and their funerals if they didn't want to hear me sing.  So, it's not all ham, you know, it's really--
Speaker 1: It's gift and, and nerve (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's a little bit more than just--yeah.
Speaker 1: Gift and nerve.
Story_ID: 613676
Speaker 1: So now were there, when you were little was there a lot of music in the house?  And I know you said your father [John McBeth] performed, your mother [Mary Simons McBeth] did some music too--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but did you get on a radio too or?
Speaker 2: Oh yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --we had the radio, the hit parade ['Your Hit Parade'] and all of the, the par--
Speaker 1: Now the hit parade, explain what a hit parade is.
Speaker 2: Explain what it is?
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause people don't know.  They're gonna be watching this later and they don't know what the hit parade is.
Speaker 2: Oh please.
Speaker 1: I know but, but.
Speaker 2: Well, now the hit parade was a, I think it came on, on Saturday night and--I guess my eyes, I'm sorry about my eyes.  I have watering ever so often.  The hit parade was where they played all the hit songs on Saturday night whatever song was on the recordings that were recorded and became hits.
Speaker 1: Popular music and records, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah popular songs.  Yes and the popular artist of the day would sing them and they would--you would think that you were watching a regular floor show, of course, it was just the radio.  So, they were just playing records but (laughter)--and occasionally they would have an interview with a, with a, with an artist.  So, it was very, well it was very rewarding.  It was a good feeling.  It was something we did.  We sat and wa- and imagined, use your imagination, that's the most important thing, so when it all became available to really look at, my imagination was right there on target.  I imagined all this, everything that they came up with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite artist?
Speaker 2: Well, of course I did and, and I grew up with, with Ella Fitzgerald.  Ella Fitzgerald was one of the popular singers then and Sarah Vaughan and they, they were both, they both came to Charlotte [North Carolina].  Billy Eckstine was, was popular at the time.  As a matter of fact, I think Billy Eckstine sang at our junior/senior prom one year that I think when I was junior.  He was the, he and June [June Eckstine] were both there and they both sang.  June was his wife.  Ella Fitzgerald came to the school one time to, to sing (laughter) for us.  Duke Ellington actually directed one of the programs that I was singing in.  That's how I met Duke Ellington, and I kept in touch with him over the years.  So, he came to, to direct the, this was when I was in high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina], the chorus.  It was some kind of a contest, regional contest or something and he directed us.  So, then I, so there were, let's see who else now that I can remember. (Pause) Well of course later on, I mean I, there were a lot of musicians, a lot of other musicians and I can't, I'm just trying to think of the timeframe of at the time.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you envision yourself like singing, you know, in--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely I sang along with everybody (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you saw yourself singing the popular culture songs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh sure.
Speaker 1: --that were out then and you know
Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh sure.
Story_ID: 613677
Speaker 1: Did you like the movies?  Did you like--
Speaker 2: Did I like?
Speaker 1: Movies.
Speaker 2: Movies?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well yes, what few that I wa- we were allowed to see.  At that particular time, the offering was fairly limited in, in--there was a Negroes' theater, the Grand Theatre, right across, diagonally across the street from Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina] and, and we would--as a matter of fact the building was still there the last time I was in Charlotte [North Carolina] three years ago, three or four years ago.  But, we would go to the movies on Saturday, generally on Saturday morning with our tickets worth five cents, I think, and we'd have to pay five cents to get in with the tickets.  But, general- most of the time it was shoot 'em ups, you know, Hopalong Cassidy and--well we, well we did see the Shirley Temple movies and a few of the things, but actually it was country western as a rule.  I learned to love, love Dale Evans and what's her, what was the guy's name?
Speaker 1: Roy Rogers, yeah, Gene Autry yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, all of those good country songs.  And I loved, I, I loved to, to, to sing those songs too. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I have recorded a couple of country western songs.
Story_ID: 613678
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  What was your first school?
Speaker 2: Elementary?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Fairview, Fairview elementary school [Fairview School, Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Fairview? Just fair--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I, I did attend Biddleville [Biddleville Elementary School, Charlotte, North Carolina] for a couple of years because we moved to Bidd- to Biddleville.
Speaker 1: So that was when--when did you--that's okay, okay when did you start grade school?  What year was that do you think 'cause--
Speaker 2: What was I--
Speaker 1: --you were about six I guess, so was that 19--
Speaker 2: Yeah about six, yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen thirty-two [1932]?
Speaker 2: There was no, there was no kindergarten then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was about 1932 I guess right?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: And then when did you go, what grade were you in when you went to Biddleville?
Speaker 2: I was in six grade at Biddleville.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right and--
Speaker 2: And then I went from Biddleville to West Charlotte High School [Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then from West Charlotte to Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit now to--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --grade school.  Now did, were there any particular teachers or mentors in grade school that you had that are worth talking about?
Speaker 2: Well yes.
Speaker 1: This is an all black school too, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh every, it was all black, yeah definitely black.  I remember several, I remember sever- half, half dozen, most of my, most of my teachers I remember really.  Mrs. Fletcher [ph.].  Ms. Ferguson [ph.] was my first grade teacher.  Ms. Tate [ph.] was my second grade teacher.  Ms. Norris [ph.] my third grade teacher.  Ms. Fletcher was my fourth grade teacher (laughter).  I can remember all of them right now, I mean when I think about it.  So, and you felt, there was a feeling of being a family and being safe and yet when you were naughty you were spanked and so it was just like, it was very natural that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't get away with, we didn't get away with what kids get away with today (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in the school or activity?
Speaker 2: Well, I've al- I've been a pretty cur- I'm almost, I've always been unnecessarily curious about everything, and I guess really I just liked everything (laughter) when I stop to think.  I loved just the process of writing, of handwriting.  I loved the challenge of math, and I liked the story aspect of history and, and so I don't know what I, I can't think, I can't say that I really had any favorite subjects until after I got in high school.
Story_ID: 613679
Speaker 1: Then of course when I went to high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] I liked science, and I liked music and, and I think the reason I liked science so much is because I had a terrible crush on the science teacher.  So, (laughter) all of us loved science.
Speaker 2: Because of the teacher?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, he was just so gorgeous.  Yeah so we--
Speaker 2: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: Yes, Jack Martin.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Jack Martin.  As a matter of fact, Jack and I became friends later on in life after I went back to several high school reunions before he died and we had some, some nice conversations.  Well, I had some nice conversations with many of my teachers when I went back.  They were all just really, you know how teachers are always so glad to see kids, former kids and when you pay attention, you know they were old by that, old by most standards you know.  But Jack was really a nice man.  And let's see I remember my Lat- now I loved Latin.  We--all--everybody had to take Latin in, in high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We all had to have two years of Latin, no matter what, whether you were at the bottom or the top of the class you had to sit in that Latin class.
Speaker 2: The model was a classical education model I guess you could say, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right it was purely, it was purely fashioned after the English mod- school model at the time.  And if you weren't, if you didn't know Latin you didn't know English, you know, I mean the Romance languages were based on Latin, so that's why I guess that was the rationale there.  And I think that it probably, it helped, I mean we weren't conversant with Latin, but you at least understood the structure of the language and I think that that was the main problem.  And I think that we, when we stop to think about some of the greatest orators from, that we have, the educated people who came from a segregated educational system you'll find that some of them were better educated than some of our northern counterparts with a, an open education.  Because I think there was a sense of purpose and a seriousness that, that teachers there offered the students that they were concerned about where you were going, you know, and how you were gonna, what you were gonna do when you got there.  So, I think that we in general enjoyed a, a, a more, how should I say this, individualized education.  We learned what we were capable of learning, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We just weren't put into a pot and like you all fit there.
Story_ID: 613680
Speaker 1: Was there a good music program there?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was there a good music program in high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we had a wonderful music program.  I remember Sam Lore [ph.] and Ms. Robinson [ph.].  Oh yes we had a wonderful music program.  We participated in all of the statewide festivals and had a great time music wise.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you start, were you in the school chorus or something or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yep--
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Speaker 2: --in a school, school chorus all the time, every time, ever since I can remember.  Even in grade school we had a chorus.
Speaker 1: So, you were able to sing in school, sing at church.  Now when did you start singing professionally, you know, in, in, for I guess social events and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I, I started singing, I guess I, I don't know I always sang at, at events and, and at home you know I, you know growing up.  But, professionally I didn't start until I had came to Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'til after I got my degree.  I mean you can't be a professional until you're professional you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but there's some, there are some musicians that we've interviewed like [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis started playing in high school.
Speaker 2: Well yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Started playing in clubs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's true he was--
Speaker 1: --you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: --he was but I--and, and pianists are different.  Claude [HistoryMaker Claude Walton] did the same thing.  He worked his way through college, you know, playing, so yeah, but no I didn't have any opportunities like that because there were no local, to my knowledge there were no local situations where there would be any opportunity to, to sing except at school functions and I did that.  But, that wasn't professional--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was just because of the fun of it.
Story_ID: 613681
Speaker 1: Now did you--how were your grades in school?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a good student.  I was always a fairly good student.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were you involved in, did you run for office or anything in school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] or, or involving clubs and so forth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was in the, the drama club and I was in the home economics club and we had a sort of--and I'm trying to remember what they called it. Debating, I guess it was a debating team, I think.  I think it was, well it was not really, it was a discus, more of a discussion kind of thing, but I guess it could be actually identified as a debating team, but we just did, that was just within the school.  We didn't do any extracurricular activities (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't debate anybody else to my--I can't remember.  It seems like there were some times when we had visiting people come in, but I can't put a rip on that.
Story_ID: 613682
Speaker 1: I don't want to miss anything in high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina], but when you were on the verge of graduating what were you career ideas?  What did you think you would do?
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted to be a musician.  I really had, that was the way I was going.  My scholarship was in music and, and--
Speaker 1: So you got a scholarship right away, I mean to go to--
Speaker 2: Not ri- no not right away.  I didn't get a scholarship--during the time that I went to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] it was, it was such, such, it was during the, the height of the war [World War II, WWII] so it was just sort of, it was just nothing going on like that, you know, I mean we, just, you just.  I had what was called a diversified occupation job where you worked and you were trained by the person for whom you worked and then you were also graded by them and I, I worked for a, for the director of the Boy Scouts of America, Quinton Adderley, and so when I was in my last year of high school I would go to work for a couple, a couple of hours before school was out and then I would work, and then I was paid for that.  Then I kept that job while I went, went to Johnson C. Smith.  And I came to, came to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] because my sister [Curlese McBeth Bostick (ph.)] moved to, to, to Washington, D.C., and I went to visit her and then decided I would transfer to Howard--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I would get a better music education there.
Speaker 1: Well what were things like at Johnson C. Smith? That's right in town right?
Speaker 2: What was it like?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was like, well I got my, it was like just being home there, (laughter) 'cause you know I mean it was just wonderful.
Speaker 1: Did you already know some of the pe- the teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh sure I knew, and most of my classmates went there.  So, and, and I babysat for one of the professors there.  He lived right across the street from us and so I babysat. So I knew Dr.--so and it was just sort of the natural thing to do to go to J.C. Smith.  The classes were affordable.  I could afford to go and, and so.
Story_ID: 613683
Speaker 1: Okay so you--but you decided to transfer to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], okay so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is 1940 what?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty- 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty--yeah.  No, I went to Howard in 1946.  I graduated from high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] in '44 [1944], and I went to Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] '44 [1944], '45 [1945], '45 [1945] and '46 [1946].  Then when I got to Howard I studied with Bessie Mayle. And she was--
Speaker 1: How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: M-A-Y-L-E.
Speaker 1: A--okay.
Speaker 2: And she was a charming lady and she became very interested in my career, and so she made it possible for me to participate in a vocal contest where I won this scholarship with the Shotwell Manufacturing Company.  Shotwell Manufacturing Company was a company based in Chicago [Illinois].  They, they made candy, sugar products, candy, Mars bars and something like, stuff like that.  So, that's when I--they were offering scholarships.  I don't know how they (unclear).  I don't know how that happened, but it was just one of those things.  So, I got this, this scholarship to wherever I really wanted to go and I chose Chicago because I thought that's, that was what I was supposed to do and Chicago conservatory [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois] had a very good reputation at the time.  Well, that went down the drain.
Speaker 1: Well what happened?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, they closed, they closed.  They couldn't make it after, well I had gra- they, I guess Chicago conservatory had closed up over twenty years ago.
Speaker 1: Chicago conservatory of music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was a, a private professional school and I guess it, they lost their endowment, so.  I don't know what happened.  I'm not sure what happened.
Speaker 1: I thought that was still going on, but maybe, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, the conservatory.  I guess the musical college is still going on, Chicago Musical College [Chicago College of Performing Arts], but they affiliated with Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].  The, I think the conservatory did not have an--well I know they didn't have an active alumni chapter, which was one of the downfalls.  You have to keep the connection, I believe, with your, with people who are interested in maintaining a history. And when Dr. Nelson [Vernon R. Nelson] died, who was the president--
Story_ID: 613684
Speaker 1: Chicago conservatory of music [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois], this is 1946 or--
Speaker 2: Yeah 1946, '46 [1946], '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: So, about this time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the soldiers are coming back from the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And of course that's when I was there, when all, we had a lot of GIs there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of GIs were coming in with their and--
Speaker 1: Now how, how were you treated there, I mean in the Chicago Conservatory?  These are the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Very, very different.  I never got the feeling that I got the education that I needed.  There was just, it was a very indifferent environment.  And having come from a situation where I was a star (laughter) it was hard to take, you understanding, you know when you, when you're young and everybody thinking you know you're gonna be this, that, and the other and then suddenly you go someplace and you're just one of the crowd, that's sort of a low blow and--
Speaker 1: So, so, Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] had more of a nurturing kind of a faculty and program?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yes, well it was all black and we were all the same.  Well here I am one black woman, girl in a sea of, of white people who don't really know what black people are all about at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay so they're a little aloof and calm, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, I mean not necessarily anything except, you know, nothing, indifferent.  I mean okay so you're here that's okay, I mean, fine.  And I, for example, I took ballet for four years.  I never danced with another student.  I took voice lessons for four years; I never sang a duet with another student.  I--because there were no black students around for me to dance with or to sing with, I didn't get that, that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Were there student performances and such where students would perform together, that sort of thing for programs and?
Speaker 2: Not, not necessarily, not, not an open, not an open forum, not like it was at Howard and not like it was at Johnson C. Smith nor at West Charlotte [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina].  There was no getting together after school and, and do--now I'm sure that it happened, you know, that, that people will naturally do what they had to do.  I do know that I did, did remember some of the--I remember this particularly this one, one afternoon. We were after--I'm trying to remember precisely.  I can see, I can't remember where we were, but there were a coup- there were always white guys around when a black guy was playing.  I can remember that feeling of all of them being more interested in what the black guys were doing than the black guys being interested in what the white guys were doing, you know what I mean.  And I think that this something that we should know, that we should think about.  If we don't do it, somebody else will.  You know if we don't get it down somebody is right there to pick up where we left off.  And I believe that, that they, I mean I don't think that this was anything accept really genuine curiosity that they wanted to know how it was done and because there was a different feeling, a different spirit in the way that bla- the blacks handled the music and I think that, that people were curious about that and it was no, certainly no secret that more, becau- because of the rules though more whites were able to take advantage of watching black entertainers at the time because they could go where they pleased, whereas blacks could not go where they wanted to be and to see the whites entertain.  So, of course it was natural for them to feel this sense of shyness let's, let's, so, so to speak.  So, but there wasn't the feeling, the natural let's, let's do this together kind of thing there. And I didn't, of course I was too young to really realize what was going on, that my life was going by, my education was getting lost in the shuffle.  I didn't realize that at the time or I would have made some, some noise myself.  And I think, and my teachers were genuinely, you know, they were, they recognized my talent and they did this, that, and the other, but there were certain things they couldn't do either.
Story_ID: 613685
Speaker 1: I don't know, I'm sorry but why did you go to Chicago [Illinois] again, I mean what was the reason to leave Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and go to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, the reason was that, that my, that the Chicago conservatory [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois] had a great, had a wonderful reputation at the time.  It was, it was located here, and as a matter of fact, I'm trying to remember that guy's name that was the representative of Shotwell Manufacturing [Shotwell Manufacturing Company].  They said, "Well if you, if you come to Chicago we can sort of give, give you some guidance, we can do thi- ," and they did indeed.  They, the, the company found me a place to live and everything was set up you know.  Now I could have gone any place that I wanted to go, but I had no contacts anywhere.  I didn't really know anybody in New York [New York].  I didn't know anyone at Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], which I should have done.  I would have loved to gone to Juilliard and, and--but I didn't, so.  Even though I was asked to--after I had been to conservatory for a couple of years I was sent a letter by a Maria (Unclear) who was a teacher at Juilliard and she asked if I would be interested in coming to Juilliard to study with her.  Well, it was too much of a challenge for me at the time.  I just didn't know how to go about doing that.  I was, I was a junior at the Chicago conservatory, and I had my piano in my room, I lived at the, at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], at the young woman's--thing.  Everything, I had everything setup the way I thought I wanted it, and I just didn't have what it took to get up and move by myself and just go to New York.  I just didn't know how, how to do that.
Speaker 1: So you finished at Chicago conservatory (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I just stayed in the Chicago conservatory and finished there.
Story_ID: 613686
Speaker 1: I mean, well were there any teachers or anybody that, that was, served as a mentor or a role model, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really.  No, I never found a mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never found a mentor.
Speaker 1: Well what about in the community? You know did you meet other black people in the community that were, you know, gave you a platform to sing or to perform?
Speaker 2: Well yeah there were several people who sort of took me under their wing.  I mean I had lots of, of good supportive friends and you know I didn't have any substantial person, anyone who had any, any substantial thing to offer to me, you know, in terms of career.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, well okay so what was your degree?
Speaker 2: In Chicago conservatory [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah what was it called?
Speaker 2: Music, a Bachelor of Music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bachelor or Music.
Speaker 1: Now, now in terms of, from what I've heard from people that were in Chicago [Illinois] in those days that, you know, some of the best music was being played on the South Side of Chicago.  You had--and 63rd street was filled with places where some of the best nationally known musicians, recording artists were playing.  Did you go down and check that out when you were here?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh sure I went to the--
Speaker 1: And where did you live?  Did you live on the South Side? Did you--
Speaker 2: No, I lived on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was sort of a disadvantage also, but I did sing at a lot of the churches on the South Side.  I met several musicians who were connected with churches, and they, you know they sort of, you know how musicians do this they sort of say, "Come on, come on sing with us or (unclear)."  So, I did sing with several choruses on the, on the South Side, a woman's chorus and I sang with the church choir and I did lots of solo work with churches on the South Side.
Speaker 1: What were some of the churches?  Do you remember some of the names?
Speaker 2: I can see them, but I can't remember them (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were they Baptist or, or Methodist or was there any particular one that may not?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember any specific denominations.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I just remember, I can't even remember, I can--well now I did sing with, in the--I know that, that Dancy [ph.] was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, so his church was, was an A.M.E. church, A.M.E., but I can't remember exactly where it was, but I'm afraid I have sung at so many churches--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) until they've all gotten--I can't tell you.
Story_ID: 613687
Speaker 1: I know at some point you become a pretty popular singer in Chicago [Illinois], so how did that happen, I mean, so you, when you graduated [from the American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois] what did you do immediately professionally for a living?  Did you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Immediately I started teaching music and dancing and drama for the Chicago Park District (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I did immediately and I--
Speaker 1: So, this is 1949?
Speaker 2: Fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Fifty [1950] okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so my kids were singing and dancing around Chicago, the kids I was teaching in the park district, and I started singing more myself at that time.  I met Jimmy Payne [Jimmy Payne, Jr.]. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he's a--
Speaker 2: You remember Jimmy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, legendary tap dancer and performer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and I started taking dancing lessons from Jimmy, and Vic Vandross was, was in his, his studio and he was a co- a voice coach and I started taking voice coaching lessons with Vic.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: V-I-C, V-A-N-D-R-O-S-S.
Speaker 1: Okay Vic Vandross, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And, and one night one of Vic's students who was singing in a club in Lyons was ill or something, and so he asked if I wanted to fill in for her that night and so I went in, went out to fill in for her and stayed for two years (laughter).  They hired me there, so I--
Speaker 1: So, she never got her job back (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I know whether, how that worked.  I don't know whether she wanted it back or not, but I worked, I worked--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) out there for a couple of years and then--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the place in Lyons, Lyons, Illinois?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the place if you remember?
Speaker 2: It was called Pedicone's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: P-E-D-I-C-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay all right so you were there for two years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then from, huh--
Speaker 1: --so that's 19--
Speaker 2: --then from Pedicone's I went to, went to Rush Street.  I'm trying to remember the name of the place that I went to.  I stayed there for a while and then I played the, several of the, all of the jazz clubs downtown, you know.  So, I just got on the circle then, so I worked on the, on the jazz circle. I worked on, in the Playboy Clubs and whatever.
Story_ID: 613688
Speaker 1: So, you were working in the park district [Chicago Park District] and singing in the evening (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no I had finished the park district by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I had, I got pregnant and came, stayed home for, for five years to raise my children [Claudette Walton Giles and John Walton] and then I started all that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry there's--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: --a five year, five year span between the park district and Jimmy Payne [Jimmy Payne, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: Now that's when my children were, were born and, and raised.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they're born around 1950 or so?
Speaker 2: Right, one, one was born in '52 [1952] and one was born in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I didn't start singing again until '59 [1959] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well '55 [1955] now there's a, I know, I'm looking at a--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --I was at a magazine over there from 1955 it's a going out guide (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, while I was, well while I was raising my, my children I was doing all kinds of other stuff.  I mean I was a columnist for this magazine, Beauty is a Habit [ph.].  I ran and did that (laughter).  And I was doing some modeling and I'd modeled, did some modeling for Jet and Ebony.  But, I'm just telling you, I mean I have done, I have done so many things, but I don't think that's history working, history making, you know, I mean.
Speaker 1: Well, it's your story.  We're trying to follow (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, but I just (laughter).
Speaker 1: --the chronology that's all.  Yeah, so don't, yeah.
Speaker 2: My story has been so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're writing, you're modeling, you're singing, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so from '55 [1955] I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was doing a lot of singing then because I did a concert, I did, I was doing classical music then when I was a young mother in Chicago [Illinois].  I was singing around.  I did several concerts at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and stuff like that.  I did the, 'The Telephone.'  I remember that.  I did 'The Telephone.'  I'd forgotten all about that.
Speaker 1: 'The Telephone.'  What's--
Speaker 2: I, I'd forgotten Menotti's 'Telephone' [Gian Carlo Menotti].  Meno- that's an operetta.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just saying I just forgot about that past (laughter) time in my life (laughter).  You telling me to keep it, do a chronology, well that's hard.  And let's see, yeah I was just doing stuff.
Story_ID: 613689
Speaker 1: So, in the '60s [1960s] from, from where we're looking at the scrapbooks when I came in, you know and it seems like in 1962, '63 [1963] you're performing in the Playboy Club, which is a big deal in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a big deal and you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it was big--
Speaker 1: --performing with, you'd be on a show with Jack Carter, the comedian, and different people I was looking, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Who else did you perform with?  I saw one picture in there with Bob Newhart or somebody.
Speaker 2: Bob Newhart yeah and I performed with--oh, oh I was with, with oh gosh what is her name?  She--isn't that terrible.
Speaker 1: A singer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Famous black singer.  She and I were on a show together.  I was on a show, I was on shows with a lot of people.  Quite a few, you know one time shows, maybe a television show or something like that.  Her name is (unclear), but I remember her particularly because she said to me, "Why are you, why are you wearing a watch and you have on a cocktail dress?"  I said, "Because I wanna know what the time is."  She said, "You don't wear watches with cocktail dresses."  What was her name?  Isn't that terrible (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was it Dinah Washington or?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No, not Din--
Speaker 2: It was, she wasn't, she wasn't really a, a blues singer.  She was more jazz, and she died, well she died even before Sarah Vaughan.
Speaker 1: Was she from Chicago [Illinois] or no?
Speaker 2: I think she was from Chicago.  Gosh isn't that, (makes sound). Isn't that funny.  Then you would know immediately who she is, but any rate that's not important, but I'm, I'm thinking about the night that, that Ella Fitzgerald sat right in front of me when I opened at, at a club out--she closed the night before and I opened the night she, after she did (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you followed Ella Fitzgerald?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yep, I followed Ella Fitzgerald, and she came backstage after I sang.  She says, "You know you got a lot of guts.  I would never sing, I would never have the guts to sing the kind, do the kind of program you did here tonight, but it was wonderful."  I said, "Well, you know," I mean see did all the jazzy up tunes and it was a loud room.  It was a loud room, and I was a sultry chanteuse (laughter), you know, so I'm singing all this, this blood and guts stuff you know.
Speaker 1: For instance, what, what songs were you singing that she--?
Speaker 2: Well, I sang something like 'My Foolish Heart' for example.  I would sing, I sang 'My Foolish Heart' and 'What is There to Say.'  These are sultry, you know songs, sad songs.  But, I remember they did, they had a ball, one of those reflection balls and when I did 'My Foolish Heart' the light, the lighting people they just had that thing going and then spot on my face and that was all, of course you could hear a pin drop.  It was wonderful.  It was a great feeling.  And everybody stopped.  I mean the waiting stopped, the people stopped talking and everything happened, so that's what she was, was talking about that mesmerizing moment.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know--
Speaker 2: So, I've had a few of those and I think it's wonderful.
Story_ID: 613690
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay now, we were talking about rhythm in terms of writing when we, when I first came in I was reading something that you had to say about writing, having rhythm is important to writing. And I just wondered when you sing a song like that how important is the drama, I guess, in, in the, when people sing songs with some of these, you know, sad messages and that sort of thing, I mean do you really have to kind of dramatize it? These, I mean how do you sell that kind of song?  Is it, does it come natural--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --or do you have practice it or what?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm not sure.  I think it has, it's, it's, I think singing is a part of who you are.  I mean you can't sing somebody else.  That's why singers become known as either a jazz singer or this kind of a singer or that kind of a singer, so that's who they are. And I think that the music is a reflection of how you see the world.  It's, it's the, your, your vision, and I, and I'm not sure that you necessarily have to dramatize something and you can't, certainly in coaching you learn what is not good to do, you know, what you can do and what you can't do.  But, you see some singers that never become really singers.  As a matter of fact, I remember Van Johnson. I worked with Van Johnson at the Palmer House [Palmer House Hotel; Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois] one time, bless his heart he's such a sweet man. But every gesture was programmed.  I knew everything he was going to say.  Every time he would move his hands I knew exactly how he was going to do it. So he had learned how, because he was not a singer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's primarily an actor.
Speaker 1: Yes, he's, he's an actor.
Speaker 2: Yeah and--
Speaker 1: So, he could get away with that because they didn't go to hear, people didn't come to hear him sing anyway.  They came to watch him act or just because he was Van Johnson (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To meet Van Johnson, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, he was such a sweetheart and he, he was, he was complaining about his sore throat one night and so he says, "Jane [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] what do you have that I could use for my sore throat, my throat so I can sound like you do?" (Laughter) I said, "Well you won't sound like I do, but you can use my throat spray."  So, he used my throat spray (laughter).  But, he was such a sweet guy, you know, and just a big ham just the way he was all the time.  He was just, just, just there.  So, I think that you, singing a song is so personal until it comes, sometimes it comes out the way you want it and I guess sometimes it doesn't, but I don't, I can't, I can't really explain that mystery to you.
Story_ID: 613691
Speaker 1: Now did you sing in mostly white venues 'cause it or?
Speaker 2: Most, most of the time I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'cause it seem to me when I was looking at the materials it seem like that you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah mostly I did.
Speaker 1: Were you the first black singer they, they had a lot of these venues?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes I was.  As a matter of fact when I sang in New Orleans [Louisiana] with, for the Playboy Club my contract had been trans- had been battered back and forth because they couldn't find a black trio to accompany me.  And finally they decided oh well let's let her go.  Nobody will know the difference.  And so I sang.  I had been singing for about a week, and it was, I was having a wonderful time and so I invited the cast, there were several other singers there, to, to my hotel.  I was staying in the Royal Orleans hotel [Omni Royal Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I just, just did it without even thinking about it, but (laughter) when some of the cast came over to, to swim they mentioned it, some, somebody talked about it.  "We went over to, to Jane [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] and she's living in the Royal Orleans hotel" and blah, blah, blah, and the manager came to me that night he says, "Well Jane, I hear that you, that you're living at the Royal Orleans hotel."  I said, "Well yeah I just thought it was easy, I can walk to work and you know it's, it's closer here and so I--."  He said, "Well you know it's against the law for a black woman to live in the, in the Royal Orleans hotel."  I said, "Oh really?  I hadn't, I didn't realize that."  That was at the time of the Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], Ole Miss was being integrated, all this racial turmoil was going on all over.  I said, "Gee I hadn't noticed that.  I had forgotten all about that."  Of course I knew perfectly well what I was doing because the, the black help at the hotel we had a good time about it, you know.  I mean everybody was laughing and joking about it.  So--
Speaker 1: So, the whites they really didn't know what to make of you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't really care.
Speaker 1: --they and they didn't, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean nobody cares.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As long as you're giving them a service that they want, who cares.  I mean only people who are on the outside looking in or have no real thing (unclear).
Speaker 1: So, it's not until somebody makes it an issue--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that it became an issue.
Speaker 2: But any rate he thought, he said, "Well you know I told, I, I told you that if you wanted me to find you a place to live I would do so."  I said, "Well I didn't want you to because I knew enough about New Orleans to know where I wanted to live."  So he said, "But suppose the, the papers get a hold of this or suppose--."  I said, "Well what can they do with it?  What would they care?"  He said, "Well it just might--."  I said, "Well listen, you know, I'm singing with a white group here, and I think, and there was a little bit of mess, I think my agent told me there was some stuff about getting a black group."  I said, "But this is to your advantage to have me sing with this white group, and it's to my advantage to live in the hotel.  Now, if you want to make an issue of that go ahead, but I'm not moving" (laughter).  So, he was very unhappy with me, but I mean he, he--what could he say.
Speaker 1: So, was it ever raised again by any of the hotel staff or?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, nobody ever thought about it.  I, I'm sure, I'm sure people truly don't care.  You know, I mean why, why would they, I mean I, at the time people only cared who, as I said rabble rousers cared. I mean you know people who wanted to get into--start something.  But, at any rate we had a lot of fun in New Orleans because we were all being very--I went to, to the clubs with the, the other entertainers.  All the entertainers at the club at that time were white.  Many of them were from Chicago [Illinois]. Penny Pryor and I had been old pals for a long time.  She was working another room there, so we would, we went all over.  And even in New Orleans, even the clubs there were making fun of the racial issue.  There was a, there was a comedy going on at the time ['Nobody Likes a Smart Ass'], a show going on time, ridiculing racial segregation in, in transportation, and they were using in bathrooms and in water- and it was so funny.  It was just a riot.  We would sneak over and, and watch the shows.  It was just a riot and it was totally, the thing about it is there has been there has been a segment of white entertainers for so long that had been dealing with and working with racial segregation that we don't even know about.  They do it on their own, and because it's, it was at that particular time a closed audience, only the people who were there knew how ridiculous it was, and the audience knew how ridiculous.  Now I happen to be a black woman in this, in this mix at one time, and a lot of people were, a lot of whites were insulted and got up on several occasions and walked out of the program because it just showed how ridiculous segregation really was.
Story_ID: 613692
Speaker 1: You were just discussing the, some of the--oh the show we were discussing the name of the show and you were trying to remember the name of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --but, it was a, it was a show--
Speaker 2: It was a stage show.
Speaker 1: --a stage show in New Orleans [Louisiana] about racial desegregation--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and how ridiculous it was.
Speaker 2: Yes, and it was, and it was an all-white cast ridiculing the, the, the silly segregation laws that were, that Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi] at the time, the, the height, this was at the height of the--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, we have speed.
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about the name of the show, you know but the show was about segregation in New Orleans right and, well in the country, in the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nobody, I think it was 'Nobody Likes a Smart Ass.'
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I'm almost sure that's the name of the play.
Speaker 1: 'Nobody Likes a Smart Ass' okay.
Speaker 2: And of course as I said it was just at the height of the, the racial tension involving in, in, integrating education facilities and the Ole Miss situation there and people were talking about it every place.  People were talking about it. I mean white people especially were talking about it because I am a spy.  At this time, I was an un- unknowing smi- spy because I would be in places where we were every, we were just, was just a white group and people would say whatever because nobody looked at me and said, "Oh we can't say that, she's black."  So, they were saying whatever they'd say, wanted to say.  And I learned a lot and how concerned people were about how silly a lot of it was.  And also how bitter some people were about the fact that, that, that we needed to even talk about it, that it should keep on going the way it is.  So, it was an interesting time.  It was really an interesting time in, in, in New Orleans at, at that pi- at that time.  So, this show we snuck over, we snuck over to see (laughter) and it was really a riot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: As it was would, could a black person go see this show?  Was it--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No black people could not go to see it.  See this--
Speaker 1: By law you weren't allowed to go see it.
Speaker 2: By law I was not, and I just went along with the crowd.  I, I would, I hate to say this, but I did that a lot.  I mean I went along with the crowd because I could, and I thought I should.  So, that's the way that goes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it depends, I mean you were on the right side, even though you were there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, yeah the, the, sometimes things, it was just silly not to be able to do that, and of course at the time it was, I didn't really mind if somebody would find out.  I mean, as I said, I was close enough to this being the thing that we were working for, were actually, so just like with the New Orleans, with the Playboy [Playboy Club] thing if you wanna tell go ahead and tell.  I'll just say yes I did it.  So, it, yes I'm here and who cares.  And that's what I would just, I was perfectly, I was ready to defend (laughter) my, my, myself, but I did a lot of things because I could.
Story_ID: 613693
Speaker 1: Now did it make any difference in Chicago [Illinois] in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I did, it did make a lot, I had, I, it's not that I wasn't rebuffed on numerous occasions.  I started a, I started singing with a group from school [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois] in a North Side hotel and we had been working in this hotel for, these were guys, white guys from school, for several, several weeks. And their manager came in and recognized me from having seem me at another singing with a group of black women on the South Side of Chicago he recognized me.  He was there for some reason or another.  And so he told them that they would either have to get rid of me, even though the hotel and the, and the clientele had accepted the fact that I was there with them singing. He said that they would either have to get rid of me or he would have to discontinue, get them out of the contract.  So, mo- the guys were, either some of them were married, had families and they relied on this music to, their, their jobs, so I said, "Oh well I'll quit," I mean no, no big deal.  Then I ran into this same guy downtown one time and he said to me, he stopped me and said, "Oh I re- do you remember me?"  I said, "Of course I remember you."  He said, "I'd like to offer you, give you my card and I want you to know that I'll be perfectly willing to act as your, as your agent if you'd like me to work for getting you a job."  And I won't tell you what I told him to do on camera, but (laughter).  I was not very happy with him.  I tore up his card right there on State Street and Madison [Street].  But, that was, that was the kind of thing that was going on.  He didn't, this was a personal thing for him.
Story_ID: 613694
Speaker 1: So, was it--now was--did you make pretty good money?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, made better, more money than you did anything, doing anything else.  You know it was, I made more than a clerk typist.  I made more than I did working at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].
Speaker 1: Or teaching school even?
Speaker 2: Oh well no.  Well yeah eventually I, I would have if I had, if I had done it full time, but, but as a, as a steady kind of a thing it's sometimes difficult, you know.  And of course I wasn't willing to give up my family and travel.  That was the reason my, my agent said, "Well either you're gonna have to travel or get out of here or you're gonna have to do something because you're not--." I traveled from here to places like Springfield [Illinois] and Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and stuff like that I would travel you know and come back home, but--
Speaker 1: Now you were on local television shows right in Chicago [Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and in other places here in the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Now you made some records.  Did they have a national distribution?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I even made The Cash Box one time.  I think I was in one of the five top Cash Box.
Speaker 2: Now what, what were you, when did you make your first album I guess?
Speaker 1: I guess during the early '60s [1960s] I suppose.
Speaker 2: Okay, and did you do like standard songs or did, were there any songs written especially for you?
Speaker 1: Well, I did stan- mostly standards.  I did one or two things that were special, they were composed just for me or at least nobody else had recorded them before I did.  But, I did mostly standards at the time, "Someone to Watch Over Me." I think I did, I did do the "Foolish Heart" ["My Foolish Heart"] and stuff like that. "Birth of the Blues."  I did a co- I did a country western album.  I went to Phoenix [Arizona] to do that.
Speaker 2: Was that in the late six--now a lot of black entertainers started doing country and western at one point in the late, well the latter part of '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ray Charles, even The Temptations I think came out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And The Supremes had a country album, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah it was fun.  I loved that.  I liked that album too.  And it just seems, and country western never goes out of, out of style you know (laughter).  It just, just keeps on keeping on.  I love, I love it.  I did an Underground Railroad album ['Bound To Go'] with, with Andrew Calhoun lately, just a few weeks ago, Campground, and I sang on that.  It's a group, and we had a record, a couple of record parties at FitzGerald's on Roosevelt Road [Berwyn, Illinois].  It was good, well attended.  It was, it's a, it's a neat record.  It's a neat album.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: CD.
Speaker 2: All right okay, that's the latest one, I mean that's the latest one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 613695
Speaker 1: Traveling is what really kind of got you out of the singing business, the un--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always traveled (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) unwillingness to travel.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, it's hard to raise children and travel too.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, when my kids [Claudette Walton Giles and John Walton] got in junior high I figured I'd better stay home.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where were you living then?
Speaker 2: Here.
Speaker 1: Out here in--
Speaker 2: I was living here all along.
Speaker 1: Lombard [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I had a woman who lived with us, and she took, helped you know, so.
Speaker 1: Now when did you meet Claude [HistoryMaker Claude Walton]?
Speaker 2: I met Claude when I was in, in school at the conservatory [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I met him.  I was working at Dr. Thatcher's [ph.] office, and he came in as a patient.  That's how I met him.  Dr. Thatcher introduced, introduced us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is back in '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: No, that was, that was in the late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Late '40s [1940s] okay.
Speaker 2: I got married in '50 [1950].

Speaker 1: When did you start teaching school, I mean did you have to go--
Speaker 2: I started teach- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) back to school to take other courses or something to teach or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went back to, to--I started teaching first in 19--I guess it was '70 [1970].  I started teaching in ni- I went back to school per se in teaching in '68 [1968].  I went to work for the Head Start program in Maywood [Illinois], and that was in '68 [1968]. And then I was asked to come to teach English as a second language in Elmhurst [Illinois] District 45--205 [District 205] I'm sorry and so that was--I started teaching in Elmhurst in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1970, all right.
Speaker 2: Then I went back to, went to National U, University, National Louis University [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and got my master's degree in teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay and did you stay out here in this part of the, this part of the Chicago [Illinois] area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I taught in Elmhurst.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of my tea- most of my teaching career Elmhurst.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about twenty years from what I read, twenty--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you teach mostly grade school or high school or?
Speaker 2: Grade school, junior high, mostly junior high and then I taught classes for National Louis University and those were extension courses at different schools.  You know I had one course I taught on the South Side in Chicago and then one in Elmhurst and I started, that's when I started working for them when I got, after I graduated.
Story_ID: 613697
Speaker 1: All right so what did you teach at National Louis [National Louis University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I started out with a teacher's course in self-esteem and then a course in that and black, African American history. America's co- Black America's Contribution to the American Experience.
Speaker 1: Okay now what qualified you to teach that at that particular point?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: African American history.  I mean had you taken some courses before?
Speaker 2: Well yes I had taken courses, I had, well of course my education coming from black schools [HBCUs] you had, there was more, I knew, you know we always had black history in school.
Speaker 1: So, you had it at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, High School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah Johnson C. Smith and in high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina]. I mean we had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --black history in high school, so--
Speaker 1: I know it became like hot property in the late '60s [1960s] people--
Speaker 2: Really and--
Speaker 1: --were trying to find people to teach it and it had never been taught in the schools (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually just who had the experience, enough experience to say nothing of the academic background to do it, they just didn't exist so to speak, so they were sort of scrounging around trying to catch up with desegregation so that teachers would have some, some inkling of the black, black experience so that they could deal with the, where the children were coming from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just language alone was a problem.
Speaker 1: When you taught that cour- well you were teaching self-esteem, African American history, now what, now self-esteem part of it too, I mean, I mean what led to the teaching of self-esteem (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I had gone through, I'd taken some courses in, in educational psychology and stuff like that and, and worked with, with Head Start programs and with the parents and teachers in building their own self-esteem in order to deal with the children.  And you'd be surprised at how self-esteem can be a deterrent to a teacher in terms of whether or not the children--and children recognize immediately if you have low self-esteem.  I mean you just cannot, you have to have enough self-esteem in order to rise above just being, just the conflict that's in a classroom.  There's a lot of conflict in a classroom.  You have as many different organizations as you have children, so I think that it was something I designed.  I mean I designed this course, so I just designed it from--and they accepted it.  So when you, after you are in education and ostensibly (gesture) educated, you have the option to contribute something new if you have something new to contribute and if you can substantiate your teaching with, with experience as well as research, so you, so you design your courses according to that.
Story_ID: 613698
Speaker 1: I know well it sounds a lot like--I know the dialogue in those days people were discussing the need for black children to feel better about themselves in school.  And probably not just black children, but especially black children in light of their, it was not, that there was no education about their contribution to history--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --or to anything, you know--
Speaker 2: No, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --in the, in the curriculum, so you've got two courses here that seem to be aimed at bolstering that kind of confidence in minority children at least.  So is that, was that the, the--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I did have two courses that many teachers truly could have used. And, but the strange thing they were not made, required courses by the university [National Louis University, Chicago, Illinois] just as many courses that I have designed for the university have not been responded to by the teachers simply because they were not required.  They will go and they will take a course in teacher economics for example.  As a matter of fact, one time I remember my, my class didn't go because I had only six students to register, and my colleague across the hall who was teaching teacher economics--I don't know what that is, I really don't what--but Glenn [ph.] was, had designed this course for teacher economics and it, and the college, the university had accepted it as a, as a required course.  He had a hundred teachers signed up for that course, and nobody knew what it was and yet the African Americans' contribution to the American experience was surely something they all knew what it was and that they knew that they needed to know something about it, and I had only six sign ups and Glenn said to me, "Well you see that's how the, how, how unfair we are.  We don't learn what we need to know and we," you know, so that's the way it goes.
Speaker 1: I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that it is generally believed by, at least a significant number of white people and black people that there is really no history to teach in terms of--and it seems that way sometimes to me.  I don't know if I'm wrong in saying this, but, but when you're facing that kind--and, and you know full well that there is content, you know, how do you--
Speaker 2: How do I deal with this?
Speaker 1: Yeah or--
Speaker 2: Well, you never reconcile yourself to this, I mean as an educator I can't possibly rest knowing that this attitude still prevails, but then there's so many things that we need in the classroom as, as teachers.  We still need a lot of that, that the powers that be don't recognize and when, when I am, when I bring up a subject like well how, how do we, how do we deal with this one, how can we evaluate this when we're not offering this to our, our teach- our student teachers, and this is what's happening and the way people feel about this, that, and the other.  And when I am told, "Well you know we're not responsible for teaching people how to think," and I thought, I said, "Well gee I've been teaching for a long time. I thought that that's what one of, one of our functions was to give them some option on ways of looking at things, at least," you know.  But--
Speaker 1: So do you suspect they meant that they weren't in the business of teaching them how to think about race is that?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and how, how to think and how to evaluate.
Story_ID: 613699
Speaker 1: Well, it's, it will be awhile yet.  As a matter of fact, we're working on now just teaching the, teaching how to teach literature, controversial literature. You know, literature that's specifically designed for one ethnic group or another or by and for and how do teachers teach this.  This is a big problem.  They don't have a clue.  I mean how do we, what is the criteria for this?
Speaker 2: Well, let's touch on that a minute since you raised it.  I know there was a big controversy a few years ago, and I think it's an ongoing controversy in different parts of the country about how to teach good old 'Huckleberry Finn' ['The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'] by Mark Twain, so--
Speaker 1: Or, or 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' [Harriet Beecher Stowe].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any, any,--
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) how do you teach it, how do you go about teaching.
Speaker 2: And so the questions raised are--
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: --how do you teach it without offending the black students in the class when they are a minority--
Speaker 1: Yes, what are we looking for here.
Speaker 2: --and how do you present the real intent of the author.  And I think in both the cases the intent is sympathetic to black people, but--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --but often, I mean it's been, I mean black people get offended by the language as if it--so there is a dilemma.
Speaker 1: Well you see in, in the first place it's, you have to reach a certain level of educational objectivity before you can read any kind of literature intelligently and understand what it's bringing to you.  And many times teachers assign literature to their classes that they have not read themselves and don't have any idea of what's it all about, and it's far more complex than we think.  It's far more complex, and it's as you said it's like what do you bring to what you're teaching.  And you, if you don't bring anything to it, you know, yourself.  I mean the most important thing that a teacher has is her own, is his or her presence and their self-esteem and their, their experiences and their background.  The curriculum doesn't mean a darn thing if you don't have something to go with that.
Story_ID: 613700
Speaker 1: This leads to a question I was gonna ask before, but I got sidetracked by the literature, but, but what--you in your writing and even through your association with Glennette Turner [HistoryMaker Glennette Tilley Turner], who I know, I mean that's impressive with me, I mean it means that there's, there's a back story to you gathering information for these courses and for the books that you write.  So, so how and what, what books, what teachers, what, what organizations I guess are the--provide the foundation for your depth of knowledge about black history and?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh my word, I have not, I could not tell you that if--because it's so much.  I mean every, every day something comes into your life that gives you a new insight into something that you don't know or hadn't recognized or didn't realize.  I, of course, I have found the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the history book that they had.  I found that to be immensely, immensely valuable.
Speaker 1: Yeah The Crisis, the new version of The Crisis, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, The Crisis, but also the other, the other little books, the, I can't remember what they call those, I have the set, that they used to, I mean they, I haven't gotten one lately, but you remember a Negro History, it was something Negro History something, something.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh you mean The Negro History Bulletin from the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, The Negro History Bulletin, that's it, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History], right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah Assoc- yes right, yeah that.  Now I read those and I, I read, I do, I really am a voracious reader and I guess I don't read as academically as I should because I read and I don't necessarily (laughter), I don't necessarily document where I get it from.  I just sort of feed it into something I already know or am familiar with and that's how I, how I, I don't know I mean I, and I find out what I need to know when I need to know it.
Speaker 1: Okay to right about a specific part of history.
Speaker 2: Yes.  If you, if you, something specific yes you find it out, fi- I mean I don't just walk around looking for stuff and yet I don't---
Speaker 1: Well, there's a lot of material available out here.  Do you--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: --did you read, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is like what, what's your favorite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Lerone Bennett's books and I have, of course I have all of the books that, that Johnson Publishing Company [Chicago, Illinois] has put out about black history from way, way back when nobody else was doing it because you know they, they published my first book, 'What Color Are You?' [Darwin McBeth Walton].
Speaker 1: Now this is 1978, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: Three [1973], okay, all right '73 [1973] okay that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I, so I had been getting, and, and there was a time when I got complimentary copies of all of their publications.  In the good old days you know you were, you were afforded complimentary copies.  Basil [Basil O. Phillips] used to send me all of these wonderful things, you know all the cookbooks and everything else. So I have all of, all of their, the historical books, some of the first books that were written, big beautiful books that were published about black history, Johnson Publishing Company did it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they reprinted a lot of the really old books like--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --'The Underground Railroad' ['The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First Hand Accounts'] by William Still and other books like that.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Did they do that?  They did that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: JP?
Speaker 1: I got a copy at home.
Speaker 2: Did they?  Well I have--
Speaker 1: They had a series of reprints they published.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that, see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm out of the link there.  I have the, I have the, his, the, the other book, the William Stills book, but I didn't, I don't have their copy.  But, you know it's, I, I still have my Langston Hughes book that I had when, when I was in high school [West Charlotte High School, Charlotte, North Carolina] and just lots of books, lots of books like that, that, that we just don't see in classrooms today.
Story_ID: 613701
Speaker 1: Tell us about the publication of your first book ['What Color Are You?,' Darwin McBeth Walton].  It's 1973, so I guess you must have started working on it what '72 [1972] or did it?
Speaker 2: Well, probably. Basically it came out of a classroom project that I did in order to--at the time I was teaching Hispanic, predominantly Hispanic children, and I had no, no- nothing.  I was in an all white church, school in, in the first place and of course the children had a mix, mixture of American culture, country culture, you know, just farm.  They were mostly migrant farmers, product of migrant farmers that moved into Elmhurst [Illinois], and I was hired specifically to teach these children and I think possibly because I was black.  At least I'm sure the recommendation was you can, this is a woman who can probably relate more car- more to the Hispanic children than a white teacher could.  Well, that was their notion.  But, any rate I had a little Spanish in my background and all children, anybody who was a teacher could teach any child.  Color doesn't have a thing to do with that, you know, and nor does ethnicity.  If you're a teacher you know that.  That's just the way it is.  But, any rate, I didn't have anything, no, none of the books, children didn't relate to any of the books that I had.  I was developing the curriculum as I was there, and I started working with a lot of magazines and trying to get image identity for them because there were no black children or black people in any of the books that we had at that time, 19--we were, we all grew up in a white culture and even the children's books, there were very few children's books that were African American or Af- or even Hispanic.
Story_ID: 613702
Speaker 1: How did the, how did you conceive of this book, 'What Color Are You?' [Darwin McBeth Walton].  What was the conception?
Speaker 2: Well I was teaching third grade, I guess, and I would use magazine pictures to point out things that people did in order to teach language.  I was teaching English language to Hispanic children, so I used a lot of pictures in my, in my teaching.  But then in the process of doing this another thing came about that was not what I was teaching.  I had a conceptual thing that was bothering me or, that came out of this project and it was saying what is the difference between why, what is the difference between all of these colors? I mean why do, why are people different colors and what difference does it make is what it was.  So, I developed this other book that's out, to point out the children doing all different, the same things, families, different shades of skin within one family and why and different kinds of people engaged in activities and why and what difference did it make what color, what color they were and, and children doing things like bathing and brushing their teeth and taking a bath, doing anything, but what difference does color make.  So, then the question, the book came out pointing out that regardless of your color we do more things that, we have the same basic needs.  We have the bame- same basic respon- tools to work with.  We have the same basic--and this is why I wanted this, and this is what I was teaching.  So, this is what this book came up.  I thought it was worth, worth (laughter) publishing.
Speaker 1: Was it tough to get it published?  It was published by Johnson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Publishing Company [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], but--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --was it tough to get it--had you a relationship with Johnson Publishing before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you have to get an agent or?
Speaker 2: I had, I had a relationship with the publishing, I worked, I had done some, some work for the publishing company, but I didn't know John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].  I had worked with one of the other persons there, but I didn't know him.  But, I saw him when I got ready to publish this book, and he said to me, "Oh we, we eat children's books around here.  We don't, we don't sell them, we just publish them and eat them."  I said, "Well you think this one you can, you," (laughter), "want to eat?"
Speaker 1: Digest this one.
Speaker 2: But anyway he decided to go ahead and publish it, and so Hal Franklin [Hal Franklin II] and I worked on the photographs.  He came to my classroom, and we set up situations where the children would be doing, engaging in certain activities to point, prove the points and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now did Hal Franklin come from JPC or how did you meet?
Speaker 2: He was at, he was at JPC at the time.  He was a staff photographer.  Since that time, he has moved on to South Carolina.  He is now a doctor, I think, a medical doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's how that came about.
Speaker 1: All right well how was the book ['What Color Are You?,' Darwin McBeth Walton] received then?
Speaker 2: Just wonderfully, won- the book went over like crazy, and it is still in print, and it's still being sold, I mean it, it's amazing how many, how people, and it's amazing how widespread it is and how people have latched on to it.  I don't know that there is ano- there's another book has been printed to say the same thing that this has in a way that I've said it, even though it's certainly not a profound book, but it gets across a message that has not been, to my knowledge, printed before.
Story_ID: 613703
Speaker 1: I mean it's a lot of people that have said the same thing.  As a matter of fact, this was one of the prototypes.  My book ['What Color Are You?,' Darwin McBeth Walton] was used as a prototype for--I'm saying this, I'm not, I mean it's not a fact, but I know that that was the year that the social studies books had to integrate their books and Allyn and Bacon used the same model for their social studies books using, putting different colored American children in the books.  Prior to that, the only black children that were in our social studies and our books were African or children from some foreign country way, way away and very often in the most uncompromi- compromising pictures and ugly pictures and, and stuff like that, that were not genuine representations of the, of the race.  I remember my son [John Walton] came home one day from high school and he was so embarrassed because the anthropology book that they had depicting the, the Negroid race had an anc- an old woman, an old, old black woman naked with her breasts hanging down to her waistline and she was there, the example of black womanhood, and they had these beautiful other indicating--I was so insulted I called the, the company.  I mean it, but that's the kinds of things that our children were putting up with at that time, and this was just, this was when he was in high school.
Speaker 2: That's not--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: That's like in the sev- in the '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was in the '70s [1970s].  Yeah, '70s [1970s] because he's in this book.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, those are the kinds of, of, of objects, kinds of things that we, we were putting up with as teachers, and the publishing companies weren't backing us up at all.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what you're saying is we already had a black power era before your son saw that picture--
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and that's all, you know, 'cause there was a course of people I think at one time that said well maybe we're going too far--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --pushing too much back history in the class.
Speaker 1: But, the public- the white publishing companies were, were a lot, they were dragging, still are.  They're still dragging their feet in terms of getting black--a great, great portion of the black books that are out there are self-published or else published by small black publishing companies that don't have any money to really put them out there, and the white publishing companies as long as they have one black writer on, in their staff or on their, they aren't interesting in any of the black books, no matter how good it is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're just, they just don't even an- they either don't answer you or they say we've got something like that or something, something, something all the time.
Story_ID: 613704
Speaker 1: Now what was your second title?
Speaker 2: 'Dance, Kayla!' [Darwin McBeth Walton] was my second book.
Speaker 1: Now this is more of a novel right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a novel (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's actually a copy of it here, yeah. On the cover is a little girl in a leotard and she's learning how to dance, apparently she's practicing, you know, so.  This is--
Speaker 2: Now this, this was chosen one of the best books of the year by the Bank Street College of Education [New York, New York] selection committee, which is a very prestigious selection committee for children's books.  Now this, this book, the original book was published by Albert Whitman [Albert Whitman and Company].  To, to prove my point that as long as a publishing company has at least one black writer that they are publishing, they are not truly interested in promoting another book.  Now this book was--I have Amago- Amazon.com [Amazon.com, Inc.] has it, has it, had it rated as a five star book, as one of the best books out of Columbia [ph.], one of the best children's books of the year and it had highly, really great reviews from all over the country.  I had just great reviews.  And yet the publishing company did not put it back in print.  They did not reprint this book, and they called me and said, "We're not gonna reprint 'Kayla.'"  I said, "Why not?"  So, my excu- the, Denise's [ph.] excuse to me was "Well you know Darwin [HistoryMaker Darwin McBeth Walton] we have to choose the books that we publicize" and dah, dah, dah, dah. And at that time Marilyn, Madeline Coleman [sic. Evelyn Coleman] had a book called 'White Socks' ['White Socks Only'] that they had been touting, touting, touting, and this book was about a little girl, a little black girl who thought that you had to have on white socks before you could drink out of the white drinking fountain in the South some place.  And it's some sort of, you know, thing that you know that not every child would relate to nor have any experience with and black children needed like another rock in the head, as far as I'm concerned, but this is the kind of thing that white publishers feel that they should be giving to our children.  Now when they get a book that is challenging the chi- the, the protagonist is challenging, she has to be creative and solve her problems and there're family situations and all kinds of things, good stuff, they don't want, they don't want to hear it.  They don't want to hear it.  I mean they, I mean I shouldn't say they don't want to hear it.  A lot of publishing companies are doing some wonderful things, but a lot of them are just so narrow minded about what they publish.  Well we, this is, anybody can write this book.  Well anybody can be a people too, you know anybody.  So, if it's not black, black, black, black, whatever that is, we don't want it.  We can't put our black children into our society like everybody else.  We, we have to set them aside and make them something different. (Makes sound) So, and, and I (laughter) get passionate about that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, this is, but this is, is it two different kinds of books.  This one is I guess a novel, a small novel like, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a novel. Yeah, and, and then I had--the reprint of that book I desi- I had that redesigned and I put in illustrations and so I and, and it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I mean that was a pu- they weren't, since they weren't gonna reprint it and re- and reissue a paperback copy, I thought I would and I did, and it's sold quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so does this get distribution?  Is it hard to get your books distributed through the school networks?  I know they have book fairs at all the major schools.  I was just at one last week where they were setting up a book fair and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it's, it's, it's hard because the publishers do that.  And if the publishers don't do anything, they don't do anything that's all.  I mean I don't know what the secret is because not being a marketing person.  I do, now these, my other books are marketed by Steck Vaughn [Steck Vaughn Publishing Corporation], and these are educa- mostly educational books that they go directly into the schools.  They're purchased directly by schools, and all of these are in, in schools and libraries--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) so.
Story_ID: 613705
Speaker 1: Now you have one about the life of Charles Bolden [HistoryMaker General Charles Bolden, Jr.], the black astronaut (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah now they did a video, I mean an audio tape that goes with that and the teacher's manual and the whole bit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that you can purchase as a, as a packet.
Speaker 1: It has pictures of him growing up and about his aspirations.
Speaker 2: I spent time with his mother [Ethel Martin Bolden].  I spent a week with her, and she's in Columbia, South Carolina--was, she died recently, well a couple of years ago.  And I knew Charles before I wrote that book, so I, he, he approved. Now this is not the book that I wrote.  I just excerpted this from, from the book.  I wrote a big book about him, and but that's all they wanted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were never able to publish all you wanted to publish.
Speaker 2: Well, I haven't published it.  I could publish it.  I kept the rights to it, but, so I could publish it anytime I wanted to, but you know they, they have a--for the, for this age group they have a, a, a fiction and nonfiction in the usual categories.  Am I--and so, so--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: But that's, but that yeah, that, they have the fiction and nonfiction book in all of those categories.
Story_ID: 613706
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you first started writing, you were teaching I take it too at the same time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did it come a time when you decided you couldn't do both at the same time or something or, or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I didn't really (laughter), I didn't really start writing until I finished teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I had written, I wrote the 'What Color Are You?' [Darwin McBeth Walton]. I had that published while I was teaching, but it really is, you know it's very difficult to teach and write (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There're quite a few books that--here are two here about the Underground Railroad.  I see there may be more, but 'Jetty's Journey to Freedom' [Darwin McBeth Walton] is like a personal story of an escape I guess or, and then another one called 'Journeys of Courage on the Underground Railroad' [Darwin McBeth Walton].  They both are beautifully illustrated, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah I did, well of course I, I didn't, I had nothing to do with the illustrations.  I did rec- made some recommendations on the, on the, the pictures from the journeys because those were historical pictures.  All of those are historical.  But, I wrote, wrote that book, Glennette and I collaborated on this book.
Speaker 1: That's Glennette Turner [HistoryMaker Glennette Tilley Turner], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Glennette Turner. Um-hm. She, she had been, she had done so much research for her Underground Railroad book ['The Underground Railroad in Illinois,' Glennette Tilley Turner] and I helped her edit that.  So, I was so conversant with the, with the Stills book ['The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First Hand Accounts,' William Still] and all the, the research that she had done that mine was a cinch to write you know.  When, so when the publisher asked me if I would write that, I thought wow yeah.  So, Glennette gave me some pointers, and we put that one together and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay
Speaker 2: --'Jetty's Journey' is a fiction, it's fictionalized of course, fiction.
Story_ID: 613707
Speaker 1: Now you got like family--you got two family books, 'A Family Is Special' [Darwin McBeth Walton] and 'A Part Of Our Family' [sic. 'Part of My Family,' Darwin McBeth Walton] and, and then 'Nana's Kitchen' [Darwin McBeth Walton] another family theme, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And stor- a book about Kwanzaa--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which is you know interesting.  It was a very, it seemed like it was very well done, you know, from what I can see and I used to teach--
Speaker 2: I like that Kwanzaa book.  It's so beautiful.  They did some, the, the designer did a lovely job of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Steck Vaughn [Steck Vaughn Publishing Corporation] is, is--
Speaker 2: Steck Vaughn is an educational, is the educational har- one of the arms of Harcourt, Harcourt Brace I think it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What's your latest one?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a book about Harold Washington that is being, well considered I hope by Northwestern Press [Northwestern University Press, Evanston, Illinois].  It's--and I have another historical novel that is set in North Carolina that Harcourt Brace has.  So, I don't know what's gonna (laughter) happen with those at this point.  I haven't gotten any publishing dates yet (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I like to just have you hold these for a second.  Maybe you can just pull it out a little bit and just get a shot of some of these, just to people an idea of what you're doing.  So you got a book on Harold Washington that's coming out, yeah
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it's being considered by Northwestern.  Yeah, we'll see.  But this is such a pretty book.
Speaker 1: It is a--
Speaker 2: I do a lot of Kwanzaa programs, but this has, this is a definitive book about what Kwanzaa is all about, and, and about the, what it means and who practiced certain--
Speaker 1: A lot of information comes out about Kwanzaa, but unfortunately a lot of it is not accurate, but I see you took some time to really make sure--
Speaker 2: Well, this is one of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it reflected what Kwanzaa is about.
Speaker 2: --this book was, this came before the big push, you know when, before the big push for--I met his excellency briefly one time, Maulana--
Speaker 1: Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Karenga.  Yeah, I met him when he was here one time, he and his wife [Tiamoyo Karenga], and I gave him a copy of my book and he was very unimpressed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was he?
Speaker 2: He was highly, highly unimpressed (laughter), but when I looked at his I thought okay.  I guess he didn't want anybody to write any books but him (laughter).
Speaker 1: I, you know, I guess it's some ambivalence when you create something and you see it all over the place, you know, but I think from what I've seen of it I know him and I've read his book and, and have you know but it's a pretty good representation of what Kwanzaa--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he, he invented it he can do what he, he can say what he wants to say, but all of this in here is documented.  I mean this is what people do, so however, his, the holiday is interpreted is what we are after really, you know, I mean because nobody is gonna do it the same way.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, but it's, I think it's a good thing that, that we have something to sort of pull ourselves together and I don't know whether we are celebrating it as much as we should.  I had as many white children attend my Kwanzaa programs than I do, as I do blacks.  The white families are latching onto it because they think, I think they appreciate the principles and surely the principles are universal and they can be applied to any group.  I guess--
Speaker 1: It wasn't really intended to be applied to any group.  I think that may be the, the objections of some, but it can be, they can be, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well no that's right it can't, it shouldn't, it's not, that's what he intend, he didn't intend it to do, but it could be.  I mean what they, what they mean can be in any, in any ethnic group they can do their own thing with use- with using the same--I, I--the way I see it is.
Story_ID: 613708
Speaker 1: Not too long ago Virginia Hamilton passed away in Yellow Springs [Ohio].  She was a prolific writer of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --children's books.  I guess Sharon Draper also in the Midwest here writes a lot of, in the Cincinnati [Ohio] area she produces lots of books about black history similar--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to yours and Glennette's [HistoryMaker Glennette Tilley Turner] you know.  Is there any association of, of writers that cover that kind of ground 'cause you know--?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that either one of them can be replaced.  I think there are a lot of writers who are trying to fill in the spaces that, that you know that are left.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Walter Dean Myers is one that we interviewed--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was really a great writer, yeah.
Speaker 2: --he does a lot of good stuff.  There are several, several, quite a few writers.  I mean there--Jerdine Nolen.  She's in, she's in, in Maryland, Jerdine Nolen.  Do you know her?  Well, she's, she's quite a prolific writer.  She did, she's doing a lot of, lot of books, a lot of--hers a little different, but she has a real niche that she's filling in.  Of course the McKissacks [Patricia McKissack and Fredrick McKissack] are doing some wonderful things.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: There are a lot of, lot of writers out there that I, I'm trying to think who, who, of course nobody is gonna take Katherine Paterson's place and Sharon either.  But, I think we can all, we all sort of do what we can to, to try to keep the, keep it going.
Story_ID: 613709
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was wondering if there was an association, has anybody tried to form an association of the writers of black children's books or any, anything like that.  Has there been any gatherings officially or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know the poets get together, historians get together, you know.
Speaker 2: You know we tried, we had the Black Literary Umbrella that was going on for quite a while here in Chi- in the Chicago [Illinois] area and it was, it was organized at Johnson Publishing Company and I was one of the founders, Glennette [HistoryMaker Glennette Tilley Turner] was one of the founders and we, we went along fine for a long time and somehow or another the first president I think, it seems to me that Glennette was the first president, I was the next president, and (Unclear) Sage [ph.] was the sec- third president.  Then I think something happened.  Jerdine [Jerdine Nolen] moved--people move away and, and the, the nucleus of the, of the organization flounders because you know it just sort of, the strength, the, the, it takes passion to run an organization.  You have to have a lot of passion, a lot of reasons for existence, and when the main people who have the dream go away, something gets lost in that.  So, it's very hard to start over.  The same thing happened with the Children's Reading Roundtable of Chicago, which they've been trying to restart for years and years and years and it hasn't happened.  The Society of Children's Book Writers [Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators] is probably as close to a writers organization for children that I know here in, in the area, but they're not necessarily for black writers and, we turned over the black, the, the Black Literary Umbrella to the Open Books program in Chicago so that it could be out of the open, be sort of have the, the, be under the umbrella of the Open Book program, which is an afterschool program headed by Marrice Coverson, and it's a wonderful organization.  So, I thought that would be, you know, a good substantial place to, to settle with, with blue, but it didn't work.  The man that was supposed to help her get that off the ground moved also, move back to Arkansas, so she hasn't done anything about it since then and you know I just don't have the energy to do that at this point because it would have to be Chicago based and it would just require too much moving back and forth and I, I, I have, I can't do that anymore.
Story_ID: 613710
Speaker 1: Now, you revealed too that you wrote the script for the Underground Railroad, some little Underground Railroad trip and drama that takes place out in--
Speaker 2: Oh at Graue Mill [Graue Mill and Museum, Oak Brook, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Graue Mill.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is about the fourth year, fourth, it's the fourth year we had, last time, and this year we had four shows, four programs, four different programs.  It was wonderful, well attended.  Glennette [HistoryMaker Glennette Tilley Turner] and I had started that four or five years with the Graue Mill.  We're both on the board there, and the Graue Mill is, repu- is, is historically considered an Underground Railroad stop, so that's why we thought it would be such a, a great place to be.  So, it's been, it's been growing and growing and growing.
Story_ID: 613711
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you this, when you look back on everything you've done to this point is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?  You've had quite a career, you know, singing, teaching to author.
Speaker 2: Well probably, not after all is said and done--why do I have this thing in my voice?  I suppose my first big mistake was not going to Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  That was my first, the only thing that I have regretted not doing in terms of my career.  But, everything else has sort of fallen into space, fallen into place and I guess I don't have any real honest to goodness regrets 'cause I've, you know, things have, I've been busy.  I've been productive, and I made a small contribution I believe to, to my reason for existence so I suppose what can you do, what can you say.
Story_ID: 613712
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have a family.  I have a lovely family and--
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your family, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, my--I have a son [John Walton] and a daughter [Claudette Walton Giles].  My daughter is, lives in Chicago [Illinois].  She's married and, and that she had, her career was in, she worked for the Chicago, isn't that terrible I can't reme- not, not the city, but the county, Chicago Cook County, Cook County [Illinois].  She worked for the Cook County organization, that's where she worked.  She's retired now from, she retired from her job as OEO [office of equal opportunity] officer.  My son is a law professor at North, Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], and he lives, they live in Batavia [Illinois] and he has a son [John Claude Walton].  So, my children are doing well and they have been productive and so what can I say.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your husband [HistoryMaker Claude Walton], we're finishing an interview with today.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: He's a famous athlete from Colorado and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right he has--
Speaker 1: --worked for many years in the Chicago Park [Chicago Park District]--
Speaker 2: --has his own history (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I really suppose my number one love is, has been with working with children.
Story_ID: 613713
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your legacy.  What today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I really suppose the thing that I've enjoyed most in my career, in my life I suppose has been working with children.  I feel that teaching has probably been--is the most rewarding job there is and, and I consider my writing to be a part of my teaching experience.  So, it, it, it's very difficult to, to separate as I said to you before the who I am to from the what I've done because I think it's all the same.  I feel like that.  I feel that, that, I mean and I receive a lot of mail from my, from my students.  As a matter of fact, we had a reunion not long ago and children came to see me that I hadn't seen in, I mean grownups came to see me that were now old folks that I had taught when they were young and they're now fifty-something.  One or two of them even in their sixties, and that's a real, there's something wonderful about knowing that people still believe that something you said or did had an impact on their life, and I think that, and this is probably the most gratifying thing of my existence to know that I had a positive impact on somebody's life.
Story_ID: 613714
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, the--my, my main hope still remains in the, in the teaching area.  My main concern is that we as, as a people, and I'm not even sure that we can be separated.  I think that we need some decided strategies for parenting, and I believe that the only place that we can get strategies for being good parents is while we are able, while we're on a captive situation when we're in school.  I believe until we start teaching parenting, the process of being a good parent as a universal criteria for education, we are not going to get there because parenting is not a position, it is an occupation.  The most ser- the, the most difficult occupation there is, and people, if people don't know developmental tasks of children they cannot raise them.  Parents need to know what to expect and how to deal with the expectations and how to set limitations and how to do this, that, you know what is best for the children as opposed to what is easy for them as parents.  And I believe that until we can figure out a way to get this into our school system, we won't have any starting point.  And this has been my, this has been one of my hopes all of my teaching that we would have some way to put, to integrate this into our curriculum. How we care about one another and why we care about one another, and, and what's going on, what's really happening.  We're losing, we're losing ground, I mean with our children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that this--and one of my hopes is that one day we'll all be able to do unto others as you want them to do unto you and I think it starts at home.
Story_ID: 613715
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you that we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think so.  I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right well--
Speaker 2: I really can't.
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I'd like to be remembered as someone who has a good sense of humor, who has a--who brings to the crowd a presence that makes life easier and happier, and I think that, that I'd like to be remembered as a good friend.
Story_ID: 613716
Speaker 1: Well, that was my, my daughter, Claudette [Claudette Walton Giles] after her christening, the day of her christening.  I think the date is on there, but she was, it was in, in the spring of 19--1952, '3 [1953], 1953.

Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-four [1934].
Speaker 2: Yeah, 19--about that, about 1934 yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay. How about this one?
Speaker 2: And that was one, that was a picture that somebody took at a, at a--I don't know maybe I posed for that picture.  I guess, I'm, I'm trying to remember.  Just a picture.  I don't remember.  Really, it's just a picture, I--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It looks professionally made--
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it was, it looks like it was probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  --(simultaneous) so I wonder if it was probably from modeling days or something as a head shot or something.
Speaker 2: Well, I was singing at that time. I remember the dress.  I just don't remember the time.  I remember that was, but I didn't remember making a black and white picture.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right.
Speaker 2: But maybe, I guess maybe most of the pictures were black and white then now that I think about it.
Speaker 1: That's Claude [HistoryMaker Claude Walton] and me on our wedding day.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay. All right Mr. Crowe [Larry Crowe].
Speaker 1: Okay we're gonna drop down to the smaller pictures at this time, I think I (unclear).

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And, Mr. Crowe.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the original edition, edition, hard cover of 'Dance, Kayla!'
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right, next.
Speaker 1: That's the collection of vignettes about famous and, maybe not so famous Underground Railroad peo- people who on the Underground Railroad escaped, some of the people who escaped to freedom as well as some of the people who helped them.
Speaker 2: All right. Here's another one (unclear).
Speaker 1: 'What Color Are You?' [Darwin McBeth Walton] was my first book and it's actually a story about the, the reasons for different shades of the skin scientifically speaking and what impact it's had on our sociological development in the United States as well as other places.  But it questions a child as to what difference does it make.
