Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [John Chase, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Viola Hall Chase, V-I-O-L-A, Hall H-A-L-L, Chase C-H-A-S-E.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Do you have an idea, an approximation?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You have an idea of how old she was when you were born?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna guess in her late twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just, I suppose she was born before the turn of the [20th] century, in 1898 [sic. 1894]?--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --something like that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, tell us what do you know about her side of the family in terms of your ancestors?  How, how far back can you trace your family on that side?
Speaker 2: Only really to my grandmother which was her mother, her name was Laura Hall, L-A-U-R-A, H-A-L-L, Hall.  I knew they came out of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Annapolis, Maryland, which of course is where I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is somewhat unusual in the sense that you have someone leaving a so called northern state, you know, coming to Maryland, you know, usually somebody leaves the South and goes north, it's not that far, I realize that, but is there a story about why she moved from Johnstown to Annapolis?
Speaker 2: I, I'm not aware of that now, my, I, I, no, I'm not knowledgeable of that at all.  My grandmother passed when, I'm guessing now, that I was around twelve maybe eleven or twelve, I remember her, you know, very well, you know, I remember her face and that type of thing but, I, I didn't know too much about the whys that you are asking now, about why she came from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to Annapolis, I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, are, are there any stories about your grandmother, or, or from your grandmother about her growing up or what her life was like back in the late 19th century I guess?
Speaker 2: You're talking about my grandmother still?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now, what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a school teacher, school teacher, so was my mother.  But my mother decided to work as a maid and cook in Washington D.C., which is relatively close to Annapolis or rather than teach school because she could make that much more money doing it that way.  I do know that.
Story_ID: 238732
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Viola Hall Chase] did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she go to college before she started teaching school?  'Cause I know, in those days, sometimes you could teach--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --school without going to college.
Speaker 2: I would, I, though I don't know for sure, but I would, I would say she finished college and then taught school.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she went to school?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, I need my sister [Laura Chase Farley] here bad.  (Laughter), I need her bad.
Speaker 1: Was it some place close by like?
Speaker 2: I wanna say Morgan College [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], that's where my father [John Chase, Sr.] went to school, I'll say Morgan College.
Speaker 1: Okay and, in, in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, did your mother have any stories about growing up?  Now was she raised primarily in Annapolis [Maryland] or in Baltimore or?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I think it was part, in part in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Then, then, I, I can't tell you the point at which she moved or and her family and mother moved to Annapolis. (Pause) No, I, I can't really tell you too much about the, her, her growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So there aren't too many family stories from that side, huh?  About--
Speaker 2: Not many.
Speaker 1: --about people in her family and what they were doing?
Speaker 2: No, and less were on my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, can you describe your mother's personality for us, and then what was she like?
Speaker 2: Warm, wonderful, loving, just a wonderful mother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, when you were coming up, was she working?  Was she teaching school or was she working as a maid at that point?
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Doing both.  She sounds very industrious, I would think that (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was, she was and of course you gotta remember too, she had two children, my sister who's two, three years older than I am, myself and she sent both of us to college, you know, she, she, I went through Hampton [Institute; Hampton University] in [Hampton] Virginia for four and a half years and my sister went through for four years, and she paid every dime of it.  We didn't, we, you know, not a bad, we, what little help I did was, I took what they called a work year at Hampton, my first year, you, you did combined studies and work on the campus and that money's applied to offset part of your cost, your college costs.  But, and wh--which wasn't that much, you know, but she paid for all of that.
Story_ID: 238733
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met, your mother [Viola Hall Chase] and father [John Chase, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Don't have the slightest idea.  They, they, they separated, I'm gonna guess at the most, I was ten years old when they separated and so I, I never really got to know my dad hardly at all, I, I knew my mother and my aunt and my uncle, my aunt who was my mother's sister and my uncle who was my aunt's husband, 'cause once my mother and father separated, my aunt, which is her sister and her husband took her into their home in Annapolis [Maryland], you see?  And, I don't, I don't remember my father at all, in fact, no don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, he really wasn't around at all then that you can remember?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever see him later on?
Speaker 2: I, you mean as I?--
Speaker 1: Yeah, as an adult--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: --did you ever come in contact with him?
Speaker 2: No, no.  He used to, I remember he used to come in the house on Saturdays and, and bring an arm full of groceries, you know, and I remember that very clearly and in fact, I even kid John [Chase, Jr.], my oldest son now, he does that, he goes out and he gets his little groceries, he lives with us and right, and every time I say, you sure remind me of my father, you know, bringing, doing that.  But, he didn't stay at the house and, if so I didn't get to see him hardly at all, no.
Story_ID: 238734
Speaker 1: What was your father's [John Chase, Sr.] full name, can you give us his name?
Speaker 2: Same as mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exact same as mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was senior then, right?  John (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, was he born in--well, where was he born and when?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he older than your mother [Viola Hall Chase]?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna guess, yes.  I'm gonna guess that, yes.  Not that much, but older, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so he was gone by the time you were ten, that's still, that's like, you're way, half way through childhood at ten but, do, do you remember much about his personality or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: No I, I, I didn't, didn't come into contact, in fact before ten, I didn't come in contact with him hardly at all.  When he would come in the house to bring the groceries, you know, that type of thing and, you know, it wasn't coming to bringing 'em and staying in, you know, he would, come in, far as I'm concerned he would leave, but, I, I just, I wish I, I knew things I had friends and older people who told me a lot about him, you know, that, for an example he was a very smart person, very intelligent, that he finished Morgan College [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], that he taught school for a while and became a principal of one of the schools and then went into the postal service.  But, I had no memory of that experience with him in those areas, you know, only what, what people, people tell me.  But, these are people like my mother's friends and all, you know, that, that growing up with, with they even went out and got much older and visit back in Annapolis [Maryland] and "Boy you're the splitting image of your daddy," you know?  That type of thought, you know, and that, oh he was a smart man, he, you know, they would, they would, people mostly talked like that, yeah, but I, to sit down and remember a conversation, I couldn't remember one as long as we've had.
Speaker 1: Is there, is there any, have you been able to detect what the problem was?  Why they, they split up and why he stayed away so, you know, much?
Speaker 2: From what little I get, that he sort of liked the sauce a little, he, he liked to drink, I, I, I do rec--remember that.  I don't remember him drinking, but I remember that being told to me by my parents, that he did do a lot of drinking, but that's, I don't remember that much of it.
Story_ID: 238735
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one sister [Laura Chase Farley] who is married and living in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, as we speak, they have three children.  One of her sons was administrative assistant to Mayor [Harold] Washington in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Farley, William Farley [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he now is in one of the big law firms in downtown Chicago, he's a part of this--I don't re--remember the name, but he is in one of the, one of the larger firms in downtown Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, her other son, John Farley [Jr.], is well, William Farley, who I just talked about is a graduate of re--of Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and John Farley is a graduate of West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] and is currently a lieutenant colonel in the [U.S. Army] Medical Corps stationed in Hawaii, as we talk and her, her daughter Laura is there in Lewistown with her.
Story_ID: 238736
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about growing up, what's your earliest childhood memory?  What's the first memory that you can come up with?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.  Going down to what we called the Yard, which was the U.S. Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland], which I spent a large amount of ti--I and my friends now, not just me, a large amount of time there watching athletic events, going to graduations, carrying my little box in front of me with the strap around your neck to hold cigarettes and Mr. Goodbars and candies and all to walk in and out of the line of the Middies [Midshipmen] as they marched from the yard to the train station, to play ball and they let us.  And that's the way we made a little money, we'd sell to the Middies and while they were in line they were permitted to buy from us, you know, and they, I guess the most interesting time at that time in life was right prior to them marching before they got out of the yard they marched past the statute of Tecumseh. Tecumseh, was an Indian [Native American] chief that they practically worshipped the midshipmen and, in, in Annapolis [Maryland] and they would throw coins to the statute as they marched past the whole brigade of Middies and--
Speaker 1: You probably don't understand why, but, I, why would?
Speaker 2: The coins were to bring 'em luck--
Speaker 1: Um-hum--
Speaker 2: --In the game that they were going to play.
Speaker 1: But why would Tecumseh, be a statue of him--
Speaker 2: I don't know.--
Speaker 1: --being in Annapolis?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know he was killed up near--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --up near, what was it like, northern Ohio, or, or near Detroit [Michigan].  He lost a big battle in can--in Indiana and there was up that way, you know, I don't think he ever?  That's kinda strange (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, but they threw coins to him and the reason why I know, because, I was one of the few that was up under Tecumseh, catching those coins (laughter).  When they came down, you know and I used to look forward to that, but I, I, that's something that I have always wondered why?  I could never get a connection between Tecumseh, and the U.S. Naval Academy, never could.
Speaker 1: That's really strange--
Speaker 2: But they did it.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  So, you were there, down there waiting to catch the coins, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right there.  Oh yeah, yeah.  I also, during graduation I hung around, and when they said, hip, hip, hoorah three times and threw the hats up, you know, you could get twenty, twenty-five dollars for a hat then, and that's--
Speaker 1: Could, you mean from them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --I mean before retrieving that hat--
Speaker 2: From their guest from their boyfriend or their girlfriends and mommas and daddies and, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five dollars in those days was, was-
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: --really twenty-five, it was like--
Speaker 2: Yes you could--
Speaker 1: --a hundred dollars now.
Speaker 2: --yes, you could--
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Yea, yeah, yes sir.
Speaker 1: That's something, I've never heard that part of the story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think very few people have heard the flip side of that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 238737
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Excuse me, I, I, if I, if I interpret correctly, what you're asking, growing up to me was always like looking, like going up the steps, you know, you're looking at another round of experience to, to, to try to corral, and to try to plan for, to try to interpret.  Sometimes you hit it and most times you missed it but it, it was to me, it was a, it just as I draw blueprints today, to me, I was drawing a blueprint growing up.
Speaker 1: What, what were some of the things that you saw growing up and what were some of the smells that were around in the neighborhood and some of the sounds that were around and through your neighborhood when you were growing up?  What did your neighborhood look like?
Speaker 2: Fourth Ward Annapolis [Maryland], nothing, nothing, and I mean nothing.  You got up every day and you looked to your left a half a block and you looked into the main entrance to the Annapolis jail.  Excuse me, there always was your gang on the corner, and I was a member of the gang in Annapolis.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your, of the gang?
Speaker 2: We didn't have a name.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't have a name.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your street?
Speaker 2: Clay Street, Clay, 16 Clay Street, C-L-A-Y.  We did have a little group called the Lucky Seven, I think it was, Lucky Seven that, I remember very vividly a fellow that grew up a half a block from me, Joseph [B.] Williams [Sr.], who is deceased now but he was the first commissioned officer in the [U.S.] Merchant Marines in World War II [WWII].  Joe was just a bad little boy, you know, we used to, we called him, Dirty Dog, that's what we called hi--and it was so funny because a lot of times, I, I know one time I said to Joe, I said, "Joe you know what?"  And this was on one of the occasions where he was being lorded for something good that he done, he did a lot of good, I said, "But for the grace of God, man you could be in the Maryland Penitentiary [Maryland Metropolitan Transition Center, Baltimore, Maryland] right now" and he could, 'cause he did that kinda stuff.  I did it sometimes myself, really like the soft drink trucks come through and would leave with less than they came through and they didn't leave it in the store, you know, that type of thing.  The other thing I guess was about Annapolis, when you think of sights, sounds, my bewilderment a lot of times was that the sounds were of nothing, there was nothing, you know, there was nothing.  Our home was roughly five blocks from the main gate into the yard and I couldn't even go there other than to go down and watch a game or something, even in that we had to sit in the segregated section to see the game.  So there wasn't too much to look for.  What, what, that which you did look for, you formulated yourself and, and sort of just went after it, that's all--
Story_ID: 238738
Speaker 1: I think the matter of having good teachers and that's what I will, will always credit, the teachers that I had, I'm speaking now in elementary school and high school [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland].
Speaker 2: What, what were some of their names?
Speaker 1: Elementary school, Mrs. Henry [ph.], Mrs. Carter [ph.], high school, principal Mr. Butler [ph.], Ms. Madeline Tate, you might of heard of the U.S. attorney Tate, it was her, her, it was his wife, Ms. Madeline Tate, Ms. Rachel Carter Smith, Ms. Ruth Barnum [ph.], and I guess, most of all, a Mr. Marchand, M-A-R-C-H-A-N-D, who was our manual arts, as they called it then, teacher who used to call everybody, my boy, you know, even if he's talking to a girl, he'd say, my boy, you know, but he would always, not always, but maybe every month maybe would go around the class, "My boy what do you plan to be when you grow up?  My boy what do you plan to be?"  Just going--and you had to say what you--and I remember very vividly when he got to me, I said Mr. Marchand, I don't know what you call 'em but, I wanna be the person over construction.  I wanna determine, I don't know if I used the word determined, but I, I wanna be the person who is over all the construction, determine what it looks like, the colors that are in it, how the rooms and spaces go.  And, and at that time he said, "My boy, you wanna be an architect."
Story_ID: 238739
Speaker 1: You were talking about, we were talking about school and how your instructor was telling you what an architect [Mr. Marchand] was, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: [Wiley H.] Bates, B-A-T-E-S, High School, Annapolis, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, Annapolis, Maryland, was that Anna Arundel County [sic. Anne Arundel County, Maryland], or something?
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: How'd you know that?  That's right.
Speaker 1: I've been there a lot, a lot I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Anne Arundel County.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.  And so, so, now you finally knew.  Now how old were you when you found out what an architect was?
Speaker 2: I was a junior in high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was about fifteen.
Speaker 1: But you knew that you wanted to, to build, buil--to design buildings?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now how did you get that idea that you wanted to design buildings?
Speaker 2: Well, I have always since I can remember been inclined toward building things, making things, drawing things.  I used to draw airplanes and cars and the only job I've ever had was working for a contractor, with the -- excepting the times I did a little waiting, waiting tables, you know -- but, I've always, I, I, I'm always making something, I made the, we talked about my grandmother [Laura Hall] a few minutes ago, I made her tombstone and it's there now, right there in Annapolis right now and made it out of concrete, I mean, I built the form, poured the concrete put some steel, didn't know what I was doing with the steel but I just did it.  I, in the summers I'd come home, I'd work for contractors, I worked all the way from, my, my job was just keep the job clean and of course we was pulling nails because at that time you, you didn't throw anything away.  You'd clean the, the piece up and pull the nails and straighten the nails and kept those and, and used the two by four, to make, whatever it was that was left over but, all I know is construction and, and that, that's, I wanted to be in the what I call the higher realm of it and that's a bad definition I know, but I wanted to be at the top of it because I, I knew that's where the people were that determined what the house would be like, what the building would be like, what whatever would be like.
Story_ID: 238740
Speaker 1: Now did you know any black architects, did you know any, anybody in the black building trades that was, you know, that you could talk to about?
Speaker 2: At that time, no.  I did later on become very close to who, a man who I thought was one of the greatest architects that ever lived, Paul Williams out of Los Angeles [California].  He's been a guest at our home here in Houston [Texas], we've been a guest at his home in Los Angeles, it's, you know, so, I knew Paul, I have greatest respect for the man, I wouldn't call him Paul, if he was living, I could talk to him right now, it'd be Mr. Williams.  I remember William [H.] Moses [Jr.], who was my teacher at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], one of my teachers at Hampton in architecture that was good, he was a designer's designer, he entered the, a, a national architectural competition in the late '30s [1930s] to design the entrance gates to the [New York] World's Fair in New York [New York], he won it and they refused to give him the prize, but they gave him the money that was associated with the win.  The prize was to get the entrance gates built by your design, they wouldn't permit that.
Speaker 1: This is for the New York's World Fair?
Speaker 2: Yes siree [ph.].
Speaker 1: Of what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm gon' be, I'm guessing, I'll be guessing it was somewhere in the mid to late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in--see I went to Hampton in '41 [1941], and the side of the story was there then, you know?  Wh--with when I begin to find out about it but, men like that who, these were some good people that just, just didn't, didn't have the opportunity that I've had--
Speaker 1: Okay.--
Speaker 2: --You know, the Benson [Leroy] Dutton, B-E-N-S-O-N, Dutton D-U- double T-O-N, a professional engineer, went on to become the director of public works for the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], public works directors are always engineers, this man built bridges, he did the structural side of the building, the trusses, the floor systems, that type of thing.  Dutton was as good as they get and he taught me at Hampton and, and to me it, the way I foun--eventually found out that he was as good as I thought he was.  See, when I went on some, see '48 [1948], some three or four years after I graduated to take the state board exam down here in Texas for my license, for my architectural license, a portion of that license is on engineering, structural engineering, which is what Benson was, the highest mark I made was in structural engineering and it was because of the, the wonderful manner in which that man could teach and the information that, that he had and, and, and, and just put out there for you to get, so tho--those, those people, Dutton and Moses, Paul Williams, were, were the people that, that I've looked up to for a long time.
Story_ID: 238741
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna take you back to grade school for a second but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in grade school, did you, so you didn't really know what architecture was then, but you liked to build things and make things.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you mentioned like making your grandmother's [Laura Hall] tombstone?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did, how old were you when you did that?
Speaker 2: I was about in the sixth or seventh grade then.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, about the sixth or seventh grade and the last time I visited her grave the tombstone was as nice as it was when I put it up out there.
Speaker 1: There's something that, as someone who's been to a lot of cemeteries, I do a lot of cemetery walking as a, for historical curiosity and so forth, but and you--the concrete ones, I've seen a few concrete ones and they do stand up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot better than marble and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --some of these other materials.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Granite and marble, a lot of 'em you see the marble starts bending and--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --the surface--
Speaker 2: Stain.--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --And everything else.--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  The concrete does seem to stay crisper.
Speaker 2: --Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there--you didn't, of course you probably didn't know that then did you or did you?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was looking for something that was lasting, you know, you know that's versus putting a piece of wood up or even then, you know, you could have gotten wood that was, that would have stayed a pretty good while too.  But, I was looking at the lasting qualities of it, the, the material and decided to use concrete.
Speaker 1: I guess it cost too, on some of them, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I've always admired concrete really, always admired it as to what you could do with it, the possibilities.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, that, that's something, you know, six or seven grade, so you just made a--poured concrete?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So you do the lettering yourself and everything on it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, right, in the wet concrete.
Speaker 1: 'Cause like most architects you're an artist, a draftsman right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.

Speaker 1: So did you like to draw buildings mostly when you were--or did you draw other things, draw people?
Speaker 2: Most of the drawing I did was buildings, was buildings, I, I never got much into figures and human likenesses and that type of thing, you left that to my, my friend who was a classmate of mine at Hampton University [Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia], John [T.] Biggers, I don't know if you--
Speaker 1: John Biggers?
Speaker 2: --ever knew John Biggers of (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I never met him, but I know about John Bia--John Biggers, he's one of the greats--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was outstand--
Speaker 1: --One of the all-time greats.
Speaker 2: He was outstanding, we've got some of his work in our home right here and right now.
Speaker 1: That's right he's left like a--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --A trail of--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --artists that admire him and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --continuing in his tradition.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we did the, our firm did the headquarters for him for Local 872 I.L.A. [Houston, Texas], International Longshoreman of America [International Longshoremen's Association], that must have been thirty years ago and I went to John, I said John, I've got an idea I'd like to see first of all if you think you could put it in a drawing and asked what would you charge to do it and let's try to sale this thing to in, to go into this building.  And I went on and told him, I said I can see something about as tall as the wall and something that would run I guess, I told him I don't know, thirty, forty feet, I said but what it would do, it would be a, a picture quality piece that would show the birth and growth of labor in this country where at first it was, labor was strictly at the mercy of management in turns of salaries, in terms of anything and as you, they begin to negotiate and they contribute and all that through the years, it got to a point where now, labor and management can sit across the table and, and, and iron out their difficulties most of the time and come up with a decision rather than labor waiting for management to make the decision fo--.  I say I like, and then what I'd like to see is the conference table that these men are sitting around, be drawn in the likenesses of the directors of Local 872, right here.  And he'd looked, his eyes got that big and all and he did it.  Outstanding!  And course that's been with the union, since that time and you can imagine how long ago that's been, since that time now, the unions have merged, they've kept the peace, you see?  It's still there and showing just as good now as it did thirty years ago or forty years ago.
Story_ID: 238743
Speaker 1: Well, I'mma get you out of school sooner or later but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, now what kind of personality did you have when you were a young man, how would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: Quiet, unassuming. Unassuming in so far as, I sort of tried to take things as they come, you know, excuse me, definitely a go-getter, a want to achieve that was, I, I don't know of anything, it was, it deeper in me than that.  Wanting to achieve and that's--
Speaker 1: Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, surely was, made good marks and my, I never been in any trouble, the only time I, I've been in jail though.  I was put in jail, it wasn't my fault.
Speaker 1: Right down the street from where you lived?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, this was in Heflin, Alabama.
Speaker 1: While you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: This was, no, I'd finished Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Story_ID: 238744
Speaker 1: This fellow and I, a friend of mine, he'd finished Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and we were working in Austin [Texas] together, that's right prior to coming here and we decided to go visit our parents.  He lived in Moss Point, Mississippi, and of course I was from Annapolis [Maryland], and we drove to both places.  Leaving his house coming back, leaving my house coming back, both of our mothers said to us, "Now, don't y'all pick up no hitch, hitchhikers, don't you dare do that, that's too dangerous, your dad"--and, and why did, I don't know why, but they, that's the last words that they said, and "Be good."  So, now we take off on our way back to Austin, we get to, right outside of Heflin, Alabama and there was, it was this white soldier hitchhiking, he was hitchhiking for, and he looked sincere, you know, and all, and, and I said to Buckley [ph.], I said, I guess I just forgotten everything both of the mothers had sa--I said "Let's do a good turn and pick him up" and Buck said "Okay."  Man we pulled over, excuse me and picked him up, not realizing that, that it could've been a plant, or just anything, I, I didn't think like that, you know?  But when we got into, going into Heflin, this squad car came up with horn as loud as you wanna hear.  "Pull over!" Man it scared both of us to death, got over and they said, the normal questions, you know, but then they say, they said "What you doing riding this white boy?"  That's what they said to us.  And so we went on and said, "Well sir, we," we were saying sir every other word then see and said, "Sir, we were just trying to, we thought we'd do a good turn and give him a lift, give him a ride." He said, "Well I'll tell you what, we, we gon' give you a ride" and, and they had this, this white boy began to try to talk up for us.  Now whether it was a plan or not, I don't know, I guess I'll never know, but he said, pr--he went to say something, didn't get it all the way out and the officers, it was about three of them, three officers said, "Look you shut up, don't you say nothing, say nothing, get outta here, you get outta here." That's the way he got out and went away, haven't heard from him to this day.  But man they took us to the jail, which was the second floor of the sheriff's apartment in Heflin, Alabama. Never forget it as long as I live. And they searched us and all, everything we had, we had to leave with them, put our wallets, all, everything and that evening, that was Friday evening, they came up with the food, food was in what I call a pie pan, what you make pies in, you know?
Speaker 2: Tin, tin pan type?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And it was greens, cornbread, and gravy.  Well, Buck looked at it and I looked at it, it, Jack [HistoryMaker John Chase] you just couldn't eat it.  Just wasn't no way, you know.  So, the, the sheriff's wife is the one who serves the food, see?  So, when she came back up and all, "You boys didn't--?"  "No, we weren't hungry, we just, we weren't hungry."  Man the next day they bought that same greens, cornbread and gravy, and you should have heard Buck, "Pass the gravy," (laughter), and I said, "Pass the greens," you know, we had us a eating good time, you know, when we realized they're serious.
Story_ID: 238745
Speaker 1: Well we went in Monday, we got out Labor Day, which was Monday--we went in Friday, I mean, we got out Labor Day which was Monday. And Saturday night, the, these are pictures I'll remember forever.  See, inside of the cell, was another cell in the corner and that's the cell that they put the bad boys in, you know, that the bad ones were put in that cell and th--Friday night, I heard 'em say--you could hear everything that was going on--the sheriff told his wife, said "Go on up and tell," I'll just call her now Beatrice, that wasn't her name, but, "Call up and tell Beatrice and tell Slim to come on down here" 'cause somebody reported him for something and they didn't go up to get 'em, said "Tell 'em to come on down here."  And Lord knows we looked up, here come Slim, that's the baddest looking dude I've seen in a long time, came in there and they were, everybody was very nice to Slim, very, very nice, he stay--in fact, Slim got in there and lot--like that Saturday morning, Saturday evening Slim was out, we was still in there.  Monday afternoon, they called us down to give us back our personal stuff and, when they get--the only thing that was really important to me were the wallets, you know, and, and when they gave us the wallets, we looked in both of them, and between us, between Buckley [ph.] and I there was eleven dollars, now, we had more, than that, more than that and he didn't know how much he had, and I didn't know how much I had, but we--I guarantee I had much more than that and that was what we had to get us to Austin, Texas from Heflin, Alabama, driving.
Speaker 2: Eleven dollars?
Speaker 1: Had it not been for Buckley knowing so, see Buckley went to Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in Alabama, he knew a bunch of people around there, he called some friends and also had arranged for a few bucks and that's how we got the gas and all to go, to go back, but, though that was my time in, in jail.
Speaker 2: And, wo--there was no--what, what was the charge, they didn't charge you with anything?
Speaker 1: Nothing, nothing.  It, when--it, it, was kind of funny when, when they was letting us out and gave us the wallets and stuff back, we looked in and saw what we had, Buckley said, Buckley was sort of a bad dude himself now see, you know, I didn't have the nerve that he had, but, Buckley said, "Sir, aren't you gonna give us a receipt for the money you took?"  That's what he said.  And boy I shook like a leaf when he said, 'cause you know, and his words were this, "Hell no nigger, I ain't gon' give you no receipt, now write your congressman that."  I said, "Buck, come on man, let's get outta here, let's get outta here" and that's what we did.  But, that has since stayed with me for a long time, you can imagine how long ago that's been, a long, long time.  So, when you looking for something to serve as a, a reason to try to excel or exceed, that to me was enough in itself.
Story_ID: 238746
Speaker 1: How did you decide to go to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] I mean, what was the--
Speaker 2: Because my sister [Laura Chase Farley] went, my sister's about three years older than I am, she went, then I said, well that's where I ought to go, too.  So, that's no plan, no nothing.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Just.
Speaker 1: --from what you're saying, I guess you really liked it at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did, I, I, fell in love with it as a school, I, I, graduated with honors, I, went on and was elected to their board of trustees and served on their board for about twenty years as member of the trustee board.  That's when the first president was Brud [Jerome H. Holland], played all that ball at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], oh God.
Speaker 1: Well, somebody'll get it from this kind of--
Speaker 2: Right, I got, wait played,
Speaker 1: --from that description--
Speaker 2: --played a whole lot of football--
Speaker 1: --wish I could tell you.
Speaker 2: --At Cornell, and on through to Bill Harvey, [HistoryMaker] William Harvey who's president down there right now as we speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were talking about some of the professors there who were teaching, they, they taught, now what did you major in undergraduate school?  What did you major in?
Speaker 2: Architectural engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Architectural engineering.  When I went into graduate school at the University of Texas in Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], I decided to change it to straight architecture.
Story_ID: 238747
Speaker 1: When did you start at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?  What year was it?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Stayed there until, '43 [1943], and then went drafted in the [U.S.] Army in '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1944, that's just before the end of the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: That's right and got a chance to see it too and served in the Philippine Islands, Manila [Luzon, Philippines], Batangas [Luzon, Philippines], Baguio [Luzon, Philippines].
Speaker 1: Okay, in the Philippine Islands and so you didn't, did you go to both theaters of the war or just the Pacific?
Speaker 2: No, just the Pacific, but the funny thing, the Pacific, we were in a unit, we wer--we had a unit to join us that had been re-deployed from the ETO [European Theater of Operations], from Europe and those, those were some mad dudes man, (laughter) they left Europe, they went instructions that they were going back to the states home and somewhere the boat turned, (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: That's, that's my father's group.
Speaker 2: Is that?--
Speaker 1: Well, he, he was in a group that did that, I don't know if it was the exact--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --same group--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.  They, they--
Speaker 1: --He, he wound up in Okinawa [Island, Japan].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well no, I never got to Okinawa--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --They left Germany--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --through France and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I think they sailed out of the harbor--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --towards North Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then they ended up sailing all the way around to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Pacific, he couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We went first and then we docked in the Marshalls [Marshall Islands] from there into Manila, and Batangas in the Philippines and from there over to (unclear) and (unclear), back into Manila and Baguio and--
Speaker 1: What, what unit were you in?  Can you remember the unit?
Speaker 2: 4476, quartermaster unit.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Trained at Fort George [G.] Meade [Maryland], I, I'm sorry, at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in [Aberdeen] Maryland. Meade is in Maryland too, but trained at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Ma--in Maryland.
Story_ID: 238748
Speaker 1: Like a lot of World War II [WWII] vets [veterans], you more than likely experienced segregation in the armed f--services--
Speaker 2: World War II?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I served in a segregated [U.S.] Army, we in Manila [Luzon, Philippines], in the, every man in our company was African American, every man in our company, in our regimen, in our battalion.  They, in Manila there were two [American] Red Crosses, one in the hillside, one on the roadside, it wasn't anywhere in writing but for some reason, blacks went to the roadside Red Cross, whites went to the hillside Red Cross and see this group that, that was redeployed over from Europe and was so mad and they joined in their union, u--unit.  Those were some bad boys man, they were bad and, and man, I, I've seen 'em, I've seen them whip or jump on white soldiers who mistreated Japanese prisoners of war.  See, we had a whole contingent of prisoners under us and I got at home, I got stuff now where I made good friends with a Japanese captain, man they knew they was architect, artist or something man, and he drew  me a little picture, I got the picture at home now--
Story_ID: 238749
Speaker 1: In the Philippines [during World War II, WWII] they would, it's, they--what those white soldiers would do man, boy they would, they would catch this, you see the way they transported the Japanese prisoners was by open box car, just think of a box car where you stand up, you don't sit down, you stand up and you--when you stand up, about from your breast bone up is exposed, you see.  Man those trains would come through there full of Japanese prisoners, man those white soldiers would crack bottles, glass bottles and throw it, just do for target practice into those darn open boxcars man, and you got to hit somebody, you got to hit somebody, you know they were that tight in there and boy I, that's oh God I couldn't, just couldn't take it, you know?  But they did it.
Speaker 2: You said like some of the blacks would like actually intercede on behalf of the Japanese soldiers?
Speaker 1: Yes sir, I've seen that, I've seen that in Manila [Luzon, Philippines], in Batangas [Luzon, Philippines], yeah, I sure have.
Story_ID: 238750
Speaker 1: So you were in [the U.S. Army] until from '44 [1944]--
Speaker 2: Six--
Speaker 1: --what to '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you came out in '46 [1946], now had--you have a degree and you're a veteran, you got--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --your G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 2: --I didn't have a degree.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a degree then?
Speaker 2: Didn't have a degree, I was little over half way through Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], went back quickly because now I go back practically free, 'cause I got the G.I. Bill, I'm going back on and, you know, and the all the equipment and supplies, and architectural tools and stuff I'm getting free.  So I went back in '46 [1946], and in '48 [1948], I finished and got my degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you get married during this period of time?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Forty-eight [1948], after Hampton I left, I sat down with the placement director and they said "We got three placements," Hampton has good placement service, good for placing, "we've got three openings we can offer you." One's, what'd they say?  They called off Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Texas and somewhere else and I said "Well you can strike Texas off the list first," you know, (laughter) ain't no way, no way and so I picked Philadelphia and that's where they sent me working for a reinforced concrete engineer up there, by the name of Frederick [McDonald] Massiah, was on South Cypress [Street], in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and worked there for about a year and it--I always, you know, wanted to go into business for myself as an architect and I just didn't, I just did--didn't see Philly as the city that offered that kind of opportunity, you know? Cities like that so, I wrote back to Hampton and told 'em that and asked that, did they have another place when I could look at the job was a good job here and all and so forth, in the South preferably and I underlined the Deep South, and I never did think I'd do something like that and--
Speaker 1: Now why did you ask for the Deep South?  I mean why?--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Why did you ask for it?
Speaker 2: Because I just figured that up here where I am in Philly, they, they seem to me, they got everything they need, you know, they, but down in, down Deep South, I just feel they gonna be wanting stuff and don't have it and, and you know and be, the opportunity to build a church would be greater in the South than it would North.  The opportunity to build apartment buildings would be greater, that type of thing and I was right, I was right.  And so, they sent me on a job teaching school in Austin, Texas, so teaching in a G.I. veterans, a veterans school in Austin and I left and came down there and it was in Austin that I began, I was working for a lumber company, I was picking jobs like that, so--somebody that's where I'm near construction, you see?  And the Lott Lumber Company, and during, during that time, I got a chance to get some buildings to work on as an architect.
Speaker 1: Now this is 1949 or '50 [1950]?
Speaker 2: This is--that's right.  That's right, this is '49 [1949].
Story_ID: 238751
Speaker 1: This is '49 [1949] and what I would do, you know I said well to, in order--to me selling architecture is no different than selling insurance, you gotta know somebody, you know and so, this, I would visit, I figured it was the best way to know people, join church, you know and in get to know a bunch of 'em, but you need to get to know more if you go visit some churches.  And rather than walk into the church that Sunday, visit the pastor that Friday, at his home, tell him what you doing, blah, blah, blah, let him know you plan to visit him Sunday, but wouldn't dare do that without meeting him first, blah, blah, blah.  Man I did that, I bet you for a year, you know, just off and on, off and on, and we got so much work out of that that you wouldn't believe.  This very longshoreman building [Local 872 I.L.A., Houston, Texas], the president of one of the locals was a member of one of the churches that I visited, that came up to me and said well, he says, I'm the president of so-and-so and we, we're thinking seriously on building a new headquarters building and we'd like for you to do it.  I mean it was just that simple, (laughter) and so you know, that went on, I imagine we've done two to three hundred churches, you know, from there through now, and it all, you know, so it spread like that.
Story_ID: 238752
Speaker 1: In doing that, being able to do that work, I found out that, goodness I don't have, or know as much architects as I thought I knew, you know, 'cause now I'm in it and I'm doing it and some stuffs coming up what I don't know nothing about, so I said maybe I ought to go on and do some graduate work at, well if you're in Austin [Texas], you're thinking of graduate work in architecture?  Ain't nowhere to think about but the University of Texas [at Austin (UT), Austin, Texas], you see.  I didn't wanna go out of town and do nothing, but at that time, see we were right at '50 [1950] then, and, and at that time, UT was as segregated as any school in America.
Speaker 2: Now, in, in--when you, was it?
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 2: Fifty-one, [1951], yeah and you were a year before the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision?
Speaker 1: That is correct.
Speaker 2: Sweatt versus Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950] decision, right?
Speaker 1: Well, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: I think they filed a suit in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: It, it, it was, well the fall--the suit and all had been working but the, the, I went in approximately two weeks after the decision came down.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they, they admitted you and you started school two, two weeks after?
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I had applied, I'd applied before it came down.
Speaker 2: Do, do you think that the lawsuit, I mean the, this famous federal suit about, I mean, it's--
Speaker 1: [Herman Marion] Sweatt had applied to law school right?  So he was suing the university president or the head of board of trustees--
Speaker 2: [Theophilus] Painter.
Speaker 1: --Painter.  Do you think that that law suit like, helped you get in the University of Texas?
Speaker 2: I sure do, that's the only way I did get in because the Supreme Court decision ruled in favor of Sweatt, which incidentally was another good friend of mine, ruled in favor of Sweatt and I had already applied, you see, see I, I went out there one day and, to the architectural department, met and talked with a man that later on became one of my best friends, that he was professor and dean of the school architecture, [Hugh L.] McMath, told him what I wanted to do, I just, I need some more architecture, I, I, I know the situation that you got out here but surely it's got to be some way that I can get this?
Speaker 1: Now, so Mr. McMan--or was it Doctor McMath or Mr. McMath or?
Speaker 2: Mr. McMath.
Speaker 1: He, he was a professor of that school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --and he was dean of the school of architecture.
Speaker 1: --and he was in favor of you going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes siree [ph.].  In fact he said that when I was, you know, when we both realized that it was, it was segregated, he said, "Look," he said "ha--have you, are you familiar with this case in front of the Supreme Court right now?"  I said "To a degree."  He says "Well, give it just a little more time," that's what he said.  "And if that thing comes through, I think your answer, your, your prayers are answered."  And lo and behold, in about two or three weeks it came through and the minute, in fact, the way I found out about, that it had come through, was through a telephone call from the Associated Press out of New York, who told me this. I didn't know it, you know, and that the news hadn't reached me anyhow and they were "Well we understand that your name is, is, you have applied and so what are your plans?"  I said well, what, it was a deal when, when you go in in the summer session or wait to the fall?  I said I will go in as quickly as I can, like that, which probably will be the summer session and that's when I did start.  And, so the Supreme Court, the decision came down, I got the call, they scheduled registration for the summer session about two or three weeks later and everything was just working right in hand, I went out there to get to register just like everybody else and I had gotten a acceptance thing then and, and registered and went on in.
Story_ID: 238753
Speaker 1: Let me just set the stage for something else here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You, give us your personal reflection on this but, in the school of architecture [at University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] now, you had someone who wanted you there, the dean [Hugh L. McMath] wanted you there, and he was really, and he couldn't let you in because of the law of the State of Tex--Texas--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in the beginning.  But now he could, but in terms of Herman [Marion] Sweatt, and the four law school, they were before the student's right, that applied to the University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], they were on that suit with him?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They had a pretty rough, the law school didn't really want 'em there, am I right?
Speaker 2: See, had, had the [U.S.] Supreme [Court], I've always said this, I don't know how much truth is in it, but had the Supreme Court decision been Chase [HistoryMaker John Chase] versus Painter, I would have never made it.  Sweatt would have probably got in and become a very fine lawyer by now, he was, Sweatt was quite a person now, great speaker, very intelligent, but I really, I couldn't tell you, point to nothing specific there but, I, I, I just believe that had that case been built on me, that I would not have gone in or had I gone in, I would have been flunked out, Sweatt was flunked out, you see, and heck I knew Sweatt well enough to know that Sweatt wasn't supposed to been flunked out of no law school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The person I was asking you about when I came in off camera we were talking about it, Dr. Jacob Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.], he was one of the four students with Sweatt and he ended up becoming a political science professor and getting a Ph.D from the University of Colorado [Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] but he couldn't deal with it either, he couldn't deal with their law school.
Speaker 2: I could understand.
Speaker 1: Once they started, he had to get outta there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can, I can--
Speaker 1: He said, he said, he was--
Speaker 2: --understand that.
Speaker 1: --he was so angry--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --he couldn't really continue.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I tell you when, when I worked the walked in that class, the very first day, Life magazine was there among others, Austin [Texas] statesmen and all the rest of 'em and let me tell you, you could pick the friends out right away, you could pick the foes out. Nobody had to tell you, you could tell it, you could tell it.  Now, the, I mean the ones that you thought and felt were okay, would do things like, you'd be sitting at your desk drawing and studying and doing on, they'd come in, saw you been working long enough let's go to the union and get a soda or a sandwich or something, come on go with us, you know?  See, now that made you feel good, or, or the time that Hollands [ph.] and his wife said, and that, at this time now I'm married see?  Said look, why don't you and your wife [Drucie Chase] and, and my wife and I go to the game this weekend, go to the game on campus and, oh we did.  And, and the joke there, in fact Holland said, yeah, we in there walking into the stadium and he says, "Boy I'll tell you the eyes of Texas are on you now." (Laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't ea--it wasn't easy though, I mean, to try to--I would imagine all the media made--made it difficult I would guess.
Speaker 2: It, it had its affect, it had its affect, I thought at one time these people who were following me around the campus were negative and I had some checking done on them and found out they were [U.S.] Secret Service people.

Speaker 1: So you became effectively--[Herman Marion] Sweatt dropped out right of law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas]?  And--
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: --oh they flunked him.
Speaker 2: They dropped him out.
Speaker 1: You, you said they flunked him.
Speaker 2: They dropped him out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they did, and that was the bad part.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker Jacob H.] Carruthers [Jr.] left and I don't know the other three fellows though.  Did any--
Speaker 2: There was a gentleman in--
Speaker 1: --of that group--
Speaker 2: --in chemistry and there was a guy from Waco [Texas] in government, they went on to finish, they went on to finish.  But you see, when I went in UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], I went in the graduate school, these other folks that I just called names of were in the undergraduate school, y--you see, so it, it's a different, it's just a different situation there you know?  Well, it, it was just, it was just different you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you became effectively the first black graduate of the University of Texas right?
Speaker 2: First black enter to enter and the first to graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right, and from time to time people make mention of that you know, and how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Oh I, you know, I as it's said I wanted some architects and that's, that's what I wanted and that's what I got a good dose of 'em up there, you know, I got a, got a real good dose of it.
Story_ID: 238755
Speaker 1: I feel good about it really I've, things began to mellow out as I, I stayed involved.  Which I did, I'm speaking even after graduation, now, I, I was elected president of the, the student body, the Ex-Students' Association [of the University of Texas], which is saying the same as the alumni association, (unclear) I guess within the five largest ex-student associations in the country, I was elected president to that and state president for a year and I've been selected to do two projects there at UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] as an architect.  The one's, one you're looking at right there, that stadium which is a track, field and soccer stadium for, for the University of Texas and we did a parking garage, the largest one that they have up there, we did that.  I was requested and joined the chancellors counsel which is the, one of the groups that are looked at quite favorably on that campus and the thing I like about it is that, among other things they had their first meeting in the fall of the year and it's always at the site of the out of town football game of the first out of town football game and that means we have, had chancellors council meetings in New York City [New York, New York] when we played Rutgers [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and we had it in Los Angeles [California] when we played UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in the Rose Bowl and, and on, and on, and on.  We do a lot of travel with them, we're in that, what they call the Flying Longhorns and we go everywhere from this country to other countries and, you know just enjoy it, no work, just enjoy it.  I was placed on the committee of 225, which is still active, it's purpose was to plan and administer a fundraising effort for the university, they'd set as its goal--and people laughed--a billion dollars, we raised something like a billion and a quarter, this just out as, this just happened almost as we're talking now.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're still involved and--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah--
Speaker 2: --very much involved?
Speaker 1: --Heavily involved with it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 238756
Speaker 1: --Let me ask you a couple of questions about, about those days though when you were in school, did you, was there ever a time that you wanted to quit?  You thought it was just not worth it?
Speaker 2: No, I never got to that point.  Now, it, it did get to points where I got awfully mad with some folks, you know, but, but no, not to quit, no.
Speaker 1: And then the other question is like, what was, what did it feel like to get finished with your pro--with your degree and be done with it?  How, how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Free.  (Laughter)  You know, I'm free, I, you feel good you know?  A lot of that stuff, you know, I guess archi--architect is easier than most subjects, you can always, say something is bad if it's not, you know, but I never ran into that, I never really ran into that, they, they all, well not they all, but for the most part they treated me with respect and I treated them with respect.  I got to know some very, very important architects now that are now there, I got to know some very important people because of the work in relation--in relationships that I had at UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and I'm speaking now, presidents, and [Lyndon Baines] Johnson.
Speaker 1: So you came out in, in wh--what year was it that you?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Fifty, now you started at '52 [1952] right?
Speaker 2: Fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: You started in '50 [1950]?
Speaker 2: Fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You came out in '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: Right.  See graduate school takes you two years and a summer, actually it shouldn't really take you but one year and a summer, but my credits from Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] were lacking enough to make me have to stay that two years and a summer to get the master's [degree] which would, which meant that the first year was, was pr--was really make up work, of work that I should have gotten at Hampton and didn't, you see what I mean?
Story_ID: 238757
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your, what would you consider your first big project after graduate school [at University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: After graduate school--
Speaker 1: Did it take a while for you to get a real big project?  Or did you, or were you looking for a big pro--project?
Speaker 2: Well I guess it depends on what, what big is, (laughter), really, but--
Speaker 1: I guess I'm talking about what would seem big to you at the time.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  I was kinda joking then.  No, it, it didn't I, you, you, you got to remember again that this is why I don't give myself too much credit.  I was the only African American licensed architect, licensed to practice architecture in the State of Texas, now if that ain't a, a grip on the situation, I don't know what else is, you know, now there are more now, everyone of 'em just about has come through my office on their way to their license.  But at that time, you know, '53 [1953], '54 [1954], and on up, I'm the only lic--so, so many of these projects of any value require a licensed architect, see what I'm saying?
Story_ID: 238758
Speaker 1: Well I know one place you got a lot of work was Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Which was doing--
Speaker 2: There's no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: --had the largest black college campus in the, in the--Texas, am I right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And, and, and of course even that had, had quite a bit of politics involved in it. We were, I've always been a little political, I'm, I'm, I've quieted down now, but I, I'm not, I'm the one that stood on the street corner and preached, I didn't do that, but I paid 'cause I knew at that time that, and it's bad to say I guess but, a lot of the African Americans that were involved political were being paid, they were being paid and there's a group of us got together and called ourselves the UPO, United Political Organization [of Texas].
Speaker 1: Now what year was that formed?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, I'm gonna guess, '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the, the man that was its president through the whole time just passed about two weeks ago--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: --up in Austin [Texas], M. J. Anderson, A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.  But, we, we got together and formed that little group and, and we said, here's what we gon' do, we, everybody in here, it was ten of us, we got to beg, borrow or steal a thousand dollars and we gonna see who ought to be governor of this state down here.  Well at the time, [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson who had, well I won't get to deep into that.
Speaker 1: Well you can tell us now he's, he's passed and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laugher).
Speaker 1: A lot of things are, and I don't know what trouble you can get into now.
Speaker 2: Yeah well, if you remember John Connally had been appointed secretary of the [U.S.] Navy, by Lyndon and all and he was beginning to be prepped to run for governor down here and we decided, do, we were asked by the people would, all you got to do, is y'all get together and support him and we, we got together and discussed it and decided that we would.
Story_ID: 238759
Speaker 1: Tell us about the UPO [United Political Organization of Texas], now you said it was formed in '53 [1953], and you all were working, you were asked to support [John] Connally's can--candidacy for governor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we were, we were, that decision to support him was ours, but it was based on being asked and some other things, you know.  But that decision was ours to do and, and we did, we supported him and we, that meant in, in several, in more than one way, we supported him with our money, we supported him with our vote and we, we helped get the vote out that we could, that he won, you know, and for that he was always appreciable, I thought.  I don't know if you know it or not but, well it happens my guess in states, the, the governor appoints the normally the board of trustees and the chairman of the various university, you know, boards and so forth around the, around the country and, or the governor of that state and so we, we had a hand in who, who the board members would be and if you looked at the boards, we just made sure that, that these people were friendly to us and we to them.  In fact, the first group was almost predominately out of UPO, you see, and I had a chance to, to be on the board but, I'm an architect and I said I'd rather not, and I think I said basically, what I just said, I'm an architect, why should I want to be on the board and--
Speaker 1: Well, what can an architect get out of public--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --the public (laughter).
Speaker 2: But a conflict of interest.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You see?  So, again, you know you're down to a situation where, you weren't necessarily picked because you  were the best architect, you're the best designer in town but, you were picked because you were wanted by the, wanted by the people who did the picking, you see?  And so yes, I did, I got a number of projects at Texas [Southern] University [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: And were you the only, you were the only licensed black architect in the state--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --first of all, and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and Texas Southern is a black school and--
Speaker 2: That's right
Speaker 1: --you would think it all would make sense.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's exactly right.
Story_ID: 238760
Speaker 1: But before we leave the politics, what was, what was your impression of [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson?  You, did, did you have a personal relationship with Lyndon Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes indeed. Well we would, we would, usually those relationships add, add, added up to invitations to major affairs, et cetera, we were, went, went to the ranch fairly often, we were there for an example on one occasion when Hoss Cartwright [Dan Blocker], was one of the guest and I remember something he said that--
Speaker 1: Dan Blocker, the actor.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right.  He said something that I remember to this day, he was talking he said, "You know, people say that the Democrats are going down, down, down," he said, "well if this is any indication of it going down, I can't wait to get to the bottom."  (Laughter)  This man, you know wasn't nobody expecting anything like that you know?
Story_ID: 238761
Speaker 1: They were, they were good times, we, we've gotten presidential appointments again in the first category, being first we were the first member of the, the planning commission [U.S. Commission on Fine Arts] for the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], this is the commission that the, besides the worthiness of such projects as the Vietnam [Veterans] Memorial [Washington, D.C.], that came across their desk when you go look at that and see that in addition to the memorial, you've got a three person statute down there.  Have you ever seen the mem--you know those three soldiers in the, that was part of some of the things we did on that commission.  We, we said that, see at that time there was a big to do about serving, you know, in, in the service where even the monument itself that Maya Lin designed and she presented that to our commission, even that memorial was a memorial to the dead so they said, it had fifty some thousand names of soldiers who were killed.  There's but one living name on that board, so this got a group of veterans very mad because they didn't feel that, they said, good gosh is that some model monument to the dead?  And, and so our commission decided well maybe something else is needed to counteract that point and on came the three soldier monument with, in combat clothes with their arms with them, right where the, the "V" is like that on the monument, the statue is right there, you see?  Some people, we had said in the meeting, some people are gonna' think well goodness we don't have one monument there, we've got two, you know, and in essence that could or could not be true, I don't know but, at least it's there and that, plus doing a directory at the beginning of the "V," up here, so that if, if you're coming down to that monument to see the name of your husband, or brother, or uncle or father, see the names aren't on there in alphabetical order, they're on there in chronological order of death in Vietnam so, you got fifty something thousand names scattered all over this wall so how do you know what panel to go to?  So, we decided that you should have this directory so a person could look up the name, in which would be alphabetized and you'd find that name and across from that name would be the panel and line that the name would, they would find that name.  And, so those are some of the things I think politically we, we, we got out of it, many more, but they were some of the highlights--
Story_ID: 238762
Speaker 1: What was your impression of [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson, what was he like?
Speaker 2: I, I, I thought the man was sincere, I thought he was a good president, I thought he made some tough decisions, some that others may have backed off of.  I think he'll go down as one of the better presidents that we've had, I really do.  We've had the pleasure of, of meeting, I'm speaking of the UPO [United Political Organization of Texas] now, but our meeting with him in the White House [Washington, D.C.], not in the public areas but in the private areas upstairs of his setup and that to me was quite nice, I've got that picture at home that, you know, that was taken there.  But I, I think that Lyndon Johnson, I, we, well I've got a slang, he knew what time it was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about Lyndon Johnson you can share with us?
Speaker 2: No, I'd rather not say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd rather not say.
Story_ID: 238763
Speaker 1: In terms of your build--now you, you've built quite a, you were responsible for designing and, quite a few of the buildings on the Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] campus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And other buildings in Houston [Texas] too?  So, one that is a Toyota Center [Houston, Texas], right?  You were an architectural partner on the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Toyota Center where the [Dallas] Mavericks playing, that's right?
Speaker 2: Right, where the--
Speaker 1: Basketball game.
Speaker 2: [Houston] Rockets--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --play and--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the Rockets right, I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: --I, I just left Dallas [Texas] last week.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no--
Speaker 1: They were in Houston.
Speaker 2: We try to beat them every time we play 'em.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: Also, we were one of the architects on the George R. Brown Convention Center [Houston, Texas], we were one of the architects on the first dome that was built here, the very first one and on the remodeling of that dome.
Speaker 1: The [Harris County] Astrodome [Astrodome, Houston, Texas], the famous Houston--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Astrodome?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Our firm did the, all of the food service lounges, et cetera, for the new football area that's where the r--roof slides.
Speaker 1: That's where the new--
Speaker 2: --open.
Speaker 1: --Houston Texas [Houston Texans]--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --football--
Speaker 2: Exactly, right, right.  We've done that, we've, we, we've been blessed with those type of projects, we were fortunate enough to have been named as the prime architect on the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia.
Speaker 1: That's on the ancient side of Carthage [Tunisia] almost--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  The model of that is right out in the lobby right now.  There, that's that's some good, I say the work at UT Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] we've done projects at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas], they haven't done any at Rice [University, Houston, Texas], done work at Bishop College [Dallas, Texas] up in northeast Texas.
Speaker 1: And now it's called [Paul] Quinn [College, Dallas, Texas], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  We've done work at Bishop College that at one time was in Marshall, Texas and we, we've done a fair amount of college and university work, we have.
Story_ID: 238764
Speaker 1: Do you have a, do you have a particular philosophy of architecture?  I mean what's your style basically?
Speaker 2: I would just say contemporary, with the times, I'm a great believer of the ambiance of bringing the outside in, you know, greenery, the things that liven up a space, color and so forth.
Speaker 1: I know the Martin Luther King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center of Humanities] at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], you know very modernistic looking building you, I was kind of shocked to hear you tell me it was built over thirty years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's very--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, modern, open kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right on the end over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And I've, I, I've always had sort of a hidden passion for curves, for circles and I've let that show in a lot of work that, that we've done, you know, well.
Speaker 1: This seems to be a theme in, in, African American architecture, the use of circles and you probably see it more, correct me if I'm wrong, well I know African American architects do a lot of circles, more circular than most European or, or--
Speaker 2: Yep, probably so--
Speaker 1: --Euro American architects do.
Speaker 2: --Probably so, yeah, probably so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there a rea--you think there's a reason for that or, I mean?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, think it's a matter of getting away from the ordinary and trying to hit a spark somewhere that'll, that people would like, they would enjoy, good gracious, who did it any better than Frank Lloyd Wright on the museum in New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, [Solomon R.] Guggenheim [Museum, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know you don't walk in a room where you've got murals all around the wall but you, you'd go up ramps that are in circles and as you'd go up the ramp you're looking at the exhibits, you know, great idea, outstanding.  Yeah.  And look at my friend Paul [Williams] out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you, you've seen, I call it the restaurant in the sky [Theme Building] at the [Los Angeles International] Airport [Los Angeles County, California], you, you've seen that one?
Speaker 1: Right.  That's like a landmark.
Speaker 2: That's Paul Williams, he did that and we were in L.A. this past Sunday, not this past Sunday, but Sunday two weeks ago and my wife [Drucie Chase] and I were, got out of the cab, we were on our way into the airport where our plane was and lo and behold we were directly across the street fr--I call it the restaurant in the sky, you know, and, and so I got this get up and get it, but I, there's a picture on my credenza over there--
Speaker 1: We can show it at the end--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: We can do that--
Speaker 2: That, it's a crummy picture but it's still something that you know, you can like.
Story_ID: 238765
Speaker 1: What are some of your future projects now?  You--you're, are you on the verge of retirement at all?  Or you think it's--
Speaker 2: Yes I am.  (Laughter)  At one time I'd sort of hesitate and stammer on that answer but, no not now, I am ready.  Right now we're doing a lot of school work.  We're doing a school here in Houston [Texas], an elementary Bonner Elementary School [Houston, Texas], a pretty good size school, we've done several schools here in Houston.  We're doing four schools in Dallas [Texas] that are in the process of going under construction as we speak, the planning has been done, the bidding, the contract award has been made, it's in the process now and they start, we'll probably be within the next two weeks of construction there, gonna build all four of them at the same time and let's see what else are we doing?  We're doing good (unclear) work for the Port of Houston [Authority], the port.  Incidentally something that, is just, I thought of as far as the port, to goes, one of the board members of the port authority, oh God, I can't think of the guys, this is awful as good as st--as good a friends as we are, but he's from Africa and he has the recognition of being one of the largest donors to Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas], over a million dollars.
Speaker 1: He's an African?  Is he, is he an architect?
Speaker 2: No he's not an architect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a business person.  He does a, a lot of good things I think in the community, plus he's a good friend and he's on that authority out there and tell you real quick that he's one of the reasons that we're getting some of that work.  They do a lot of work at the Houston port authority, very much, second largest inland port in the world, you see, they sat around in Galveston [Texas] and let 'em dig a ditch from the Gulf of Mexico up to Houston and now they're the second largest inland port in the world really, right?  All that tonnage goes right past Galveston, right on up to Houston.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that, now in the old days, may--maybe you heard this but I, I know I saw something recently on television about a hurricane that hit Galveston--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --around 1920, 1919, 1920 [sic. 1900]?
Speaker 2: Very bad.
Speaker 1: That blew the city almost off the map.
Speaker 2: Very, very bad.
Speaker 1: The worst in U.S. history right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now I think it was some reluctances to make Galveston--'cause Galveston would have been Houston, had it not been for the hurricane.
Speaker 2: Easily have been, could easily have been.  We're got a place down there and we go down there, we tell all of our friends when they say look we tried to call you at home and no one answered, I say well look, when you call and don't get an answer here, call Galveston, 'cause we go down there, oh God, and it reminds me of Annapolis [Maryland], my home so much.  It's small, inconspicuous, plenty of water, you know, and that's what all Annapolis was really and.  But yeah, Galveston is, they're really growing now, we, we just finished a major project in Galveston, it's really a recreational center down there and it's complete now, in fact been complete now for about a month maybe.
Story_ID: 238766
Speaker 1: Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general nowadays?
Speaker 2: Well, that they will continue to pursue schooling, training, that the mission to start businesses and improve businesses that have already been started continue and, in, in saying that, I've, I've got great hopes and respect for the young African American coming up today, you know so many people talk, talk 'em down a little bit and I don't, I don't see that, I see nothing but the magic of success that they are, that they are fighting for, that they're trying to achieve.  And, and I think really that, that's where it's gonna really shine, it's beginning to do so now, you know when, the, the, when I think of the group that is not necessarily children, even though they are children.  But they are really moving business wise, commerce wise, educationally, everywhere and in areas that, that we don't necessarily assume that you're gonna find many blacks there like on Wall Street and in investment banking, you know, that, that, that type of thing, I've got nothing but high hopes.  I, I don't see a negative anywhere, I don't anything but great successes for them, really great.
Story_ID: 238767
Speaker 1: When you look back at all, all the things that you've done, in your many years of, as an architect and a political activist and, what, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Oh that's a good one.  Maybe those things that went wrong, (laughter) you might say that.  Not necessarily because, you know, doing it different doesn't, still doesn't make it work, make it a success.  I think the one thing that that I would do is get a better understanding of financial success.  I'm, I'm convinced that one of the hidden problems of racial segregation is it cramps your ability and style to achieve, it, it cramps it, it, it really does, it, it gives you false opinions.  Let me give you an example, of what I'm talking about.  I, I look back now over my situation and I missed out, this been several years ago now, several years ago, I missed out on, on acquiring a piece of land, property here in Houston [Texas] that today I kick myself a many a times for doing it.  And I missed out on it because I, at the time I thought that, you know, I got a whole lot of property, and I do, I do, and, and, I, I began comparing the property that I had with the property that I now have a chance to get and I had a chance to get it, believe me they, the person that had control over it, we were like that, he was the one who told me that, it, I won't go into all of it but I, I didn't do it because I thought I had as much property as, for people in Houston to know, are you Bob Smith?  And, people like that who really had property, you know, they had a thousand apartment units and this, that, and the other that, but I thought that and then I didn't, don't have that kind of property.  But that little that I had, I was putting it in visually, d--do you see what, I don't know if I'm saying what I'm trying to say here and in any event, I passed it up, I, I, didn't put the thought on it, every time I pass that piece of property right now, it's been bought and it's been improved and it is successful, very successful, I, g--I almost kick myself and say fool, you could've had that, you know?  And, and the person told me they say, now look if you think it's a little too much for you to handle by yourself, get, get a couple of your buddies to go in with you, he even told me that and so when I look back, yeah, I see that, I see that one, I really see that.
Speaker 1: Okay, this opportunity that once, once it was here you can't really get it back?

Speaker 2: They are, we have three children, two boys and a girl, all three of 'em are attorneys, the girl is the youngest [Saundria Chase Gray] and she's a staff attorney for Texaco and she has been very political, in fact, as we speak she is in Cleveland [Ohio] working for a Currie [ph.] and her husband is the senior anchor for CBS here in Houston [Texas], Jerome Gray, our next son is the one that I think that you're going to interview tomorrow, [HistoryMaker] Anthony [Ray Chase].  Saundria finished Tufts University in Medford, Mass. [Massachusetts] and did a law degree at UT [University of Texas at Austin School of Law] in Austin [Texas], Anthony did a J.D./M.B.A. from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with honors, he's worked on Wall Street with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette [New York, New York] and he came to hou--back to Houston and started his own firm which is called ChaseCom and I would guess that his total employees in that operation approaches a thousand people, he owns several radio stations, he--
Speaker 1: Here in Houston or around the country?
Speaker 2: Around the country, around the country. He just purchased a home, he and his wife [Dina Alsowayel Chase], he's married and their son, in fact two sons, he just purchased a home in River Oaks here in Houston and I don't know how much you know about River Oaks, but it's a nice area, very nice, it's the area that I understand that they turned Muhammad Ali down on, to go into.  He's very active in the community he's a member of the partnership downtown, what else?
Speaker 1: Federal Reserve Board [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System] we were talking about--

Speaker 1: John S. Chase, Jr [sic. John S. Chase, III].
Speaker 2: You really go by the third now.
Speaker 1: By the third, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a junior that makes him the third.  And we'd took us about ten years to get that straight but, he's a lawyer also, he practices here in this building with us, not with us but, yeah with us.  But, he has his own private practices, he's also a municipal judge doing a very good job, very good, outstanding.  He, he graduated from Rice University [Houston, Texas] here and then did his law degree at the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] here in Houston, so we've been, my wife [Drucie Chase] and I have been very fortunate I think to have raised three good successful children.

Speaker 1: You haven't talked about your wife yet, I mean, what's her name and when did you all meet?
Speaker 2: Drucie, D-R-U-C-I-E, we met at a wedding, we met at the practice for a wedding, it was her cousin that was getting married and I'd been asked to be one of the groomsmen and so they had a rehearsal and everybody of course that was gonna be in the wedding was at the rehearsal and that's where I met her, that was in Austin [Texas] of course.  We've been married now for fifty-three years and let me see, she graduated from Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] in Austin, taught school for about ten years in Austin and in Houston [Texas], in Houston, she now does not work, she, we'd call her a housewife I guess, my guess that's what you call her.  We, we've had a lovey life together, we travel, in fact my whole family we, we'd even do little family trips one or two a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, even now when everybody's grown?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yeah we're planning one now and, and I mean we, we don't, we're not talking about going to Austin, we do a trip.  The last two or three trips we've done, remember I told you the sunflower story in Italy, that was one of the family trips and one was in France last year, we, we traveled quite a bit and mainly really because of those family trips and then we have little rules on those trips you know, you, you go as a family and you, you react as a family on the trip, you know, that means if, just because you play golf you don't pl--and you're the only one that plays golf, you don't run off and play golf, you, you indulge in something what everybody else can indulge in see, on the trip and it makes a difference, it, it does.  We are talking now about our next family trip and I don't know, well really they not talking about a family trip right now, they're, they're talking about an anniversary trip, that me and my wife will be married fifty-four years and on our next anniversary and what to do there and so we, we, we do very well together, do very well together.

Speaker 2: Just at the brink, no she never, no, no.  And of course that's one of the things that I guess hurt me more than anything is that I, I was never really able to, I did a lot of things now for her, but not the things that I could have done, excuse me had she lived a little longer, you know, into my development.  But, she, she saw, she saw success, I'll tell you that, she saw that, she came down here to visit us several times and she loved it, fell in love with it. She had never, she'd never been in the home we're in now, she was in the home that we had prior to, to this one and the one we have now is a little better, nicer than the one we had.
