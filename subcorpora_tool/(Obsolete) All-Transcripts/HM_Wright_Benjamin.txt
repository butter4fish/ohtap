Speaker 2: Is J-R cool?
Speaker 1: J-R. is cool.  All right.  And where are we this morning?

Speaker 1: All right, the hard question, of course, is today's date?
Speaker 2: What month is it? (laugh) No, today's date is the 18, April 18, 2007.
Speaker 1: All right, you got it right, so you scored 100 on this test.
Speaker 2: I'm getting points, man.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 103127
Speaker 1: All right. I'm going to start by asking you five People-type magazine questions that I'm told will relax you and of course will relax me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's start by asking you for-- what is your favorite color?

Speaker 1: All right, And your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Lobster.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  What is your favorite time of year or season?

Speaker 1: Oh, Okay in the lower [sic, Lesser] Antilles.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's--let me just say, I've never had a vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't recall actually having a vacation, you know, for what I do, praise God, I've been pretty much everywhere, but I was working.
Speaker 1: Okay, but if you sneaked a few minutes of vacation in there, then we'll accept St. Martins.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, no problem, St. Martin.
Speaker 1: And the final People magazine question for you is, what is your favorite saying, phrase, slogan?
Speaker 2: Straight ahead.
Speaker 1: All right, straight ahead.
Story_ID: 103128
Speaker 1: All right. We're through with the People magazine questions, so I'm going to get back to the real questions again, and let's start by asking you for your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: All right, and your date of birth?
Speaker 2: 07/11/46.
Speaker 1: All right, July 11, 1946.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: All right. We're going to try to take you back in your family tree-- history, starting--we'll start with your mother, on your mother's side.  What was your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: Colonus.
Speaker 1: Spell that for us.
Speaker 2: C-O-L-O-N-U-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Miller, that was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Her maiden name.  M-I-L-L-E-R.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Wright.
Speaker 2: Well, Wright came later.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 2: But I guess that's all I know, Wright.
Speaker 1: Okay, Colonus Miller and her place of birth?
Speaker 2: Mississippi.  I don't know what city.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll just go with Mississippi, and date of birth if you know it?
Speaker 2: June 10, 1911.
Speaker 1: Okay, fine.  And Let's do the same thing with your dad, the full name.
Speaker 2: Benjamin F. Wright.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're a junior.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And his place of birth.
Speaker 2: Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, date of birth if you know it?
Speaker 2: July 10, 1904.
Speaker 1: '04 [1904], all right.
Speaker 2: I'm guessing at that.
Speaker 1: That's fine.  All right, now, let's see how far back we can go on your mother's side,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Her mother and her father's name, starting with her mother?
Speaker 2: Oh my God. Okay. I do not remember my mother's mother-- I never met her.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: She passed away when I was a kid,
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Really before I got here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How 'bout her father?
Speaker 2: Her father's name was John Miller.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  And if you don't know it, that's fine, but John Miller's place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: I think that was-- he was a Mississippian as well.
Speaker 1: Okay. We'll just put Mississippi and date of birth or approximate?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God.
Speaker 1: No. Don't worry about.
Speaker 2: I don't have a clue on that.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask, but don't worry if you don't have a clue, that's fine.
Speaker 2: A long time ago.
Speaker 1: A long time ago, absolutely, absolutely, I think it's safe to say that's as far back as you can go on your mother's side, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, we'll try, you know, on your father's side, your grandfather's-- you're your father's father's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Peter.
Speaker 1: Peter. Okay, Peter Miller.
Speaker 2: Peter. No, Peter Wright.
Speaker 1: Peter Wright, I'm sorry, Peter Wright, and any idea about place of birth or date of birth?
Speaker 2: Peter was a Mississippian as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. Never--you know, he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, so date of birth, you don't know.  And Peter's wife was?
Speaker 2: Was, my god, Lillian.
Speaker 1: Lillian.  And I know this is making you think of things that you possibly have never thought of.
Speaker 2: Yeah, here's a situation where I think I saw my grandmother once.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She died when I was very young,
Speaker 1: Young, okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I never had grandparents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I just knew certain names.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Not a problem on, on that.
Story_ID: 103129
Speaker 1: Let's now go back and ask--well, I'll start by asking you about your siblings.  We'll get that on the record.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had a brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, and his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Paul.
Speaker 1: Beautiful name.
Speaker 2: Now, Paul died when I was, I think, two years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Paul died in 1948?
Speaker 2: About that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember how old Paul was at that time?  Or Paul's date of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, let's, let's, let's clear that up because I understand Paul was two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Paul was two when he died--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --so he was a couple years younger than you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so I don't remember his date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we can just assume with me being two years older than him, let's say '49 [1948].  He was born in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Okay.  Do you remember what Paul died of? Was it childhood disease?
Speaker 2: I heard pneumonia.
Speaker 1: Pneumonia, which was a popular way of death for young kids at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other siblings?
Speaker 2: I have a sister--two sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mrs. L. V., the letter "L," the letter "V," Martin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, let's see.
Speaker 1: And Martin is her married name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She was born in Mississippi,
Speaker 2: Born in Miss-
Speaker 1: In Greenville?
Speaker 2: Yeah--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to get that together because actually, yeah, she was born in Mississippi.  My parents [Colonus Miller and Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a minute.  And the way I understand it, they came to Mississippi to have me.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So maybe that's why I couldn't wait to get to Chicago.
Speaker 1: So they were-they may have been visiting Greenville when you were born?
Speaker 2: Well, no, they had moved back.
Speaker 1: Oh, So they had moved back, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how long they stayed in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, the story about finding work and whatever, you know, maybe that was into play.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it was really my big sister that let me know.  You know.  We actually came back to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's--let's, let's-- L. V. Martin--when you said big sister, what struck me is that she is older than you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --She is 15 years older than me, so I'm 60, so she is about 75 now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your big sister-- 1932 or '31 [1931], approximately?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll go with that date.  19-- We'll say 1931 for L.V.--  was she L. V. Miller before she married?
Speaker 2: She was James.
Speaker 1: James, all right.  Then your other sibling sister?
Speaker 2: My young sister, Percy.
Speaker 1: P-E-R--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --C-Y.
Speaker 1: Middle name?
Speaker 2: Jean. J-E-A-N
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she originally a Miller, or?
Speaker 2: She was originally a Knight, K-N-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: Okay. Greenville, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Green- Yeah, I know that one.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 1952.
Speaker 1: I bet you don't know the month and the date.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, September 3rd because she beats me on her birthday every year.  I can't ever remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Did I get that right?  You said July 3rd?
Speaker 2: No, September.
Speaker 1: September 3. September 3, 1962.
Speaker 2: '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: '52 [1952], date of birth.  Okay, good, now we can go on from there.
Story_ID: 103130
Speaker 1: So, your parents [Colonus Miller and Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] had occasion to leave Mississippi and go to Chicago [Illinois], and it was common because we're talking about possibly a war going at that time and, World War II, and there was a mass migration to the North because work was plentiful.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't know what the reason was.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's never been much talk about the Chicago situation.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My father was a carpenter.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was going to be my next question.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, you know, my dad was a very independent cat, man, so, I don't, you know, we've never spoken about Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your mother was a housewife or did she--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do work outside of the house?
Speaker 2: Domestic.
Speaker 1: Domestic work, work.  There was an occasion to go to Chicago but you do know they returned in '46 [1946] because you were born--they came back?
Speaker 2: I have no idea when they went to Chicago but my mom and my sister [L. V. Martin], and that we know, that they came back to Mississippi while she was pregnant with me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then you were born in 1946.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And did the family stay in Greenville then or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you grew up in Greenville?
Speaker 2: Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: All right. All right.
Speaker 2: I still got mud on my shoes, man.
Speaker 1: All right, let's see how much you remember how you got that mud.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 103131
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories there in Greenville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Um, I guess I was a happy child.  Okay?  You know, and during that time, you know, and I'm still aware now of how poor we were, but that was all I knew, so I didn't couldn't compare it to anything at that time, okay?
Speaker 1: This is the section that we call the "sights and sounds that you may remember."  Do you remember any of the games you used to love to play?  You remember any of your pre-school age?  Did you have to go out working in the cotton fields or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: was it just playing in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I remember the school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the first school I went to, it was called, Julia L. Armstrong [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Elementary?
Speaker 2: Elementary, and that a great situation.  I can remember maybe from about fourth grade on.  I can't go back.
Speaker 1: Okay. So we should we assume that fourth grade would be about 1955?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are those memories in the fourth grade?
Speaker 2: I really liked going to school.  I really loved going to school, lots of children.  I started creating friendships.  One thing that stands out is I was always captured by the music stuff--whatever was music, man, that was exciting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --right there.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that was exciting to me.  Now, I loved playing ball, playing with the kids, football.  It was mainly football more than anything else, baseball.  A little later, I got into basketball.  But, it was really that music thing, and I wasn't part of it. You know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't part of it, my friends were.  They'd sing and dance, and the whole bit, and play.  Man, I wanted to do that so bad.
Speaker 1: Okay, even there in fourth grade, when you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like assemblies and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I wanted to be in that, so I could only participate from a church standpoint.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in a church choir.
Speaker 1: We're going to get to do you in church.
Speaker 2: I'm ahead of myself.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.  Wanted to ask you was there a particularly teacher, maybe a music teacher or teacher there in the elementary school?
Speaker 2: We didn't have music then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there was-- I don't recall being in a music class-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until I got to junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, there was a lady who played the piano or whatever for most assemblies, and little programs, or whatever.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I didn't have music.
Story_ID: 103132
Speaker 1: Okay. Let's go over to that all important church.  You're around nine or ten years old, and you're going to Sunday school and so forth.  What was the name of the church that you were going in [Greenville] Mississippi?
Speaker 2: St. John Missionary Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay, the--you participated in Sunday school?
Speaker 2: Sunday school, BYPU [Baptist Young Peoples Union], choir--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --BYPU, later in there--I remember--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, Sunday school that morning--if you live close, you could possibly go home.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.
Speaker 2: But I think BYPU started at four.  It's right there, man.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Now, your mother [Colonus Miller] made sure that you and your older sister [L. V. Martin] was right there, in that church?
Speaker 2: It was mandatory.
Speaker 1: Got you.  Got you.  And you heard that choir, you must have been moved by that choir.
Speaker 2: I had to be part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At what age did you become a part of it?
Speaker 2: I think about nine or ten years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so now you're right there singing in this youth choir, I imagine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the minister there at St. John?
Speaker 2: Yes, Reverend M. M. Morris.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Sunday was almost all day church for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: It struck a musical chord in you.  You sang in the choir there.  Were there any other musical affiliations there at the church on Sunday?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I need to back up a bit--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sure.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --because my big sister--well, you know, I'm just-- I gotta to tell it all.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: My big sister loved music.
Speaker 1: Okay, L. V.
Speaker 2: L. V. loved music.  We had a piano.
Speaker 1: At home?
Speaker 2: No, she had a piano.  We lived in the same house, but she had a piano.
Speaker 1: I got you.  I hear you.
Speaker 2: And she took lessons, actually she took lessons--I'm sorry I hit this mic, but later we're going to get into my choir director--my big sister took music from a lady named Herdisine [ph.] Jones.  My big sister was the most untalented musician ever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there was no swing to my sister.  If the notes were not on the paper, she couldn't play it.  She couldn't--like I could hear things, and duplicate it.
Speaker 1: You had a very fine--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My ear was cool.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: My sister, uh-uh--if you hum it to her, no way.  If it was not lines and dots, she couldn't hang-
Speaker 1: I hear.
Speaker 2: But she loved music.  So, you know, we'd hear some stiff music from my sister.  (laughter) But at church, my sister was certainly far more musician than the church musician.  The church musician could just swing, you know.  However they thought the hymns go, you know, just improvise.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But sometimes the piano--church piano didn't show or whatever and they called my sister, and I would be the first guy to go "Oh, no, not my sister because she can't swing," you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, we want to rock and roll a bit in them hymns.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, no, she played boom, so legit, so legit, you know, but, you know, that was a blessing too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I learned later.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 103133
Speaker 1: But being a young kid, hearing my sister [L. V. Martin] at home and when she was not there, and I certainly got on that piano and messed around.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay--and because of that ear--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --you could go back to that piano.
Speaker 1: It helped develop it.  You know?
Speaker 2: Mhmm. And you did this starting at around eight or nine?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it continued on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, I was a closet piano player--what I mean is like nobody knew.
Speaker 2: Okay, because you had to wait until your sister had to get out of the house.
Speaker 1: Well, even when she was there sometimes, you know.  I learned something a few days ago that took me back to my childhood.  Most cats who deal with the piano and have that ear, learn how to play on the black keys.  Are you with me?  On the back keys--and like I sayI heard something the other day that took me back to that, and I'd never really thought of it like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The black keys, you know, in my days of growing up, the thing on the radio was the boogie woogie. (singing)  And it was so easy because the black keys said that.  And listening to a cat the other day that was talking about the black keys and what we call pentatonic, I was like "Wow, here it is I write all this music or whatever, but I had not thought of that!"  But it was so easy to go to the black keys, so, you know, you can't play at all, but you can mess around with the black keys and get the melody.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I was maybe ashamed to play in front of somebody.  That's why I say I was maybe a closet piano player or whatever.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In fact, as we go, I'll show you when that came out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 103134
Speaker 1: All right.  So you're moving on to junior high school.  You're growing up in Greenville, Mississippi, closet piano player.
Speaker 2: Hey.
Speaker 1: But loving those musical sounds in church, formerly in the elementary school, but now, you're in junior high.  What's the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: Coleman High School.
Speaker 1: Coleman High School.
Speaker 2: You know, at that time, we didn't have middle school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --especially in the black community.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you went from elementary to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --up to the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Oh, sixth grade.
Speaker 2: seventh grade, you went to high school.
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell us about your experience there at Coleman because you met new friends, new teachers and you were hearing music.
Speaker 2: That was exciting.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was exciting because more music.  There is a choir.  There is a band and I wanted to be part of that.  It didn't happen right away. I don't remember how I really got into the choir, I don't-- but I was so apt to get there--to be part of, so I don't remember if it was an audition.  I don't recall that, but I got in that choir, man, and it was an awarding-winning choir and at that particular time that I joined the choir, there were some big-name seniors there.  We had a cat in the choir named Willie Richardson.  Willie Richardson I think became the first black player to play in the Blue and Grey Bowl [Blue-Grey College All-Star Game, now the Blue-Grey Football Classic], football player, who sang in the choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I remember.
Speaker 2: He went on and Willie went to Jackson State [College, now Jackson State University, in Jackson, Mississippi], and was drafted by the [Baltimore] Colts.  He played with the Colts many years.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: There was a guy in the choir who passed away recently.  Thank God I was able to go to New York and see him, and that is Dr. Turnbull, [HM] Walter [J.] Turnbull, Harlem Boys Choir [Boys Choir of Harlem].
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: We used to sing side-by-side in the choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean the choir was it to me.  That was heaven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was heaven.  I got in the choir really in the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was--.  I think that was all I concentrated in too--was the choir.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --was the choir, so you weren't concentrating on musical instruments on the choir was the concentration.
Speaker 2: Just the choir, I didn't--I couldn't play an instrument other than my playing at home.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 103135
Speaker 1: In the eighth grade, I joined a doo-wop group.  And I was the baby in the doo-wop groups.  All the other cats were a grade or two higher than me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay? But I could hear man, you know, I could hear.
Speaker 2: That ear.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I could hear. Cats be fumbling with the parts, and I had this high voice.  I could sing those high tenor parts.
Speaker 2: Give us an example of that.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow--we had a-- created our song!  And song is "We are The Soothers, yeah."  And then we would introduce ourselves; and here it is, I probably weigh ninety pounds and (singing) "I'm big ben, and who are you?, you know, it's way up there like a soprano, you know?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I would say that to kids and it was like (screaming).  So I was hooked man.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I was hooked.  And we became very, very popular.  There was an older group, you know, so polished and would sing the Flamingo-type songs [The Flamingos] or whatever, but we were singing the hard rock and roll stuff.  And we had a piano player,
Speaker 2: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: And I don't want to get too far ahead, but I think when I became a junior, we were having rehearsal, and we were arguing about chord or something.  And the piano player was like, "I'm God.  Man.  I'm the man," you know.  And certainly an upper classman--everybody was an upper classman to me, but I had become very verbal.  I could talk.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know?  I could say, "That's wrong."  "Who's this young cat telling me that's wrong."  But this particular day, we were going at it.  It's like, "That's wrong."  So the piano player said, "Well, you play it."  Woah, I had built up enough confidence, and certainly everything that we rehearsed, whatever, I'd go home and --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --try it.
Speaker 1: So this particular day --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --you were ready to come out of the closet now.
Speaker 1: I came out.  I said, "Okay," boom, because you know I was so strong on whatever my point was, "no problem," bang, and the cats went like "Wow!"  Certainly that was the start of the diminish of the group.
Speaker 2: Did the piano player come back?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't cool after that.  But the piano player really kind of fizzled out and graduated, so I became the piano player.
Speaker 2: This is the 8th grade or the 9th grade.
Speaker 1: Well, actually I'm about 10th grade now.
Speaker 2: 10th grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about 10th grade now.
Story_ID: 103136
Speaker 1: I'm having problems in the choir, which it was like heaven for me from a music standpoint.  Each year, the choir director would put notations up and explain little theory stuff, and I'm eating that up, man, but I'm not getting enough of it because it was just enough to deal with the choir.  We had a big choir, one choir director, no assistant and the same thing with the band.  And again, 400 kids were in the band.
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: One black school.
Speaker 2: This is still Coleman [High School] now?
Speaker 1: Yes.  There were 400 kids in the band and one band director and no assistant.  So with the choir director putting notations up, and certainly a guy like me was like I was really into that, "Wow, learning music!  But it wasn't enough because she had so many things to do to prepare the choir to prepare for functions and this and that and the other, and mandatory competitions--you know, just a lot to do for one person.  You know, but I'm not filled here, you know.  So the next year, she started the year off with the same thing.  I'm not getting enough, man.  Now, I have become a pretty recognizable person in the choir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, we had a young lady who was an excellent pianist, Dr. Turnbull [HM Walter J. Turnbull], who was a superstar tenor.  The choir director got sick, had to have an operation.  And the school pulled in the lady who taught, who played piano in the elementary school to come and sit in until the choir director got back.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We had a function to perform for.  And this is when I found out somebody believed in me.  The choir director sent instructions for me to conduct the choir.  I'm an underclassmen to Dr. Turnbull and to lady that, to the young girl that played the piano.  She was a senior.  Dr. Turnbull was a senior and they had called up the school teacher to be there, but the choir said, "No, Benjamin directs the choir."  Woah, that was heavy!  That was real heavy!
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because Turnbull was sophisticated.  Everybody was sophisticated.  I'm a hoodlum.  You know. I mean I love the music, but I'm trying to play ball.
Speaker 2: Oh, you were still playing ball?
Speaker 1: Oh, I loved playing ball.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I couldn't get on no team, but we would play ball every day.  But when you say "conduct the choir," this is the state's award-winning choir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Every year that I was there.  This is it.
Speaker 2: You'd left that out now--that Coleman was a state choir winners every year.
Speaker 1: Band and choir.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yes, and football team.
Speaker 2: Oh, and the football team.
Speaker 1: Coleman was the powerhouse.
Speaker 2: How many kids did Coleman have approximately?
Speaker 1: I don't know, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's just say, during the time, I was going to school at Coleman High, that was the only school that blacks could go to.  They built another school that opened during my senior year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I guess Coleman was overrun.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because of all this was pre-Civil Rights, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay, and I was going to get to that question also.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: So how many kids?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Every class was running over--everything was crowded.  Okay.
Story_ID: 103137
Speaker 1: In the eleventh grade, I was wanted to be in the band.  The band was like a hoodlum organization.  The choir was very sophisticated, but the band was a bunch of renegade, renegades, you know.  The choir and the band were in a building together.  The choir had this room, and the band had this room.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So no way you could, No way the band could rehearse without interfering with the choir because it was loud.  And the look on the choir director's face was like "That band, that band!"  But, man, I wanted to be part of that band because those cats were learning music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You had to know some music to play in that band.  I wanted to be in the band.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm a choir--one of the superstars of the choir.
Speaker 2: Right, now, you are.
Speaker 1: Okay. I had to join the band.  And I went out--I felt I could play drums.  I went and auditioned.  And the cat gave me a bass drum.  And I must have beaten that bass drum to death, you know.  I became flashy.  You know, you know, back in the day when you're crossing over, under leg, just boom, just flash, flash.  "Oh, Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin."
Speaker 2: That's what all the girls were saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was the man, you know, playing bass drum. Okay.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --And you loved that.
Speaker 1: Then for concert season, the band director put me on tympanies.  Now, I loved that.  That was--yeah, you had to know something to play tympanies.  Back in that time, we only had two tympani drums, so it was about pedaling to make the notes.  So, you know, yeah, I was into that.  And I thought that was classy, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, you're in the eleventh grade now, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm in the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I became very good on the tympanies.  Then band director came to me one day, and he said, "Son, you're very talented."  He says, "I'm losing I think all of my trombones this year, or most of them.  And I need somebody to play certain songs, and you're very talented, and I want you to try to learn to play these songs on trombone."  Well, that's like your mandatory competition stuff.  You had to have so many whatever.  He gave me this 'bone, and I became to play and I could figure some things or whatever.  I could figure out certain things and whatever, but it was that the band director felt so good about me in terms of I could do it.  Now, meanwhile, I've become so into this band, the choir director said, "Hey, it's a choice here."
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: "Whatcha going to do?" "I'm going to the band."
Speaker 2: You broke his heart.
Speaker 1: I'm in the band, you know, and then in the band--because I had been singing the doo-wop group and the whole bit, and I've been playing (unclear) group, I qualified for something else--to play with the band director's little swing group--play at night clubs and stuff.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's like, "Woah, I'm in it now!"
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he had a little organ, so I'm playing a little organ.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, we play every Saturday night, we played at the VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars] at Greenville, Mississippi.  So you had to, you know, this is the learning process, have your black pants, your white shirt, and your bow tie.  When you get to the gig, we give you an green after six jacket, and we call it the "green tux."
Speaker 2: Now, you were about seventeen or eighteen?
Speaker 1: I think I'm about sixteen years old.
Speaker 2: Sixteen then.
Speaker 1: Sixteen years old. Fifteen/sixteen
Speaker 2: Now before we go too far ahead--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 103138
Speaker 1: I want you to parallel that with Sundays [St. John Missionary Baptist Church].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sundays, you're still in the choir?
Speaker 2: I'm still in the choir.  I'm singing.  I got solos now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're somewhat of a superstar in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm a church superstar.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And you know, church is important.  It was mandatory to go.  I love the fact that mom [Colonus Miller] said you had to go.  I wanted to go, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was the place to be.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay? That's no problem for me, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think when I was in the fifth grade, I actually got religion, you know, joined the church.  I was baptized in fifth grade.  My solos increased.  I'm the man, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And confidence is building in this choir thing because, like you say, fifth grade, sixth grade I was participating in the school music stuff, but when I got into the seventh grade, that's when I joined the choir, so I was pretty strong in terms of what I was, you know--my singing stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was getting to be pretty confident.
Speaker 1: --Okay--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --So--that's that (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 103139
Speaker 1: Now we can go ahead, you're in the eleventh grade, you've got the gig every Friday night at the VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars].  Nothing on Saturdays nights?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the main gig was on Saturday nights.
Speaker 1: Oh, Saturday night.
Speaker 2: But generally there was a Friday something that was like a prom or some school event or whatever that the band director had a gig.  Okay, then stuff that would come to the VFW or the Elks Club back in the day, acts like Rufus Thomas or whatever would come through, and never had a band.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we would be the band.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were still getting those gigs and you were still in high school-
Speaker 2: Still in high school
Speaker 1: --but you were earning a few pennies there?
Speaker 2: Five dollars a night.  I don't care what the situation was, five dollars,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was great.
Speaker 1: Yep, because we're in the '60s [1960], five dollars will take you a ways.
Speaker 2: Right, that was heavy duty.
Story_ID: 103140
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, my father [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] was a carpenter.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: And, you know, as a child, most people hate working with their fathers.  I went to the field.  I chopped cotton.
Speaker 1: Okay, at what age did you start chopping cotton?
Speaker 2: Maybe seventh grade,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was your father now back in Greenville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, after I was born, my parents [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr. and Colonus Miller] never went anywhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm out there chopping cotton because that's where most of the kids were.  My dad wanted me to work with him.  I wanted to hang with the kids.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, it was mandatory for some families to be out there chopping cotton.
Speaker 1: That was a question I was coming up with because in those days, a lot of black kids would be even pulled out of school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And were you ever pulled out of school?
Speaker 2: No, no.  No, like I said, we didn't do well, but my dad was a carpenter, you know, so and my mom was a maid, you know.
Speaker 1: But during the summer break months, you would chop cotton?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.  Hard?
Speaker 2: Oh, man.  You know, I don't know why I put myself through that because I did not personally have to do that.  Okay.  But, You know, all your friends and whatever, if you didn't go to the field, you'd be home by yourself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But that was--even then, it was demeaning, okay, very demeaning.  I often tell young musicians about that kind of experience because some families had to chop cotton.  It was the only way they could get money.
Speaker 1: Right, survival.
Speaker 2: Survival, and chopping cotton in most cases was maybe 3.00 a day.  So if they had the whole family out there, you know what I'm saying, you might make 12, 15 dollars.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The sad part about chopping cotton was that there were a lot of old ladies out there.
Speaker 1: Grandmothers?
Speaker 2: Grandmothers, old people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You got this hoe in your hand, and sometimes grass would be as tall as you, okay. And here is the part that made it real ugly.  You get snakes out there.  And as I think about it, sometimes it just makes me want to cry, okay, because you got these old ladies out there that have to be there for survival-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they spot a snake, they can't run.
Speaker 1: Right, and most of them would they be barefoot, many of them?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think barefoot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I don't recall that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the thing is that there'd be so many children, when you said "snake," kids would run to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't know any better.  It could be a rattler, moccasin or whatever.  We had hoes.  Snake didn't survive.  You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would attack the snakes with the hoe?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Chop it.  But sometimes those old ladies couldn't get out of the way, and they know that going in.  That's the devastating part of it.
Speaker 1: Right.  So they--
Speaker 2: Nobody talks about that.  You know, I don't hear about that.  I don't read about that part.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But that's what it was because in those areas, you got the snacks, and when you come to--you know, you say a truck pulls up at 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning, and the guy announces "$3.00, $5.00."  Everybody wants to get on the $5.00 truck
Speaker 1: Right. But you know on the $5.00 truck, you're going to an area that has not been touched or whatever, so snakes are at home.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're everywhere.  Sick.  And you know it's going to be tough grass, you know, you know, because if I remember like Johnson grass.  Johnson grass can cut you, you know.
Speaker 2: So Johnson grass was sharp with blades?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it seemed like Johnson grass liked to grow where the cotton was.  You know what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But that was an experience.
Story_ID: 103141
Speaker 1: Now, I don't think I did that [chopped cotton] but a couple of summers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then worked with dad.
Speaker 2: Then you decided, you'll let your friends--
Speaker 1: I worked with my dad.  That was an experience.  My dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.], oh my God, I love that old man, independent contractor.
Speaker 2: Okay, he took whatever carpenter jobs he wanted to take.
Speaker 1: Yes, he was a popular carpenter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was always working.
Story_ID: 103142
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we're talking about a period, you're still in high school, you've described what summers were like, and your experiences with hanging with your friends chopping cotton.  But there is a storm brewing through Mississippi and Alabama, and Tennessee and those surrounding states, it's called, the Civil Rights Movement, and it visits all towns including Greenville [Mississippi].  What was consciousness as a high schooler getting ready to be a senior?  What was your consciousness about the Civil Rights Movement and the impact it had on Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Woah, this is heavy.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I've always been very conscious. As a child, growing up, you know, you look forward to going downtown.  The one store that stands out that was the store was Sears and Roebuck.  Okay. I remember being in Sears and Roebuck, and the water fountain, went to get some water and my mom [Colonus Miller] snatched me away from the fountain, even though there was a big sign up there that said, "Whites Only," that wasn't my focus, my focus was water.  Mom snatched me away, said I couldn't drink.  Well, I always had questions and mom couldn't elaborate there.  I don't know how old I was.  Very young, very young.  That, that was the beginning of being aware.
Speaker 1: And it left a lasting impression on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It's still there today. Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You only saw white people when you go downtown.  Okay?  So there was no history there.  Stores in the community--I can remember a white merchant and a Chinese guy had a store.  Whenever you go downtown, you know the signs "whites," "coloreds," I didn't have to deal with the traveling thing until I remember once we had to go pick up--somebody passed away, so we had an uncle or something coming in from Chicago [Illinois], and my dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] had a truck, a carpenter would pick him up at the bus station.  And that's when I saw "colored" "white."  Wow, this is the same thing they had at the Sears and Roebucks.  About maybe 9th, 10th grade, Freedom Riders moved in a house maybe about five or six doors from where I lived.  Things were really heating up.
Story_ID: 103143
Speaker 1: The Emmett Till thing--you know, we didn't have television, my family, okay, but the when the Emmett Till thing happened, wow, that was heavy duty.
Speaker 2: What are the details that you remember about Emmett Till affair?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the word was Emmett Till came from Chicago [Illinois], visiting his cousin or whatever and supposedly he whistled at a white woman, and now then (unclear) killed him, identifiable.  Shot him, beat him, threw him in the river.  You didn't--in Greenville, you didn't see that on a daily basis because you didn't have contact with white people.  But as you begin to go to school and whatever--I lived in what is called the "south end."  The south end had a big white school called, E.E. Bass [School], by the railroad tracks.  Now, I had to--E.E. Bass was maybe 10 or 12 blocks from my house, but I had to go approximately five miles to get to my school [Coleman High School] and you had a choice.  You could take the streets or you could take the railroad tracks.  The railroad track was a shorter route but you had two dangers, the train--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Right.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --there wasn't much room on either side if the train came, and white kids at the school that you had to pass, so nobody knew the other one.  There was a fight every day, rock throwing or whatever.  And it was like-- I never understood that.
Speaker 2: Was there retaliatory rock throwing, in other words, when the white kids threw at you, you would throw back at them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you know.  I mean it was on every day, and, you know, you didn't want to--you didn't want to take the track by yourself, generally there was four or five guys, you know.  But the racial thing was bad.  And like I said, nobody knew each other.  White kids didn't know the black kids and vice versa.  What the hell are we fighting for, you know?  Now, my--my parents [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr. and Colonus Miller], love, love, love, love, love and I have a problem with that because that ain't what's happening outside of this door.  Okay?  My dad was the Sunday school superintendent, you know.  All my dad know is God and carpentry.  Never heard him curse, good man.  But I don't like what's happening with this, I can't go here, I can't do this.  I never knew nothing else, but there is something is wrong here, instinctively something is wrong.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When the Freedom Riders came, information, information.  Well, I'm hanging out down there because all this pent up stuff for me to feel that something is wrong.  Now somebody else show up and showed that it is wrong because we didn't get that basically from home, you know.
Story_ID: 103144
Speaker 1: I remember an incident where my dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] had to tear down this building and I guess part of the deal was whatever he wanted from it, you know.  I'll never forget we were loading stuff up on his truck--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --bricks and stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a big fan--big-- as we would say super window-size fan, and I was helping my dad to put it up on the truck.  And this one cat came up, and was very belligerent, and cursing, and the whole bit, "No, you can't take that."  And I think only because I was there that this time, my dad took a stand because, you know, I'm ready to fight every day.
Speaker 2: You did not believe in the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] philosophy.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, and we didn't know King at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. But it's like I play ball and whatever and I'm hip now.  I don't take nothing.  So I'm watching my dad.  This one cat was cursing the whole bit, and, you know, I'm like, "Dad, won't you hit him?"  Like I said I think it was because of me, that my dad took a stand.  He didn't curse, but my dad went after this guy, and that guy ran pass his car.  But he was so--you know, the way he was talking, smacking and cursing, and the whole bit, it's like he was going to kill everybody.  "You can't do--" Nothing to say, my dad just went after him, but it was because of me, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, with the Freedom Rider, they started marching in town, and my folks were not in favor of that and then I was mad at my folks, you know, because this stuff is not right, but it took me some time to understand.  It's not that my parents didn't agree with what is going on.  It was protecting me.  It was protecting me because they were killing us.  So and so and so and so's boy is with the Freedom Riders because most of our parents worked as domestics, so, now, the white people know the children because, as being a little kid, sometimes your mom had to take, bring you with her.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you, you know, would hear "Mr. so and so would say so and so about such and such a child, how can you do that?"  I had to be out there, but my parents were not in favor of that because from their standpoint they were protecting me.  Okay.  And I understood that kind of early, okay, because we lost some kids mainly because of this.  You know, there was no big whatever about it.  It was a norm, like we pull you out and that's it.
Speaker 2: Right. It was the rule of law.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know. So--
Story_ID: 103145
Speaker 1: When the Freedom Riders--they came to Greenville [Mississippi]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yes.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and a number of them took residency there, how did that impact the city and how did that impact you in high school?
Speaker 2: It set the city in chaos because brave blacks were ready for the change.  Whites were not ready for that, you know.  So that increased fights along the railroad tracks, so that increased fights along the railroad tracks passing the school.  Then all of a sudden, white kids was coming into black's neighborhood, you know, in the cars riding through throwing stuff, and whatever, and it escalated.  All of sudden, it became dangerous.
Speaker 1: Did you have an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Chapter in Greenville?
Speaker 2: Not then, and then soon after that, I was gone, so I didn't know what the NAACP was at that time.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, in high school, you know, the latter years, maybe sophomore, junior, senior, you know, I had been in high school since seventh grade-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay. Then talk about the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall, start learning what Brown v. Board of Education, that kind of stuff, okay.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Then--what was the black dude secretary of state, the first Nobel Peace Prize winner?  I can't recall his name right now.  I should be hitting the head, but he was in [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower's cabinet--the black person.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Eisenhower's cabinet-just trying to----think there was a--I can't, can't think of it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --The first Nobel, first black Nobel Peace winner--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh Bunche.
Speaker 2: Ralph Bunche.
Speaker 1: Ralph Bunch.
Speaker 2: Ralph Bunche, yes [sic, Ralph Bunch was a member of President Franklin Roosevelt's unofficial "Black Cabinet," but not a member of Eisenhower's Cabinet].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Love you, man.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this consciousness was seeping into Greenville and into the high schoolers there in Greenville and the Civil Rights Movement was creeping into your consciousness--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --growing, growing.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: -growing--the, and against that background, you are, of course, a band member in a band, and singing in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --choir.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --choir there in church and so forth.  What was--do you remember the minister, was it still Morris?
Speaker 2: Morris, yes, Reverend [M.M.] Morris, as I can remember, I can't remember him addressing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Back then, a couple of my friends' parents were ministers, you know, I always make a joke, "Man, your daddy got more churches than Sundays."  You know, so, let's say the way it is now, you're the pastor of this church and we see you every Sunday, back in the day, well, maybe your church had communion on third Sunday.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's when we saw--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Reverend Morris--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --the preacher, yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, because the first Sunday, he's over at this church, and the second Sunday, he is--you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Right. Right. Right.
Speaker 2: So, we never saw him more than what was required for him to be at St. John [St. John Missionary Baptist Church].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay. In my opinion, the preachers didn't really lock into the Civil Rights thing until [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] really came along.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they hurriedly got on the band wagon.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.
Speaker 2: You know, we got to look at it, and the preachers were afraid too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were really afraid.
Story_ID: 103146
Speaker 1: Now, you're in high school [Coleman High School in Greenville, Mississippi].  You're doing well with the band.  And you become a senior.  Is your role increasing there either in the band--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, my role, you know I grew in the band.  You know, I'm out of the choir I think in eleventh grade, I'm out of the choir, nobody, and the choir director and I are not speaking, and she is a wonderful lady, but I'm independent now.
Speaker 1: And she is upset that you're not a part of her choir?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, because I was one of the star people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the band is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: [HM] Walter Turnbull has graduated.
Speaker 2: Turnbull is gone,
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Um, I became drum major- Okay.
Speaker 1: --in the band,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Top spot.
Speaker 2: Top spot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now you're a senior.
Speaker 1: Senior.
Speaker 2: How are you doing in your other studies there in high school?
Speaker 1: Suspect. Suspect--I was the dumbest kid in school until my senior year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was an honor student in my senior year.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: Well, nobody could believe it either. (laughter) You know, they put your name on the honor roll, (unclear) "Benjamin Wright, that don't--"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: "Somebody made a mistake."
Speaker 1: Um, my night club playing made me grow up real fast--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Maturity.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in more ways than necessary.  I was grown.
Speaker 2: So you started studying the English and so forth subjects a little more?
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was that all my buddies graduated because I was dealing with cats that were older than me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, they're gone, man.  It's like, you know, "what am I going to do?"  I certainly began to do my homework because I think I became a bit reclusive.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't know what that was then.  I was a little withdrawn.  You know, I'm still playing ball and whatever.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were playing just as much--I was going to ask you.  You were playing just as much sports?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I loved that, but playing in a night clubs, you grow real fast and from a morality standpoint of view, it was like ugly, you know, but you grow so fast, you're a child, but you're not dealing with kids anymore.  Little girls, it's like that's not appealing to me, it's like these women, yeah, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: These ladies at the club--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, that's I'm in to, okay, and local musicians, you know, older cats.  That's my environment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My-- the only time I'm with the kids is when we play ball.  I ain't got nothing else in common.
Speaker 2: And now you have a little bit more time because now you're not devoting much time to the school choir.
Speaker 1: Nah, I'm outta that.
Speaker 2: So, you're a senior, and your grades start to improve and you make the honor roll.
Speaker 1: I make the honor roll.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you become drum major for the school band, which is still winning statewide honors.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 103147
Speaker 1: Something very important happened.
Speaker 2: Okay, tell us about it.
Speaker 1: I was a senior, and we wanted to play--the band wanted to play the number one song on the radio at the football games.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay?  And the band director--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --What was the name of that song?
Speaker 1: I don't remember the name of that song.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I'm sad because I don't remember that, but the band director, you know, we--"Mr. Holson [ph.], we need to play--" I remember Mr. Holson would say, "If that's what you want to play, write it."  Like, "write it, what's he is talking about?  How are we going to write it?"  Well, let me look at it from Mr. Holson's standpoint, competitions, parades, ceremonies.  He ain't got time to deal with that, "So y'all want to play that, write it."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: "Write it for the band."  Nobody knew anything about writing.  You know, you never told us how to write.  Three of us came together and we figured enough of whatever that song was to be able to identify it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --put it on paper.
Speaker 1: We had, you know, like, like, like unsupervised choirs.  Everybody sang the soprano part.  They had the tubas, the clarinets, the 'bones, the trumpets, the drums--everything playing the melody--no accompaniment at all, just the melody, man.  So that was enough of that melody that people said, "Oh," and it was a hit song, so it was cool.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Man, that was the worse piece of crap ever, but it changed my life.
Speaker 2: That's the story we want to hear.
Speaker 1: Changed my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 103148
Speaker 1: Now, something happened with the choir prior to that.  We went to Tougaloo [Mississippi]. In Greenville, Mississippi; Tougaloo is near Jackson [Mississippi].  We went to Tougaloo for a live performance of the "Messiah," [by George Fredrick Handel] full orchestra.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Now, I've never seen anything like that.  Like I said, my folks [Colonus Miller and Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] didn't have a television.  There probably wasn't much stuff like that anyway.  We had been practicing the "Messiah," so we knew most of it.  You know, "Thus says the Lord," and "Hallelujah" chorus, you know, all that stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Man, I remember that orchestra struck up and started playing.  They had violins and stuff.  I was like at the edge of my seat, my mouth was opened.  I think I slobbered the whole while.  It's like "wow" to hear, see it, and every now and then the songs that we had practiced and rehearsed, and you could follow along, but I wasn't hearing the choir, man, I was, it's that band, that orchestra.  Man, I was never the same!  Then the next year, I'm in this band.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we get to this point where the band director says, "Write," after we wrote that horrible song that everybody loved, I think I was convinced then that I wanted to write.
Story_ID: 102810
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's this revolution for you, "The Messiah," [by George Fredrick Handel] and you've heard a piece, the writing part. And now you're challenged.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: "If you want this new hit piece, you need to write it yourself."  The band leader has challenged you.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Like I said, we wrote it.  I don't know how we did it.
Speaker 1: You did write it?
Speaker 2: We did write it.
Speaker 1: Who did most of the writing?
Speaker 2: Well, it was three of us.  I don't recall how much each of us did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we were able to get that melody on paper---(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --enough to teach the band.  Like I said, it sounded like crap, man, because we only had the melody, that's it, but I think the experience of what we did in terms of trying to prepare it for band and teaching the band, that put a stamp on me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I want to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, certainly I had a problem with stuff because whatever was on the radio--I always heard it should be this and it should be that.  I didn't have a clue of maybe I was honing my craft, okay, of being in arranger.  Today, I'm called an "arranger," but whatever I heard, I was never satisfied with nothing.  Whatever was on the radio, "Man, that should have been that."  Man, the drum should have--the string should have, you know, I'm pointing out.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, now you're being shaped.  You're being shaped in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a growing maturity--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as reflected in your academic grades as well as your consciousness on this band music, okay.
Speaker 2: Everything is going good, you know.
Story_ID: 102811
Speaker 1: Okay. Take us to graduation.
Speaker 2: Prior to graduation, I get thrown out of school [Coleman High School].
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What's the incident?
Speaker 2: Well, my mom [Colonus Miller] had been said all along, "You gotta be careful.  You gotta be careful" because I'm very opinionated now, and maybe talk back whatever.   And like I said, I'm playing in the night clubs.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Playing in a night club, I remember we did a gig in Cleveland, Mississippi, and my girlfriend went on this gig, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You had a gig, and she went with you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where was it?
Speaker 2: This is the band director's gig.
Speaker 1: Oh, the band director's gig.
Speaker 2: Cleveland is like 20 or 30 minutes away from where we live, but an incident happened after, and we should have been coming right back.  The cat that had the car or whatever.  We hung out a little bit, and there was a confrontation with about five guys that is possibly from--what is called, Leland, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they raped my girlfriend, one of them, one of them.
Speaker 1: You're saying that one of the people that went with you on the gig raped your girlfriend?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Five guys that showed up at the gig from Leland, Mississippi.  We didn't know them, whatever, but, you know, you're in somebody else's territory.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This thing happened.  When the newspaper got it, it was an ugly scene.
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: And, you know, we were able to identify a guy.  He was put in jail, and it's a small town.  The newspaper, it's everywhere.  Well, the band director had been hassled for years for using young, young kids to play in his band outside of school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they came down on him; and no certain, he's pissed because he told us.  "Okay, okay, let's go," and we didn't go.  When the court thing and whatever, then the school expelled me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They didn't do anything to the band director or any of the other cats?
Speaker 2: No, they had been fighting him all the time anyway.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They couldn't throw him away.  He was too strong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I could see myself walking home, and my mom, God bless her, knew that something was wrong.  I told her--I think she told me, "You're out.  You're out of school."  "Yes, I was thrown out of school."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not know the hurt it was causing my mom.
Story_ID: 102812
Speaker 1: The next day, my mom [Colonus Miller] took me to go meet the school superintendent.  Now, we're talking pre-Civil Rights here, there's no black superintendent.  We had to go to the white superintendent to get the black child back into the black school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --because the school system, at that time, in Greenville [Mississippi] was set up--was simply one set of school superintendents and they were over the black schools as well as the white school?
Speaker 1: A school superintendent.
Speaker 2: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: There were no blacks in that superintendent's-
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: --board? Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: The school superintendent gave the okay for me to go back to school.  That made my mom very happy, but it pissed me off.  Now, I'm not going back.
Speaker 2: Okay, why did it piss you off now?
Speaker 1: Well, I just--I'm fed up with school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm fed up.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Even though you were getting your best grades ever?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like I said, I'm standoffish--you know, all my peers are older musicians.  And basically, I got a little girlfriend, but I'm dealing with this older chicks.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: I'm not in school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not there.
Speaker 2: What age are you?
Speaker 1: I think I'm seventeen.
Speaker 2: You're seventeen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen, seventeen years old.
Speaker 2: And your girlfriend is what, eighteen or nineteen?
Speaker 1: No, she was in school too.
Speaker 2: She was in school also, okay.
Speaker 1: "I don't, mom, I don't want to go back."  "(Unclear) we want you to march to see you in that line."  "No, I ain't going back."  That broke my mom's heart--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because for my family, you know, to see somebody graduate from high school, oh my God, that's like winning three of four lottos.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But big, bull me, no.
Speaker 2: Head strong.
Speaker 1: I ain't going back.
Speaker 2: I gotcha.
Speaker 1: Okay. To get my diploma, I go back to school to take the test to the office and that's the only thing I agreed to.
Speaker 2: This is your GED. I guess, I don't know.
Speaker 1: No, high school diploma.
Speaker 2: Your high school diploma, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, I go back to take the test, final exams.  You know, I get my diploma, but I don't march.  I don't wanna to march.  I just wanna be away from and that was me being thrown out of school, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. So my life is ready to take another turn now.
Speaker 2: But you now have your high school diploma?
Speaker 1: I got my diploma.
Speaker 2: Good enough.
Speaker 1: Legit because I'm an honor student.  I wiped the test out, no problem.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102813
Speaker 1: This particular summer after being thrown out of school [Coleman High School in Greenville, Mississippi]--let me back up a little bit.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: This is the heavy part for me.  As a senior, you had to go before the high school counselor.  I had been the dumbest cat in the school forever.  And in the yearbook, it features what you want to be.  I said, "Professional musician."  Now, there were no professional musicians in my town.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was a band director who taught school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who had gigs on the weekend, and some of the other cats that we would occasional play--blues cats or whatever, worked on service station, gig on the weekend.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There is no full-time musician.  Okay.  Now cats used to come through town, you know, performing.  Bobby ["Blue"] Bland and that kind of thing, and I remember--cat came through.  All the little musicians would go hang out on the bus or whatever.  And one guy had a book called, Down Beat magazine.  And, man, I saw that thing and "This is it!"  Nobody in Mississippi sold that magazine.  I had to order a subscription to that magazine, so I started taking Down Beat magazine about when I was in the eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. So with Down Beat magazine, I know what's happening with every cat everywhere, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Every musician that's in Down Beat, (unclear) back in that day.
Speaker 2: What year are you in your senior, '60 [1960]?
Speaker 1: 1965 in my senior year.
Speaker 2: Okay, right.  That's what I was thinking.
Speaker 1: Down Beat magazine, the number one jazz band was [HM] B. B. King.  B. B. King--my high school choir director had talked about B. B. King, which you really couldn't understand was coming from--Mrs. Jones, concert this, and classical this, B. B. King.  Well, back in the day, B. B. King, as you know, had an orchestra.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the latter--the middle '60s [1960], the orchestra came down to the seven or eight piece band.  And that was the number one jazz band according to the Down Beat magazine at that time, you know.  So my choir director talked about B. B. King.  And B. B. King is from right down the road in Indianola, Mississippi.  Now, B. B. King was a real lady's man, so half of the school was children by B. B.  I knew several of his kid, so I was into B. B.  And this Down Beat magazine, okay, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but-
Story_ID: 102814
Speaker 1: Now, I'm thrown out of school [Coleman High School in Greenville, Mississippi], and there is a little cat there named, Jerry Wilson, saxophone player who was a relative of Ike Turner.  Ike used to be in town all the time.  Ike's first wife was from Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're waiting-- we're working with my dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.]--working with my dad, working with my dad.  We show up late.  My dad don't--my dad is very punctual and the whole bit.  We gigged last night, so we showed late.  Maybe my dad was putting a roof on in the summertime.  Okay. "Gentlemen" No matter how old you were, how small, you were always "Mister."  My dad always addressed you as "Mister."  For me, it was "Mr. Wright--Mr. Wilson, we're putting a roof in the morning at 5 a.m., gentlemen, 5 a.m. because it's hot, and in a few hours, it'll be too hot to be on the roof.  It gets so hot, you could slide off."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Mr. Wright and Mr. Wilson show up about 8:00.  And my dad was always so polite.  "Good morning, gentleman, how you doing, can I help you?"  "Yeah dad, we've been--" "Oh, no, no, you don't understand.  You were to be here at five, so why don't you go and take the rest of the day off and do whatever you were doing."  Now, I think it was my buddy that was making me late.  And one thing about it as opposed to going to the field to chop cotton, my dad paid me seventy dollars a week.
Speaker 2: Woah!
Speaker 1: Seventy dollars a week.  Now, dad was trying to teach me thing because this was for my clothing, my upkeeping, the whole bit.  He didn't want me to just go out and blow the money.  When we would show up, certainly my dad would pay me well, and then I had my gigs on the weekend that most times, Friday nights and Saturdays nights, making $10.00.  Cats in the field, you know, they're making $2.00 and $3.00 a day, you know.  I'm making $5.00 a night doing what I want to do, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I'm out of school and I'm going back to my counselor.  My counselor says, "You want to be a professional musician?"  She didn't know what a professional musician was, so these were my choices since I had bad grades throughout high school, there is no college for me.  My folks [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr. and Colonus Miller] can't send me to college-(unclear) "Being a dark-skinned person, your choices are," this from the counselor, "Go to the Army or try to get a job at the post office."
Speaker 2: Those were the only two choices.
Speaker 1: That's it.  "Go to the Army or try to get a job at the post office."  There is no college for me because I'm dumb and my folks ain't got no money.
Speaker 2: So you can't qualify for college?
Speaker 1: That's it. Counselor.
Story_ID: 102815
Speaker 1: No problem.  I didn't understand the significance of it at that time.  So my buddy and I--my dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] fires.  And we go to the pool hall.  "Who's coming to town?  We're going to get a road gig."  Bobby ["Blue"] Bland is coming to town.  We know everybody in the band, D. [Deadric] Molone, all the cats, guitarist Wayne Bennett.  We know everybody.  Whenever Bobby Bland would come to town because we played in the night club, we could get in.  And we would get up on the bandstand, and sometimes we'd be looking over on the music because Bobby Bland had an orchestra.  You know, we could--oh, he missed.  You know, we know everything, you know?  But we have prepared.  We know all of Bobby Bland's stuff, him [Jerry Wilson] a saxophonist and I'm a piano player.  We going to get this job with Bobby Bland.  Bobby Bland cancelled.
Speaker 2: He didn't come into Greenville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 1: Another act replaced him by the name of [Austin] Ted Taylor.  At the time, Ted had, I guess, a number one hit called, "Be Ever Wonderful."  Ted was a high falsetto singer (singing) "Be Ever Wonderful," strings and stuff, and white background singers, you know, during that day.
Speaker 2: He didn't come to Mississippi that way?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, he did.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean he didn't bring that but that's what his records were.
Speaker 2: Good enough.
Speaker 1: Ted liked playing blues, even though he was on Columbia at the time, they wanted him to be this classical, but that wasn't him.  He wanted to sing blues.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ted was a big man, pretty guy, light-skinned, wavy hair, but a guy--not a fat guy--big man, kind of like Marvin Gaye, a big man.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He loved to fight--and I think--because he had this high voice, I think all his days, he had been called a "faggot" or whatever, so, you know.  And I didn't know at the time what karate was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is '65 [1965] now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We audition for Ted Taylor.  We sat in, and Ted liked what we did.  Said "we wanted to go on the road, man," and Ted agreed.  He said, "Okay, these young boys can play."  Well, I'm ready to go.  They're leaving the next day.  I'm ready to go.  My parents [Colonus Miller and Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] say, "Who?  Ted, who?"  My folks are church folks.  They don't know nothing about no Ted Taylor.  Say, "Well, Mr. Taylor is going to have to come over here and talk to me."  Artists don't come to talk to no parents like for somebody to go on the road.  As God would have it, Ted understood.  He understood, so he came to the house.  And, boy, my dad, Sunday school superintendent.  "Now, Mr. Taylor, what does he do when he's not performing with you away from home?"  I was like, "Oh, my God, my father won't let me go."  He got all these things. But Ted was so understanding--so understanding and had a road manager from Dallas, Texas, who was on the police force.  And he said they're going to take care of them and the whole bit, so my folks let me go on the road.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102816
Speaker 1: I had a little Wurlitzer electric piano.
Speaker 2: How about your friend, now?
Speaker 1: Yes, he's a saxophone player.
Speaker 2: Saxophone player--give me his name again.
Speaker 1: Jerry Wilson.
Speaker 2: Jerry Wilson.
Speaker 1: Jerry was kind of used to the road because being in Ike's family, every summer, he went on the road with Ike [Turner].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: You know. Some recordings he played on, you know.  And there were several cats in our town like Lou Milton.  Lou Milton had a nephew, Joe Campbell, who plays out here now, trumpet player.  A few other cats played with their relatives--you know, there were a lot of blues artists in our area and, you know, their kindred, whatever, you know, young kids, whatever would go play music.  They'd go out with them on holidays and whatever.  I was always by myself because my folks--no music, you know.  So we hit the road together and with [Austin] Ted Taylor, two young kids and Ted had a band of old guys, what an experience--what an experience.  Now, being on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --This 1965--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --1965--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and you hit the road.
Speaker 1: Hit the road.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the date?
Speaker 1: Summer of '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Summer of '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: This is about June--about June.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tremendous experience--I mean we were traveling at that time--if you can recall the old checker limousines.  The old checker limousines had four doors on one side prior to everybody having the buses, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I mean we're in heaven.  We're on the road, man.  But reality sets in real quick.  We can't stay in so-called "white hotels."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We get to certain places.  We had to find what was referred to as "black rooming houses."
Story_ID: 102465
Speaker 1: When you're traveling during that time, we couldn't stay--I'll just use the term, "Holiday Inn type places," white hotels, had to find black rooming houses.  And very seldom would they be conducive especially for two children.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. There's a--
Speaker 2: Rooming houses were transient homes and so forth.
Speaker 1: Transient--as kids refer to it now, Motel 6, motel, hotel, Holiday Inn.  You know, it's where you go knock off the piece.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Bathroom down the hall.  Okay.  Um, we survived that--my buddy [Jerry Wilson] and me.  We were the children in the band; and the good part about is that the road manager had specific instructions from our parents, you know, to look over us.  I wanted to get my hair fried because you had to have a do in that day.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: "No, you can't."
Speaker 2: The road manager said this or the parents said?
Speaker 1: Yeah. The road manager.  "No you can't."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: "Heh, here I am on the road."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: "No, you can't."
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: God bless him.  God bless him.  Now, before I left home, my mom gave me $100.00.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That would have been equivalent to about five grand.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She gave me $100.00 and she said, "Now, Benjamin, you hide this from yourself."
Speaker 2: That was your emergency money.
Speaker 1: Say if "Mr. Taylor and them start acting a fool, you can come home.  If something happened to you on the road, this $100.00 and this Life of Georgia Insurance card"--you know, this insurance card didn't mean anything, you know, because they weren't taking us in the hospitals.  That was the reality of it, but that's what my mom armed me with.  "Hide this from yourself."  Mr. Taylor's road manager was the greatest parent ever.
Speaker 2: Let's get his name down.
Speaker 1: Oh my God, I can't recall his name at the moment.
Speaker 2: Okay, maybe later.  And I could see his face because I used to go stay with him in Dallas, Texas when I wasn't working, you know, and he'd just let me come, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102466
Speaker 1: But we had a couple of druggies in the band [Ted Taylor's band].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And at that time, the cats were shooting up, and the police wasn't following them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was like almost out in Oakland.  And this was another good part for me because a tenor player, an old tenor player used to shoot up before the gig.  "Oh, young blood, you oughta come try this."  That was the ugliest, nastiest thing, ugh, man--now I just got out of high school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Where the nurses come give you shots.  And I was one of those cats that was running, and now I got to be stuck with this cat shooting up.  I praise God because God-willing in a few months, I'll be sixty-one years old.  I have never been high in my life, never.   I thank God for that experience.
Speaker 2: And your parents,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: My parents didn't know nothing about no drugs.  They never talked to me about no drugs.  I guess in that day, "marijuana" was the name.  It was called "reefer."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I didn't smoke.  I remember an incident--my dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.]--my dad smoked cigars.  And I think about 8, 9 years old, I was always fuddling around with his cigars.  I remember he'd always say, "Leave my stuff alone," but that didn't mean anything to me.  So one day he busted me.  He said, "Mr. Wright, you like smoking?  Have a seat."  Got in his pocket--and you know you lick it.  "Smoke up."  He did his.  "Yeah, smoke up."  I'm coughing and I'm getting sick.  "Smoke."  Man, I couldn't take it no more.  When he thought I couldn't take it no more, he took me to Dr. (unclear).  He told me just go get into the truck and took me to the doctor.  I think I was about 8 or 9 years old.  Never smoked.
Speaker 2: Never again.
Speaker 1: Never.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I never drank, never smoked, never got high even today.  I'm the most boring cat you could ever meet.  Okay.  But--
Story_ID: 102467
Speaker 1: But you're on the road now.
Speaker 2: On the road.
Speaker 1: And you're staying in these, what some people would call today, I guess, "cat houses."
Speaker 2: Right, right, "cat houses."  Then we have to go to Nashville [Tennessee] to record.  I had never been to a recording studio.  Go to Nashville--you know, [Austin] Ted [Taylor] has a hit records, so he's a big cat.  We go up there maybe in the afternoon, I guess maybe 5:00 or whatever, and here is another experience because I never played music with a white musician.  In this situation, that evening, there was another artist--there was a white artist in the studio, Peggy Lee--Peggy Lee.
Speaker 1: Are we still in 1965?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this white drummer--and I didn't know what's what.  I knew what we were going to play with Ted, cause we rehearsed that.  It was just Peggy Lee.  And, you know, she was so friendly.  We had a guitar player.  I don't recall his name, but he was a great reader.  He stayed drunk all the time, but he could, but you gave him a piece of music, he could just fly with it.  Everybody else was just a real pro musician.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So this session with this white drummer who stood out and about three other white cats for this session.  Just playing and the white guy was so sensitive and aware of the racial thing because when we left the studio, we got a hotel.  And when you could get a hotel, you only got one or two rooms and everybody stayed in it.  You know, cats would be coming up the back to get to the room.  He stayed in the room with us.  And that was a funny feeling, you know what I'm saying?  And he knew that we had not been exposed--these two young kids.  So musicians speak a whole other language.  That was a great experience.  But also at this Nashville experience, my buddy [Jerry Wilson], who had not finished high school said he had to go back home.  "(unclear) to go finish school."  Hadn't thought about it like that, well what's going to happen to me?  It was that night that I decided to be a man.  "I ain't going back.  I'm staying."  We had a long trip.  I think we went from Nashville to Lakeland, Florida.  So I had to, we had to hit it, you know.  He told Mr. Taylor he had to go home.  He said, "Whatcha going to do?"  Didn't take long. "I'm staying."  "Okay, get in the vehicle."  We dropped my man off at the bus station, my buddy.  I'm on the road for real now.  You know, this is it.  This is it.  I make all the gigs and the whole bit.  Then--
Speaker 1: And you hadn't turned eighteen yet? Or just turned eighteen?
Speaker 2: I turned eighteen on the road.
Speaker 1: On the road, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102468
Speaker 1: I-- There's a James Brown date.  [Austin] Ted Taylor used to headline over James Brown.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, it's about August.  August 1965, 'Papa's Got a Brand New Bag' hit.  Nobody head lined over James no more.  So we're going to big James Brown date.  I'm excited because a couple of cats in our band knew cats in James' band.  They had gone to school together, or something, or whatever, so I'm excited.  This gig is in Birmingham, Alabama.  I think it's called Ridgeway Field [sic. Rickwood Field].  It's a stadium.  James is big.  But it's two things happening in town that day, the James Brown gig, which I'm excited to get to, but that morning, there was a march, [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was in Birmingham.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, I've been so Civil Rights conscious and the whole bit.  I'm going to be in that march.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I made that march.
Speaker 2: You're at the march that morning.
Speaker 1: That morning, and that evening--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: ---you played with James Brown?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Now, this was another experience.  There was a young lady on the show called, Mitty Collier.  Mitty Collier had a big record at that time called 'I had a Talk with My Man Last Night.'  Mitty didn't have a band.  [Austin] Ted Taylor's band is to play behind Mitty Collier.  Well, now, we're set up at around second base.  They're calling Mitty Collier.  "Mitty Collier!"  The stadium is full and people are calling.  People are screaming.  And this guy is running out toward second base where the band is with some charts.  I'd never seen any charts other than in the high school band.  The band starts playing (singing) with everybody's come on song.  The guy is running out, Mitty Collier.  She appears and she is strolling.  The guy came out and staring passing music.  What am I going to do with this?  I can't read this.  I can read drum stuff.  I'm the piano player.  Guess what?  In Mitty Collier's record, there is a piano solo--two bar piano solo that is big in the song.  (Singing) "I said I had a talk with my man."  This is a big part in the song, so they do two songs while I sat silently.  And the third song was her hit record.  Now, I've been looking through this chart.  Throughout these two songs, nobody had heard me, but I could figure out based on my choir experience and my notation in terms of beats and whatever, I was able to figure out that part.  So when it got to that part, I'm ready man.  I turn up, and I kill it.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I became the hit of the tour.  I was so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed.
Speaker 2: About?
Speaker 1: Because I couldn't handle the music.
Story_ID: 102469
Speaker 1: That was the first reality check.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. We left Birmingham, Alabama and had to go to Tulsa, Oklahoma.  We got to Tulsa, Oklahoma on a Saturday morning before the stores opened.  I couldn't wait for the stores to open because I wanted to go to the music store to buy some music books.  I bought my first music books in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  I started studying. I studied, studied, studied.  Even today, I study.  Then the draft came.  I-- My parents [Colonus Miller and Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] caught me.  [Austin] Ted [Taylor] worked for Universal Attractions, so in order to reach somebody, you had to call New York [New York City, New York] to get possibly where they were.  They told me about this letter.  The letter was from the draft board.  Here is another story.  I go to Greenville [Mississippi].  Most of my high school class is dead.  I'll take you back to the counselor--those who can't go to college, the only opportunity would be to get a job at the post office, which would be considered a decent job, or you go to the Army.  Most went to the Army.  Vietnam is hot as hell.  They had to be funerals in my home town every week--okay--because these black kids were front liners, so here I get my papers.
Speaker 2: This was the Vietnam War?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I go home and I go to the Air Force man, telling him how I want to join the Air Force.  They send me to Jackson, Mississippi to take all these tests and whatever, and we had to stay over in Jackson.  Well, that night, I decided to go over to Jackson State [College, now Jackson State University, in Jackson, Mississippi].  I know everybody at Jackson State and we always go to Jackson and whatever, and we were the high school cats, probably in the band and the whole bit.  I'm just going to hang out.  I know the band director and the whole bit.  I go to Jackson State.  The band is practicing.  I walk in the door and the band director is the first one to recognize me.  "That's Benjamin Wright."  Then I see all these little shaved heads, cats from high school band.  "It'a Benjamin, Ben, Ben. (unclear) where have you been?"  I commence telling them--now, I'm curious.  What's this, where have I been?  Well, they've been waiting on me.  I got a scholarship.
Speaker 2: At Jackson State?
Speaker 1: At Jackson State--I don't know nothing about it.  I was thrown out of school [Coleman High School in Greenville, Mississippi].  Somebody in my school knew.  Somebody in my high school knew.  My parents don't know nothing about it.  I don't know nothing about it, but they got a scholarship list on the board.  My name was at the top there.  I was considered a very talented person.  I was a drum major.  Jackson State needed a drum major.  I was a great, All-State tympani player at the time, and I sang.
Speaker 2: So they were waiting for you.
Speaker 1: I didn't have a clue.  Because if I could've gone to college, no way would I have gone on the road.  Now, this was the assistant band director who knew me well.  I told him what was happening, and I've been on the road, and I was there because of the draft and the whole bit.  And he said, "Okay, well, son, if you can, you meet me here in the morning at such and such time, and we're going to try to get this together."  I met him at the appointed time, and he was outstanding to try to get through red tape to get me in school that day.  It didn't work.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I can't specifically why, but school administration--what he was trying to do, no.  And one of the things he was trying to do was to keep me from going to the war.  Well, didn't work.
Story_ID: 102470
Speaker 1: I had to go to the military.
Speaker 2: So you went in--what was that date?
Speaker 1: I went in, I think, October 6, '65 [1965].  I think that is what it was.  That was the worst day of my life.  It was horrible.
Speaker 2: I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Because I never dreamed military.  We used to see cats in military uniforms at home from the air base and throw rocks at them, and just I couldn't see myself as a GI.  I had problems.
Speaker 2: But you went in.
Speaker 1: My first duty station was Montgomery, Alabama.  I had been to Montgomery with [Austin] Ted Tayler.  With Ted Taylor, we had challenged a couple of hotels after the Civil Rights Bill had passed, you know.  When the billed was passed, cats began to challenge it, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But here I am stationed at Montgomery, Alabama, checked in with the first sergeant.  He tells me what barracks to go to.  I go to the barracks.  It's two to a room.  In the room, there's this white guy there three stripes.  On this side, bed on this side, bed on this side.  He's on this bed.  I come in and speak.  "How are you doing?"  He is very, very cold.  On this side, where the bed is, there is a wall-size Confederate flag.  I had a problems with that.  I dropped my stuff.  I go back to the first sergeant.  Telling him, "You know, I'm not going to sleep under this wall-sized Confederate flag.  Well, the first sergeant certainly could fix anything.  So he says, "Sleep on the other side."  This is the U.S. military now.  And I'm having to adhere to the Confederate flag.
Speaker 2: You give up certain freedoms.
Speaker 1: This is day one.  And I went through a bunch of racial things there, a bunch of racial things there.  It broke my heart many years later, before our wonderful brother, [HM] Colin Powell, became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, made a statement that, on television, "There is no racism in the military."  If I had a bomb, I would have thrown it to wherever he was.  Do you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: I understand.
Speaker 1: That was so sick. Was like, "How could you say that?"
Speaker 2: But yet you remained in the military.
Speaker 1: I was in the military 3 years, 3 months and 2 weeks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 102471
Speaker 1: You're now in the service and you're just beginning--well, you've learned the most important lesson.  You do as you're told--you sacrifice certain freedoms--go ahead.  You took that bunk under that Confederate flag.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first sergeant finally became man enough to have him take it down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. I went through a lot of changes there.  I be-- really became very stand-offish and all a bit because I had a problem with "boy"--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --people with more rank really welcomed the opportunity to say "Hey, nigger," and you had to salute them.
Speaker 1: How did this impact your, your music?
Speaker 2: That was my escape.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, I go back to buying music books.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The military was a place where I really got into my music.  I could not join the band.  You know, I was told, "Hey man, when they ask you so and so, tell them you want Special Services, you'll get in the band.  I can't say "What your job?"  It's Special Services."  "What do you mean Special Services?"  I want to play in the band.  I'm quoting.  He says, "Shit, we got Bob Hope for that."  That killed my band thing.  Okay. My job was Communications, teletype and stuff.  The military had a music course, music theory, administered by the Department of Defense.  It was really for people in the band, but whomever could take it.  I took it.  I also took, at that time, correspondence from Carl Fisher [Carl Fischer Music].  And here's another one--my good friend, Matthew, does not know much about this, but, in Boston, there was school called, Berklee [Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts].  I'm taking you back, in early '60s [1960], Berklee School of Music had correspondence course, and I took the Berklee School of Music course, and I knew about the Berklee thing because Berklee was a big supporter of Down Beat magazine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was my Bible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  So I knew about Berklee from Down Beat [magazine].
Speaker 1: Because you still had your subscription going from Down Beat.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was following me then, but you know, I, you know. Taking Carl Fisher, Berklee School of Music, and the military's Department of Defense theory, very seldom did I adhere to my job. You know, I was taking music, man, music, music, music, music, plus I'm gigging downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102472
Speaker 1: Okay. I learned in my shift, there was three individuals that I felt had the ideal job.  My situation was that, you know, you worked midnights, days or mids, you know, and man, this is messing with me playing downtown.  But these people had a job where they come in at eleven and they left at four.  I was like, wow, how do you get this gig?  Well, I'm in the Communication Center, strict super, super security.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Maxwell [Air Force Base] in Montgomery [Alabama] was the back up for the Pentagon [Arlington County, Virginia]. A colonel is like a private, you know, this is big time, so in my job in the com center is where I had top secret speed (unclear) crypto clearances.  This is high, high end stuff, especially in crypto.  These people were the typers and whatever or high speed security stuff, and that boom, but you had to be of a certain rank to do that, so I studied my music and I studied them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And as they began to get shipped out, I had signed so much, you know, everything that you can do, you have to put your (unclear) sign there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So when traffic analysis, "Well who is this?  Airman, not sergeant."  Finally, they shipped somebody out and they couldn't get anybody back in to replace them right away.  I got that job.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I made money.  The reason I say I made money is 'cause I did all the gigs downtown, man.  I didn't have to cash my GI check, you know,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then being on the road, I knew how to play pool, so I would take all the young cats' money, you know.  I was rolling, you know, I was rolling.
Story_ID: 102473
Speaker 1: I hated the military, but in terms of me working downtown after I got that particular job--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --fine.  So I did well rank-wise but my attitude wasn't cool.  It was black people and white people, there was always a batter.  And I wasn't one of those submissive people.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: Then I got a Vietnam assignment.  Now, like I said when the draft first came, and my parents got in contact with me, this was devastating because most of my high school [Coleman High School] class was already gone.  Now, I got a Vietnam assignment.  It killed my mother [Colonus Miller].
Speaker 2: But you were ready to go?
Speaker 1: No, no, I certainly I didn't want to go.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: My mom got sick,
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, real, real sick and the last days of her life, you know, I used to--I had a car, and mom had to go to the hospital and I was the only person in the family with a car, so I had to drive from Montgomery, Alabama to Greenville, Mississippi to take my mom because we couldn't afford ambulance service.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I had to make this trip.  The last I had to deal with my mom, she, she didn't know I was there but she would always say this, "Lord, don't send my son to Vietnam."  And something else she would say from the book of Job, which I didn't know at the time.  "Thou thou slay me, yet will I trust in thee," and the next thing was, "Lord, don't send my son to Vietnam."  It was like a tape, like a loop.  That's all she said, you know, I was right there.  She couldn't even recognize me, or whatever.  It was really bad.  Coming home for this last time, my wife was with me.  I had married.  I was in uniform.  My sister said, "You know, you need to hurry."  Okay.  We stopped in Greenwood, Mississippi to fuel up.  Fuel up, my wife needed to go the bathroom-I asked for the bathroom.  The white attendant says, "Niggers can't use the bathroom here."  I ain't got no gun.  I'm in uniform.  I got orders to go give up my life.  Fill up my car and can't tell me "Niggers, can't use the bathroom.  Get the hell off my property."  Man, you know, I don't know what to do.  Should I try and ram this cat with my car?  You know, but that was it.
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: That was it.  I mean, you know, saw mom.  I left her alive.  But I had to go back to the war--you know, back to the base.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And deal with white cats demeaning me on a daily basis.  I was in more fights than Jack Johnson.  Every time, boom, you know, it was (unclear) I stayed busted.  You know, my whole thing was like "You killed my mom."
Speaker 2: So this was a procession of trouble for you back in the base in Alabama?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Fights?
Speaker 1: Right.  It was a bad situation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Your mom passed?
Speaker 1: My mom passed.
Speaker 2: What was that date?
Speaker 1: I don't remember the date, but it was I think one day before I was to leave to go to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I got what's called, "Humanitarian Deferment" by telegram.  Humanitarian Deferment automatically lasts eighteen months.  The deferment, which was sent by God, adhered to my mom's [Colonus Miller] wishes because I got the deferment and I couldn't go.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When the deferment was up--it was up I think like two days before I was to get out, so it worked.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It worked.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102474
Speaker 1: I get out of the military, there is an act called Bob Moore and The Rhythm Aces [sic, Bobby Moore and The Rhythm Aces] in Montgomery, Alabama.  It had a two million-selling records.  One was called (singing) Searching and Searching for a Baby [sic, "Searching For My Love"].  I got a gig with Bob playing organ.  Bob didn't use a bass player.  I was playing pedals.  So I get out of the military; they swear me out; this morning I go to the airport.  I'm gigging.  I'm back on the road, man.  I'm back on the road.
Speaker 2: With Bob Moore?
Speaker 1: Bob Moore and The Rhythm Aces.  That was a decent situation 'cause, like I said, they had two hit records.  Then one day, I get a telegram.  I didn't have a phone.  The telegram say, "Hey, man, my name is Skip McQueen.  I hear that you one bad organ player, and I'm coming to meet with you."  He gave me a date.  That day came.  The car pulls up.  This white cat gets out of the car with long hair.  Real southern cat.  "Ben, right?"  "Yeah." "I'm Skip McQueen."  Right. I'm quoting him, "I heard you're one God damn hell of an organ player, man.  I want to offer you a job, man."  Okay, I'm listening, you know, it was like--  I don't know how to take this.  Who is this cat?  That cat offered me more money than what I'm making with Bob Moore.
Speaker 2: A lot more or a little more?
Speaker 1: A lot more.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's like damn, wow!  "Okay. Okay."  I went to Bob's house because my organ is in the bus.  "Hey, man, I'm taking this gig." Or whatever.  And you know, that was really cold what I did because there was no notice, no nothing, you know.  Bob said, "Okay, man."  I got my organ and my two Leslies [Leslie speakers].  This cat went and got a trailer.  I put it on a trailer.  And I left Montgomery, Alabama that day, going to Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You haven't told us his name yet.
Speaker 1: Skip McQueen, that's my buddy.
Speaker 2: Skip McQueen.
Speaker 1: That's my buddy today.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 102475
Speaker 1: Skip [McQueen] had a trio now, guitar player, black guitar player, black organ player, and Skip playing drums.  Skip could only play like "Mustang Sally" stuff, you know, and sing those Wilson Pickett songs, you know, just hard, pow, pow, pow.  Man, I got to do some other kind of music, you know, you know, I've been studying and the whole bit, you know.  The cat just played that club stuff, man, you know.  So Skip and I became very, very close because all of sudden I had to have more money.  You know, I mean, I'm carrying the load.  I'm singing.  I'm the organ player.  And Skip was a very good business man because I got the money.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But then, then all of sudden, I was making more money than Skip.  But it was holding the situation together, but we became very, very close friends, very close, closer than--you know, and hey, I've been fighting white people all my life.  And here it is Skip and I are like brothers.  We get an offer to go to North Carolina to play for the Holiday Inn circuit. Holiday Inn--I'm sorry-Downtowner, Downtowner Motor Inns was just coming on the scene.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Holiday Inn had created lounges where bands were playing.  So Downtowner followed suit, you know, so we got a call, man.  We go into North Carolina in Charlotte, and we got to play in the Downtowner Motor Inn circuit, and we did, you know.  But we also got very adventurous and took another gig in that town, an after-hour gig, playing for a race driver.  This was an easy gig because we got off at eleven with the Downtowners.  By the time we packed up the organ and drums, and whatever, and go cross town, pretty much 12:00, and we hit.  But it was an after-hours place, and everybody in town would come and sit in, and the whole bit, so we didn't have to work ourselves to death.  They were there all night.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then we built up a following because we were a very unusual group.  These two black cats and white cat, a trio, and we planned R & B stuff.  We're playing funky stuff.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: This is '6-, '69 [1969], now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: '69 [1969].  Skip and I are making $2.00, so we want to become big time businessman.  We open a clothing store right in Alabama, down from University of Auburn [sic, Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Now, what a minute, now, you're playing two different places?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in Charlotte, North Carolina and you open a clothing store--
Speaker 1: Open a clothing store.
Speaker 2: --in, just outside of Auburn.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You have to explain that.
Speaker 1: Well, Skip's wife is kind of manning the store.  We were selling hip stuff like bell bottoms, purses from Mexico, we had a  parachute in the place--that kind of clothing store--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --hip stuff.
Speaker 2: And Skip's wife is running it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And uou and Skip have invested in it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we buddy-buddy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Every week our store would be tore up.  Nothing ever stolen-everything, everything turned over and the whole bit.  "What's happening?"
Speaker 2: You mean someone would break in and tear it up?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  After three weeks of this, we got the message, "Get out of town," so that was the end of our entrepreneurship, you know.  But, but Skip [McQueen] and I are doing great.  We're playing for the race driver.
Speaker 2: Is that, is that a name we should know?
Speaker 1: The cat's name was Doug.  I don't remember his last name, but he was a great guy, man.  He was a great cat.  I think there was some mob stuff in there, but Doug was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a good cat.  We made more money than the mayor.
Speaker 2: The mayor of Charlotte [North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Yes, we made more than the mayor.  But I was a problem because I'm still studying, and I want to write music.
Speaker 2: And maturing.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yes, yes, I'm growing.  And Skip and the guitar player, man, they ain't there, you know.
Story_ID: 102476
Speaker 1: So, finally, I get a call from my buddy, my Ike Turner buddy, who lives in Chicago [Illinois] and he has been making records and the whole bit.
Speaker 2: This is [Austin] Ted Taylor?
Speaker 1: No, no, this is Jerry Wilson, that's the horn player.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry Wilson.
Speaker 1: Say, I'm beat, "Hey, Beat, you need to come to Chicago, man!"  I'm like, "Yeah," because I want to make records.  I want to write music and whatever.  I rent a truck, my organ, I got Fender Rhodes piano now.  I got all kind of equipment.  I got three Leslies [Leslie speakers] now.  I'm going to Chicago.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I'm sharp.  You know, I wear custom clothes.  I'm hey.  I come to Chicago; hook up with this band.
Speaker 2: Are we in '70 [1970] yet or '71 [1971]?
Speaker 1: No, no, this is still--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --still '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: '69 [1969], '69 [1969].  These cats are doing session and the whole bit, but they're starving.  I ain't never starved before.  You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, I've been making money.  These cats they no money.  They drugged out.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: --and here you are sharp as a tack--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: -- I'm sharpy, making money--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Making money.
Speaker 1: I got equipment. Keyboard players didn't have equipment.  I got equipment, and I got loud equipment, you know, I could kill the whole band, you know?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the one thing about these cats is that they could play.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They could play.  You know, cats was playing tunes.  And I wasn't familiar with tunes now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --like standards and that kind of stuff, you know.  But what their playing and the whole bit, and studying and learning, and all of sudden we're doing sessions with name artists.  I like it.
Story_ID: 102477
Speaker 1: I forgot something I gotta tell you.  While in the military [U.S. Air Force], I played with a trumpet player, a society cat, in Alabama.  He used to get all the white gigs, gigs, society stuff.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They played tunes.  I didn't know tunes.  I just played my funky subtle chord, (unclear) "Look at me, look at me."  The old man would be looking at me like, "Boy, what the hell are you doing?"  The guy's name was Andre Ford.  I was like, "Andre, I like him.  I like him."  Andre used to talk a lot.  He knew a lot of languages.  And the one thing he was talking about all the time was Duke Ellington, but he talked so much, very few people believed him.  One day, he called me on the base [Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama] and he said he was going to pick me up.  The cat came to pick me up and drove me over to Alabama State College [Montgomery, Alabama].  "Duke Ellington"--we go into this particular room, Duke Ellington and the band is having a meeting.  Andre walks in, everybody look back.  Fast forward, "Andre, hey, everybody."  I'm just in amazement.  I love Mr. Ellington.  Everybody acknowledges Mr. Ford, so that confirms what he has been saying.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Talk and talk and talk.  He just broke the meeting.  "Hey, man, glad to see you."  He takes me up to Duke Ellington.  I'm about to crap in my pants, man.  He introduces me to Mr. Ellington.  Tells Mr. Ellington I'm this talented kid.  And Mr. Ellington talks to me almost twenty minutes.  That is the highlight of my whole career.
Speaker 2: And I understand.
Speaker 1: Even now.
Speaker 2: I understand.
Speaker 1: I was so wiped out I think the next year or so I don't remember exactly, a couple of years or so, Duke passed away.  And I name one of my kids after Duke Ellington.  One of my kid's name is Edward Kennedy Ellington Wright.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: That's how much I was into the Duke.  You know, it was just.
Speaker 2: You don't have to say anymore.  We understand how impressed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 102817
Speaker 1: So you walk into this room and there's the Duke [Ellington].
Speaker 2: There's the Duke.
Speaker 1: And he asks you to come over and you spend some time with him, so you can tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, Mr. [Andre] Ford took me up to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. And, you know, Mr. Ford just gave me this wonderful introduction on how talented I was and this and that and the other.  I was none of those things, but introducing me to Mr. Duke Ellington, it's like-Mr. Ellington just started talking to me, you know, some music stuff and, you know, and what I was doing and whatever.  I think I mentioned something that I wanted to write music, you know, and he elaborated on that.  It was just general stuff.  It wasn't anything specific per se, just--simultaneous
Speaker 1: --but it left a lasting impression.
Speaker 2: Oh, man, come one, you know, this is Duke Ellington, you know.  I don't even remember what I heard.  It was just like somebody should have come over and closed my mouth. You know what I'm saying?  And cats was-- It was a jubilant time because the guys hadn't seen Mr. Ford for many years, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who else was in the room?  Were the members of the--
Speaker 2: Most of the Ellington band was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, the Ellington Band was there, whoever--simultaneous
Speaker 1: --Johnny Hodges.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know what--simultaneous
Speaker 1: Billy Strayhorn, was he there?
Speaker 2: No, Mr. Strayhorn was not there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew Mr. Strayhorn, but the thing is it was after that that I found some Duke Ellington's records with Mr. Ford's name on it.  So, Mr. Ford was legit.
Speaker 1: He was legit.
Speaker 2: He was legit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even, even Ray Nance, who used to play the violin and whatever, Mr. Ford used to own some of the records--simultaneous
Speaker 1: --with Ray Nance.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So like I say, I named my child after Duke Ellington.
Speaker 1: Now that meeting with Duke Ellington impacted you when you packed up everything, you left Skip McQueen--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and went to Chicago.  Connect those two things.
Story_ID: 102818
Speaker 1: Well, going to Chicago [Illinois]--I wanted to play, I wanted to play music.  I wanted to play more than the Wilson Pickett stuff that we were doing every night.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I wanted to study more and make records, okay.
Speaker 2: But when you got to Chicago, it was these guys--
Speaker 1: It was another scene.  A couple of guys were--I was introduced, "Hey, man, this is going to be like," A couple cats is like, you know, "We don't need nobody else," but even though I'm a non-player, when I looked at all the equipment, man, and we began to play, cats was like, "Yeah" because the sound was big.  They had never had that, but they did--they were very familiar with outstanding keyboard playing because they did most of the records with Donny Hathaway.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I had that--
Speaker 2: So they backed up Donny Hathaway--
Speaker 1: Most of the records--
Speaker 2: --on his recordings?
Speaker 1: Most of the records had the group the Pieces of Peace on it and the filler guys would occasionally would be Phillip [ph.] Church sometimes playing bass.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But most of the early stuff that Donny did most of the sessions, Bernard Reed was the bass player, John Bishop the guitar player.  This is from our band.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then, you know, Louis Satterfield was bass or whatever, but my little playing and my little singing got me embedded in this band, okay.  Then it was a platform for me because now I want to write arrangements and whatever.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sometimes the cats wanted to play, and I'm like "Man, well, I don't want to play this stuff," you know, but once the cats were kind of drugged out, and I got so--simultaneous
Speaker 2: But you began doing the arranging, right?
Speaker 1: --I got so much energy and you know, and then my money is running out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We ain't making money.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So now I'm stuck.
Speaker 2: So what do you do?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I still play music, you know, but I can, I can remember--I'm not a child, a young child, it's like I'm going to take care it, you know.  The snow used to be bad in Chicago, and I'd say, "Hey, I might have to hit somebody today."  Never did, but I was of that mindset because I gotta take care, you know.
Story_ID: 102819
Speaker 1: Now, we had-- we had skipped over--you had met somebody and you had somebody in your life, a lady in your life, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is my high school sweetheart.
Speaker 1: And that relationship continued from high school [Coleman High School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  You want to give us that name?
Speaker 2: Deloris Wright, who was Deloris Hughes.
Speaker 1: Now, you also had a son.
Speaker 2: I had, I had, I had two kids prior too from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanted to bring--I just wanted to get that in.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: And you had a child by Deloris?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that child's name was Edward.
Speaker 2: No.  My first child by Deloris was Benjamin.
Speaker 1: Benjamin, okay, and while we're at it, you had two older children.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You want to give us their names?
Speaker 2: Sharon Smith.
Speaker 1: Sharon Smith, okay.
Speaker 2: And Gregory Smith.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  I did just want to go back and get that.
Story_ID: 102820
Speaker 1: Let's go back up to Chicago [Illinois].  Things are not going as well as you like there in Chicago.  You're experiencing some of those real cold, serious Chicago--
Speaker 2: --yes, and I'm starving.  It's rough.
Speaker 1: Right.  You're begging to wonder if you made the right decision.
Speaker 2: But I was determined to, to stay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Then we got a gig to go to Singapore-to Europe and Singapore--well, prior to that I want to go to, I want to go to the Conservatory.  And I talked to the guys all the time, "Hey, we need to do this, we need to go to school," you know, "yeah, man, yeah" but nobody is making an effort.  So I decided I'm going to school.  I go to the Chicago Conservatory [Chicago Conservatory College in Chicago, Illinois] one Thursday around noon, second week in October.  I think this is 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I finally get the nerve to go into this scary building downtown, in the loop of Chicago.  I go in and I tell the lady, "You know, I want to go to school."  And she said, "This is a music school."  I said, "Yes, ma'am.  You know, I want to go to music school."  She said, "Well, what experiences do you have?"  I told her I played in some bands and that was the funniest thing to her.  She just laughed and laughed, you know.  I was kind of embarrassed because I didn't know what was what.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Basically Chicago Conservatory was really a place where people already had degrees.  So when she got through laughing at me because of my answer, "I'd played in some bands," you know, that's the extent of my music, she asked if I thought I could pass an entrance exam.  I said, "Yes," but I was scared to death, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My thing was "Okay, I'm going to go home and I'm going to study.  I'm going to study, and then I'm going to come back here and take this thing."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She didn't see it that way.  She said, "Come with me."  Took me to the library.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her name by the way?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Don't.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Gave me the test.  The little test that she gave me, I mean I ran through that.  Now, you know I've been studying the Carl Fisher [Music], the Berklee [College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts], the military theory, the whole bit.  I nailed those little things that they were asking about, but there were five things on there that I couldn't answer, and these were songs.  You were to sight sing the notes and name the song--simultaneous
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Like "God Bless America" you know you just sight sing--oh that melody is such and such and such.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I think I named three of them I believe.
Speaker 1: Three out of five.
Speaker 2: But the two, I didn't know the names of, I could sight sing the notes, so I took to her--I went back to her with the paper.  And her immediate thing was "Oh, you decided not to take it."  No, I took it.
Speaker 1: You just finished.
Speaker 2: There are a couple things here that I don't know the names of these--I could hum these to you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She kept looking.  I made 100.  Thursday, second week in October.  Monday morning I was in Chicago Conservatory and everybody knew who I was.
Speaker 1: They had a genius on their hands.
Speaker 2: Well, for me to pass that exam and not have the background of most of the students there, you know, who have gone to this kind of school and da da da and did such and such and such, I had none of that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I had been studying correspondence, and whatever, and gigging, and I had begun to be a little arranger, so, you know, I was up on it, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 102821
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That got me up on school [Chicago Conservatory in Chicago, Illinois], didn't finish there.  We got the gig in Singapore.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you how long did you spend there at the Chicago Conservatory?
Speaker 2: Nine months--well, not at the Chicago but at the Chicago Conservatory.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nine months.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I left Chicago.  I got there in '69 [1969].  I left Chicago in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: So you got the gig.
Speaker 2: We went to Singapore.
Speaker 1: --to go to Singapore.
Speaker 2: Tremendous experience.
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, Singapore was a great place for a lot of the Americans in Vietnam as R&R, Singapore was ideal for most of the cats in the band because they could do all the drugs in the world and have to-- didn't have to answer to anybody, but here--as they call "my bullshit," it was--that part was devastating to me.  Okay.  But I'm still hanging with cats that could play.  These cats could really play,
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's the only thing--simultaneous
Speaker 1: --that's the redeeming part.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, man, the cats be missing gigs.  You'd go to--"Where is so and so?"  Little rickshaw drivers "I know.  I know," and they'd take you to the opium den.  C'mon man.
Speaker 1: You were performing for the soldiers on R&R?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, we were performing for, at that time, the word was "discotheque."  It was like a high-end discotheque, Singapore was becoming westernized.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of U.S. things were moving in.  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kentucky Fried [Chicken] was coming over, you know, that kind of stuff.  But Singapore was fighting young people to remain loyal to their heritage.  They didn't want the kind clothing we were wearing, the whole (unclear) you know.  They don't want that.
Story_ID: 102822
Speaker 1: What was the greatest legacy although that you got from the nine months that you spent at the Chicago Conservatory [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a harmony teacher.  I don't remember her name, I'm sorry, but she used to say, "When you finish my class, you can be walking in the forest and hear something and be able to just jot it down.  That was heavy duty to me, so I really-- I learned some of that.  I learned some of that, but everything was not roses at the school for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of the teachers kind of resented because, I think, of the way I came in.  And I had one teacher, the guy, he was totally against me.
Speaker 1: You could sense it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, because I used to battle him all the time, you know, he'd say something musically and I'd come back and say, "No, that doesn't work."  And I had developed that thing about it doesn't work because you have a situation where a person goes to college, majors in music, graduates, takes a couple of weeks off and comes back to start working on his master's; get his master's; take a little time off; come back to work on his doctorate.  While working on his doctorate, the school hires him; gets his doctorate, boom, he's got a job.  A big time professor--he has never made it work and doesn't have a clue of what we go through.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He's just been in school, school, school, school--been on the bandstand with a lot of cats who might know a lot of music and whatever because we find that out here in the world most of your horn players are like street cats.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of the string players, you know--most of my work is with strings or from the high-end music institutions throughout the world and classical trained and the whole bit, so at the Conservatory, this guy used to say whatever the legitimate thing is--let's say for instance it's a sharp and I might write "a flat," he'd mark me wrong.  I said, "But that's enharmonic.  It's the same note, man.  People can't hear the difference."  He was like, "Well, in my class, da da."  You know, always trying to beat me up and then this is why I come up with a thing, he hasn't made it work.  He doesn't know how to make it work.  I know how to make it work when we had the train wrecks and the whole bit.  You know what I'm saying?  So that stood out, but all in all, it was good.  I wish I could have stayed, but I had to go in the band.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I wanted that part in there though for our audience--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because I think that's extremely important.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 102823
Speaker 1: Well, let me, let me, let me take it further.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, I mean I send my kids to school.  I got six kids in college.  But I always let them know most cases, in a lot of situations, school is not in touch with the marketplace.
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: You know, and in my business, especially from a music standpoint, it's getting better, you know, but they're teaching kids stuff that doesn't exist. Recently, I was in the road, had some cats in the orchestra from [Washington] D.C.  The cats were talking about some software and the whole bit, I was like, "Man, this stuff is fifteen years old.  Whatcha talking about?"  I was able to hip some of the cats, you know, they heard of the stuff, and whatever, some of the stuff I endorsed.  "You really (unclear) my pictures.  Look in the book!"  To bring cats up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the cats was like "Damn, man, we're teaching--"  "That's fifteen years old.  That don't even exist anymore.  Where did you get it from?"  But in their mind, a lot of them haven't had their coats pulled, so they feel like we doing a service.  "No, you ain't doing service."
Speaker 2: If anything a disservice.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then, you know, for what we do musically, they say, "Well, we got to cut."  What's the first thing to cut?  Music Department.  So you got a host of kids out here.  Some are superstars and whatever that can play with computers until they get it how they want, but can't know no music.  No music.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm non-music, but I understand what you're saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I see it in other things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 102824
Speaker 1: But now you are in Singapore.  And you--
Speaker 2: We're out of the country for just about a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a lot of fun, a lot of trails.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And now we're coming back.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The band [Pieces of Peace] is disbanded because we're mad at each other.  "When you get back to Chicago [Illinois], don't call me, man."  Okay, well I didn't have relatives in Chicago, so I'm thinking, hey, man, how am I going to survive?  God had another plan for me because even though we had got disbanded when we got back, my arranging thing began to take off, and in a sense, I became the The Man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You could start that story.
Speaker 2: Well, because of my writing, you know, cats began to trust in me, you know.  We had a reputation of being a session band, so we  are always on the scene, but when we broke up, coming back, you know, certainly I went through a period of no food for a minute, but I began to do a little arranging gigs $200.00 a chart, and they don't put your name on the record, you know.  But it began to build up.  I began to become recognized in Chicago.   So all of sudden, I began getting an abundance of work and one of the cats I was dealing--you know, my good friend, (unclear), probably ran into Berkeley [sp.], Richard Evans.  He was one of my Chicago competitors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was growing.  I was growing, so.  Most of the local stuff, I was doing.  And, like I said, dealing with [Donny] Hathaway thing, having been a copyist and whatever, Donny--the record company found out he could sing, and then he became Joe Superstar, so he left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And supposedly I was the guy to fill that slot, being the local arranger.  Okay.  So things were good.  Things were good for me in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew.  I really grew.
Speaker 1: So we're talking about '71 [1971], '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '71 [1971], '72 [1972], '73 [1973].  I'm growing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the man.
Speaker 1: Your name is spreading.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But just in Chicago?  Or, is it going--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, it's spreading because I'm doing big records now, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not super, super big various record companies.
Speaker 1: Name some of them, sorry.
Speaker 2: Well, most of the record companies, various artists and whatever--Chicago was a decent little hub, okay.  But the industry was moving west.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 102825
Speaker 1: Moving west, in the '70s [1970s], it start moving west.  And I used to come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] you know, I was a music director for the The Dells, and it was my first trip to L.A., and, you know, it was like I loved the scene, but I could never live in L.A.  It's too slow.  Cats would get up--just slow, mind you, I'm from Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Right.  You have to explain that.
Speaker 1: Man, L.A. was slow.  So I mean--
Speaker 2: You have to explain that, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I lived in Chicago, and back east quite a bit, and New York [New York City, New York], and whatever.  I've been through Europe and whatever.  L.A. is slow, man, you know.  Then, all of sudden, I found myself coming out here frequently doing record dates.  You fly in.  You go to a hotel.  They had just built the Hyatt on Sunset [Boulevard] and you stay there.  Then you to go the studio, then back to the hotel, then back to the airport.  Then I found myself having to come out and do some stuff and not be on a record company's P.O.  So it's my stuff.  I said, "Man, you know, that old thing I had been saying I could never live in L.A?"  Well, L.A. was a different vibe.  Back in Chicago and back east, in general, Donny used to say something, "Man, cats are not playing my--" "Man, cats ain't playing my music," and I got to a point, level of arranging that I was saying the same thing, "Cats aren't playing my music."  Okay.  Well, in Chicago, you always find that cats are always trying to get overtime, you know.  Trying to burn you, you know, but when you came to L.A.--like in Chicago, I was a copyist myself, you know, one person, it's cool and whenever you finish, you get it.  The cats lagging and whatever--in L.A., you walked on the session, and the music was on the stands.  And cats were like blowing.  Nobody was trying to get overtime because the cats had too many sessions.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, there was a downbeat at 10.  Hey, man, at 2:00, I got to be at so and so.  And at 6:00, I got to be--so cats are hitting.  They ain't missing, they're blowing, boom, boom, boom.  This is the same place I said I couldn't live because it was too slow, but, on the music scene, it was really happening.  It didn't take me long.  I remember one time I came out here to do a record.  I was supposed to be out here for four days to do a whole album.  I called back to Chicago and I told my wife, "Sell everything.  Sell everything."  She wasn't into that.  Okay.  I didn't know what was happening.  "You must be crazy."
Speaker 2: But you were ready to move west.
Speaker 1: I was ready to move west.  That four days turned into ten days out here.
Story_ID: 673162
Speaker 1: We will begin by slating. My name is [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Today is July 22, 2017.  We are in Sun Valley, California.  And this is a continuation interview with Mr. Benjamin Wright [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], so thank you for allowing us to come back and talk to you some more about your life.  I would love to begin with your being discharged from the service.  And so if you tell me what year was and what happened at, at that point of your discharge.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is real ugly, but it's the truth.  A guy had--an air policeman had banded my car from coming on the yard, the [U.S.] military yard, okay.  We was married, and I lived off base.  And this guy and I had a little physical altercation, and it was a real racial situation, so I promised to kill him.  And it just so happened that the day that I was gonna be sworn out, I drove my car on the military lot.  Certainly he wasn't there at that time.  But by the time that I was sworn out and the whole bit, I guess his shift had kicked in.  So as I was coming out, free at last, it was a hill.  This is, this is Maxwell Air Force Base [Montgomery, Alabama], the backup for the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] too.  Everything's challenged, going in and coming out, secret documents, et cetera.  Had to go down the hill coming out. Down the hill, a guy steps out.  He's a policeman.  He stepped out to challenge my car and look in it, the whole bit.  I was like, yeah, okay.  As he stepped out, I hit it (makes sounds).  I gunned the car.  And he was too far out to go back in, so he had to go forward, over the embankment.  And I was just pissed off because it was--the hill was too steep for my car to follow him, okay (laughter), 'cause I--
Speaker 1: You were that mad?
Speaker 2: --I'd been promising him for two years, I'm gonna kill your ass.  He went down the embankment.  I split.  He knew who I was.  Couple of hours later here come the civilian police.  It's all over.  I know I'm going to jail.  It was two white policemen in Montgomery, Alabama.  And they got me as I was going to the airport, because I had a gig that night.  My career was already going.  Being honest Benjamin, I told them exactly what's happening, and they laughed.  Obviously they had been military guys themselves, and they, they know what--it's crazy situation.  They said, "Hey, man," shook my hand, "welcome to civilian life, be careful."  Said, I knew God was with me.
Speaker 1: In Montgomery, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Montgomery, Alabama.
Story_ID: 673163
Speaker 1: It didn't stop there.  God was always with me, because I had to get a flight to Jacksonville, Florida.  I, I never forget this.  It's a big tour, multiple acts, whole bit.  And I was working with a group called Bob Moore and the Rhythm Aces [Bobby Moore and the Rhythm Aces], which was hot.  Place was filled, Coliseum [Jacksonville Coliseum; Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena, Jacksonville, Florida] filled.  All of a sudden, told everybody to get out, concert's over; haven't even started.  What's going on?  Well, you're down South.  That racial thing is really kicking in.  And I ended up being one of those going to the TV station, being interviewed about the white policemen.
Speaker 2: In Jacksonville, Florida?
Speaker 1: In Jacksonville, Florida.  This is the same day (laughter).
Speaker 2: So this--wait, just so I understand it, you, you leave the base; you, you're free; you get on the plane from--
Speaker 1: Go to Jackson-
Speaker 2: --Montgomery [Alabama] to Jacksonville; you go into this gig with Bob Moore and the Aces, and it doesn't--the gig doesn't happen?
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't happen.  Everybody's there.  All the acts are there, whole bit.  The place is--you can't find a seat.  The place is filled up.
Speaker 2: And how, how big is this place?  How many people are there?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess ten thousand or so.
Speaker 2: And the gig doesn't happen?
Speaker 1: No.  All the acts got their money.  It was the police and the city.
Speaker 2: Who shut it down?
Speaker 1: Shut it down.
Speaker 2: And how did you get to be the per- the voice of this?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  But I guess I was raising so much hell (laughter), 'cause I'm trying to find out--everybody's trying to figure out what's, what's going on.  Nobody had answers.  The, the police just said get out, get out, get out, no black policemen, only white policemen.  You had ten thousand almost nothing but blacks.
Speaker 2: And all of the acts are black, who are--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to perform?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So this is a black event?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And--
Speaker 2: So what do you say?  You're, you're being interviewed.  What do you say?
Speaker 1: Well, the, the, the TV stations came in and the whole bit.  And I'm just voicing what I saw and the whole bit and you know, just it's, it's a real racial situation happening.  And the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] took me out of the back of the TV station, put me in a car, lay down, and I met Bob Moore and the Rhythm Aces bus on the outskirts of town.  Said, "If we don't get you out, you won't make it through the night."  Hello world, this is--
Speaker 2: This is your welcome back to civilian life.
Speaker 1: Welcome back to civilian life.  And it, it, it, it, it's really not much difference because the [U.S.] military was more racist than civilians, you know, even though they say, oh, there's no, you know--please forgive me; I just have to put it on front street.  Various big time generals in the military would say, "Oh, there's no racism in, in the military."  And that was the craziest bullshit I ever heard in my life, you know.  I, I don't have time to build this whole interview around that kind of stuff because it happened from the moment I got there, in terms of that duty station, I got there from day one.  So you know, it was just, just, it was horrible.  And you know, there have been some changes, but we still got it.  You know, I got a grandson and I got a son still in the military.  It's crazy.
Story_ID: 673164
Speaker 1: So you're re-launching your career--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because you had to pause during the time that you were in the [U.S.] military.  Or, or, did you perform in the military?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I performed in the military, gigs downtown, you know.
Speaker 1: In Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Didn't go outside because--
Speaker 1: And you, you described earlier that your, your mother was praying for you not to go to Vietnam [Vietnam War], and you ended up not having to go.
Speaker 2: I got a Vietnam assignment.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know all the parameters or whatever, but when I got that assignment and let my mom know I had that assignment, she went out, because most of my high school [Coleman High School, Greenville, Mississippi], guys, were already dead, because my high school counseling was, "You're mama doesn't have any money.  Your complexion played a very important part.  You can't go to college.  So, you can try to get a job at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] or go to the military."  What? I don't want no damn post office job.  G.I., I can't even imagine me being a G.I.  I want to play music.  No.  So, off to play music and the whole bit, and the, the draft came and hello, nowhere to run, okay.  So when, when my parents [Colonus Miller Wright and Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] called me--because back in the day, you know, you had no cell phones or whatever.  You worked for agencies, per se.  The act I worked for was being booked by Universal Attraction [sic. Universal Attractions Agency] out of New York [New York].  So you had to call New York and try to find out where the act was going to be on certain days.  That's how your parents would find you, okay.  "Son, you need to come home right away."  That was the draft notice.  Half of my class was already dead, half of the class.  And my mom, you--she knew all the kids, whatever, like, funerals every week, man, Vietnam.  "Lord, I don't want my son to go to Vietnam."  So even on her dying bed, with me there holding her hand, not being able to recognize me, would say--she would quote this from the Bible, the Book of Job, which I didn't know at the time, "Though you slay me, yet will I trust in thee [Job 13:15], and Lord, please don't send my son to Vietnam."  So my mother died two days before I was to ship out, so I got a humanitarian deferment by telegram.
Speaker 1: Because she had passed?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And a humanitarian deferment is activated for eighteen months.  The last day of my eighteen months was the day I got sworn out.  So that song that 'Mother Prayed for Me,' hello, I know it works.  But I was one angry G.I.  (Pause) So these are some of the things that has, you know, just, I can't get over.
Story_ID: 673165
Speaker 1: Let's go to your--you know, after that first day.  The day you get out, you--the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] basically saves your life by shuttling you in a car to, to the bus, to the Bob Moore [Bobby Moore and the Rhythm Aces] bus.  Where do you go from there?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we, we went down to the East Coast, you know, to the Carolinas.  You know, they used to have the thing called the, like the Summer Fest [ph.] or something like that.  And--
Speaker 1: So it's summertime?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, you know, I was on the road.  Bob [Bobby Moore] had his own bus, and I was on the road again, man.
Speaker 1: And, and what is your role in the band?
Speaker 2: I was playing organ, playing Hammond organ.  And we didn't have a bass player.  I used the pedals, play bass, so I was a bad cat in the day, you know.
Speaker 1: And you had learned--well, bass is different, but you had learned drums, so you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that whole rhythm--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --understanding.
Speaker 2: I was drummer in, in, in the high school band, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you're, you're traveling with Bob Moore up and down the eastern seaboard.  How long do you stay with him?
Speaker 2: I think I was with Bob less than a year.
Speaker 1: But as you, as you're, as you're traveling with him, are you knowing that this can be your career and that you are gonna be able to make a living doing it?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I knew that's what I wanted to do, yeah.  And you know, Bob was a--it was a very good gig 'cause, you know, he had a couple of hit records, you know.  Mind you, I had been on the road prior to going into the [U.S.] military.  So my first thing on the road was with a guy named Ted Taylor, who at that time headlined over the great James Brown.  At that time, early '65 [1965], James Brown was just singing doo wop, not the funk stuff that people know him for, you know.  Am I--
Speaker 1: That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --telling my age?
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 2: Hello.
Speaker 1: It's good to tell your age.  You had a full life (laughter).  But just to give context because a lot of people don't know, you know, how people start is not always the way they end up.  So he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he started out early in his career doing doo wop.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's all it was (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what was your relationship to James Brown?
Speaker 2: Well, I was just excited because, you know, we were seeing James Brown just grow, radio, okay.  And it got so that you would all be on these tours together, you know.  And being a drummer in high school [Coleman High School, Greenville, Mississippi], James Brown was the first act that I saw that had four drummers; it's like, wow.  So when they set up to rehearse for the sound checks or whatever, I'd be standing right there almost falling over the drums 'cause that was exciting to me.  I'm just a little kid from Mississippi.  Everything was exciting to me, you know, watching what's happening, 'cause being a drummer, you know--drum captain.  Said this guy got four drummers.  So, fuck, okay, that's the captain there, and how do they play together?  What--I'm just fascinated by everything, you know.  And so I say the military interrupted that because I was out there, man.  I was being part of what's happening, and then all of a sudden I was singing with Ted Taylor, opening shows; I'm growing.  Uncle Sam said, "Hey, cut that out; take this rifle" (laughter)--give me a break man, you know.  But that's over.  I'm with Bob Moore and whatever, and, and I'm touring again.
Story_ID: 673166
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're touring, and this is now the early '70s [1970s], right--or late six--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This is sixty--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --is it '69 [1969] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --sixty-nine [1969], '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: This is '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Sixty--yeah, '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: So, just in, in our country, you know, the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] has been assassinated.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] has been assassinated.  Malcolm X--I mean, you know, a lot has happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement has reached its crescendo.  The Black Power movement is kind of taking route.  You're traveling in the South.  What's happening as you're traveling?  What, what is the state of the country, and how are you and the band being received?
Speaker 2: Almost every black person on the road at that time had a piece, had a gun, okay.  You didn't hear too much about musicians being so hassled because musicians fought back.  You know what I'm saying (laughter).  It's like, nobody scared here, you know, but it was bad.  Things were bad, you know.  But ma--
Speaker 1: What does bad mean?
Speaker 2: Well, the racial thing was, was, was horrible.  You know, you, you--there were places that you, you, you couldn't go eat.
Speaker 1: Still?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  I, I, I need to fast forward a little bit because--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was--it started with conducting for Gladys Knight and the Pips.
Speaker 1: Which was when?
Speaker 2: When Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] became president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, we did a gig in Arkansas.  Bill Clinton [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was the governor.  And certainly I didn't know prior to that, but that Gladys and the Pips had stayed away from Arkansas.  Said, "No, we, we're not going to Arkansas."  Well, come to find out, on this particular gig, this was special situation.  And, and Mr. Clinton was to deliver an apology to Gladys Knight and the Pips because some years prior to that, they had played Arkansas and stopped to get some- something to eat, and the troopers wouldn't allow them to eat.  "Get your ass out of here," guided them to the, to the, the, the border, whichever way they were going.  They couldn't eat after the gig.  So they said hey, we'll never, you know, because they grew, whatever.  But this was a special gig, and the governor of Arkansas at that time, Mr. Bill Clinton, came forth in a ceremonial type situation on the stage and gave this apology for his state, you know. Crazy, man.
Speaker 1: How did--how were you affected by that?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't affect me, you know.  It's like it was not unique.  It happened to a lot of people.  You know, you, you, you, you, you get through playing, man, you know, you got to eat.  You're starving.  So you know, you, you pull up at a joint and you, you know, it, it's, it's that not that we accept it, whatever, but you know, you've got to go to the back, get the food.  You just gotta eat, you know.  So, like I say, you, you didn't accept it, but you got to eat.
Story_ID: 673167
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] then?
Speaker 2: Nothing (laughter).  It's like, Bill who?  (Laughter) But I do have a Bill Clinton story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, you, you ready for my story?
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Years later we played the White House [Washington, D.C.].  He's president.  So we finished playing--and, and I didn't have braids then.  My hair was very long.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, my hair was very long, okay.  I could reach back and touch my hair, you know.  So when we finished playing, the hair, my hair is all over my head, whatever.  And you know, you line up in the Green Room, whatever, to shake hands with the president.  So, the president is coming down the line.  And he gets to me, he says, "Man, your hair look like Ben Franklin [Benjamin Franklin]," 'cause Ben Franklin had hair--you know, whatever.  And everybody was just cracking up, was like, wow, man, he, he, he got Benjamin.  So I just refused to be outdone.  And this was prior to Ms. Lewinsky [Monica Lewinsky].  So I grabbed his tie.  I say, "For a president, you can't do better than this, man?"  (Laughter) And, and the whole line froze, like, "Oh, my god," I know he didn't do that.  And the president laughed his butt off, you know--"You all right, Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], you all right."  He said, "Walk with me."  He took me to the Ben Franklin picture in the White House--and we began to talk, found out I was from Greenville, Mississippi.  Well, he's right across the bridge.  And during the time that I was in Greenville, he was, he was trying to be a musician.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We knew some of the same joints, 'cause we were trying to sneak in (laughter).  You know what I'm saying?  So we hit it off very good, you know.
Speaker 2: That's a great story.
Story_ID: 673168
Speaker 1: All right, I'm going back.  In, in sixty--well, you said you, you stayed for how long with Bob Moore [Bobby Moore and the Rhythm Aces]?
Speaker 2: Less than a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and where did you go after that?
Speaker 2: Well, one day I got, I got a telegram.  I didn't have a phone.  And the telegram says, "[HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright, my name is Skip McQuinn, and I have a band.  And I heard that you were a bad MF.  And I wish to come and talk to you."  And it had the date on it and the whole bit.  So that date, you know, I hung around to see who is this cat.
Speaker 1: And where were you loc--
Speaker 2: Montgomery, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're home base was Montgomery, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where Bob Moore was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay.  So--say about two o'clock, boom, two o'clock, this car pulls up.  Here comes this tall, lanky white cat.  "Benjamin Wright?"  "Yeah."  "I'm Skip McQuinn, man."  (Laughter) "Okay."  Mind you, me and white folks ain't got along too good, okay.  "Man, I heard that you, you--," down south people don't say M-A-N.  They say M-A-I-N (laughter).  "Main, da, da, da, dun, you, you bad so and so and so, man, you, you, you know, I came to talk to you playing, playing with me and the whole bit."  I'm just listening.  You got to the pay.  Well, wait a minute.  This is a nobody.  I'm playing with a star, but this cat is paying twice what I'm making with the star.  It was a no brainer (laughter).  I'm out.  So I move to Columbus, Georgia, that day--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --to my buddy.  And that's what we became, buddies, 'til he passed away a couple of years ago--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Skip McQuinn?
Speaker 2: Skip McQuinn.  And that's who--he and I were playing with the mob together.  We, we were the mob boys.
Speaker 1: So that's why it was so much more money.
Speaker 2: Well, not at, not at that moment, because he lived in Columbus, Georgia, and he played for a nightclub.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So it's nightclub money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was double what I was making.  We got along fine, and then we became friends.  We actually became friends.  We became like brothers.
Speaker 1: Let's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was good for me.
Story_ID: 673169
Speaker 1: You describe (coughs) Steve McQuinn [sic.], and you mentioned the mob.  Tell me, tell me about working with the mob.  How did that happen, and how did that work?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, well, Skip [Skip McQuinn] and I generated a lot of business; club was full.  You know, I'd be like the fire marshal had to be there every night, okay.  And the word was getting around the, the, the East Coast.  It's like it was a trio.  I'm playing organ, and pedals, we had a guitarist, black cat playing guitar, and Skip, white cat, playing drums.  The Downtowner Motor Inn [ph.] was coming into being, and they were trying to emulate Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inn was creating lounges, where they had bands, entertainment.  So we got this, this thing to come to Charlotte, North Carolina, play for Downtown Motor Inn.  It's a good gig.  There in Charlotte we met a bunch of race drivers.  That's where all the race drivers are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we went to work for this race driver after our gig at the Downtowner Inn.  We had an hour.  We'd move our stuff in, we'd play all night long 'til daylight.  We making money.  But there was another group of people who strong armed everybody, and they needed to fill their club the way we were filling up the race drivers' club.  That was the mob.  (Laughter) So it was like a no brainer, say, "Yeah, you gonna work over here," and, and we did; we did.  We still had our Downtowner Motor Inn, and at midnight we hit with the Colombo family's club.  Now, I have to be very careful what I say here because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --this was, this was the most corrupt club situation I'd ever seen in my life, you know, 'cause they were filming pornography and you, you name it.  Whatever you can name, that's what they did.
Speaker 1: At this club?
Speaker 2: At this club (laughter), wow.  And you know what?  We always had the first invitation.  Hey, yet--no, no.  I used to tell Skip, "Hey, man I'm gonna to be somebody one day.  I don't need this" (laughter), you know.  But that's, that's how we ended up playing for the Colombo family.  And like I say, that was very good.  There used to be fights every night in the club, big--like, big bar room fights like, like--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: --like you're watching TV.
Speaker 1: The drinking too much?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the drinking.  You, you, you--Charlotte was, was, was big ra- big time race drivers and big time hockey.  Oh my god, it's, it's a fight before--
Speaker 1: Testosterone.
Speaker 2: --before you even start it's a fight--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --every night, but nobody laid hands on Skip or me.  We were protected, you know, and that was the good thing about the mob.  You were pro- you with us, so.  Things were good.
Story_ID: 673170
Speaker 1: And what kind of music were you playing?
Speaker 2: Mainly R and B [rhythm and blues] stuff.  Skip [Skip McQuinn], you know, Skip was a white cat, and he didn't like white music (laughter).  He wanted to play Wilson Pickett.  And I got tired of playing Wilson Pickett, okay, because Skip didn't read; the guitar player didn't read; and I'm studying, man.  I'm, I'm studying every night.  Any time I get a break I'm studying.  My study was the Berklee School of Music [Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts], which at that time was a correspondence school.  Berklee didn't have a campus then, okay.  It was a new school, and I'm studying.  So I, I, I want to, I want to write scores and stuff, man.
Speaker 1: You knew that's what you wanted to do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I finally couldn't take it anymore.
Speaker 1: How long then?
Speaker 2: We into '70 [1970] now.
Speaker 1: And do you have a family at this point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're solo.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You had children, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had two kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they weren't living with you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  So I say, "Skip, I got to get out of here, man.  I'm leaving, man."  I had a buddy in Chicago [Illinois] from Greenville, Mississippi, actually, Ike Turner's little brother-in-law.  Ike is a big--Ike and Tina [Tina Turner], that thing.  Cat say, "B [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], you ought to come to Chicago, man.  We recording.  We doing this and we doing that."  And that's exactly what I wanted to do, so I left the money to go starve to death (laughter), 'cause that's exactly what happened.  They were doing this and that and the other.  But see, I didn't understand the money situation, because everybody in the band was drugged out.
Speaker 1: In Chicago?
Speaker 2: In Chicago.
Story_ID: 673171
Speaker 1: So talk about that, because this is now the, this is the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are the drugs of choice at that time?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They weren't offering it to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--okay, you can write this part in red.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm seventy-one years old.  I never been high in my life.  I've never drank.  I've never smoked.  I can't even comprehend.  But I've been with the grandest druggies in the world, those who--those with Trump-type [President Donald John Trump] money who can buy any--whatever.  But I've, I, I haven't been influenced by that.  I just want to do music.
Speaker 1: Why do you think you weren't attracted at all to any of it?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the reasons is that when I, when I got the first road gig, my father [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.], who was a Sunday school superintendent, who didn't know anything about stars on the radio, whatever, clubs or whatever.  No, no, no, my, my folks didn't know none of that.  In fact, they would always say, "This music that you're playing is not of the Lord."  Okay, so that's how I came up, you know.  So when I got the, the, the gig with Ted Taylor, he says, "Whoever Mr. Taylor is, he's gonna have to come over here and talk to me."  Dad, ain't nobody--ain't no star gonna come over here in the hood (laughter), you know.  But Mr. Taylor understood, and he came to talk to my dad.  And when he came, his whole little entourage and the whole bit and people were looking in the windows and whatever.  My dad didn't understand that.  But in terms of my dad interviewing this guy, it's like, "Okay, now, Mr. Taylor, what happens when he's not performing?  What, what, what, what does he do then?"  And Mr. Taylor said, "Well, sir, we have a road manager."  "What's a road manager?"  He explained that so and so, said, "He's gonna have to look after him," and da, da, da, da, da.  The road manager was my worst nightmare.  He didn't let me hang with no girls or nothing.  I couldn't get my hair fried like everybody else, whatever, the gig is over.  He didn't have any tact.  "Little Benjamin, get over here."  It's like, "Man, I'm, I'm grown now.  I'm on the road."  "Get your butt over here."  He didn't let me do anything.  I thank him.
Speaker 1: Your father put the fear of God in him too.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I thank him.  I could break down and start crying, because everybody around me were consumed.  And it's like I was functioning with a shield around me.  So I never even wanted--even to this day.  I just want money (laughter).  You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Well, and then so you're in Chicago [Illinois].  You're with your friend's band.  You see them getting high.  Is it while they're performing, after they're performing?  What--is, is it just--
Speaker 2: It was never while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But they were just drugged out, man.  But we were the best band in town.  Now there was another band that had Maurice White in it, 'cause Maurice was a superstar, first call recording drummer out of the Chess Record [sic. Chess Records] school.  And I came pretty much behind Maurice, okay, in, in terms of recording and whatever.  So, being with this band, and we were the recording band--
Speaker 1: And what--did you have a name?  What was your band called?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The band was called the Pieces of Peace.
Speaker 1: P-I-E-C-E-S of--
Speaker 2: P-E-A-C-E.
Speaker 1: P-E-A-C-E.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: And this is R and B [rhythm and blues]?
Speaker 2: Music.
Speaker 1: Music.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you writing music at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes, and nobody wanted to play it (laughter).  "Man, he always writing some shit, man.  You know, why don't you come over here and get high?"  I had these things in my head.  I'd write them down and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So how did you navigate that?  You see all these people getting high.  You know, when you perform it's great, but then otherwise they're not into what you're doing.
Speaker 2: I didn't participate--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What do you?  Well, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I love girls; man, did I love girls, but, you know, that was it.  You know, gig is over, I, I got to go write music, and, and that's where I was.  You know, I was, I was just a big bore.  I, I want to write music.
Story_ID: 673172
Speaker 1: When was the first time that you got your music to someone where you were able to make that music?
Speaker 2: Well, here's the thing: You know, I did all of this studying with--from the Berklee School of Music [Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts].  I never heard anything.  You know, they didn't have many whatever.  You know, you did your assignments and you mailed them in, and then they would mail the results back to you.  I always made 100 [percent], but I never heard anything.  Whatever I was writing I didn't hear, okay.  And then one of the things that always messed me up is, like, for the strings, the violins, the violas, the cellies.  We understood that violins and the clef [treble clef], the cellos and the contrabass, the clef [bass clef], but the violas have a different clef [alto clef] that I'd never seen before.  We didn't have that in high school [Coleman High School, Greenville, Mississippi].  We didn't have violas in the, in the marching band.  So I was pretty strong on everything but the violas.  That scared me, but I always made 100.  And it was in Chicago [Illinois] that I got the first opportunity to do a recording session, my music, okay, while I was writing for somebody.  And that, that guy was name is Syl Johnson.
Speaker 1: S-Y-L?
Speaker 2: Yes, Syl Johnson.  And Syl had a big hit back in the day called 'Is It Because I'm Black?'  And the young rappers, or whatever, are still sampling his stuff, okay.  So here it is Syl gave me this opportunity to use strings.  It was like I so excited, my god.  But when we got to the studio, it hit me about what about these violas?  Oh, my god, Lord, please.  And they ran the music down--oh, I'm sorry.  They ran the music down.  Hm, sounds right, so immediately I formed an attitude, like, yeah, I got this, no problem, piece of cake.  And that's how it's been ever since (laughter).  God blessed me to learn how to write for violas.  But that was something I was afraid of.
Speaker 1: Well, and just writing for strings--you, you were a drummer, timpanist, and then pianist, organist.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did the--where did the inspiration come from to, to compose for string?
Speaker 2: It, it--I don't think it was inspiration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was God's divine plan, okay.  That's, that's how I see it.  Because even being in Mississippi, you hear something on the radio and it's a hit record, but for me, it's like, the drums should have been playing something else.  And the bass player should have gone here, and the trumpets, I don't like what they--"Hey, man, it's a hit record." But I don't like it.  I'm hearing something else.  I didn't understand that possibly I was honing my craft, 'cause I heard a different way.  So everything that I heard, regardless of how successful it was, it wasn't the way I wanted it to be.  So God gave me a chance to write what's in my head.  And, please forgive me, but praise God.  That's how I'm still standing, because the record industry have accepted how I hear it.  When an assignment comes in--I got Jamal [ph.] here.  He, he sent me something yesterday, some--and--(unclear)--in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  "We want, we want Mr. Wright [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright] to do strings," whatever.  They don't tell me what to write.  They just want Mr. Wright to do it.  Why?  Because obviously they like how I think.  The record company send stuff, they don't tell me what to write.  They halfway like how I think.  So it's, it's, it's just whatever is in my head.
Story_ID: 673173
Speaker 1: So going from that first recording with Syl Johnson that was successful--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what doors does that open for you?
Speaker 2: It opened all the local doors in Chicago [Illinois] (laughter), okay.
Speaker 1: And Chicago is a big market.
Speaker 2: Oh, Chicago was the hub--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --okay, at that particular time.  We have some met--I had some major competitors there.  There's a name Charles Stephanie [sic.], who was--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Stepney [Charles Stepney].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the--
Speaker 1: --Stepney, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Earth, Wind and Fire stuff--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis stuff, the whatever, and Stepney was the man that wrote the classic stuff and the whole bit.  I was a copyist for him.
Speaker 1: And what is a copyist?  What is that?
Speaker 2: A copyist is when the arranger does a score, the copyist takes the individual parts off the score for the individual players, okay.  You can't give the score to the violin player.  He just need to see--
Speaker 1: You have to give the violin section.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he just needs to see his part, okay.  And it's, it's a little more intense than that because a lot of arrangers would write in, in what's called concert, so that's via the piano.  But wa- well you got--you're, you're writing for a whole orchestra.  So the, the piano is a C instrument, but the trumpets is a D--is a B-flat instrument.  So if you play C on the piano, to make that same note, the trumpets has to play a D.  Well, if it's an E-flat instruments like a bari [baritone] sax or alto saxophone, that's an E-flat instrument.  So to play that same C, that instrument has to play an A.  So for the French horns, that's an F instrument.  So to make that same C, they have to play a G, boom, so--I'm, I'm--
Speaker 1: So you know this?
Speaker 2: --I'm showing off.  As a conductor, I have to stand up there on the podium and talk to each individual in their language because every, every instrument has to be transposed, okay.
Speaker 1: And does the composer always know that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The composer makes the music usually with the piano.
Speaker 2: And, and, and, and send it to a copyist who knows that.
Speaker 1: Who breaks it all down.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: Did you learn this through Berklee [Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause I, I, I didn't have that in high school [Coleman High School, Greenville, Mississippi]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --okay.  But I'm, I'm the arranger today.  I don't have to copy for anybody anymore, okay.
Speaker 1: But then--let's stick--let's stay back then.  When you're, you know, back when you're in Chicago [Illinois] and you're being the copyist, this--you're, you're breaking out each of the parts.  So does this become a source of livelihood for you to be--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so who are you working with, being a--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a copyist?
Speaker 2: Mr. Stepney, Charles, okay; Mr. Donny Hathaway.  Donny Hathaway was an outstanding arranger.  Most people didn't know that 'cause they know his singing; Richard Evans, bad cat; a couple of other cats in Chicago, you know.  And after I did the thing for Syl Johnson as an arranger and Chicago was a hub, then all of the, the low people was calling on me.  I was affordable, okay (laughter).  There were many, many, many jobs where I, I don't need the two hundred dollars in arrangement.  I need my name on the record, okay.  That was more important.
Speaker 1: In the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.  Now, you can keep my name off the record; I need fifteen thousand dollars.  You know what I'm saying (laughter)?  So it has grown considerably over the years.
Story_ID: 673174
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But in those early days, as you are building your name, says--as you pointed--you know, it's the trade off: If you put my name on it, then--you, you can't afford it, put my name on it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What strategy are you using to--because you've gone from making a lot of money; now you're in the hub.  You're not making a lot of money, but you're building.  So do you have a strategy for that, 'cause you, you've described copyist--
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I didn't, I, I didn't.  And, and, and, and here's the thing where now I have a manager.  After nine thousand years, I have a manager.  I've been able to function in this business all of these years without representation because--
Speaker 1: So you didn't get a manager--
Speaker 2: Until a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two years ago, okay, because my work was my calling card, okay.  Now, Jamal [ph.], who used to be running through the house as I'm trying to, to write music, kids spinning on their heads and whatever, gets on my back about the publishing of this and publish--my mine wasn't there.  I wanted to just write the music, and I had began to command a decent salary.  And that's where my head was, didn't understand that I could have copy written most of my arrangements, no, but didn't understand that.
Speaker 1: You didn't do that?
Speaker 2: No, didn't know, just didn't know.  Now, the little white kids that come along knew.  They couldn't write like me, but they knew the business side.  Now today, I'm pretty hip on the business side.  I got an attitude, you know.  And one of the things that I would always tell Jamal wherever he stopped at this various record companies--he, he, he's gonna smile.  I can't see his face.  But I always say, "Learn, learn, learn, learn."  That's all I got to say to him, learn.  "Mr. Wright [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], I don't like being--they give me too much work--." "Learn, learn, learn, learn."  And we've had to sue some people recently and the whole bit, some super named people, because I say, "Learn, learn, learn, learn."  He's a sharp cat today.
Story_ID: 673175
Speaker 1: Going back to those early days when you're in Chicago [Illinois].  You worked with a lot of different artists.  What did you do for Jackie Wilson, The Chi-Lites, [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler, Curtis Mayfield?  Were you being a copyist for them, or you--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jackie Wilson, the band, the Pieces of Peace--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we, we, we went on the road with Jackie.  Mr., Mr. Jerry Butler, who I love, you know--have you guys interviewed Jerry?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: But Jerry was--you know, it was Jerry Butler and The Impressions before it was Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions.  And Jerry went on to be the first black to have a--be a distributorship.  We're talking about '60s [1960s].  Jerry got all the money in the world.  And in terms of him being the commissioner of Chicago, that was not a complementary position; that was the truth, you know, boom.  But, but--
Speaker 1: What did you do with him?
Speaker 2: With--I worked on a lot of his stuff as, as, as a musician, okay.  Most of these cats, we did sessions for, okay.
Speaker 1: With Pieces of Peace?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And The Dells?
Speaker 2: I was their music director.
Speaker 1: So when did you become a music director?  How did, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened is that the Pieces of the Peace--the Pieces of Peace and I decided that we are so good for everybody, we, we made stars out of people, and we wanted to be stars ourselves.  But we were not good for ourselves, okay.  One of the reasons why, 'cause everybody was drugged out, okay.  So we figured that if we, if we would go to Europe and the whole bit, we would come back we would be heavy.  Well, that was the worst thing that ever happened to us 'cause we fell out, okay.  When we got--after being gone a year, so we come back to America--"Hey, man, when we get back to Chicago don't call me."  "Don't call me either, man--."  So wait a minute.
Speaker 1: The three of you?  No--
Speaker 2: No, it, it was, it was--we had seven, seven cats in the band.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's like, what about me?  'Cause I don't live in Chicago; I, I don't have relatives stay--what am I gonna do?  You know, you guys have been my whole life.  What--God had a plan for me; came back, got into writing.  Everybody wanted me to write.  Pockets began to look like footballs.  And I used to hire all of the cats in the Pieces of Peace to play on the recording sessions, okay, each one of them.  I'm going.  Then a guy say, "Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], man, you're writing all these chart--(unclear)--you ought to put a big band together."  I never thought of that.  Say, "Hey, man, you know, why don't you make you some stands and the whole bit and--." "Wow, that's interesting."  So I did that.
Story_ID: 673176
Speaker 1: So you had an opportunity to put a big band together and hadn't thought about that before.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What, what was the band?
Speaker 2: The Benjamin Wright Orchestra.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: Ah, man, this is I think '72 [1972], '73 [1973], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: So this is, then, after you--you, you went to the Chicago conservatory of music [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that on, then on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is different from Berklee [Berklee School of Music; Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts].  You're, you're there.  Do you perform this while you're there or after?
Speaker 2: Along with the Pieces of Peace.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and you know, we--like I said, we were the number one session band in Chicago [Illinois].  So my thing was, "Guys, we ought to go to school."  And it's just like, "Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], you talking to some super hoodlums, drugged out hoodlums."  They ain't gonna go to school.  You just looking out for yourself.  I wanted to go to school.  I wanted to go to school.  I'm a raging whatever.  I'm doing little jobs and whatever.  I want to hone my craft.  They all agreed, yes, okay, but nobody ever showed up.
Speaker 1: You're the only one that went?
Speaker 2: I was the only one that showed up.  I, I got a quick story on that.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Okay, I go to the Chicago conservatory on Thursday.  Second week in October, cold as hell in Chicago, didn't have a car.  I go in and tell the lady, "I want to go to school here."  She said, "Well, this is a music school."  I said, "Yes, ma'am, I, I know."  Said, "Well, what, what are your experiences?"  "Well, I've played in a lot of bands."  And she just laughed her ass off.  That was the funniest thing I think she's, she's ever heard in her life.  And you know, I don't understand the laughter, 'cause I'm just telling the truth.  So she finally stopped laughing and asked, "Do you think you could pass an entrance exam?"  Well, reality is setting in now.  I got kind of frightened, but I said, "Well, I've, I've come this far, so yeah, I'll take it."  So my thinking was, okay, I'm gonna go home; I'm gonna study this weekend; and I'm gonna come back and take that exam.  The lady said, "Follow me."  So she took me a library section and gave me the test.  It's like, oh my god, Lord.  God just calmed me down.  I took the exam.  Finished it obviously in record time because I, I went and took it back to her, and the things that came out of her mouth was, "Oh, you decided not to take it."  I said, "No, no, no, I, I took it."  "Really?"  I said, "Yes, but you, you got something here I don't understand."  There were four songs there that you were to sight-sing these songs and name whatever the song was, like maybe, (singing) "My country tears of the," da, da, da, da, da, da; read that melody and name the song.  Well, I could sight-sing the notes, but I didn't know the name of the songs.  So I explained to her, "I can, I can, I can read this to you, but I don't know the name of the song."  She said, "Okay, go on."  First song I gave myself a count (claps hands), and I started reading it; did the second one; number three she said, "That's all right."  I made 100 [percent] on the entrance exam Thursday afternoon.  I start school Monday.  Monday morning when I showed up at the Chicago conservatory everybody in the school knew who I was.  Tell me God can't fix it.
Story_ID: 673177
Speaker 1: And so what, what were the key things that you learned there that you've been able to use in your career?
Speaker 2: Jealous people (laughter).  There were a couple of instructors there that were excited.  I remember--I don't remember the names, but there was a young lady--older lady, very short, who said, "When you finish my class, you can be walking in the forest and something come to your head and you can get--you can write it down on leaves when you finish this class."  I loved that.  But then there was another class I went to, a young guy who I think he just hated me, because we'd do certain things and I'll write it out, and he'll mark my paper wrong.  It was like, "Well, well, what's, what's happening?"  Well, it, it, it, it's, it's a technicality.  See, the song is in the key of B-flat.  Well, I might have a C-sharp in there.  There are no sharps in a flat key.  But there's another word called inharmonic, so the C-sharp is a D-flat.  It's the same note but with a different name.  He says, "Hey, it's wrong."  Okay, all right, he's pissed off 'cause my stuff is right.  Okay, when you hear something, you don't hear if it's a C-sharp or a D-flat or whatever.  You just hear the correct note, okay.  Yes, this little asshole, I don't want to be in that class, okay, you know.  Because see, what, what's happening is this, you got kids who major in music get a B.S., take a summer off, come back and get in the master's program, master's program, get the master's [degree], come back for the doctor's [doctorate] program.  And before they finish the doctor program they're offered a job.  They become doctor So and So and So and So.  Now what's wrong with this picture?  They have never been in the field.  They've just been in school.  So in terms of catastrophes that happen on stage and the whole bit, doesn't have a clue, don't know nothing.  Those of us who have been in the field, those of us who've got--sixty, seventy-piece orchestra, and the singer gets happy, it goes to the wrong place (laughter), and you've got seventy people here, what do you do?  Because the singer is never wrong, not on stage.  You know what I'm saying?  So, hey, you, you doctor so and so and so and so who never had your butt in the field, never had your butt in one of these smoky nightclub and the whole bit, you don't know how to fix anything.  You know, and, and, and, and the guys who, who, who play these jobs and whatever, and they got beer all over them and they smoking, they know music like you can't believe, you know.
Speaker 1: So in school you have theory.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You've got the practical, the hands on experience.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are you extracting out of the academic experience that you are bringing into your practical experience?
Speaker 2: Well, no academics at, at, at the Chicago conservatory [American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Illinois].  You, you, you, you had to go to Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] for academic stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You just got music--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --at the Chicago conservatory, okay.  So I didn't go to Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: I used the wrong word.  The--what you're learning--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the music that you're learning, the--as, as you were just describing, the Ph.Ds. don't have the experience--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but they have the learning.  So what were--you're learning, what--
Speaker 2: I learned--
Speaker 1: --how are you applying what you're learning to--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --improve your--
Speaker 2: Even for the teacher that I hated and he hated me--I think he hated me because I made a hundred on the, on that exam, okay.  But I did learn some of the technicalities that he was talking about.  I give him no credit, none whatsoever.  If you weren't a lady I'd used some words.  To hell with him, okay.  But it was good for me because that's why I wanted to go to school, okay.  So I did take some things away.  But the Pieces of Peace decided that we were gonna go to Europe, and that's when I left school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't finish that program?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 673178
Speaker 1: When you and the Pieces of Peace go to Europe, is this your first time traveling outside of the country?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  (Pause) I'm, I'm guess at this--I, I think I'd been out of the country before but just a quickie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We left to be gone for a year.
Speaker 1: All right.  You, you toured Europe and--
Speaker 2: And, and the Far East.
Speaker 1: --and the Far East for a year.  So what is this experience like?  You had, you know, you talked about touring the South on the eastern seaboard.  What is it like touring in Europe and the Far East?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we had a gig, we had a gig, you know, in our stops.  We, we, we, we played in hotels, okay.  And it was, it, it was, it was, it was a dream life.  You had nothing to do but play music, eat, and for me, I sent money home, and I gave the rest of the money to the tailor.  I had custom clothes made every day (laughter), shoes, custom everything.  You know, I was sharp, man (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this is '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --seventy [1970], '71 [1971], somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Did, did the Pieces of Peace have a look?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'll have to find a picture for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was the cutest one (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where did you, where did you go?  Where did you tour?  What countries?
Speaker 2: We, we, we started off going to London [England], and we migrated to Singapore.  That was our hub, Singapore and--Singapore, like Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia.  Those, those were mainly the places, you know.  We had a lot of fun, had a lot of fun, met a lot of people.
Speaker 1: And how were you received?  Did you, did you have any racially challenging experiences in, in that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --tour?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Mind you, we were not in America (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, you know, there're some subliminal stuff that happens, curiosity, whatever, but everything was well.
Speaker 1: Who organized the tour?  Was there a manager, tour manager?
Speaker 2: No.  We were too hip for a manager (laughter).
Speaker 1: So how did you get the gigs?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember what the initial contact was.  But I think our bass player, Bernard Reed, got the contract.  And like I say, we were too hip for a manager.  You know, we managed ourselves.  We, we, we just knew everything about the business.  We didn't know nothing (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you were making money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were not manageable, okay, no (laughter).  That, that would have been good for us, you know.  But it got--placed a few cats in, in, in, in our pathway, okay.  Like, in Singapore, we had a cat named Edmund Chen, Chinese cat, and he fell in love with the band.  And then if he showed up today--like, generally through the years, he would come to America, and I think my house is the only house that he's ever visited, you know.  He would come here, and we'd give him a car.  He's got all the money in the world.  He likes to go to Disneyland [Anaheim, California].  "Hey, man, I ain't going to no damn Disneyland" (laughter).  "Here's the car, goodbye."  And he stays here, whatever.  So we still have a relationship, okay, good guy.
Story_ID: 673179
Speaker 1: So you're, you're touring for a year.  Does--how does it end?
Speaker 2: Horrible, 'cause we fell out.  We didn't like each other anymore.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we had a young drummer.  You know, the, the original Pieces of Peace drummer was a guy named Fred White, who was the brother of Maurice White, Little Fred.  Fred was fifteen years old.  And I was the one who had the charisma to be able to go talk to Dr. and Mrs. White for Fred to make the gigs, especially when we'd back up Jackie Wilson or people like that.  So we used to do all of the tracks for Donny Hathaway, and Donny wanted this band.  And you know, we used to talk about Donny bad.  We loved him, the little short, fat MF.  We, we, no, we, we ain't nobody's band.  We're us, and we, we were the worst thing in the world for us, but we were good players, okay.
Speaker 1: And did Fred go on the tour with you?
Speaker 2: No.  Fred, Fred--
Speaker 1: He was too young.
Speaker 2: --Fred went with Donny Hathaway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Donny pulled the weakest link, 'cause Donny wanted the whole bad.  Donny pulled the weakest link.  So we, we hired another young cat.  We took off.  And, and things got--you know, living without your families, without home and the whole bit, collectively speaking, we just couldn't handle it, you know.  The music was good, but that was about it, you know.
Story_ID: 673180
Speaker 1: So you come home (coughs) and soon after you form your orchestra [Benjamin Wright Orchestra], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who's in your orchestra?  Are you, you picking any--well, you said that you used--
Speaker 2: The Pieces of Peace--(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: --guys from Pieces of Peace--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for different recording sessions.  But who's in your orchestra?
Speaker 2: The same, same--
Speaker 1: Same people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and--
Speaker 1: So you bring them back in but just not as the same group.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because then--and you know, every- everybody said as we were departing, coming home, "When we get back to Chicago [Illinois] don't call me."  "Don't call me."  "Don't call me."  They were welcomed my calls because I had money.  You know, I was paying.  But you know, we put the band together and some, some more young cats, and then we had a couple of guys who were very noted guys, Louis Satterfield who played with Earth, Wind and Fire and Don Murray.  You know, you hear Don Murray--Maurice [Maurice White] acknowledges him on solo, okay.  And these were older cats.  But the band was comprised of cats who, who did the recording sessions, so it was good.
Speaker 1: And you became the house band for High Chaparral [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what, so what is High Chaparral at that time?
Speaker 2: The High Chaparral was a big nightclub.  I say big because it, it, it, it, it, it sat fifteen hundred people.  That's a pretty big--
Speaker 1: That's big.
Speaker 2: --club.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then I was growing on the so called political scene.
Speaker 1: On the political scene?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because when acts would come through Chicago, the disc jockeys would--I was one of the persons they would call.  "Hey, man, So and So and So is coming through, man.  We need three thousand [dollars] from you, man."  No problem.  I'm half rolling (makes sounds) okay.  (Unclear) would return 100 percent next act, you know, acts like Leslie Uggams would come through and the whole bit, so I was growing.  So big acts would come to town, it's like [HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright, put the orchestra together.  (Unclear)--so I'm growing; I'm growing; I'm making money, talking smack, you know.  So, some of the, the elite musicians of Chicago were playing with me.
Speaker 1: And you're primarily playing at High Chaparral?
Speaker 2: That was the main place, you know.  I used to do the Playboy Club in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Talk about that.
Speaker 2: It, it--that was not an exciting gig (laughter).
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you, you, you, you think about--you say Playboy Club, so Bunnies [Playboy Bunnies]--it was not fun.  You know, it was Hugh Hefner's toy, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a showcase for the band.
Speaker 2: No.  It was just a gig, you know.
Speaker 1: Because so many people wonder what was it like going to the Playboy Club?
Speaker 2: We were not playboys.  It was like, "Hey, man, where is our check?" (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Did it pay well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a, it was a good gig, you know.  We were, we were the top band in town.
Speaker 1: And this is early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673181
Speaker 1: In 1975 you moved to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  What--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 2: --seventy-five [1975], '76 [1976], yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You're the top band in Chicago [Illinois].  Things are going well.  You're making money.  All the big acts are coming through.  You got the political thing going.  Why move?
Speaker 2: Okay, first of all, I was growing as an arranger, okay.  And being such, I would have to come to L.A. to do recording sessions.  My thing was I could never live in L.A.  It's too slow.  You know, I, I've, I've pretty much grown up on that East Coast thing, New York [New York].  Chicago is like move, go, hey, hey, come on.  L.A., cats didn't wake up 'til three o'clock in the evening.  You know, it was just a whole 'nother world.  But they had something else happening.  The musicianship was off the chain.  The players was just unbelievable.  Chicago, New York, whatever, cats stumble, and you wonder why.  And you finally begin to learn that they're trying to extend time to get overtime; whereas in L.A., they don't have time for overtime because--
Speaker 1: In Chicago?
Speaker 2: In L.A.
Speaker 1: Really?  Okay.
Speaker 2: In L.A.  Chicago is like, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, they--oh, you're say--oh, okay, I understand.  So they, they want to work longer, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They're trying to get--
Speaker 1: I get it.
Speaker 2: --they're trying to still two dollars.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: In L.A., cats say, "Okay, here, man, I'm at Capitol [Capitol Records] at ten a.m.  Guys, come on, man, let's hit, man, 'cause at one o'clock I'm over at A and M [A and M Records], okay.  Five p.m., I'm at CBS, man."  Da--so the L.A. cats, it's like expertise.  They blow the notes off the paper.  Go back East--
Speaker 1: I see--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --cats are struggling.  You know, the best in the world comes to L.A.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 673182
Speaker 1: So you, what, what brings you?  Are you invited to come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or--
Speaker 2: I was--all of a sudden I was getting a lot of jobs to, to come to L.A.  You know, back in the day you could do an album three days.  Just come in with the charts and cats blow them, you know.
Speaker 1: And you are being invited to arrange, be musical director--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what, what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, arrange--
Speaker 1: Both?
Speaker 2: --arrange music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And generally, in those type of situations, you're coming on the record company's PO [ph.].  Then all of a sudden I found myself having to come out here, and I was the PO, like, hey, wait a minute.  This ain't supposed to be happening like this.  So I remember I came out here to do an album.  Supposed to been here three days; ten days later I was still here.  So then I call my then-wife, "Sell everything; we're moving."  But she didn't see it that way.  So I went back to Chicago [Illinois].  It took me about four days to pack all my stuff, and I left her ass right there (laughter), hello.  That's the lady I married, you know.  (Unclear)--I, I got out of there.  Nobody could believe that I was gonna move because I, I had become like the man.
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm, I'm, I'm out, I'm out.
Speaker 1: And at this point are, are your kids still young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--excuse me.
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 2: Well, finally brought that woman out here.  Worst mistake I ever made.  Got divorced, sleeping in the car.  Court took my children.  It was horrible.  But it brought another chapter in, into my life.  In the Bible there's a book called Job.  And it describe Job as a very wealthy man, righteous man.  Now, I don't identify with the righteous part, but I call myself Job, Jr., because when I got divorced, didn't have money for a first and last to move into an apartment, the whole bit.  Finally, a guy let me move in without first and last, in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], flophouse, but it was like a Taj Mahal to me.  God made it so that everything I touched turned to platinum, every, every record.  It started off with the, the, the, the Earth, Wind and Fire, the "Boogie Wonderland," boom, then the, the, the, the 'Off the Wall,' the Michael Jackson, everything I touched, Aretha [Aretha Franklin].  You name it, everything turned to platinum.  Now while living in the flophouse, I bought eleven houses in L.A. and four condos in Chicago, Hyde Park, high rent district, black high, high rent district, okay.  Finally, I made a bid for the flophouse.  The, the guy who let me in and I didn't have first and last, and he couldn't understand that in a couple of years how can I come in and want to make a bid on his building.  So the relationship kind of turned, so I moved into one of my houses.
Story_ID: 673183
Speaker 1: So to go from--you know, at the top in Chicago [Illinois].  You come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  You move your wife and children to L.A.  You, you kind of lose everything, right?  Flophouse.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you, you know what?  I, I, I miss something, because I have to acknowledge the Lord, okay.  When I moved here, I had no relatives, no job, no relatives, no job, no money.
Speaker 1: Even though you were working?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I left Chicago, you know, I went--left L.A., went, went back to Chicago to move my stuff, when I got here, you know, I had no job and no money now, no relatives.  It's like, it's like pioneers, man, you know, wagon train.  But I'm so blessed.  You know, God never left me.  I was here about three days, and I got an apartment right in the middle of Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], Crescent Heights [Boulevard].  I was coming out of the building, and somebody said, "[HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright."  Nobody knows I'm here.  I looked around and it was a guy named Mickey Stevens [sic. HistoryMaker Mickey Stevenson].  Mickey Stevens was, like, the first VP [vice president] of Motown [Motown Records].  So we--
Speaker 1: And so this is in the '70s [1970s], so Motown has moved to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: --L.A.
Speaker 2: --Motown had already moved to L.A.--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: They moved in '72 [1972] I think.
Speaker 2: So he, he says, "What are you doing here?"  I said, "I just moved here."  So Mickey says--this is, this is the Lord working.  He says, "You have got to be The Temptations music director."  Now let me tell you how stupid I was.  I don't know if you could write this, but I'm--you know, you've got to get it--
Speaker 1: You can say it.
Speaker 2: --you've got to get it the way, the way I told him.  Mickey didn't know me like this.  I said, "I didn't come out here to be no motherfucking Temptations music director," and I didn't, even though The Temptations was the hottest thing on the planet.  Oh, okay, let's go back over this.  You had no job; you had no money; you had no relatives.  And the guy say you have got to be The Temptations music director.  That's why we sing this song in the gospel church that 'Amazing Grace.' He looked beyond my faults and saw my needs, 'cause I wasn't capable of it, okay.  I fought that job for over a month.  I didn't want it.  I'd been The Dells music director.  I had a taste of that.  I didn't want that.  I want to just produce records.  I was encouraged to take the job.  The word got around.  I finally took the job.  It was one hell of a job because the prime music director has lost all the music, my friend, [HistoryMaker] Cornelius Grant, my friend.  But Cornelius was not an arranger, whatever; he just knew the show.  He lost all the music.  So I had to listen to cassette tapes to figure out what everybody was playing and rewrite the show based on those cassette tapes.
Speaker 1: So that goes back to your experience of being a copyist, too, right?
Speaker 2: Everything, everything, because you listen to the tape and you say The Temptations are using orchestra.  So you hear the saxophones playing (makes sounds) and all of the sudden you hear woodwinds, flutes and clarinets and whatever.  You say, "Well, who switched to what?"  Oh my god, Lord, why did I say yes to this gig?  It killed me.  But finally, I finished the book, because The Temptations couldn't go to work without music--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --okay.
Speaker 1: How did he lose the music?
Speaker 2: Hey, if, if you don't know music (laughter), it's easy to lose--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --over the years, you know, whatever.
Story_ID: 673184
Speaker 1: How long did you work with The Temptations?
Speaker 2: (Pause) From '76 [1976] to '79 [1979], I think.
Speaker 1: And with them being the biggest group on the scene, apart from the fact that you didn't want to do it at first, you're doing it, what, what is that doing for your reputation in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] that you're working with them?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know, because the recording door wasn't open to me at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was after I left The Tempts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and what prompted you to leave?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was fed up.  I was just fed up, you know.  The Temptations were some wonderful cats, okay.  Praise God I still have a relationship with Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams], the only one that's still alive.  But the Temptations were taught by Charlie Atkins [Cholly Atkins], famed choreographer.  And Charlie helped me too.  It was the first time I had the chance to really work with a choreographer.  So Charlie would--you know, a new song would come out, and Charlie would go mark it off and he'd dance through it, just he and me.  And while he's dancing, I got my manuscript paper.  "You see this, Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright]?  Benjamin, wake up.  You see this?"  "Yes, Pops, I got it."  "Okay, you just step, boom, ah, ah, ah, uh, huh."  "Okay, Pop."  So I put these Xs and Os on my manuscript paper, and then I put the music to those markings.  So when you see The Temptations and they make movements or certain things, it looks bigger than life.  And it's what I call, what I deemed, my choreographical writing.  So I was, I was really onto something happening.  My stuff was, was, was killing, you know.  But when Pops didn't come on the road to monitor these guys, it became my responsibility, in terms of how they looked.  "Otis, you missed that," so and so and so.  "Ay, Dennis [Dennis Edwards], what's wrong with you, man?"  I'm playing Pops' role.  So I remember I was pissed off about something.  They, they'd had a terrible show, and I didn't say anything.  Do you know they had a meeting on me?  The meeting was, my words, "We fucked up and Benjamin didn't say nothing."  Wait a minute.  You acknowledge you messed up.  You're grown men, older than me.  And you pissed--you pissed off 'cause I didn't say anything?  Well, I guess I was hot already, 'cause the next night, say fuck it, y'all got it.  I'm out (laughter), and that's how I left (laughter).  And you know, naturally I was the worst guy in the world.  And right after that, Melvin [Melvin Franklin] got shot, the, the, the bass singer, Melvin.
Speaker 1: In L.A.?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He got shot.  Now The Temptations have cussed me all--called me all kinds of names and the whole bit 'cause I quit.  But when Melvin got shot my phone rang: "Hey, Ben."  "Yeah?"  "Melvin got shot, man.  We need you to come to the hospital."  "Huh?"  "Yeah, we need you to come to the, to the hospital."  I didn't question what, what, what am I gonna do, because we were so close.  "Melvin got shot.  Benjamin, we need you at the hospital."  I'm no doctor.  I show up at the hospital.  And you got The Temptations, we all standing around the bed like we was gonna make an album or something.  (Laughter) You know what I'm saying?  I mean, that's just really sick, but it showed where we were in terms of we still loved each other.  So it's, it's always been that way.
Speaker 1: So you got to make up right away.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I ain't coming back though, you know.  We cool, you know.  I mean, Otis and I are like this (gestures) today, you know.
Speaker 1: But it was time for you to go.  So that's '79 [1979], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673185
Speaker 1: And well, I guess right before you left working with them you started also doing some work with Stax Records, right?  Was it right before, with--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Stax--
Speaker 1: --with Rance Allen?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  It, it--
Speaker 1: Was it sort of in that same time period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right after, right after The Tempts--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Oh my god, you, you, you touched my soul.  Rance Allen, that's, that's the man.  But, but it didn't happen until I quit The Temptations.  And then what the judge told me to pay, I ain't paying that, my--for my divorce.  I ain't paying that.  Okay, I ain't working, so I ain't got it.  I ain't paying nothing, 'cause it was all wrong, was all wrong.  You, you see, I had the kids.  And when I filed--I filed for divorce, then they took the kids from me.  It's like, this is, this is wrong.  So here it is I'm on the streets, man.  I'm living in my car 'til the guy let me in, in, in the flophouse.
Speaker 1: Because you intentionally stopped working so that you wouldn't have to pay this money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that was my thinking.  So that's--you know, I had, I had no money and whatever, and, and this is how I say I became Job, Jr., because God made it so that if he call I got to work on a piece of music.  That music went to the top of the charts.
Speaker 1: And what were some of those songs that you were making?
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Don't stop 'til you get enough; keep on--din, da, da," the, the Michael Jack--(makes noise).  That's me, you know, (singing) "Rock with you."
Speaker 1: Huge hits.
Speaker 2: Huge--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So you're working with [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Quincy called me.
Speaker 1: So what is it like?  Quincy Jones is--I mean, he's been like the godfather for a long time.
Speaker 2: He still was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, and, and that's a--
Speaker 1: You get a call from Quincy Jones.
Speaker 2: --that's a story in itself.
Speaker 1: Tell me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm, I'm, I'm working--I get a call from Maurice White, and I do 'Boogie Wonderland.'
Speaker 1: Which is a huge hit for Earth, Wind--
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: --and Fire.  And Earth, Wind and Fire at this point is at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the top.
Speaker 2: Top.
Speaker 1: They have, they have eclipsed The Temptations, different kind of music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is when the music is shifting--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --more toward--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Maurice likes my writing.  He wrote something in, in his book (unclear) on me.  'Cause I'd fallen out with Maurice, like the hell with Maurice, okay.  He's, he has no personality, whatever, and the hell with you.  And then he died, and his book came out.  It's like, whoa, is this what he felt, because he said when, when Stephanie [sic. Charles Stepney] passed away, Stephanie didn't pass the baton to me.  He passed it to my competitor in Chicago [Illinois], Tom Tom [Thomas "Tom Tom" Washington].  But some of the engineers in Chicago had spoke to Maurice, like, "You gotta check out this young cat, [HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright, man.  This is a cat."  But Maurice didn't do that.  But it wasn't until he died that Maurice has in his book how he wanted Benjamin Wright versus who the other people said he should have.  Kind of messed me up, you know, 'cause I wouldn't get along with this cat, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: So he, he did contact you.  You did 'Boogie Wonderland.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But 'Boogie Wonderland' was not for Earth, Wind and Fire.  It was for another act.  But when I did it, Maurice says, "I think this should be for the Fire" (laughter).  And that was the name--that was it, you know.  But I'd done DeBarge, (singing) "All this love is waiting for you" ['All This Love'].  Everything I touched, man, just--
Speaker 1: Which is still popular (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My--all my stuff is still being played, okay.
Story_ID: 673186
Speaker 1: And as arranger and composer at this point too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?  Becau- and this is about the business, so are you being paid for your services and getting a piece of the record?
Speaker 2: No, I was not getting a piece of the record, but my fees were, my fees were topping black arrangers' salaries.
Speaker 1: So give me a sense of what's a range of--back then what were you making?
Speaker 2: Okay, at, at that time, I--(unclear)--see like this--Gene Page was the man.  Gene Page was the guy who was writing for Barry White, okay, those beautiful, lush arrangements and the whole bit.  Gene was making seven hundred dollars per an arrangement.  I was demanding nine [nine hundred dollars].  Because I did something for Motown [Motown Records], and Lee Young, Sr. was heading A and R [artist and repertoire], and he got my bill.  He said, "I'm not paying this," said, "we don't even pay Gene Page that, and that's the man."  But a guy took him into the studio, and the engineer played the stuff back, let Mr. Young play with it.  And this is Mr. Young talking--(unclear)--after two songs Mr. Young got up from the board and said, "Pay the man."  And that's heavy because mit- Mr. Young was Nat Cole's [Nat King Cole] music director, so we're talking about an authority, okay.  So my, my numbers start going up, really start going up, okay.  And that was, that was wonderful because in a sense, I, I, I, I think I became like the top paid cat in town at that time.
Story_ID: 673187
Speaker 1: But then one day my phone ring, and the guy says, "[HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright?"  "Yes."  "It's [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones."  "Quincy who?"  "This is Quincy Jones."  "Yeah, right, Quincy who?  This ain't no damn Quincy Jones."  One of them guitar players messing with me--kept talking.  Right when he thought I was cool, I asked again, "Quincy who?"  And he gave me an address to come to, talked about Michael Jackson.  He had been stop doing that bubble gum stuff 'cause he's growing up, gave me an address to come to.  And the address was in Bel Air [Los Angeles, California].  I don't know nobody in Bel Air.  I only knew where Bel Air because when I first got to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I went to the UCLA Film School [University of California Los Angeles School of Theater, Film and Television, Los Angeles, California] 'cause I want to score movies.  And if you go west on Sunset Boulevard, you get to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] you have to turn left into the school.  But if you turn right, it's a big signs says, "Welcome to Bel Air," so I knew where Bel Air was.  I find the house, and this lady comes to the door.  This lady looks very familiar.  That's Peggy Lipton.  I knew her from the, the, the television thing, 'Mod Squad.'  I didn't know at the time that Peggy Lipton is Lipton tea.  She's so nice.  "Benjamin, da, da, da, da."
Speaker 2: Did you know that it was Q's wife?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew.
Speaker 2: Oh, you knew that.
Speaker 1: I knew that.
Speaker 2: You knew that, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she takes me back to Q, and I'm still kind of nervous.  Q talks to me.  He talks about his years in Chicago [Illinois], 'cause Q was in Chicago quite a few years.  He was vice president of Mercury Records.  That's the stuff when he was doing Lesley Gore, (singing) "It's my party and I cry when I want to" ['It's My Party'].  Said wow, okay, this is the real Quincy.  I'd never seen him in person.  We talked, talked, talked, and he said, said, telling me about the Michael Jackson thing and whole bit.  And he gives me thirty days to write.  Nobody never gave me thirty days to write.
Speaker 2: That was a long time?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a long time.  You know, you get two or three days; gave me thirty days, man.
Story_ID: 673188
Speaker 1: For twenty-eight days I couldn't write anything, 'cause it's [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.  What can you write for Quincy Jones?  He's done all the movies.  He's done the Grammys [Grammy Awards], the this and that and the other.  I'm scared.  And I could hear the Lord talking to me like in a conversation--"Okay, hey, Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], you know you got a session in a couple of days.  You're gonna have to put some notes on the paper."  "Okay, Lord."  I finally put some notes on the paper.  I get to the studio the day of the session.  I never--was shaking.  Nothing has ever frightened me, nothing.  Even when I go to the studio it's like my house.  I'm the man.  But with Quincy Jones I'm scared to death.  Somebody says, "Hey, Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright]."  I look around, and it's Bruce Swedien.  That's the engineer Quincy uses.  I knew Bruce because Bruce did all of the Jackie Wilson stuff at Brunswick [Brunswick Records] in Chicago [Illinois].  So you Bruce, but then Bruce messed it up.  He says, "Hey, Q, Benjamin's here.  It's gonna be a piece of cake."  I don't need no more pressure, man, you know.  Musicians come in, thump.  We run it down, okay, still take.  I'm watching Quincy out of the corner of my eye, and I'm seeing him fall on his knees.  (Unclear)--say oh, man, I must really be jacking this up, 'cause I don't know this, this guy.  I don't know what his antics are.  We finish.  I go into the control room to ask, "Okay, what do you think?  What do I need to do?"  Quincy's having a heart attack--"This is the shit.  This is it; oh my god, this is it."  Let me get it straight now 'cause I, I, I don't know.  Oh, he likes it.  To confirm that he really liked it, he gave me another song that day.  The song that we just did was 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.'  And the second song he gave me was 'Rock with You.'  (Unclear)--oh, he likes it; he likes my writing, and you know, the rest is history.  And that, that opened a relationship, because I used to get a call from Quincy every day.  Quincy did a song of mine called 'Find One Hundred Ways' ['One Hundred Ways'] I think.  [HistoryMaker] James Ingram sang the song.  I'm the writer.  It's like, cat loves me, man, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 673189
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," is that the one that has the African--"mama se mama sa mama coosa?"  Is that in it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, that's a different song?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' though is a huge--it's one of the biggest hits.
Speaker 2: That was the first.
Speaker 1: Right.  So you do that.  Then you do "Rock with You"--rock with me.  Do you do other songs on that album?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did another song on that album called "Get on the Floor."  I, I did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And this is the 'Off the Wall' album, so this is Michael's [Michael Jackson] first.
Speaker 2: (Gestures) Right there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Did you see that?  The wall.
Speaker 1: There you go.  This is his breakout album.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you help to, to arrange-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --his breakout (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --yes, and get number one hits as a result.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What does that do for your career?
Speaker 2: Went up.  Fees went up.  I ain't mad (laughter).
Speaker 1: And did you continue a relationship with Q [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] over the years?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Like I say, Quincy used to call me every day.  I didn't know how to be his friend because I was not on that level, okay.  Q would call me and talk about Bruce Lundvall and only names that I could read in the trade magazines--man, so and so, this cat says such and such and such and so.  And my response is, "Really, oh, wow."  That's no conversation.  I didn't know how to respond.  I did not understand at that particular time.  He was looking for a friend, a, a shoulder, and I didn't know how to be that, you know.  But I think it was finally established.  My oldest daughter and, and husband were killed.  And I know Q was in Paris [France] when it went down.  The next day, I get a call from Quincy.  I'm trying to figure out--how did he find out 'cause it wasn't on the news.  You know, it's, it's--cat was close to me, and we, we still cool.
Story_ID: 673190
Speaker 1: So a- another group that you wrote for was Tavares.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's 1980, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was producing Tavares.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're producing now.
Speaker 2: For Capitol Records.  And that was a very good situation, you know, and certainly the Michael Jackson thing helped all of that.  And I had a decent budget, like, half a million to do them, and I never went crazy; I always watched the money.  And Tavares had what's called a recording fund versus a recording budget, so everything that's not used, go back to them, not the record company.
Speaker 1: Oh, good, so you were very mindful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and at--let, let me just ask you this because you, you talked about working with [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.  Did you work with Michael as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Michael was on the, on, on the scene.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about working with Michael Jackson?  What was--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --he like then?  'Cause this is a--period--point of transition for him in his career.
Speaker 2: Michael--I, I always give an example, okay.  I remember working with a guy from, from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], a young black cat, not very talented in my opinion.  And then this studio and producer says, "Hey, man, that, that's fine."  He said, "But can we, can we try it again?"  "What?"  Said, "You know it's--you're doing great, but we need to try it again, please."  "Okay, man."  Guy sings it again.  Guy said, "Man, we need to do one more take on this one."  "Man, I've been singing this shit all day, man."  So at some point, it gets to the producer and--said, "Okay, man, it's fine, cool, come on in."  Guy comes in and he's still talking about, "Damn, been singing this song, man.  Y'all don't know what you're doing, man."  "Hey, man, let me borrow five dollars to catch the bus to get home." Versus Michael Jackson.  Michael does a track.  Bruce [Bruce Lundvall], Quincy say, "Okay, that's it."  Michael, "No, no, I, I could do it better.  Give me another track."  Okay, give him another track.  He sings the song.  Say that's it, man.  "No, no, no, I could do it better.  I could do it better."  "Goddamn, Mike, come on, man."  Give him another track, finish, same thing.  "I could, I could beat that."  "Mike, we need to get out of here--." The difference is Mike's a billionaire.  Cat from L.A. need to borrow five dollars to get back home.  He has attitude.  The guy with all the money saying it's not good enough for me.  Give me another track.  "Let me try, try it again."  That's the difference.  (Pause) (Shakes head) Can't beat it.
Story_ID: 673191
Speaker 1: I, I had the chance to talk to Michael [Michael Jackson] towards the end of his life.  And he talked about, in particular, orchestration, which is why I'm thinking of it with your strings, that it was very important to him for his music to be creative, composed, arranged like classical music, with the layers, so that it would live and had--and have layers no matter how you listen to it.  And so you, you did the strings, correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was he--did you, did you talk to him about that at all or--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I can appreciate what he's saying, but he didn't have a clue.
Speaker 1: Then.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  So it came later.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), you know.  Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] didn't have a clue.  You know, you, you never know who's paying attention to you, so obviously Q saw something.  You know, as he say, very talented cat.  I knew a couple of occasions at--we were in the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was--it's, it's really in Switzerland [Lake Geneva, Switzerland], and it had a choir there from Atlanta [Georgia], a black choir.  And I, I'm a nobody.  We had all this huge dressing room with all these artists in it.  And then we--finally I was called to the stage.  And while on the stage, Quincy Jones appeared in this dressing room.  It's on the monitor.  I wasn't there.  I was on the stage.  And the word was Quincy went crazy, "That's [HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright.  That's a bad cat."  Well, he's done that several situations when I conducting orchestra, whatever--"That's Benjamin."  He has to let every--"That's Benjamin."  So yeah, it's great.  But he didn't know what I was gonna write.  I didn't know what I was gonna write.  I had thirty days, and for twenty-eight days I didn't write anything until God said, "Hey, you got a session.  You got to put some notes on the paper."  He gave me the notes to put on the paper.  So whoever comes and say well, hey, I, I want--my stuff has to be layers and whatever, you know, he's just talking shit (laughter).  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Well, to be fair, he talked about it when he got to 'Thriller.'  So maybe this is after learning--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, being exposed to it and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --seeing the value of it, 'cause that was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Context is important (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673192
Speaker 1: You opened Ritesonian Recording Studio [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is what, '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about establishing that.
Speaker 2: Well, things were going very well.  I was getting lazy.  I didn't like going downtown anymore.  I can do this at my house.  I built a studio at the crib, kind of like this.  And this, this is really a big room.  We actually seat thirty string players in this room.  But at that particular time in, in another house I lived in we created a studio.  We had bought equipment.  I wanted to buy a, a used tape machine.  Tape machines are like, sixty, seventy thousand dollars.  It was like, man, I, I need a used one.  Cat say "No, Benjamin, you don't want, you don't want a used one.  You, you, you want a--fuck this, this is a new product, so and so and so.  I'd heard about this new product." It's like, "No, I don't want that product 'cause it doesn't do this and doesn't do that."  He said, "No, all that's been corrected.  This is the newest one, such and such and such."  He says, "I'll tell you what, you take it home; play with it; it you don't like it, bring it back."  So the devil jumped all over me.  He had.  I'm gonna take it home, and I'm gonna cut everything I can think of on it, then bring it back.  It never left my house to go back (laughter).  It was great.  It was great.  Now in this situation here, I have a big high end console, and I got all the toys.  I actually have a shed outside with a million dollars' worth of equipment in it.  Is this the kid from Mississippi?  Yeah, but I got big time stuff in that room, here.  This is not a home studio.  This is the real deal, plus.
Speaker 1: And so from that time when you established your studio, from then on have you been working primarily through your own studio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, I go downtown, you know, as well.  A lot of times I, I might do something that's much bigger than my place, you know--
Speaker 1: And, and--but so some of the artists that you've worked with around that time, The Whispers, Lakeside, Shalamar, Midnight Star, Carrie Lucas.
Speaker 2: That's the boss's wife--
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: --Dick Griffey, who became the owner of SOLAR Records.
Speaker 1: Right.  So were all of these artists part of SOLAR?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all--everybody you just named.
Speaker 1: So that was--so just in terms of the way that you work, did, did you, you--there was a label that was interested in working with you, and you kind of arranged everything for them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, they--SOLAR had a young man called Leon Sylvers [Leon Sylvers III], who's the producer there at the time.  And Leon loved him some [HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright arrangements.  That's how that was.
Speaker 1: And so how long did that relationship last?
Speaker 2: (Yawns) Quite a few years, quite a few years.  I don't know.
Story_ID: 673193
Speaker 1: In 1987, you were selected to be musical director and conductor of the 'Night of the Divas.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a big situation.  That was in your background--your, your backyard.
Speaker 1: Washington, D.C., right.  It was in honor of Marian Anderson.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what, what, what did you do?  As you're, you're preparing--now this is for television, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, it's a live event, but it's also televised.  Is that how--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it works?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that--PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] or something.  I don't know.  But you have to know the story of Marian Anderson.  Do you know about Marian Anderson?
Speaker 1: I do, but tell us for the--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Marian Anderson was our first black--
Speaker 1: Opera.
Speaker 2: --classical singer--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --okay.  This was during the time of President Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt].  The first lady [Eleanor Roosevelt] was a member of a group called the Daughters of the Revolution [Daughters of the American Revolution], very racist group.  But Mrs. Roosevelt wanted Marian Anderson to sing at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  Organization say, "No."  We can imagine how it went down.  You never hear me use the word. "Niggers can't sing there."  First lady said, "No, I can't go down like that."  So instead of Marian singing inside in the winter, had her sing on the steps in the cold.  Well, many years later, come this little kid, [HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright.  And I don't know how I was chosen to be the music director for that.  Said it had (unclear), Florence Quivar, who represented classical; [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, the jazz; Shirley Caesar, the gospel; and you had a choreographer from New York named [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson, wrote all this ballet and the whole bits, and I did its music.  And the vice president showed up to give an apology to Ms. Marian Anderson, who attended that event.  She's still alive.  And that, that was big for me.
Story_ID: 673194
Speaker 1: The next year, you go back on the road as musical director for Gladys Knight and the Pips.  But it's interesting, you, you, you're doing a year of one-nighters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you reconfigure her band.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe how you--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I had been writing for Gladys and the Pips, so everything was big orchestra.  But when--you know, they had a hit record called 'Love Overboard,' okay.  And boom, I sat at the table, the planning, the, the big heads, and it's like, logistically speaking, a lot of these dates can't happen because we have to have orchestra, and the transportation is not gonna get us there on time.  So--excuse me--I needed to be creative to come up with something to make this work.  So I transformed this big orchestra with all of these strings and horns to a ten piece band.  And in this ten piece band I had five keyboard players.  That was totally unheard of then.  But I used the keyboards.  Each keyboard, each keyboard--each keyboardist--had, like, five keyboards--give me horns, strings, saxophones.  I covered the whole orchestra.  Man, when Gladys Knight hit the stage, and you had that kind of power.  No matter who you were and what you were doing, you had to come out of your dressing room to come see and hear what was happening.  So it was very successful.
Speaker 1: So basically you were using technology, 'cause the keys now can, can--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --play every instrument.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They're not just a piano--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or an organ.  So you, you had the keyboardists become those different--
Speaker 2: The orchestra.
Speaker 1: --the orchestra.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which of course makes it more affordable and portable to travel around with.
Speaker 2: Right, because we could not--logistically we could not make it--the buses couldn't make it on time.
Speaker 1: With thirty-two piece orchestra.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You start touring again internationally in the '90s [1990s].  Who are you touring with?
Speaker 2: Gladys, Ms. Patti LaBelle.  I did my first Nobel Peace Prize with Patti LaBelle; then I did one with Gladys.  So maybe I'm the Nobel Peace man.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And, and you, you'd mentioned earlier that you performed at the White--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is for President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the event?  You remember?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was anything special, maybe just something the, the first lady [Hillary Rodham Clinton] wanted to have, performance, whatever, you know.  I don't think it was anything special--(yawns) excuse me--other than just the performance for the White House [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 673195
Speaker 1: So then you continue--you know, there, there are few people in the industry whose careers continue for a long period of time; a whole lot of people it's momentary.  But you go from The Temptations to then in the '90s [1990s] and 2000s, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Chaka Khan, Destiny's Child, Brandy, Toni Braxton, Dru Hill, Mary Mary, Jamiroquai, Joss Stone.  I mean, it's--
Speaker 2: It's crazy.
Speaker 1: And are you doing much of that out of this studio, or where--how, how are you working with them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was doing a lot of it out of, out of home here.  But most of those projects were bigger than what I could have at home, you know.
Speaker 1: How are you getting these gigs?  Is this still just people contacting you directly?
Speaker 2: It was.  It was.
Speaker 1: And, and to the point of--are--what are you doing for them?  Are you, are you writing?  Are you what--composing?  What, what are you doing?
Speaker 2: Excuse me--I'm arranging, occasionally composing, but mainly arranging the music for records or whatever, yeah, so I'm in my element.
Story_ID: 673196
Speaker 1: At a certain point, I think in, in the early 2000s, you start writing programs, big orchestra programs for churches.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Okay, there was a big church here in, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called Faithful Central [Faithful Central Bible Church, Inglewood, California].  Faithful Central, Pastor Ulmer [Bishop Dr. Kenneth C. Ulmer], had this idea--Pastor Ulmer had this idea that they needed this supersize building.  And the building that, that he sought was The Forum [Inglewood, California], the L.A. Forum, which is where Kareem [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] and Magic [Magic Johnson] played basketball.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They lost a lot of church members because the--some of the, some of the members couldn't see that.  But his vision was very strong.  So collectively, that church bought the L.A. Forum.  I think on typical Sunday, they, they seat twenty thousand plus, huge church.  They had an, a music--how you say it--minister of music, Mrs. Barbara Allen [Barbara A. Allen].  Mrs. Allen saw me do another big church, and she said, "That's my guy; I got to have him," so I got the call to do their annual Easter program.  The Easter program at this church is greater than a Hollywood movie, the whole production.  You know, they bring in the horses, angels in the sky a hundred feet up in--
Speaker 1: In The Forum?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So they have to have--you know, the--these are Teamsters people [International Brotherhood of Teamsters], so it's, it's--
Speaker 1: Money.
Speaker 2: --very costly.
Speaker 1: Right.  But it's also such a large venue that it has to be grand in order to even be seen, right?  And--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, they got big monitors and the whole bit.
Story_ID: 673197
Speaker 1: But, what's happening is that they got to me--I put a sixty-piece orchestra in there.  That's heavy.  And I end up writing all the music.  It's like, one year they say, "Well, we want to do the 'Hallelujah Chorus'" ['Messiah,' George Frideric Handel].  And I'm like, "Okay, piece of cake, rent the score."  Well, they got the score.  They bought the score, whatever, brought it to me since I was the one suggested that they go pick up a score.  Then you find that the 'Hallelujah Chorus' was written for chamber orchestra, not full symphony orchestra.  Also, we found out that in terms of authenticity, it's the music that George Frideric Handel wrote.  In that day trumpets as we know them have valves.  But during the day of the 'Hallelujah Chorus,' trumpets didn't have valves.  So they make instruments in the key of the song.  Today we have key signatures as they say it's in this key or it's in that key.  So all the trumpet parts were written for it D, as in Delta, trumpets.  Who in the hell owns a D trumpet.  Ain't no cats around got a D trumpet.  So me and my big mouth saying get the score, I've got to write it.  Well, all of the French horn parts are written without key signatures.  Well, key signatures, if you pick up a piece of music you might see some sharps, one, two, three sharps, four sharps, five sharps, whatever, or flats--That's the key signature.  It determines what key the music is in.  But for the 'Messiah' there are no key signatures for the French horns.  What?  The other instruments, in terms of the names of them and the whole bit, are all written in Italian.  I don't speak Italian.  I don't know what the hell is on that.  So me and my big mouth saying just order the score, I got to rewrite this whole thing, which would have easily been maybe a fifteen thousand dollar chart, for the church, no.  I'm mad because I have to do it, but praise God he has prepared me to know how to do it, okay.  And that's--those are some of my woes dealing with, with the church.  The last one we did I know specifically because the budget was $375,000, and the pastor of this church refuses to charge.  All of the megachurches for their Easter programs or Christmas program charges a fee.  This black minister says, "No, this is a church service."  Forgive my grammar--say, "We ain't charging nobody."  But when you got a budget of $375,000, come on, man.  But that's how he saw it, and I loved him for it, okay, 'cause we paid the orchestra well.  And they, they just do it so well, because when you--it's, it's, it's like, [HistoryMaker] Benjamin Wright is coming in, so you have everything laid out for his orchestra.  And they have the, the, the, the, the chefs there to make the breakfast for everybody and--it's just, it's just class A.  I wish I could do it every day.  You know what I'm saying?
Story_ID: 673198
Speaker 1: After doing this huge work for the church that's housed at The Forum [Inglewood, California], did you go on to compose and arrange other--well, arrange other work for churches?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think three other churches that I was doing stuff for.  Don't ask me the names.  I--
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 2: You know--I was building a reputation, you know.
Speaker 1: And you were honored by the Pentecostal Bible College in Tuskegee [Alabama] in 2002.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was a very good situation.  I'm, I'm, I'm still honored by that, with a tear in my eye, okay.  There's a, there's a church in Montgomery, Alabama, that's pastored by the Reverend Leo Louis [Leo Lewis, Sr.].  And Reverend Louis is one of those cats who've become a big time preacher who's, has his own plane and the whole bit, and it's one of my classmates, just like Jamal [ph.], my manager, worked for Sony [Sony Music Entertainment].  And at Sony the head attorney over there is Michael Frisby, and that's another one of our classmates.
Speaker 1: Class from where?
Speaker 2: Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Oh, from home.
Speaker 2: High school [Coleman High School, Greenville, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I was the only dummy, you know (laughter).  These cats were sharp.  I was hanging around, you know (laughter) quite a few like these big time surgeons.  We got some, some Supreme Court justices [Mississippi Supreme Court] and the whole bit.  You know, it's Mississippi, man, you know.
Story_ID: 673199
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the church a little bit, because you--throughout your interview you have acknowledged God's presence in your life and in your work and guiding your steps.  When was that seed planted, your, your faith?
Speaker 2: When I was a kid.  Like I said, my dad [Benjamin F. Wright, Sr.] was a Sunday school superintendent, and my mom [Colonus Miller Wright] was as equally yoked as he was, okay.  As I was growing up trying to play music, you know, I was consistently warned, "This music that you're playing, Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], is not of the Lord."  That's kind of heavy, you know.  But I remember, when I was talking about the Ted thing--Ted Taylor thing, my dad was interviewing Mr. Taylor [Ted Taylor].  And it was like, "Man, dad, dad, please let me get this gig, you know.  You asking all these questions," and whatever.  But in that interview is my dad was getting his information, learning about a road manager.  "What is, what is a road manager?"  He said, "Okay, okay.  You're my son.  And if this is what you really want to do, I'm gonna support you."  "Woah, I'm going."  Then he say, "But you know this music is not of the Lord."  "Oh my god, I'm not going."  Then he says, "Tomorrow, we're gonna go down to that music store and get that little thing you've been talking about."  That little thing was a new Wurlitzer electric piano.  I really wanted a B3, a Hammond B3 organ.  But a Hammond B3 organ cost more than a house at that time, you know, and we were renting, you know.  He says gonna go get that little thing.  And my dad took me downtown and charged that little piano.  And I say something in, in, in another setting, my dad got sick.  For ten years I funded him, canceled checks little over $750,000, 'cause they wouldn't give him an aspirin unless they got permission from me to pay for it 'cause there was no insurance.  But I was able to do it because of that little thing, that little piano.  My dad never owned a car.  I bought him three cars, because of that little piano.  All my children, grandchildren, et cetera, God has blessed me 'cause of that little piano.  I used to work for, for Paul Anka as, as a--Jamal [ph.] was talking about.  Paul Anka has jets, Learjets.  He wants to talk to me, he send a Learjet.  Well, I used to be in Las Vegas [Nevada] every night, L.A. [Los Angeles, California] every day, commute, commute, commute, commute.  And I came to L.A. one morning and, and woke up in the hospital because I was not eating.  Wasn't time for me to eat, wasn't time for me to sleep.  I'm just writing music.  I got sessions in L.A. every day, and I'm conducting in Vegas every night, made a lot of money, almost died in the process so that--ha, ha--how you gonna, how you, how you gonna deal with that?  Well, how did the big boys do it?  They own their own plane.  I can't buy no Learjet, but I can buy a nice twin engine.  I never bought the plane.  I met this cute little girl named Deborah [Deborah Wright].  She's in, in the other room in there.  They killed my plane (laughter), you know, and then kids start creeping up.  Hey, where you come from?  You know.
Speaker 1: And you and Deborah been married thirty-four years.
Speaker 2: Hello, and still ain't got no airplane.  You don't hear me.  However, I was in a position to do that because of that little piano.  That little piano is very important to me, you know.
Speaker 1: Where is that little piano?
Speaker 2: I don't know where it is, but this--it's his cousin sitting right here.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right.
Story_ID: 673200
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about family 'cause you, you, you mentioned family.  How many children do you have?
Speaker 2: Nine hundred.  (Pause) We, we, we got seven, seven children.  The oldest child and her husband were killed in a car accident--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so we had to take their children.  So collectively, in terms of our children, we've raised ten.  And then we took care another five, whatever.  Then the grandkids start coming, so Deborah [Wright's wife, Deborah Wright] had about a hundred children, you know.  I just stand back and look at him.
Speaker 1: And you said you have fifteen grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we got great-grandchildren.  I try to be cool with that 'cause I'm still trying to be cute (laughter).  You great-granddad, you know.  Stop calling me that, inappropriate.
Speaker 1: Gee, gee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know what I'm saying? (Laughter) No, no, I welcome it.  I'm, I'm, I'm thrilled.
Speaker 1: What does family mean to you?
Speaker 2: Everything.  They're, they're expensive, very expensive--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --you know.  But like, God has provided a way for us to hang, 'cause we've got all of these children and we're still here, and they're gonna eat today.  You can fix some leftovers, they gonna eat tomorrow.  You don't hear me, you know.
Story_ID: 673201
Speaker 1: Well, and, and you continue to work.  I mean, now, just looking at time when we go in the early 2000s, you began working with Justin Timberlake.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That, that was a blessing.
Speaker 1: An ongoing collaboration, right?  You worked with him for a few projects?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've, I've, I've, I've worked on all three of his albums.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How do you stay in the flow of what the music is, because music changes over time, the--what--because I asked you earlier about R and B [rhythm and blues], and you said music, that--this was from many years ago.  And so I suspect music is what we're talking--it--in that general umbrella.  But how, how do you stay in the flow of what is happening now?
Speaker 2: Okay, can I ask Ja--Jamal [ph.], Jamal, can you come out for a second?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'cause she--he got me wired up.  Could you stand behind this piano?  All the music in the world comes from five lines and four spaces.  Do you play piano?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, you ever played any instrument?
Speaker 1: I played the violin.
Speaker 2: Violin, great, five lines, four spaces, right.  It's not but twelve notes in the whole universe, you know that.  Could you, could you play a gospel C.
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: Play a rock and roll C.
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: Play a funk C.
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: Could you play a jazz C?
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: Blues C.
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: Bluegrass.
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: Country.
Speaker 1: (PLAYS PIANO)
Speaker 2: You call it what you want.  It's all the same stuff.  That's how I see music.  You know, cats can label it for whatever purposes.  You say, how, how, how do you stay current?  I don't listen to anybody else.  This morning, before I left to go buy some croissants, the thing was turn on the radio.  I had a problem turning on the radio 'cause I much, I much rather hear the news.  I'm into news and sports.  I'm not into the radio.  My radio is what I hear in my head.  It's what God gives me.  You know what I'm saying?  Now, it's a lot of good stuff, lot of great stuff.  He sent me something yesterday, and he said, "Well, the singers are not good."  And I counted.  I said, "They are; they are good, and it's a project I want to work on. Music is good, and I'm listening to somebody else.  It's a good job."  You know, I'm not bias or anything.  If, if it's, if it's not--no, that's, that's too grammatically correct.  If the shit don't sound right, I'm the first to let you know (laughter), 'cause I don't like nothing.  You know what I'm saying?  But I respect good.  Well, well, what, what do you call good?  Is it, is it just your standards, Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright]?  It's what, what I like.  I hear it and it's like, eh.  I might not like the song, but I say wow, man, get--did a great job on the music here, sometimes to the point that it's tears in my eyes 'cause it's so good, and it ain't mine.  You know, I'm of that mindset to give it up, man.
Story_ID: 673202
Speaker 1: How are you picking your projects today?
Speaker 2: Honey, I'm broke.  I'm not bias (laughter).  Wait, wait, you gotta hear this.  You've got to hear this.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You gotta hear this, I told him yesterday don't leave no money on the table.  Jamal, what did I tell you yesterday about the money?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Make sure it keeps coming in?
Speaker 2: What did I say?  Think.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're not, we're not leaving anything on the table.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  That's where my head is.
Speaker 1: So the projects come, and you welcome them.
Speaker 2: Because oatmeal is better than no meal. You with me?  I, I'm not one to sit here and choose.  Well, I don't want to do this, and I don't want to do that and the whole bit.  Yeah, it, it's, it's, it's, it's lot of those.  But you know, it's, it's like, the scenario is, child says, "Daddy, I'm hungry."  And you tell a child, "I understand baby," but then they sent me--so I don't like this music.  "No, dad, you, you don't understand.  I'm hungry."  "Yeah, but I, I, I don't want to deal with this project here 'cause it's--." "Dad, I'm hungry."  How can you have this hungry child understand he's hungry because you don't want to do this project?  No, don't leave no money on the table.  We'll work it out.  Oh yeah, there have been times when I could collect the big dollar.  Those times are not there anymore.  The industry have changed.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, my wife [Deborah Wright] is accustomed to coming in here and can't hardly open the door, musicians everywhere.  The budgets are not there, but we still gotta eat, you know.  So that's where I kind of differ from some of the cats, 'cause I love to eat, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm hungry now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 673203
Speaker 1: When you look to the future, what do you, what do you see yourself doing in moving forward?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I haven't thought about that.  We are getting bombarded with that from insurance people, old folks living whatever.  Hey, man, I don't want to hear that.  Might be a lot of substance behind it, but I'm gonna be doing music.  And as soon as I can, I'm gonna get on the basketball court.  That's what I see.  My wife [Deborah Wright] wants to travel, the whole bit, and she gonna drag me along.  I, I, I, I, I love it when she does things and she's smiling, you know.  But from the travel standpoint, baby, I, I want to go home.  I've traveled my whole life.  Even when I was doing it, I, I wasn't excited about that.  You could send me a postcard.  It's like, yeah, okay, cool.  I'm serious.
Speaker 1: I believe you.
Speaker 2: You know.

Speaker 1: When you think about your career, which has been very full over many, many years, what is the legacy that you hope you're leaving?
Speaker 2: Money (laughter).  I hope that I can--okay, okay, let me, let me put it this way, I have a musician's pension.  Now, if I accept my full pension, I'd be smiling every day.  But the way I have it set up is I take a portion, because if I go first, she's gonna get all.  Now if I can participate in more projects and whatever, to make it so that my family can reap the benefits when I'm gone, they just--they gonna think I'm gone 'cause I'm gonna have one eye on all of them, okay.  But if I could do something to ensure that everybody is taken care of, I'll be a happy camper.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't learn to play piano.  (Pause) That's it.  I didn't learn to play piano.  My mom [Colonus Miller Wright] wanted me to go to piano lessons with my little sister [Percy Knight].  In my day that was a sissy thing, okay.  And I wanted to play ball.  And my ear was so good, that I was way ahead of what my little sister was learning, until one day, when she would always ask me whatever the teacher was giving her--she calls me Junior [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright]--Junior, such and such and such.  Okay, yeah, I so and so and so and so, based on talent.  Then she would come home and, and she would make runs on the piano, thumb under, thumb under, and I didn't know how to do that, okay.  And then I started withdrawing, 'cause I'm not her go-to guy anymore.  She has the technical knowledge.  I know how to get there but not the way she does, 'cause the teacher is telling her the--what fingers and the whole bit.  I didn't learn that.  Mom wanted me to learn that.  No, I didn't see the piano in my future at that time.  But all of a sudden it's, it's my career.  It's my whole--you know.
Speaker 1: So when you play the organ you don't consider that--that, that's not the same as learning how to play the piano?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I, I--no, I can play but not to my, my level.
Speaker 1: Ah, that's what you mean.
Speaker 2: I can make the gig but not, not the way it's supposed to be, you know.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Man, you know, you're talking some death stuff.  I don't know.  I'd like to be remembered as a guy who shared the good news of our Lord and Savior to somebody else.  That's important to me.  I find that I'm in that situation quite frequently.  I was in Home Depot yesterday.  And this is how your, your reputation gets around.  I'm at Home Depot, and this buy guy, big white guy, runs up to me, "Benjamin [HistoryMaker Benjamin Wright], Benjamin, I need you to talk to this guy."  "What's, what's happening, what's happening?"  Well, some, some, some singer in some group committed suicide the other day--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --okay.  And this guy was--had some views--something they was talking it, whatever.  And so the big white guy say, "Well, there's a minister right there."  (Laughter) I'm no minister.  But because we talked about the Lord, I'm the minister.  So he ran over to get me.  He has a big Home Depot apron on, the whole bit, and everybody's like, "Wow, what's going on?"  So I get out of the line with my basket, go talk to this other guy who's having a problem with the, the suicide thing.  And we talked, so and so and so, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, and then you know, hey, man, I start off here.  And all of a sudden I'm talking loud.  And the guy was like, "Thank you, sir, thank you."  Wow, how do I--what's this feeling I'm getting?  My wife [Deborah Wright] is a minister, not me, hello.  You know what I'm saying?  And I treasure her, man, you know.  That's heavy stuff.  And I look how she sees things through God's eyes, not her own interpretation.  She's bigger than that, you know, 'cause I always say, "Well, Benjamin, how do you interpret it?"  I don't interpret.  God gives it to you.  You don't have to interpret.  You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, and that's how I go about it.

Speaker 1: --Curious about what advice you would give to young people, particularly young African Americans who would like to follow in your footsteps.
Speaker 2: In terms of following in my footsteps, you know, me as a musician, learn the music, man.  Please learn the music, no matter what genre you, you doing and what they call it, whole bit.  I, I go back to five lines and four spaces, twelve notes.  You learn it, learn it, learn it, learn it, inside, outside, whatever, sideways, whatever, learn it, 'cause if you're gonna be in this, it's gonna come back to bite you in the butt, okay.  And so many of our kids, you know, they, they see what the hip hop thing is, whole bit.  I'm not mad.  But when it comes to the music and whatever, if there's a television show you hit--you need to write it on the spot, you're spending time trying to call somebody like me, so you miss it, you know.  This, this is, this is heavy stuff.  You gotta learn it, got to learn it.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to share that I have not asked?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you got some food?  (Laughter)  He's been here two times.  He ain't brought no sandwich or nothing, okay (laughter).  Come on, Matt [Matthew Hickey] (laughter).

Speaker 1: That's my dad and me.

Speaker 1: Seventies [1970s].
Speaker 2: Pieces of Peace.  (Gestures) That's me.
Speaker 1: Right here in the center?
Speaker 2: Yeah--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay, that was me getting the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is?
Speaker 1: Yeah, getting a--this is a, this is a--
Speaker 2: The honorary doctorate?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And at that time I was teaching at a school here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], kids with strings.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they were donating the violin.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is an honorary doctorate for Pentecostal Bible [Pentecostal Bible College, Tuskegee, Alabama]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, that must be Benjamin Dee Williams.  No, Ben--(laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Looks like the guy we interviewed last time I was here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a serious looking guy, man.
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of when this was?
Speaker 2: I know--
Speaker 1: Seventies [1970s]?
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: Eighties [1980s].
Speaker 2: Eighties [1980s].
Speaker 1: Eighties [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is (unclear)--this is The Temptations.  That's me--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --cutest one.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Of course, and look at you here.
Speaker 1: That's, is when we was working with the mob.  This is Skip McQuinn.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And--
Speaker 1: I, I, I, I--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--that on the left?
Speaker 1: And that's me.
Speaker 2: That's you, and who is he?
Speaker 1: That's a guy we, we, we hired, guitar player, but let me tell you something about him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Skip and I didn't see each other for many, many years, and we found each other, okay.  And Skip had been living in Memphis [Tennessee], and he had been working with a lot of churches.  So I needed to do a big band thing in, in Greenville, Mississippi, for the Greenville--the Delta Blues Festival [Mississippi Delta Blues and Heritage Festival].  So I needed him to come in with the recording truck and record.  And he had been sick.  And he came and brought his stuff and the whole bit.  And we finished the gig, and everybody's breaking down and the whole bit.  Now Skip got the worst mouth in the world.  So now here it is, all of these super white guys around, and he's describing me.  I'm standing there.  (Unclear)--this is a big guy now.  He--'cause he, he picked up a lot of weight.  "This guy right here, that's my mother fucking brother.  You know--and when I was sick, he's the only guy that called and prayed for me."  They was--wow, man, you know, turning it into an emotional thing, you know.  He eventually died, and I sent him something to, to the funeral, man.  And the preacher says, "I don't have to preach after reading this."
Speaker 2: Powerful.
Speaker 1: And that's, that's, that's my brother.
Speaker 2: That's your brother.
Speaker 1: Pieces of Peace.  I think we're in Singapore or something when that was out.
Speaker 2: Like you said, you sent money home, and the rest went to the tailor.
Speaker 1: Hello.
Speaker 2: Looking, looking smooth right there.
Speaker 1: Ah, man, that's a little China chick I picked up.
Speaker 2: And what's her name?
Speaker 1: Deborah Wright.
Speaker 2: And you've been married thirty four years as of 2017, huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what she says.
Speaker 2: That's a beautiful thing.  See, that's good.  We did it.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
