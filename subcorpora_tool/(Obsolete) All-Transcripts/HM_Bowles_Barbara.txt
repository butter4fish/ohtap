Story_ID: 3722
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's name and spell that for us and her date of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother is Rebecca Jennings, J-E-N-N-I-N-G-S.  She was born in Selma, Alabama.  Actually she was born in a small town near Selma.  And she was born in 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father?
Speaker 2: My father is deceased.  He died in 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well can you state his name and spell it?
Speaker 2: His name was Corris Landers.  Corris, C-O-R-R-I-S, Landers, L-A-N-D-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have any idea when he was born?
Speaker 2: 1920.  He was also born that year.
Speaker 1: And was he born in Selma as well? Or--?
Speaker 2: No.  My father was born in another town in Alabama.  I don't know exactly where.
Speaker 1: Now, do either one of your parents have stories about their backgrounds? Stories that are interesting or you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well I think they had an interesting background in that they met in college.  And they were both the first of their generation to go to college.  They met at Tuskegee University [Tuskegee, Alabama]  And for various reasons they left Tuskegee and decided to join the war effort right after they were married.  They were married in 1941.  And, of course, we had Pearl Harbor in December of that year.  And both of my parents volunteered for the service.  So my mother was one of the first African American WACs [Women's Army Corps].  In fact she was one of the first WACs.  My father was also in the service.  And they thought that--both of them I am told thought that those were two of the most fascinating years of their life 19--1942 to '45 [1945].  So I guess three years there.  My father did get two or three medals.  I know he got two bronze medals.  And my mother served distinguishedly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They served in which theater of war? Were they in Europe or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My father was in European theater.  My mother did almost all of her service here in the United States, building plants, making--helping to form munitions and working as a nurse helper.  In primarily I think Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do--Did either one of them have stories about slavery days from their grandparents or great grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know.  They were sort of children of the 20th century.  However my mother came from a family where we could trace our history back to the slavery days.  And because they grew up in rural Alabama, there is a lot of information.  Our family owned about 150 acres in Alabama.  And we had our own church and our own graveyard.  And when you go to the graveyard, what's interesting is that you can see burials all the way back to about 1870.  We believe that the family name "Bonham" was the name of one of the masters of the relatives a few--you know, several years aback.  But that's about as far as--as I know in terms of history.  What was also interesting though as I was growing up is that we were growing up in a time where we could go to my grandmother's house during the summer.  And we realized that there were no inside bathrooms, there was no telephone, there was nothing.  She was--but she was surrounded by homes that had some of that.  And I used to ask her, "Well Grandmother, why don't you have a bathroom? And why can't you get a phone?" and she said, it was because the--the city--the county they lived in was Wilcox County.  Would not allow African Americans or blacks to have that. So it was probably in the '50s [1950s] before we were able to get inside plumbing and able to get a telephone.  So to me that was very interesting.  Because I grew up with all of that, you know, at my fingertips.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--Now on--But was it on your mother's side or your father's side that the Bonhams (ph.) were, you know?
Speaker 2: The Bonhams (ph.) were on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was an only child who primarily grew up in an urban community.  He grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  And because he died at such a young age and I didn't get to learn very much about him.  Except that he was the president of the Veterans Club at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  I do--I did hear about that.  He studied to be a minister.  And actually became a minister before he passed away.  But he was an only child.  And so we don't know much about their family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did he pass away?
Speaker 2: My father was killed.  He was visiting a sick person I guess in a home or a hospital.  I'm not sure.  And it was a female person.  And this person's husband was mentally ill and deranged and just shot him.  We never found out if there were any nefarious reasons why he was shot.  But he was shot.  And he actually bled to death.  He couldn't receive help in time.  And he was thirty-one years old.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  How were you when your father was passed?
Speaker 2: I was three years old.  My mother ended up having to raise three children ages two, three and four by herself for--until--at least until I was ten and she remarried.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well were you raised in Nashville?
Speaker 2: I was raised in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They both went to--after the war went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] on the GI Bill.  And my father graduated from Fisk.  My mother ended up graduating from Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and they settled in Nashville.
Story_ID: 3723
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about the neighborhood you lived in and maybe about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in that neighborhood in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Nashville was interesting.  Because it really truly was a college town.  And we really lived on the cusp of that community.  My father as you know, died at a young age.  And so my grandparents--his parents came to live near us.  And my grandfather owned a grocery store right across the street from the local high school, Pearl High .  And I worked in his store and got to hear all the jukebox music before anybody else.  And was able to kind of hang out with the high school kids when I was, you know, still a preteen.  And that to me was fun.  We also lived right across the street from the local funeral home.  And we lived right down the street from Fisk University.  So there was a lot of culture in my life growing up.  Because my mother [Rebecca Jennings Landers] had gone to Tennessee State [University], I was able to participate in a lot of the activities that went--that took place at both of the schools.  Consequently when I was growing up, I was in two dance groups--I participated in what was called Children's Theater at Tennessee State.  It was a thespian group, but you could do it as a young child.  I played the violin and the piano.  And my brothers played the trumpet.  So I had to play that too.  And it was--It was great growing up in Nashville.  I guess the only thing from the entertainment point of view that we didn't do was go to the local theater.  And that was because we had to go up the back steps, and my mother would not allow that.  So we never went to the movies.  Probably until I was--I think eleven years old when I--she finally relented and let us see 'The Ten Commandments'.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you all have to sit in the balcony to see 'The Ten Commandments'?
Speaker 2: We actually did.  And, therefore, our family chose not to ever go back to that theater or the movies again.  We never did.  We never went back.  When Nashville Theater became integrated--when I was in college actually--I think that may be the time that I went later.  And then only occasionally, I always felt uncomfortable.  Interestingly enough, the theaters didn't do very well at the point of integration because African Americans chose not to participate.  They didn't go.  And so to this day, there are very few theaters in Nashville proper.  Most of them are in the malls way out in the suburbs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had our own way of, you know, boycotting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the other recreational things you'd do in Nashville?
Speaker 2: Well we went swimming at Tennessee State, because there were no local swimming pools.  I think by the time I was ten there was a park pool.  One park pool that we could all go to in my neighborhood which was generally closed.  It wasn't open frequently.  So that was difficult.  But when it was open we did go swimming.  I learned to swim at a young age.  I always went to camp, church camp usually.  I was very active in my church as a child and still am.
Speaker 1: What denomination were you?
Speaker 2: I was a Baptist growing up.  And we attended Sunday school, church and what the--and there was a night--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) BTU?
Speaker 2: BTU--Baptist Training Union.  You're right.  Every Sunday.  And so that's where we met most of our friends.  If not in school, then we met them at church.
Story_ID: 3724
Speaker 1: Did you like school, and where'd you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to [James M.] Head Elementary School [Nashville, Tennessee], which was right down the street from my house.  So I could walk to school every day.  And that was a school from first grade to sixth grade.  And I loved school--and I loved all my teachers.  I also went to junior high.  The junior high was called Washington Junior High.  It no longer exists in Nashville.  And I went to Pearl High [School, later Martin Luther King Jr. Magnet School, Nashville], which was one of three African American high schools in Nashville.  And those were our only choices.  But Pearl High School was one of the best schools in the city at that time. Bar none.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I assume that Washington School was named after Booker T.  Washington.  Was it or?
Speaker 2: It's not clear.  It could have been George.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I just know that the name of the school was Washington (laughs) Junior High.
Speaker 1: And what about Pearl now? Do you know who Pearl High School was named for?
Speaker 2: I don't know who Pearl was named for.  But Pearl was a famous school from back in the early 20th century.  I have--I have relatives who had gone to that school as far back as 1915.  And there is still a Pearl [Cohn Comprehensive Business] Magnet [High] School in Nashville which takes the name of Pearl High.  But it's not the same school.  But Pearl was famous for winning all the football championships and all the basketball championships and having some of the smartest students.  And most of us were very proud to be members of Pearl High.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the teachers that stood out in junior high? And you say you loved them all.  But there has to be some that probably stood out more than--?
Speaker 2: Well I think my math teacher stood out most.  I had a eighth grade math teacher who was wonderful.  And I had a high school math teacher who was not only wonderful, but when I went home recently to Nashville he actually came to hear me speak.  So he's still very proud of his students.  His name is Mr. Smith.  But that was my favorite subject.  And it was nurtured by those teachers.  And what they did went beyond school.  I mean they enrolled us in all of the statewide tests.  So that we could compete with everyone.  Not just people in the--in the city.  And generally speaking in high school, Pearl high students did extremely well.  In junior high, I think I first became aware that I liked math in eighth grade.  And so that teacher really is a--has--is one that I remember most.  And she is still in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It sounds like it was a fairly strong community with the two schools there in town and, you know,  a lot of emphasis on education.  Can you--Can you tell us about any of the community leaders in Nashville during those days? Or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well generally speaking, the community leaders were your teachers, both in the local schools that represented high school and elementary school.  But the--the true leaders were probably the college professors and the college presidents.  And I remember Stephen [J.] Wright was the president of Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] during my high school years.  And I even remember Charles [S.] Johnson during my elementary school years as being the president of Fisk and being a real lightening rod in the community.  I don't remember the presidents of Tennessee State as well.  But I do remember that they also were very successful leaders in the Nashville community.  And I do remember one of the presidents because he was a friend of our--one of the vice presidents, (ph.) Alger Boswell, who was a friend of our family.  And who was instrumental in involving me in Children's Theater.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  What kind of plays would you--did you all--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Did we put on?
Speaker 1: Perform in?
Speaker 2: Okay.  What do I remember? I mean they were--they were young peoples' plays for the most part.  And some of the names actually escape me now.  I remember doing 'Hansel and Gretel'.  And--(thinking) Let's see what else do I remember? There was another play that we did called 'Tom Thumb'.  I remember that.  And I remember that I wanted a role in--what's the black play that--'Raisin in the Sun'.  We did 'A Raisin in the Sun' several times.  And--but that was later.  You know, that was probably around my high school years.  And by that time I was moving out of children's theater.  So I didn't get a role in that play.  But I went to see it several times during college and in high school.  But they were--you know, that was the place that you went just for entertainment that didn't cost very much money, without having to go downtown.
Speaker 1: So that's great.  And they're, you know, I don't hear many stories of you know, black theater.  You know, theater groups for young people.  You know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well we did--we did have that.  but we also had the Jubilee Singers at Fisk .  And they would entertain us--probably monthly.  And we would--and that was usually a free concert.  So you could also go and hear them.  We had the childrens' choir, which I sang in.  I sang in the--well I actually sang in the Pearl High School choir but it sang all around the city.  We also had the band.  And I was in the band.  I actually got put out of being in the band.  Because I played the violin and I cut up to much.  So I got fired from that job.
Speaker 1: It was a concert band?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a concert band.  It was a wonderful band.  And, in fact, one of the persons who was in the band today is a noted conductor in the country.  The top black female conductor was in the band with me.  And, you know, I say, "Gee, if I had just stayed in the band, what could I be today (laughs)?" So.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her name? (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Roberts--Kay Roberts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So--well--what were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Well obviously math.  But I also like science courses and biology.  My worst subject was English.  I hated it.  I enjoyed reading.  But I didn't like what we were learning in English.
Story_ID: 3725
Speaker 1: While you were in high school [Pearl High School, Nashville, Tennessee] there were a lot of--there were sit-in demonstrations in Nashville [Tennessee].  Students from Fisk [University] and Tennessee State [University].  I know Dianne Nash who lives in Chicago [Illinois] now was there.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And James Bevel and--.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: There were other people whose names I can't remember now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the [U.S.] Congressman from Atlanta [Georgia].  He was there then.
Speaker 1: John Lewis.
Speaker 2: John Lewis was there.  [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] would come to Chicago--come to Nashville often.  And my mother [Rebecca Jennings Landers] would always go to the meetings.  But when we were in high school--and this was primarily when I was in eighth and ninth grade.  I graduated from high school at sixteen.  So a large part of this was going on while I was in junior high [Washington Junior High School, Nashville, Tennessee].  We were not allowed to participate.  The only thing that we could do--and this was my mother's point was, "If you don't go downtown to the movie theaters, if you don't go into Woolworth's , or any of those places, then you're doing your part.  And if you go get on the bus, sit in the front."  So those were the things our family was told to do.  But we were not allowed to actually participate in the sit-ins or do any of the marches.  Then when I got to college, that was a different story.  But that's how it was when I was growing up.  My mother was always very concerned about us getting into trouble.  So, you know, her rule was, "I'll do the sit-ins.  Not you."
Speaker 1: Okay.  What would happen if you sat on the front of that bus?
Speaker 2: Oh, they would stare at you.  And, you know, wonder why you were there.  But, you know, by that time, you could sit on the front of the bus.  We had had no boycotts in Nashville to stop--you know, I think  you had already had the Alabama situation sort of change the whole world.  And though most African Americans were still going to the back of the bus, those of us who were very young refused to do that.  And all we would get were stares primarily.  Or we would--usually if you sat down next to a white person he would get up and leave.  He would move to the other side of the bus.  That was okay.
Speaker 1: Is Nashville in any way different from some of the other Southern cities in that respect? I mean?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was just as--you mean in terms of the level of racism in Nashville?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Or the--'cause I've heard that Little Rock [Arkansas] for instance was more liberal (unclear).
Speaker 2: A lot of people think that Nashville--.
Speaker 1: Even though they had the school situation.  It was more liberal.
Speaker 2: I don't think Nashville was more liberal.  I think what made Nashville more cultured was the fact that it was a college town.  But back in those days Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee] was the worst school you'd ever heard of in terms of its conservatism.  And that was the center of white society.  So I mean we were in two different worlds.  And yet the schools were--less than a mile apart.  All of them.
Story_ID: 3726
Speaker 1: As you matriculated through school, did you have any idea what you wanted to do when you were (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a clue.  I knew that I didn't--I really believed that I didn't wanna be a teacher.  My mother [Rebecca Jennings Landers] was a teacher--a life long teacher and she really wanted me to major in education.  And I felt that I did not have the aptitude or the patience to work with children.  So I didn't wanna be a teacher but I didn't know what I wanted to do.  Most of my teachers in high school [Pearl High School, Nashville, Tennessee] wanted me to major in math in college and then go ahead--go to graduate school and get a Ph.D. in math.  And I think that's what I thought about doing most of my years of college [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Because I did major in math.  My music teacher actually wanted me to major in music and I didn't see a future in it so I absolutely refused to do it.  But by the time I became a senior in college, I didn't really see a future in math either.  I mean I didn't know what to do with it.  And I think I had concluded that I didn't want to get the Ph.D.  So I have to honestly say that I graduated from college not being sure of what I wanted my life's work to be.
Story_ID: 3727
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any idea of what you wanted to when you graduated from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Well what direction did you take when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well as I said I did major in math.  You know, that just seemed like the obvious thing for me to do given my background.  And I had made straight A's in math in high school--and graduated at the top ten percent of my class.
Speaker 1: Were you the--well did you--well you graduated with honors from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated with honors from high school [Pearl High School, Nashville, Tennessee].  I think I was number seventh in the class out of 350 students.  And that was in--And that was all the achievement I wanted.  I mean I wasn't trying to be valedictorian or salutatorian or anything like that.  I was very surprised that I graduated at that level.  So I went to high--college with very high hopes that I would do well.  And I found Fisk to be a very hard school.  And the subject that I did best in was math and I must--I think acknowledge that I graduated in math with all A's the whole four years.  That was the only subject I graduated with in all A's.  All my other subjects I was primarily a C student.  Maybe a B-  student.  So while I graduated with honors in math, I didn't graduate with honors in anything else.  I was glad to get out.  And I thought Fisk was a very good place to be in terms of being the school of hard knocks.  I mean if you wanted a really good education, you could get it at Fisk.  I also found Fisk to be extremely nurturing.  So that the people that I talked to both my professors, my counselors, etc.  essentially told us not to worry about what you weren't majoring in or worry about what you wanna do in life.  It will generally come to you.  So  it didn't occur to me to worry about it.  What happened my senior year was that I was recruited primarily by companies that were interested in science and math backgrounds.  So I was recruited by IBM .  I was recruited by a few other corporations.  And I was recruited by First National Bank of Chicago to go on a special program called the First Scholar Program.  And because I always wanted to live in Chicago--my then boyfriend was here--I decided  to take the job.  That was--It was as simple as that.  And I actually regretted not going to work for IBM, because by that time most math majors were going into computer science.  But again, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so this seemed like an opportunity for me.  The other thing about the job at First National Bank of Chicago Scholar program was that they sent you to business school.  And I felt that since I wasn't ready to decide my life's work that having the opportunity to work and go into business school would be a good decision.  So with the help of my mother [Rebecca Jennings Landers], that was the decision I made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what school did they send you to?
Speaker 2: I went to University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Well that's impressive (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Well I think my math background was very helpful in that.  And, in fact I did make good math grades at U of C.  and I didn't do particularly well any other subject.  But I did well in corporate finance.  That was my major.  I did well in all the math courses.  And you know, I sort of C'd out the other courses.  Which was okay for U of C.  which was a very--again a tough school.  But I didn't think that graduate school was any tougher than college for me.  You know, it was about the same.  And I think that says that I got an excellent background at Fisk.  And I graduated generally on time at U of C.
Story_ID: 3728
Speaker 1: It's interesting a lot of people say that when they go to a school like University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--,
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and they've been to a you know, good black college.  Think it's about the, you know.  About the same in terms of being tough.  You know what I mean.
Speaker 2: Well I didn't--I didn't feel I missed anything going to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  When you finished Fisk you felt like you could take on the world.  And so when I started at U of C [University of Chicago] I didn't think it was any big deal.  I did have to settle down a bit.  I mean I was in--being in a bigger city in Chicago was harder to me than going to school. That was extremely tough.  Nashville is a small town compared to Chicago.  And getting used to the big city was hard.
Speaker 1: Was it--do you think--Was it difficult or distracting? You know, or both?
Speaker 2: I thought it was difficult to get around.  I mean the--you know, the city is just so large.  I found it difficult to drive in.  You know, I was afraid half the time.  And I came to Chicago in 1968, when we had the Chicago riots.  And so I had to circle around Grant Park to get home every day.  And I remember by the time the Democratic [Party] Convention was over, I was ready to leave.  I was in tears every other day.  When I started at First National Bank of Chicago I was the only African American on the--what was then called the Training Program/Scholar Program.  And we were having bomb scares.  I mean it was a--It was a very interesting time.  It was almost worse than the boycotts that we were all on in college.
Speaker 1: Well how were you treated there as the only black person in the program?
Speaker 2: Interestingly.  The people that I worked with I thought were generally fair.  But the people that I did not work with never knew who we were, who any of the scholars were for that matter.  And certainly didn't know who I was.  So you would have interesting experiences like being invited to the fifty-seventh floor.  And the fifty-seventh floor was where you tended to entertain the executives of the bank, the trainees of the bank and the guests of the bank.  And since there had been very few blacks in the bank in any of those positions, i.e., guests, trainees or managers, I remember going to the fifty-seventh floor up the wrong elevators once.  And again it's my trying to figure out Chicago.  So instead of going up one elevator, I went up the other elevator.  But that was the back side of what was generally speaking the executive dining room.  And I was not the only one that did that.  There were several of us who went up the wrong elevator.  I was the-just the--there were two African American women in the group.  And the other people sort of walked through.  And as we were walking through we were stopped to ask if we were gonna be working that evening in the kitchen.  So those were kind of situations that happened.  Actually they were funny at the time.  But, you know, when I remember them now, you know, I wonder how I thought all this was funny.  The other thing that I would be required to do from time to time was to go to what is called the bank cage.  And either drop off monies, pick up documents, etc.  and every time I did that probably for the first year I was there, I had to show i.d. because nobody believed that--that  I had the job of picking up money from the cage.  So it was an interesting experience.  But I thought generally speaking it was a good experience.  I thought the bank was very fair.  And during the period of Gaylord Freeman (ph.) who was chairman of the bank at that time, I would say that he was very forward looking and a wonderful man.  I think I went to the bank at exactly the right time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I stayed thirteen years.  I finished my MBA at University of Chicago and I gradually proceeded up the corporate ladder.  I left the--when I finished my scholar program, you were to select where you wanted to work for most of your career.  And by that time I had figured out what I wanted to do.  And so in 1971, I joined the trust department as an investment analyst.  And I did that for more or less the whole thirteen years I was--the next ten years I was at the bank.  But by the time I left, I headed up the training for all of the analysts.  And I was third in command in the investment area of the trust department.

Speaker 1: We're both the AKA's, members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. And the AKA's just had their Boule in Florida in Orlando, and my mother [Rebecca Jennings Landers] and I decided we would go--.
Speaker 2: Now, now okay.
Speaker 1: As mother and daughter.
Speaker 2: Well what is a Boule?  Just for the sake of listeners.
Speaker 1: A Boule is a national convention of a sorority.  And AKA is the oldest sorority in the country.  Born in 1908.
Speaker 2: Black, black--.
Speaker 1: Black sorority.  Female sorority.  My mother actually joined the sorority after I did. So, you know, when they say, "You know, mother--daughters follow their mothers."  In my case, my mother followed me as a sorority member.  But anyway, we decided to celebrate.  And we started telling each other about some of the things that we did in our youth.  And she told me the most interesting story--I was teasing my mother about walking three miles a day now and getting a lot of exercise.  And my mother said, "I did that every day going to school."  And I said, "What do you mean you did that every day?"  She said that growing up in--and I said Wilcox County, Alabama which was near Selma, the actual city was called Camden.  And Camden had no schools for African Americans.  None.  So the only school that they were able to go to was a Lutheran school I believe it was, it was a church school of some type.  And in order for them to get there, they had to walk three miles there and three miles back.  And because their father paid so much money for those kids to go to school, my mother said they gladly did that every day.  And I said, "Well what if it rained?"  And she said, "Well if it rained, my father would come up in his horse and buggy and pick us up.  But that was the only time we ever got a ride."  And she did that until she graduated from high school.  So I said, "I'll never tell you I walked three miles a day again." (laughs)

Speaker 1: Now At First National [Bank of Chicago] there's gotta be--there has to be some stories at First National you can tell about what did blacks do (unclear).  So what are the-what I guess what was your most memorable day there?  Or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a lot of those.  I had a lot of memorable days.  I guess the thing that I remember most about First Chicago was that I truly felt that I was a role model.  And I felt that way because at every step of the way in my career, I was usually a first or usually a second.  I was the first female African American vice president elected at First National Bank of Chicago and that might surprise you because it really wasn't until 1980.  But I was the first.  What was surprising to me was how rare it not only was to me, but to others.  I will never forget attending a party--you  know when you became a VP at First Chicago, you were a full-fledged officer. When you--you had three points before you made VP.  But you were really an officer if you made VP.  And  so I was invited to a women's luncheon that day, where the bank named the most female VPs in its history.  And on that particular day, they named ten.  I was one of ten,  the other nine were white.  Prior to that, there  I think in the whole history of the bank there had only been six or seven female VPs.  So this was a luncheon that was actually put on by the women VPs themselves.  They wanted to celebrate that day and they invited all of the new VPs.  But they didn't know that I was African American.  Nor did they know that I was coming.  But I decided that they were celebrating, I was gonna come too.  And when I got to the front of the door of the entrance to the  private room that we had engaged, I was asked a question by one of the women--one of my fellow new VPs, why was I there?  And that's when I realized that we had not come very far. Not even at First National Bank of Chicago.  I was so taken aback by it, that I said, "Why do you ask?"  And--you know I kind of knew why she asked.  But she said, "Well the only people who are supposed to be here are VPs."  And I said, "Well I'm one of them and my name is Barbara Bowles and there it is."  And  she was just--she looked at me the rest of the evening totally surprised.  As though I had diminished the whole evening for them that I was in the same room with them.  And so, you know, I had a lot of experiences like that at the bank.  But they were generally coupled with great experiences.  For instance the selection itself was an exciting time for everybody in my staff.  And everybody in the trust department.  They were all very happy for me.  I realized that I fit in there.  And it's difficult to know when you fit in.  You just know it.  And that was a place where to me it was an excellent environment for me.  And so my job--I thought--was to help other blacks to come through the trust department.  And I was always looking out for an opportunity to make sure that we hired others.  And I guess the thing that I felt good about was that at the end of the day when I left the bank, even though there were very few of us in that department, there were probably ten times as many as there were when I came--which was me and one other person.  So there was a lot of joy in working in banking.  There was also some times when I had to really demand my equal treatment.  One of the things that I really felt at the bank was that I--at some point I hit the glass ceiling.  I mean in--back in those days we didn't use the glass ceiling but you know that there was a time  and when it was time for you to leave.  And what happened in my case was I was trying to get a job as head of research-director of research.  And it's a sort of an old story everybody knows it.  And I felt like I was the most qualified.  And most of the people in my department felt that way.  In part because I was already training the analysts meaning that I was doing most of the work.  And also because I had the most money under management within my group.  And finally because I was probably the second most experienced person there behind the person who already had the job.  But we had a fairly new boss who had just decided that he wasn't gonna give me the job.  And so we argued back and forth for about a year.  And finally he said to me, "Well you can try to compete for this job if you want to but you've already been very successful.  You are the highest paid black woman in the bank.  Why aren't you happy?"  and I said to him, "Because I ultimately I want your job.  And I have to get this job in order to get yours at some point."  Well, of course, that was the end of my career.  So I--eventually I left the bank which was a good move.
Story_ID: 3731
Speaker 1: Under those circumstances I'd have to agree.  So they were actually shocked that you had ambitions--the same ambitions that they would have--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I mean I think generally speaking if you--because you rose above your family--you know.  I did better than my parents [Corris Landers and Rebecca Jennings Landers].  And because you were the highest ranking person of color in the institution, certainly a female.  I mean the only person higher ranking than me at the bank [First National Bank of Chicago] when I was there was Clark Burrus.  And they probably felt he was comfortable and they felt I was comfortable.  And interestingly enough Clark Burrus became my mentor at that time because we were all looking for somebody that we could talk to or who would nurture us--and he had had a much broader career than me, but took me under his wing. And really because of my relationship with him I felt stronger in what I had to do at the bank.  And yes, I was very ambitious and--many times that did surprise them. It also surprised them when I left.  You know, they didn't think I would leave.  "I mean how could she leave?  Where is she gonna go?"  That was the--that was the attitude of the bank.  "You got the best job in town.  Why would you leave?"  And so even as I left they tried to keep me.  But I stuck to my guns and con--and left.
Speaker 1: Now so what did you do?
Speaker 2: I ended up going to work for one of my clients.  The name of the company at that time was Beatrice Foods International.  They were the largest food company in the country then.  Our sales back in those days--this was 1980 were in excess of $10 billion and our major competitor was Kraft [Foods] Inc., which was another big food company. I left to become the first professional head of investor relations. And I say first professional head. They had a lot of people playing at the job.  Usually that was a function that the CFO did or the CEO of the company which is talk to the investment community, talk to the banks about the stock, talk to various groups about investing, write the annual report, put together  the quarterly report.  All of the things that they're complaining about today that auditors do--I was responsible for putting together all of that information and then disseminating in a way in which the majority of people could read it.  That was my job.  It was primarily a marketing job, communications job and an investment financial job all rolled into one.  So it was a wonderful job for me--and I decided to take it.  It also paid a lot more than I was making at First Chicago [Bank].  And one of the thing that I wanted to do at First Chicago was see the world.  And there was no way I could do that in the job that I had there.  But I could do it at Beatrice.  We had investors all around the world.  And I was able to knowing--knowingly take a job that would allow me to go to Europe every year and other places.  So it was an excellent opportunity for me.  And I took the job three and a half years.
Story_ID: 3732
Speaker 1: Tell us about your travels (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well at Beatrice [Foods International] we had clients in--and when I say clients, we're talking about institutions that owned our stock in various countries.  Most of the ownership was in Paris [France], Frankfort, Germany and Scotland. And so once a year I took a trip to all three of those places to visit our clients.  And usually we also had businesses there.  So it was an opportunity for me to not only visit our clients, and to do a meeting, but it was also an opportunity for me to see how our company operated in-in this part of the world.  So I mean we--we got a chance to visit Italy while we were doing meetings--we would visit London [England].  And we generally did this at least once a year.  It was a great opportunity to learn more about Beatrice while  at the same time serving our institutional clients. Typically I took the CEO with me who made the presentation.  I was generally the person responsible for writing the speeches.  And I would set up the meeting with our operating executive. So that we could get information out of them.  It allowed me to have a close relationship with top management and, therefore,  you know--sitting at the seat of corporate America during that time was very fascinating.  And to be able to have that opportunity was just a godsend.  So I enjoyed it thoroughly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So while you were there did you get the idea to start your own--of starting your own business.
Speaker 2: No.  I actually had another job in between that.
Speaker 1: Oh you did.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But let me just say why I left Beatrice.  Beatrice was a company that was an acquirer--acquiring company.  And its really a very familiar kind of company today.  It's the company that that they now call a  roll-up company.  Which means that in order to grow, you generally have to make acquisitions.  And we made many of them every single year.  Beatrice was a company that owned such things as Tropicana orange juice, Culligan water, Samsonite luggage.  We had 500 businesses.  And, of course, being the head of Investor Relations I was supposed to know a little something about all 500 businesses.  But we also had a very ambitious chairman who could not see enough.  He kept--he continue to want to acquire.  And at some point, we looked at a company that was almost as big as we were.  I think the company at that time was called Esmark [Inc.].  And they owned things like Swift Foods, Swift Sausage, Hunt's-Wesson tomato paste, etcetera. And he made the decision to acquire this company.  It was very controversial.  I was having difficulty with the acquisition because I did not know  how to explain to our clientele that this was an acquisition that would add value.  And obviously if you're not adding value, the stock's not gonna go up.  It was also a very diluted acquisition.  And so a lot of us had discussions with the then chairman about this.  But he was adamant about doing the deal.  I stayed through the completion of the acquisition but decided for my own growth career-wise, I wanted to work for a company that I felt more comfortable with.  And so while I was sort of thinking about all of this, Kraft [Foods Inc.] called me and said that they were looking for a Vice President of Investor Relations.  I had also decided--my husband [Earl Bowles] and I--to adopt a child.  So we adopted Terry [Bowles] around the three and a half year mark at Beatrice [Foods International]. And I decided to take at least a month off to just be with the young man at home.  While this was happening, Kraft was negotiating with me about coming to work for them.  And my biggest fear of leaving Beatrice at that time was that it was a comfortable place to work, in terms of being convenient.  It was right downtown.  I lived in Dearborn Park--but it was not comfortable from an operating point of view.  And I had always admired Kraft.  One of the things that they were willing to do was to be extremely flexible about my baby in terms of when I would get there--when I would come home.  And I felt that career-wise it was a step up for me. I was going to be made full corporate VP [vice president].  I was gonna be able to sit on the policy making committee.  And there was a nice raise.  And back in those days stock options were rare to get.  And I was gonna get a lot of stock options.  So I took the job and never really looked back.  It was a--that was the best thing that I did.  Less than a year later Beatrice was taken over by another company.  And so Beatrice as I knew it is now history.
Speaker 1: What was that other company?
Speaker 2: It was taken over by a leverage buyout firm.  I can't think of the name of the firm right now.  But essentially what they did  was take the company over.  Remember those 500 businesses that I talked about, they split them all of up and sold them off piecemeal.  And so, therefore, there's no--there's no single company today that looks like Beatrice. ConAgra [Foods, Inc.]  I think bought most of the businesses.
Story_ID: 3733
Speaker 1: In the meantime I had been at Kraft [Foods Inc.] for a year.  And I had the opportunity to extend my-what I would call my growth in the company.  I worked on such things as listing Kraft on the Tokyo [Japan] stock exchange--so I was able to go to Japan three times and I got a side trip to Hong Kong [China] which was fun.  I also worked on dividend policy.  That was one of the things that I could have worked on at Beatrice [Foods International] but it was in the hands of the treasurer.  At Kraft, dividend policy was in the head--in the hands of the IR [investor relations] person.  I had the opportunity to sit on a couple of committees that were responsible for spinning off two companies  we owned.  Duracell batteries was one of them. The other one is a company called Premark International [Inc., Deerfield, Illinois].  I helped to spin off both of those companies.  One was actually a sale.  The other one was a spin off.  And that was a very interesting complicated thing to do.  And it was something that really helped me grow.  But I guess during about the fifth year at Kraft, Phillip Morris [Companies, Inc.] came calling and made an offer to buy the company.  And eventually we agreed to selling out to Phillip Morris. And that was the opportunity  that I thought it was time for me to now accept to start my own company.  So I was at Kraft almost five years and--probably would still be there today if it was Kraft as I knew it.  But decided to take the "golden parachute" which is what they give executives when your company is taken over--and start my own company with that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  'Cause that's a lot of money.  (unclear).
Speaker 1: It usually is some, some multiple of your salary plus your bonus.  And it certainly was more money than I had ever seen.  And I wasn't sure that I would be able to borrow the money to start my own company. And I had by this time kind of thought about that would be my next life--my next life was to start my own company.  And so it was a gift.  And I thought a gift that needed to be used well.  And so I used it to start my own company.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now how much did you actually need to start your own company?
Speaker 1: Well I put down on paper--I remember  my plan basically said, "You're probably not gonna make money for a couple of years."  You're gonna definitely need an office.  The investment management business is a labor-intensive business, meaning you can make it work.  You don't have to hire a lot of--you don't have to buy a lot of equipment.  All you need really is a good computer. You need a secretary and you need some help.  So I hired one person.  And the two of us--we were everything.  We were the secretary.  We were the bottle cleaner, the office staff.  We did everything  for six months. But with my calculations I figured it would take about $300,000 of my money to break even in approximately two years.  And I was close.  It took about two and a half years to break even.  And it took about $300,000.  So fortunately--didn't have to go to the bank.
Story_ID: 3734
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is it that you actually do if you just break it down?
Speaker 2: Okay.  We are an equity investment advisory business.  The Kenwood Group [Inc.] is.  And we--the company was started in 1989 which was approximately six months after Phillip Morris [Companies, Inc.] took over Kraft [Foods Inc.].  Kraft gave me the opportunity to either go and work in a firm that helped you to find another job or--they asked me what I wanted.  And I essentially told them that I would not mind being in a firm that helped you search for another job.  But I wanted a firm to help me search for office space, that allowed me to use their office space to start my company, and a firm that would help me nurture my business--i.e. give me some tips on how to start a business.  So I credit Kraft with doing that for me.  And, therefore, I was able to start my company, get it fully incorporated by the time I essentially left Kraft.  I left Kraft in February and started my company in March.  And basically what I had was my Kraft rolodex.  And I used that rolodex to search for clients.  And I--my clients  I knew would be interested in our philosophy.  Which was that we were primarily equity only.  We wanted to manage institutional money.  So I'm looking at companies.  We wanted to manage in a value oriented style.  Which is the same style that I had managed in when I was an analyst and a portfolio manager at First National Bank of Chicago. And my new wrinkle, i.e. my value-added, was that I wanted to manage mid-cap money. There was very little money being managed in the middle end of the market.  Most people and most companies invested only in large capitalization companies that is--companies that had big revenues, big earnings and therefore--big market prices.  There were a few clients who did look at managing--and looked at managers who managed small cap money.  I didn't feel comfortable doing that 'cause I'd never done that.  But the middle market to me was ripe to be looked at.  And so we decided to start our business by looking at  companies within a stream of market cap of between about $300--$200 million to be exact up to $6 1/2 half billion.  And that's definitely right down the middle.  Most clients bought portfolios with an average market capitalization of about $20 billion--even then.  And our average capitalization was about $2 billion and that was middle market. And that actually did--that particular philosophy was interesting to people that we talked to.  We also wanted to be very conservative in our investment style. That is we wanted to share with potential clients that we would have a portfolio where it was unlikely you would lose a lot of money--you know.  So our risk profile was  on the conservative end.  What that generally means is that you don't make a lot of money at the top end but you don't lose a lot of money at the bottom end. And what we said is that at the top end we thought we would be real close. But that generally speaking we thought that we would be able to preserve capital.  So after delivering this pitch probably a million times in my first year I finally got my first client.  And my first client was close to home.  It was Quaker Oats Company, which was one of my rolodex companies.
Story_ID: 3735
Speaker 1: I know so little about this as far as the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well let--want me to talk--I'll  talk--,
Speaker 1: Yeah,  you can (unclear).
Speaker 2: To you a little bit about how--,
Speaker 1: (unclear) --Good questions--.
Speaker 2: About how we got Quaker [Oats Company]--,
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: --and what did we do next.  Basically this is a business where you make your money on your fees.  So the first thing you have to do is you get a client.  And then the client will pay you a fee based on the amount of money that you get under management.  My goal and my plan was that in order for us to break even we probably needed $50 million  under management--back in those days.  And Quaker gave us $5 million which was to me wonderful because we could use it in our marketing strategy i.e. we could tell other people that Quaker had given us money to manage. And it was a fee.  It was a fee.  It was not enough for us to break even, but it was a start. And it was a very good start.  I mean if you want to have your first client, you want your first client to be a pedigreed client.  And so having Quaker as our first client was wonderful.  When they gave us the money to manage, we invested their money in equity.  Middle income--I'm sorry, middle market equities.  Stocks that were within the range that I talked about earlier.  $200 million up to $6 billion.  And we generally our first year had okay performance.  If your performance beats the S&P [Standard & Poor's] 500, or as some people use the Dow Jones [& Company] Industrial Average, you are considered doing well by your clients.  In our case we would have liked to have had a medium capitalization index but there was not one at the time--so generally speaking, the index that we sort of measured ourself against was the S&P 500--and we generally did well.  In so doing, we were able to get other clients so that by the end of year three--we had about--as I recall it now--about $70 million under management, which was above our break even point.  We had--we were up to three or four people who worked for the firm.  So we were now finally--we finally had a secretary.  And essentially we were beginning to make some money.  My second client was a large public client--local.  And it was in getting both a corporate client and a local public client the same year--set the stage for how we wanted to run our business which said that basically we wanted to be--not all public, not all corporate and it would be nice to have some endowment funds.  So we have a mix of business.  We have several clients about--approximately forty percent of our clients are corporate and about sixty percent are public.  I  mean--may--we have one endowment client and we would like to grow that business.  It takes a long time to build an investment business. As we speak, there are approximately twenty equity investment firms that are minority firms throughout the country.  So even though we've been in business thirteen years--this has been a tough business.  When we got into the business, there were about ten firms. And today there are only twenty firms.  Altogether minorities manage--and when I say minorities, I'm primarily talking about African American black--I'm sorry--African American men and women.  We probably manage less than $20 billion in total.  And that is a drop in the bucket of the trillions of dollars that are being managed in this country.  There are very few blacks who are studying investments in school.  And those who are studying it in school still have difficulty getting a job--so--in the business. So another one of our goals was to be able to train and hire minority investment people.  And to that end today we have a staff of ten people.  Most of whom  have a gotten a great deal of their training here.  Although for the most part they have had some training elsewhere.  And all the people that work for our firm right now are African American--I'm--and I'm, I'm proud of that because in many cases, we have lost some good people to the white--very white firms that would not have hired them before they came to work for the Kenwood Group and we don't mind sharing the wealth--you know.  On the other hand, I expect the people  that work here to be as loyal to the company as possible.  Today, we manage approximately $400 million from--at you know zero.  We started out with nothing.  Today we manage $400 million.  It's a thriving business but it's also a business that needs to be nourished and needs to grow.  And we are continuing to market our product.  And so far--we only have one product, which is that mid-cap value product we started with.  So I'm not sure that I--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that pretty thorough (unclear) explanation.  Of the twenty other groups like your--.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How many are in Chicago [Illinois]?  Are there any other (unclear)?
Speaker 2: There are one two--there are three others right here in Chicago [Illinois].  There is Ariel Capital Management, which is the largest African American investment firm.  There's Lou Holland--I think it's Capital Management.  Lou Holland Capital Management [Inc.].  And then there's a bond house called Abacus [Fund, Inc.].  Those are the other three African American firms that I am aware of in the city of Chicago and as I said, there are various other throughout the United States.  Most of which are either in Atlanta [Georgia] or New York or other places on the East Coast.
Story_ID: 3736
Speaker 1: I was asking about what these guys in these different color jackets do? (laughs) Where are they going and who are they doing it for?  And you were explaining--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You're asking about the people who work on the exchange floor.  And we--and in an equity area, why do they have different color jackets.  And generally speaking it's because they tend to work for a certain specialist firm.  And the specialist firm has certain companies that they specialize in.  They don't all trade the same stocks.  So for instance a guy in a yellow jacket may be a specialist for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and a guy in a blue jacket may be a specialist for Coca Cola [Company].  In some cases you can have specialists in companies that are very different from each other.  But it just so happens that they won the bid.  How did they become a specialist in the first place?  Well actually companies like Kraft and Beatrice hired them.  And I was responsible  for the specialists at Kraft [Foods Inc.].  Basically we look at the specialists that we would wanna work with.  We look at the track record that they've had in maintaining an orderly market for their stocks. And we made our decision on that basis.  So essentially the specialists is working for the company that it's listed as specialist for.  From the standpoint of an investment advisor, this is all transparent.  What an investment advisor does is decide what stock they wanna buy.  They send their orders to their trader in their trading room.  Their trader looks at the way  the prices are being executed and at what prices the stocks are trading at during a given day.  And when the price reaches the range at which they wanna pay, the trader will then call a broker who is either on the floor or can call the floor.  And he will call that broker who is working through the specialist to execute that order.  So it all seems very transparent--but at the end of the day, you've had an orderly transaction primarily because somebody on the floor, namely the specialist, is making sure that's an orderly transaction.  Occasionally you'll see a gap in the trading price.  And that's because either the specialist has not done his job, or there's such an imbalance that's it very difficult for him to keep an orderly market.

Speaker 1: What do you see when you look at the state of finances in the black community, what, what kind of advice would you give people in terms of investing money.  And (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well I think your asking me two questions.  What is the state of the environment for blacks in finance, as well as the state of how, how should blacks invest?
Speaker 1: I suppose so.  But I guess I'm kind of presupposing it's pretty bad. You know,  I mean the state is--I know it's not in that good a shape.  But we may not be in as bad a shape as we think we're in if we did the right thing with our money, you know (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well actually I think blacks have come a long way in the financial arena.  I've been asked that question before that if you graduated from college today, what's the best opportunity for you to go to work?  And I would say the financial market place is as good a place as any--because it's large, it's broad and blacks have become very successful in it.  So I would recommend  that  as a place to look for your first career if you will.  And, of course, having  a career in the financial market place can lead to other careers.  Look at me.  And I've had three different careers.  I've worked for a bank and from the bank I went to corporate America and after that, I started my own company.  So I think having a good broad based background in finance--starting with math if you will--and trying to work through a career in the financial market is a good place to begin.  As for investing, I think that what we all have to do is educate ourselves.  And I don't think it's just a black problem.  I think it's a problem of all Americans.  The last ten years has seen such a wonderful marketplace that people forgot that they needed to actually work at it--and that they did need to go back and read up on the companies they were investing in.  They were so quick to listen to the advice that you might hear on the radio or on television or even in the magazines, that we forgot to do our own due diligence.  And I would simply say that in terms of how to--how to invest, you've gotta invest in a fully diversified way.  That means you've gotta have some stocks, you have to have some  bonds, you have to have some money in the bank and you might even wanna have some money market funds--some funds for a rainy day.  But we've always been taught that.  It's just in the--in the last ten years we haven't done very much of it.  And we've gotta remember that risk takes a lot--that the level of risk you take depends on how long you wanna invest.  So that if you really only have a short term horizon--time horizon--you probably don't wanna put as much money in stocks.  If you think you're gonna be around for the next ten or fifteen years,  or if you don't think you need the money for that long, putting in money in--putting more money in stocks makes a lot of sense.  Because the time will mitigate your risk level.  And so I try to talk in terms of look at your risk. Look at how much risk you 're willing to take.  And let that help to determine how diversified you wanna be.  But nothing takes the place of reading a lot, educating yourself a lot about the market. And finding the right experts to work with.  And I know that 's hard but I'm not even sure we try--you know. We don't get--we don't do financial planning in our company but we encourage people to try to either find a financial planner you could trust, find a banker you can trust or if you have the time to educate yourself, you can do it yourself. But I suggest that people look for folks who do this all the time.  They have more time than you.
Story_ID: 3738
Speaker 1: What do you think will be the legacy of your business activity?
Speaker 2: Well you know--I think  about that often as I get older.  Generally speaking I would like our firm to grow and prosper.  I do not wanna see the firm end with my tenure ending.  And therefore to that end, I'm trying to develop people to be able to manage this firm beyond Barbara Bowles.  And I've--I think I've done that.  We recently hired a young president of the company who--is still in his thirties.  Who is eager--well educated.  He also has a Chicago [Illinois] MBA--similar background to my own.  Who has worked on and off at the company over its years.  He happened to be the second--or third employee of this company.  Three years later--he left and went to two other businesses and about a year ago he came back.  We have some people who've been with this firm for almost as long as I have.  One employee in particular has been with the firm eleven years.  I have another employee who has been with the firm nine years and two employees who've been with the firm over six years.  So I think The Kenwood Group [Inc.] is firmly established though small.  And that my legacy will be to make sure that it is on an even larger footing and that that footing is stable before--you know, I'll feel comfortable that--it will survive me but we're growing into that level.  I think that we have a lot to offer in terms of education and training.  And we try to do that through our mutual fund.  I think we have a lot to offer black executives who wanna work in the investment business because as we grow, we can hire more of them.  But we are not an organization that discriminates.  We have had summer interns who were white and  who've done a really great job for us and who we've even offered jobs to.  We worked with a lot of organizations outside of our own, where we really feel we're just getting the best people.  And some of these people I--Ihave worked for as long ago as when I was in corporate America. For instance the firm who helped me to establish my logo--I worked with at both Beatrice [Foods International] and Kraft [Foods Inc.].  So I'm trying to build on the past as well as build for the future and--I think we're headed down the right path. I think the other thing though that I would like to say about our firm is that we are a firm with integrity.  We're known as a firm that what we say we will do, we will do our very best to do. We do not--we believe in good relationships and in fair relationships.  We're not political particularly.  We just wanna do the best for our clients. And we try to provide excellent service. And if we've left a legacy with our clients, it's that, "The Kenwood Group  provided me good performance. And it provided me good performance with good service."  That's what we want to be known for.  And I think our thirteen-year experience with over twenty--twenty-five clients over this period of time would suggest that they would say that.  So that's how--that's is generally speaking our legacy.

Speaker 1: Is there any significance to the name Kenwood?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  Kenwood is my home location.  I live in the area of Kenwood.  I always liked the way it sounded.  In the investment business  you see a lot of companies that are named interestingly enough after streets in Kenwood.  For instance, there's a company called the Blackstone Group--believe it or not. And I don't mean the (laughs) Blackstone Rangers [Chicago-based street gang].  There's another company that I've heard of called Woodlawn Group. And so at the time that I started The Kenwood Group [Inc.] we searched throughout the state filed and there were no company named Kenwood.  And--I thought it sounded masculine if you will, but in a nice tree-like way.  i.e.--and I love trees and I love flowers and I love being outside.  So it's turned out to be a good name.  And, you know, it worked.  And it was my name.  I mean I was the one that came up with the idea.  And I like it.
Speaker 1: It sounds--it sounds sort of (unclear).  It has a nice, you know responsible kind of ring to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I like it.  I like the name of the company.  And I like our logo. And so, you know, we are--we have been consistent in our marketing strategy.  We've been consistent with who we were and we've been consistent in our look throughout the whole thirteen years.  And to me that's Marketing 101.  Which I learned in U--at U of C [University of Chicago] Graduate School of Business [Chicago, Illinois].  And I think that has stood me in good stead over these years.

Speaker 1: Do you find it difficult to try to tell people what it is you actually do and to get youths interested in this?
Speaker 2: Well it depends.  And we-It's not at all difficult to explain what you do to the audience you're selling to.  The institutional audience that we sell to is very sophisticated.  So basically we just have to tell them our point of difference--how we differ from every other firm.  You know, there are a million investment firms out there.  What makes you different?  What makes you better?  So that's easy to do.  Is it difficult to explain to young people who might wanna be in the business?  You know, I just have to believe that today young people are a lot more knowledgeable than I was when I started in this business.  It's interesting to me that I never heard of an investment firm before I graduated from college.  I didn't even know what it was.  I didn't know what inves--I mean I knew what investing in the stock market was but I didn't know that people did it. You know what I mean?  So it was sort of an--a ways away from my real knowledge. But young people today are a lot more knowledgeable about investments.  Primarily because we've had such a hot market the last ten years.  And so they are interested and hopefully they are educating themselves.  We as a team of ten people here do a lot of speaking at the schools.  So I--you know, I don't think we do them justice by thinking that they're in the same shape that I was in when I--when I got out of college.  I think they're fairly knowledgeable.  And I get a lot of resumes every day from people who really wanna get into this business.  And I have to say it's a honor to be in this business because it's still hard to get into.  It's very difficult.  No matter whether you went to Harvard  or whether you went to Fisk University.  It's a difficult business. Typically its' best to have a graduate degree in business to get into this business.  And if you have some knowledge about the firm you wanna work for either through an intern program--that would be better than just coming out of business school cold to get into the business.  It's tough to do.

Speaker 1: How does your mother [Rebecca Jennings Landers] feel about your success, and is she proud of what you've done?
Speaker 2: My mother is extremely proud of what I've done.  And one indication of her proudness was that about two months ago, her--our church--the church that I grew up in invited me back to be the Women's Day speaker. And my mother introduced me. So I'm proud to be her daughter. And she is proud of me.  I guess one of the things that we haven't talked about, but that I find interesting and is an adjunct to what I do every day, is that I do serve on a few corporate boards. And one of the corporate boards I served on--serve on is in Nashville, Tennessee.  So it's nice to be able to go home and serve in a totally different capacity than I would have dreamed of growing up.  And it's also nice because I can segue that into visiting my mother.  And so I get the opportunity to go to Nashville, Tennessee pretty often.  I also believe in giving back.  And to that end, I serve on the Fisk University Trustee Board and I serve on a few other not-for-profit boards including the Chicago Urban League.
Speaker 1: Do you have--have a sense of how you would like to be remembered?  I mean you've got a lot of life to live still.  But do have any sense of that?
Speaker 2: You know, somebody said, "If you're remembered that's better than not being remembered." (laughs) Basically I guess I just wanna be remembered as a good wife, a good mother, and a corporate leader.  And probably in that order.
