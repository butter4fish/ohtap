 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, June 12, 2015. I am in Overland Park, Kansas,  interviewing L. D. Schnake as part of the O-State Stories Oral History  Project. Thank you for joining us today.  Schnake Happy to be here.  Nykolaiszyn L. D., could you start off and tell us the year you were born and where you  were born?  Schnake I was born 1938 in a farmhouse near Stark City, Missouri, on a rainy,  muddy January day.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Schnake Well, let   s see. My dad   s grandfather emigrated from Germany, and my  mother was of English Irish descent. Kelly was her maiden name. My dad  learned to speak German before he did English because his grandmother  never did learn to speak English, so always at family gatherings they all  spoke German. He had a ninth-grade education. Due to the Depression, he  had to go to work to help survive, you might say. That didn   t mean he was  not intelligent because he was a very intelligent man. He   d always been a  farmer. I don   t know what part of my life it was, but he could do anything  with his hands. He was an excellent carpenter. During World War II, Camp  Crowder in southwest Missouri came in, and they were building a lot of  buildings. He went to work there. I don   t know the whole story, but anyhow,  they found out he was a farmer and had a farm job. They kicked him off of  the crew. Well, he had all these buildings to build because they had bought  this acreage that had nothing on it. He built all the buildings on the farm.  During the process, someone stole all of his tools. That was difficult during  World War II, to get metal of any kind. He was quite an innovator of doing  things.  5  I started going on off-farm jobs with him when I was seven years old. I was  three years old when he was building the barn. I told my mother,    When I  get to be a man, I   m going to have me a little boy. He can just go get  things,    because my dad would say,    I need x penny nail,    whichever it  would be. I learned early on what they were. He needed a certain hammer,  or he needed a certain saw, I would go get it and bring it to him. I got so  tired. On my mother   s side of the house. I was the oldest grandson, the third  oldest grandchild, as I was on both sides of the house. My granddad would  have taken his head off, if he could have gotten it off, to give to me. He  really did, I say, adore me. I was a little bitty kid, I mean I wasn   t four years  old, and he gave me my first pocket knife. He gave me my first pocket  watch. It was was one of his that was worn out, but, boy, I thought that was  really something to have a pocket watch and a knife as a little ol   kid. I did.  I think I was probably three years old, and he had to take an animal to Joplin  (I can   t remember if it was a hog or if it was a beef animal) to the  stockyards. I guess he wanted me to go with him. Anyway, I don   t know if  my folks took me down to my grandparents    house or what. I went to Joplin  with him, and he unloaded this animal. He had to go in and get his ticket, get  his check and everything. I guess I thought it was getting to be quite a long  time. This was a 1935 Ford pickup, and I got on the horn. (Laughs) I just  blew that horn, blew that horn. He came out, and he never said a word to  me. Then on the way home   this was during the noon hour, I was kind of  hungry. I don   t know where he picked them up, but he gave me a Milky  Way candy bar. I never will forget that. It was hot. I had chocolate from ear  to ear and all over my hands. He never said a word about it. I don   t know if I  got chocolate on his pickup or not. Anyway, that   s some of my early  childhood.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have siblings?  Schnake One sister. She   s twenty-two months older than I.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your mother.  Schnake My mother was the oldest of nine. She had four sisters and four brothers. I  would put it this way: she was my granddad   s first son. They had four girls,  and then they had four boys. Then they had the last girl. She was like eight  years older than her oldest brother. She was sent to the field with a team of  horses to work all day when she was eight years old. I really think that that  sort of scarred her life. She had to work so hard, and she always worked so  hard. Of course, my dad always worked so hard, too. They both worked so  hard. My granddad always said there wasn   t anything that work wouldn   t  cure. They never went to the doctor, you know.    You just need to work.     6  She graduated from high school as valedictorian of her class. Of course, she  had two brothers that did likewise. She was sixteen when she graduated.  She went to Draughon   s Business College in Springfield, Missouri. She had  to have a comptometer. You might not know what that is. I really can   t tell  you, but it was a mechanical device that did arithmetic. I think it did some  kind of accounting types of things. Anyway, I forget what it cost. She did  not have the money to buy one. She kind of got homesick, too, so that ended  her schooling there. She was an avid reader. There wasn   t a day went by that  she didn   t work a crossword puzzle. She had cancer surgery, oh, sometime  when I was living in Manhattan, which was between    71 and    84. I went  down, and she  had  just barely come to.    I want today   s paper. I want to  work the crossword puzzle.    She did. She was what I call tough but very  fair. I had a very good relationship with both my parents. I just don   t know  how a kid could   ve had a better relationship because I could talk to them  about anything. I got advice, and I treasured it and never was led astray. If  they asked me a question, I always gave the truthful answer, and that   s the  way I always operated.  Nykolaiszyn Talk to me a little bit about your early schooling.  Schnake You mean, like grade school? Well, I went to what would be considered a  country school, but it was a consolidated school district. All twelve grades in  this school started out in 1933. The building was built by WPA work. It was  a brick building, and it was two stories. My first grade teacher was the wife  of a Army officer who was stationed at Camp Crowder, and her name was  Mary Owens. She was a beautiful person. I know my mother always said  she was such a pretty person. I think that she only taught there two years,  and apparently he got shipped overseas or someplace, and she left. Then in  the second grade, I had seven different teachers because teachers were hard  to come by. Part of the time, we   d have a high school junior or high school  senior. Then we had the wife of the local grocer. They decided they needed  her to teach commerce classes upstairs. Then they got the local barber   s wife  to end out the year, and she was a very good teacher, very good teacher,  Hazel Arnold. We had a spelling contest in the county. That was in the  spring of the year.  I never will forget that. My mother bought me a new suit (I never had a  commercial pair of clothes before) to wear to that spelling contest. I still  have that suit upstairs. Anyway, I went to the spelling contest every year I  was in grade school. I think one year out of those years, I got a red instead  of a blue. Red if you missed one word or two words. Blue was you scored a  perfect paper. I graduated eighth grade, and our teacher   again, they were  short of teachers. He had not completed his bachelor   s degree. He was an  excellent, excellent teacher. His name was Bob Underwood. He   s now  retired. I was class, eighth-grade valedictorian. I never was into sports  7  because I always had problems with Strep throat. I could get sweaty, and as  soon as I cooled off, I just got myself a dose of Strep. When it came to field  sports and running and that kind of thing, we always had our annual little  deal. No one could beat me. There was one girl that we were classmates  through the fifth grade. Then her dad became principal at Carthage. We  competed on everything. She was really a nice little girl. I don   t think either  one of us could outrun the other one. It   s good to have someone to really test  you, and she could do it.  Nykolaiszyn Well, during this time, I know you were helping out your father. Did you  have a job growing up?  Schnake You mean as a child?  Nykolaiszyn Yes.  Schnake Yeah, I had a job. (Laughs) You know, we were on the farm. Early on, we  had milk cows, and I started learning to milk when I was five years old. I  had a cow to milk at night. I didn   t have to go milk in the mornings, but as I  got older, yes, I had to milk in the morning and in the night. Of course, it  was milk by hand because we didn   t have a milker at the time. We had a  breeding flock of hens, and part of my chore was to take corn at night, corn  cobs, full ears of corn, and break those ears up and throw them out on the  floor for the chickens. They   d pick the corn off of the cobs. These little  cockerels a day old cost a dollar. That was a lot of money back in those days  in the   40s. Anyway, I   d go up there at night, and this one ol   rooster, he was  so mean. He   d come after me every time. His ol   spurs were long. Anyway,  one night I thought,    I   ll fix you, buddy.    I broke off a piece of that ear of  corn. It was about three inches long, and here he came. I let loose, and I  threw as hard as I could. It hit him right in the head, and he just keeled over  on the floor. I ran to the house screaming. I said,    Oh, I killed one of the  roosters     Well, Mother or Daddy one went up to the chicken house. He   d  gotten up around. He just got kind of cold-cocked. (Laughs)  Then, (I don   t know what year it was and I was in grade school) we started  growing broilers. When I got home from school, it was to go take care of the  broilers, make sure that they had feed out and water out. We had automatic  waterers, but when they   re a day old, they   re not automatic. When we first  started, we had kerosene brooders, and one of the jobs was every morning  go out and find if there   s any dead ones and if there   s any that needed  knocked in the head because they were not going to make it anyway. I  learned early on that some things didn   t need to live. I always got to help  clean out the chicken houses, and I always dreaded it because every time I  did, I got sick, the dust. My dad basically did, too. We didn   t have  respirators back in those days. We just put a bandana around our face and  went on.  8  In high school, by that time, we   d gotten a tractor. I did anything you   d do  with a tractor, plowed and got the field ready to plant. If there   s hay to cut,  cut. The first time I ever had a team of horses under my reign, I was seven  years old. My dad was on a job, and there was something that had to be  done. I don   t know if he was working concrete or what. That alfalfa needed  mowed because we knew that it might rain. Of course, back in those days,  you looked in the sky to see if it was going to rain. He took me out there,  and I was scared to death of these horses because when I was two years old,  my mother was kicked by a colt. She came from the side of the barn, and  this colt was there. He didn   t know she was coming, and he crushed her  liver. She about died, so I was always afraid of horses. Anyway, here I was.  I was seven years old, and I wasn   t tall enough to sit on that mower seat. I  could just lean up against the shaft that held that mower seat up there. My  dad said,    Oh, don   t worry about the horses. They   ll know when to turn.  They see what   s been mowed and what hasn   t.    He was right. They could  turn a perfect square corner and not skip a blade of alfalfa.  That was my first experience at working with horses. We raked hay with a  sulky rake. Just took all the energy I had to trip that thing, you know, put  hay up, loose hay, and all of that. Then when you went to feed the cows, you  had to jerk it out of the hay mountain. When the winters were real bad, we  kept the cows in the barn overnight. You had to throw down a lot of hay and  feed them in the manger. People think that   s a hard life. Hey, it was  wonderful  I mean, I wouldn   t trade it for anything. I learned responsibility.  I had things to do, and I was counted on to do it. Like one time, I was in a  hurry, and I was at the far corner of the place. I had a spring-tooth harrow. I  was harrowing this plowed ground, and I knew I was supposed to be at the  house to milk. I looked at the time and, oh my. I just unhooked the tractor,  and I drove as fast as I could to get there. When I got there, my dad said,     Did you take the harrow out of the ground?    I said,    No.    He said,    When  you get done milking, you can walk back there and take it out of the  ground.    What he meant was,    You will remember the next time.    It  worked  I wasn   t mad. It did work. I never forgot again. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Well, you told me a little bit about education through eighth grade. What  was going on during high school?  Schnake Well, in high school I was into everything, to tell the truth. We had high  school speech and drama. We always had one-act plays, and I was always in  one-act plays. We went to contests, and, oh, I had an informative speech that  I gave once. I can remember quite well. Here you are. You   re supposed to  be describing something. Well, it was so easy for me because I was in the  FFA  Future Farmers of America , so I took the FFA jacket and held that  emblem up that year, the corn ring and the owl and everything, and  explained it. I got the rights to go to state on that. It must have been when I  9  was, perhaps, a senior because that   s when I got so sick I missed six weeks  of school. When I was a senior I had mumps, and then I got a backset. I had  a meningeal effect. I had a fever of 107 and survived it. Anyway, I was into  music, and I was into the speech and dramatics. I was into FFA, and I was  the student manager of all the athletic teams.  Again, I was FFA officer, I don   t know, two different offices. I never held  the president   s office. I didn   t make state farmer and always felt that was  political, you know, because I was asked by one of the neighboring school  district   s FFA advisor if I   d be willing to consider being a state FFA officer.  You had to be a state farmer before you could be a state officer. Well, I  didn   t get state farmer. Anyway, I still think there was politics involved with  that. That   s okay. I lived over it. I was president of my freshman class, I was  president of my senior class, and I was valedictorian of my senior class.  When I was a junior, they gave an award, the first time they had given it. It  was called the All Midway Boy and All Midway Girl Award. I got the All  Midway Boy Award, and I really think that   s one of the highest honors I  ever got in high school.  I still have it framed. Unfortunately, I didn   t frame it right, and it had a batch  of acid cardboard behind it. The papers all turned yellow on it. I still have it  framed, signed by the superintendent, who was a good friend. He was a  good friend of my family. Let   s put it this way: he knew that I worked hard,  and I was a good student. They had a problem. We had a basketball  tournament, and somebody stole stuff out of one of the locker rooms. He  asked me if I would be willing to hide behind this door with a little   the   gym  seats came down like this. It was an odd-shaped, little ol   hole room  where they could put some equipment. It had a wooden door to it, so they  drilled a hole through that door. Shaded it out so it wouldn   t ever be seen.  Here I had my eye up there, looking out to see if anybody was in there  stealing anything. Well, it happened that the night I was in there nothing was  lost. Anyway, he asked me if I   d do it, and, of course, I did it. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Were your parents very encouraging when it came to education?  Schnake My mother, particularly, yeah. Her parents, my granddad on Mother   s side, I  forget what grade he got through with school. He never got to graduate high  school, but, boy, he really put a lot of emphasis on education. He had a  batch of smart kids, too. Then my grandmother, she had taught school. This  was before the days where you had to have a college degree, but reading,  writing, and arithmetic were very important. She was good. Yeah, that  family, they all learned to read and write and do their math.  Nykolaiszyn After graduation from high school, what did you go on to do?  10  Schnake Well, when I was a junior in high school, I was on the FFA Field Crops  Judging Team. I won first place in state that year, so it automatically     entitled me    to a scholarship to the University of Missouri. I knew that I  wanted to go to the University of Missouri. Thing was, I really didn   t know  how I was going to cut the mustard to do it in terms of money. My folks just  said this:    You can do it. You know we don   t have any money to really help  you, but we got a lot of moral support.    Well, in FFA that senior year, I  ended up with two cows and a heifer for my project. They said,    Okay, we  will milk your cows, and you buy the dairy feed and pay the breeding fees.  We   ll furnish the hay and the pasture, and you get the milk check,    after the  expense had been deducted. I   ll tell you, back in those days, that was a  pretty good deal. Time I got to be a senior in college, I had sold all three  animals.  I thought my last year I was going to have to borrow some money, a  hundred and twenty-five dollars. I went over to student aid, and Mr. Allan  Purdy was the director of student aid at Missouri at the time. He   d been in  the College of Agriculture. He said,    L. D., there   s no way that you can  graduate with just a hundred and twenty-five dollars. You got to have five  hundred dollars.       No, I just need a hundred and twenty-five dollars.    He  said,    We   re going to loan you five hundred dollars, and you   ve got five  years to pay it back after you graduate.    Well, at the end of the semester, I  hadn   t used any of that five hundred dollars, and they wouldn   t take any of it  back until I had a job. As a student, when I graduated from high school, my  vo ag teacher was working on a master   s at Missouri. He was working in the  Field Crops Department on some kind of a study, and he got acquainted with  the professor who was head of the herbicide weed control project.  He came home the second weekend. He says,    I got a job for you.    This is,  like, just right after I graduated from high school. I had to get things rounded  up in a hurry to go with him on Sunday afternoon to drive back to Columbia.  Well, it was kind of hard to do because a week or so before that, my dad had  been bitten by a black widow spider, and he just about died from it. It took  six people to hold him in bed. Well, here was all the chores and stuff to be  done at home. My mother said,    No, you   ve got to go. You   ve got to go.  We   ll manage.    I did. I went up there, and my FFA advisor had me to stay  with them the first two or three weeks of summer school. Then I got me a  place to stay in the house where they were staying when they left. I started  work for sixty-five cents an hour. I didn   t have a penny one in the bank,  really. I had those animals. I got pretty homesick that summer. You know, I  was up there all by myself. There was a couple that were in my sister   s high  school class that lived there, and he was going to school. They were like  family. They would have me over to eat supper with them and things.  Boy, I walked the streets going to work in the morning, and I   d look and see  if these cars had a sticker on them that would say the city they were from in  11  southwest Missouri. I found a ride a couple of times and would get back  home that way. Then school started in the fall. I think I worked, I don   t  know if it was two weeks or four weeks and got my wages raised to eighty-five  cents an hour. That was the highest paying job on campus per hour, and  I worked hard. They knew it, and they rewarded me for it. I worked between  twenty and thirty hours every week to support myself, plus scholarships I  had. I paid my life insurance, too, and that was  25.60 every quarter. That  was, what,  102.40, something like that. My most expensive year in  undergraduate school was eight hundred and some dollars, less than nine  hundred dollars.  I didn   t drink any cokes, I didn   t eat any ice cream cones, and I didn   t run  around with girls because I knew I was there to go to school. I didn   t have  the money to do those things, and if I got in love with some girl, that would  ruin my education right there. I didn   t date, period. I had to have a date to go  to the ROTC balls because I took advanced ROTC. That   s the only two  dates I had, the two ROTC balls. Anyway, I wasn   t aware that I was  eighteen-hundredths of a point shy on my grade point average of graduating  with honors. I had a three point something, whatever it was, on a four-point  system. If I   d have known that, I would have probably tried to work a little  harder, but I was carrying maybe as many as nineteen hours a semester. I  had twenty-some hours beyond my bachelor   s degree when I graduated with  my bachelor   s. Oh, I was in the agronomy club. I was officer in the  agronomy club. I was active in the Wesley Foundation at the University of  Missouri.  I did win a lot of scholarships. The one that really was the big one was my,  between junior and senior years I got the Danforth Summer Fellowship.  That was five hundred dollars towards my senior year in school plus a  month, maybe you   re familiar with the Danforth Summer Fellowship. Okay,  we spent two weeks in Saint Louis at Ralston Purina because Mr.  William   Danforth was the man behind Ralston Purina. We got to meet a lot of  people, took us lots of different places. Then from Saint Louis, we went to  Muskegon, Michigan, to the American Youth Foundation   s boys    camp for  two weeks there, and you got a mixture of people from everywhere there.  That was all paid for. I mean, that didn   t cost me anything. It was really nice  because I met some people who became big boys like Joe Coffey from  Purdue that became Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. I met Earl Butz at  that particular summer activity. He was dean at Purdue and became  Secretary of Agriculture.  Kind of interesting sidelight on that was I saw him several years later at our  ag econ meetings, our national meetings. I went up to him, and I said,    Dr.  Butz, I don   t know if you would remember me or not, but I met you in 1959  at the American Youth Foundation camp in Michigan.       Where are you  from?    I said,    Missouri.       Oh, yeah  L. D. Schnake.    That man had a  12  photographic memory, I swear. I met people like that. I met the Vice  President of Bordens and other people I met. It was like you   d been exposed  to a new world, and you actually had access. I contacted some of those  people. I mean, to be the vice president of the company and write some little  joker down here who is a senior in college, and they did it. I guess it gave  me some confidence because I had to do a lot of that in my work later.  Nykolaiszyn What was your major at    Missouri ?  Schnake The first scholarship I had that was outside of this first scholarship I was  telling you about that I got when I was junior in high school was I could get  a scholarship in poultry science. I was a poultry major, but really I was  general ag, taking all the biological sciences I could take. The chairman of  the Poultry Department was my advisor, very, very good man, Dr. Ernest  Funk. He pushed me. First semester, he had me taking geology. I hadn   t had  any chemistry courses or anything. He said,    Oh, no. You can do it. I know  you can do it. I want you to take it.    I did; made a B in it. I wasn   t  dissatisfied with that. He always just pushed me. I took two courses in  physics, which most ag students didn   t take physics, period. I took all the  chemistry I could take. I took, at that time they called it bacteriology, which  now I think they probably call it microbiology, and zoology and botany and  all those things. Yet, to this day I use that. Big payoff. I got an education  that most ag economists didn   t have because they were going straight ag  econ. I was always amused that they were so narrow. They really, in my  opinion, were too narrow. It did help me in my research a lot because I  understood a lot of these processes that these people didn   t.  Nykolaiszyn What year did you graduate from Missouri?  Schnake Nineteen sixty.  Nykolaiszyn Did you know you wanted to go on for a master   s degree?  Schnake Yes.  Nykolaiszyn How did you end up coming to Oklahoma State?  Schnake Well, it   s a long story. I went through advanced ROTC, so I got  commissioned as a lieutenant, US Army. At that time, the University of  Missouri was what they called a branch school, artillery, so we learned  everything artillery in our advanced ROTC. When we were getting our  commission, we were asked to list our priorities of which part of the Army  we   d like to be in. I put artillery because that   s where my training had been.  I don   t know how long it was after I graduated, I got my orders to report to  Fort Sill on January 21 of 1961. That was the day after my birthday. I went   through  the officer   s basic course that all the ROTC commissioned officers  13  had to go through. It was just kind of boring in a way because it was rerun of  what I   d had for two years. Just before I went in the Army (it was between  Christmas and reporting date) I got mononucleosis. I was sick, really sick,  and I had to go down there. I just went to bed. I didn   t study. I couldn   t. I  just had to get all the rest I could get.  My good friend at the University of Missouri (his name was Larry Gray), we  both got the same reporting date. He came down and stayed overnight with  my folks and I, and we drove down to Fort Sill together. We weren   t in the  same section of class, but Larry was a real sharp guy. He was a biochemistry  major. I forget where he ranked in class, pretty high. I wasn   t up there. That  wasn   t my goal. I was just trying to get through, you know. Then after I got  out of the basic course, I got assignment to Fort Sill. It was a school support  unit, Honest John nuclear missiles, so I got additional training in nuclear  warheads and stuff. I guess you would say I complained every day I was in  the Army, but it was a good experience. I enjoyed it, and I learned a lot.  They tried to get me to stay in, put me on the advanced list for promotion  and all these things. I said,    No, I   m in for two years, and that   s it.     I was going to go back to the University of Missouri, and I was going to  major in food science. Well, I get out of the Army January 22 of    63. My  dad had to have three major surgeries that year. I had to stay at home and  take care of things on the farm. Dr. Funk had told me before I left the  university, he said,    Now, when you get ready to come back to graduate  school, you can work on anything you want.    Being a fair-haired boy, it   s  not the greatest place to be. I get up there that fall, and a major professor I  was going to have had seven new master   s candidates, and he had two  working on PhDs. I was told what I was to do. I was going to have to make  direct microscopic counts to determine the bactericidal effects of a certain  egg protein on bacteria. I stated,    I can   t do direct microscopic counts  because of my eyes.    A man on my committee who   d done a lot of work at  Purdue,    No, you don   t need to do direct microscopic counts. We can do this  with color analysis, and there   s no statistical difference in the outcomes.    I  said,    That   s great      Boy, I had my proposal all written up and everything. Here   s the day I   m  giving it before all the faculty of the department and the whole committee  and all the graduate students. Right in the middle of my presentation, my  major professor said,    It stinks, and I don   t want to hear any more of it.     Well, I knew what that meant. I was out of there. I mean, he wasn   t going to  accept anything I proposed. At the end of the semester, six of us resigned.  Seven years later, when I was stationed at Manhattan with ERS  Economic  Research Service , I talked to this fellow who was on the staff at K-State  and had done his PhD  under Doc . I said,    What was going on with him  back there?    He said,    You didn   t know?    I said,    I just know he couldn   t  have gotten along with the devil.    He said,    Well, remember he had those  14  three little stair-step girls, pretty, little blonde-headed girls?       Yeah.    He  said,    His wife had cancer in both breasts, and he was about to go out of his  mind.    I said,    Yeah, I understand he was about out of his mind.     He  Doc  asked me,    Can you tell me what   s wrong?    Back then, I was  resigning. I had to be very frank with him. I said,    Doc, you   re older than I  am. If you can   t figure it out, it won   t do me any good to tell you.    Here I  was. What was I going to do? A friend of mine, (he was on the faculty) he  said,    It isn   t going to do you any good to try and stay in biochemistry  anyplace because you   re going to get blackballed.    I went to testing and  counseling for six to eight weeks, and I took tests. I tell you I never took so  many tests in my life to try to find out where I possibly fit, my personality  and my background, so forth. Well, the end of that was either engineering or  mathematical economics. I hadn   t had any engineering courses. I don   t think  I want to go there. I   d only had one course in ag economics that was  required, so that coming semester and the summer school, I was taking  economics courses like crazy to qualify for graduate school in economics. In  the process, I needed some work to do because I didn   t have any income.  I got a student labor job in the Department of Ag Economics. Their office  was in a house that was the first house that Dan Devine had when he came  to Missouri. You go in the front door, and on the right side was this room,  and on the left side was a room. There was kind of a partition there. Then  you looked right up the stairs, and they had rooms up there. Well, I worked  over here on the right-side room, and over here on the left side were three  secretaries that worked. I was working as many hours as I could with the  hours I was taking. This nice, young girl always had a smile on her face, and  she was so pleasant and treated everybody so nice. She was very efficient,  you could tell. It got to be after Valentine   s Day, and I said,    I think I   ll  invite her for a date.    She went. She come on a date. First date, I take her to  the door. She had tears in her eyes. She said,    I love you.    What do I do  now, Coach? We got married in August. This August we will have been  married fifty-one years. Now, that was one of the greatest derailments I ever  had. I thought I really had been jolted. I met my future that I wouldn   t have  found otherwise. They can say all they want, but God works in strange and  mysterious ways because she is wonderful.  Nykolaiszyn That   s amazing.  Schnake I applied for graduate school in ag economics, and I wanted to go to the best  schools. I applied at Purdue. I applied at Minnesota. I applied at Missouri  because I thought, you know, it would be easy to stay, stay there. I don   t  know, K-State and I don   t know where else, some that were close but some  good schools. I really wanted to go to Purdue, but I didn   t get anything from  them. I went to K-State and said,    No, that   s not where I want to go.    I got  turned down at Missouri. The reason I got turned down was one of the men  15  she was working for, old enough to be her dad, he was in love with her. She  didn   t know anything about it. He was going to make sure I didn   t get an  assistantship in that department. That was a good favor. Had I have, he  could have wrecked me real quick. I went down to Stillwater. They offered  me an assistantship. I went down to Stillwater, left home real early one  morning, southwest Missouri, and I drove down there and stayed all day and  drove back that night. I was really impressed. I really did like it.  The people were so nice, made you feel at home, and obviously it was a  very good school. The campus was beautiful, and it seemed optimal. I got  home, and I don   t know what time of the morning it was. My mother and  dad said,    Well, what   d you think?    I said,    I know where I   m going to  school.    (Laughs) We   d been in Stillwater about, oh, four or five days, and I  get a phone call. The man on the other end of the line says,    Well, I guess I  know what you   ve done, and this call is probably needless.    He   s calling  from Purdue, said they were offering me an assistantship. I was very glad to  be at Oklahoma State, and I   m very glad that I stayed there and that I went  ahead and got my PhD there, too. It was a wonderful experience. We love  Stillwater, and we loved our church and lots of good friends in graduate  school. Our Sunday school class basically was made up of ag econ people.  (Laughs) I tell you we, had big Sunday school classes. Every one of them,  boy, new graduate student go,    Hey, you going to church?       Mmmm.        Well, come, go on with us.    When we were getting ready to leave down  there, said,    Well, you can   t leave until you get a replacement.    Well, we  got replacements. We got two people, new graduate students in ag econ.  Nykolaiszyn When you moved to Stillwater, where did you live?  Schnake Well, that   s a good story, too. One night, I was taking Barbara home from  work. She needed to stop by the grocery store. It was a Safeway store, if I  recall, in Columbia, and we were walking out of the parking lot of the store.  Here comes this fellow who was a graduate student in ag econ. He said,     Hey, guess what? Here   s what the two of you need.       Well, what   s that?     He had this paper, piece of paper, eight-and-a-half-by-eleven advertisement.  He said,    This trailer is where I live, and it   s for sale. This lady and her  husband got a divorce,    and they had this trailer down on Lake of the  Ozarks. I think the lady ended up with the trailer. She wanted to get rid of it.  She moved it to Columbia, and she rented it that year. It was like two or  three years old, like brand new, Detroiter, one of the best trailers made at  that time. I said,    What does she want for it?    He said   what was it he said?     I think you can get it for thirty-five hundred dollars.    It costs almost eight  thousand new. I said,    Can you hold that paper? I want to call my dad.    I  took Barbara home. I called my dad, and I said,    Look, here   s this trailer.  It   s available for thirty-five hundred dollars. Is there any way you could  float me on that?    He said,    I   ll go to the bank tomorrow and see.     16  He had to put on there seven registered jersey cows and I don   t know what  else as collateral, and he got me a loan. We got that trailer. We moved it  from Columbia to Stillwater, and we lived in Berry Trailer Park. When we  left there, we sold it for thirty-seven hundred dollars, but it had been  completely redone on the inside, all new furniture and everything. We didn   t  lose any money. We didn   t pay out rent. We didn   t have anything to show  for it. That   s where we lived. That was good, too. A graduate student in the  Ag Econ Department, when I went down there, told  Odell Walker  I would  be living in a trailer and needed a trailer park location. Odell Walker was his  major professor,    Well Charles can take care of that.    Charles Cox was his  name. Charles was given the assignment to find me a place to park that  trailer. That   s how they did things. They got me a place and I got the trailer  hauled (pulled) down to Stillwater. We got married on a Sunday, and a week  from that Sunday, we were in Stillwater. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about the professors you remember at that time.  Schnake When I got there, Kenny Boggs was one of the professors that was there. He  was teaching undergraduate courses. Outstanding teacher. He was only there  the first year, and he left and went to the University of Missouri. Luther  Tweeten was there, and he was their policy man. Odell Walker was  production economics man. Loris Parcher was land economics. Leo Blakley  was into marketing. John Franzmann was into marketing. Oh, I   m trying to  think of his name right now. I can see his face. I can   t recall it. Anyway,  that   s the core of the department. Oh, John Goodwin was there. He was  teaching undergraduate courses. He was also on my master   s committee. All  very, very good people.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about you master   s research.  Schnake Okay, my master   s I did under John Franzmann. It was on non-slaughtering  beef processing plants. I worked with an industrial engineer from Ag  Research Service who was stationed in Stillwater, and it took forever to get  my data.  James  Plaxico, who was chairman of the department was wanting  to know why it was taking me so long, wasn   t I doing anything, or whatever.  Well, I was relying on these people to make the drawings for the plant and  sort of answer my questions as to what I needed to do. Then I had to go run  around to non-slaughtering meat processing plants and get data from them  and decide what are the usable pieces of this that are realistic for this type of  thing. What I did was look at what we call the building block approach.  You   ve got the receiving end. You   ve got the processing end. You   ve got  the distribution and all of this. You had certain equipment for each one of  those. You could size it up or size it down. You pick your one. Pick your  other. Here   s your cost for your plant. That   s what I did. To that end, it took  me, what was it,    64 to    67. It took me over three years, which was quite a  while. I did get a paper out of it that I gave to the Southern Ag Econ  17  Association. I   m trying to think. I just know that my methodology, I used  later. It   s a long story.  Nykolaiszyn While you were working on your master   s, what was your job within the  department?  Schnake Okay, I was just a graduate assistant. I forget how they titled that. Of course,  I had a stipend with that, and then I had my GI benefits. Then Barbara was  working. She came down there with no job. We didn   t know how we were  going to do this, but we knew we could do it. We   ve been there maybe a  week, and she got a temporary job in Agronomy. She was having problems  with the typewriter that was an IBM Selectric, had the ball, you know. It  was supposed to be the fastest thing on earth. She said,    I tell you. I can   t  use this machine because it won   t type fast enough.    Oh, they said,    No, no,  no, no.    She said,    I   ve been used to an IBM Executive.    She did a report at  the University of Missouri called the    Grade A Review    which included  several states, and it was on dairy prices. Leo Blakeley knew about that  because he contributed to it.  Anyway, the department head had an IBM Executive machine. Well, his  secretary hated that machine because she really didn   t know how to use it  because it was proportional spacing. You could left hand, right hand, justify.  He said,    Well, if she can use that Executive machine, I want my stuff typed  on the Executive machine.    Took her in there, and she said,    I   ll show you.  This machine won   t jam.    It didn   t. They called a guy from IBM out of  Oklahoma City to come up there. He said,    You can   t jam that Selectric  machine.    She sat down, and she immediately jammed it. He said,    I   ve  never seen anything like this before.    She said,    The Executive is the faster  machine.    Proved that to them, too. Anyway, she was working, and I was  working. We, what should you say, we knew that 10 percent came off the  top for church, gross, and we saved money. By the time I finished the PhD, I  owed no money on that trailer, and we had savings. We sold the trailer and  took our savings and had a down payment on our house in Manhattan,  Kansas.  Nykolaiszyn Well, before we get to Manhattan, tell me about your PhD research.  Schnake Okay, that   s another story, too. Jim Martin was on the staff, and I forgot to  mention him. He later became president of the University of Arkansas. He  was really a sharp guy. He played basketball at Auburn. He wasn   t there too  long. Anyway, when I was starting on my PhD, he was going to be my  major professor. That hadn   t been any time, and he took a job as a, I don   t  know if it was a department head or vice president   s job someplace. He was  gone. Then another person on my committee, Bernard Sanders, real sharp  guy, he was a marketing guy. He was there about six months, and he left to  become vice president of Farmland Industries. Well, by that time, it was,  18     What do we do now?    Nobody knew the type of stuff I was doing, so I  asked John Franzmann if he would be willing to take me on again. He was  on the committee. He said yeah, he would, but he said,    I really can   t help  you.    I didn   t have anybody there that could really help me on this big  model, big LP  linear programming  model, and it was all on grain.  Anyway, basically, I did my own thing. (Laughs) It took some extra time,  too, because I was dealing with rails, trucks, and barges. Then I was dealing  the various grains, hard wheat, soft wheat, corn, soybeans, and I can   t  remember if there was anything else in there or not. I think there were seven  of them all together. I   ve got so mixed up by now. Anyway, it was a lot of  work to get the basic data to run this thing. What it was really about was to  look at if the US grain marketing system operated on cost of service  transportation basis, how would it change the system because, see, we were  regulated at that time. The barges were regulated. The rails were regulated.  The trucks were regulated. I went in and looked at what the real operating  costs were and reran this big model and then showed the differences. It was.  There were substantial differences, particularly when you freed up barges  and freed up rails. That   s why I spent a lot of time in the library was getting  these government documents that had that information in there, the  Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulated the barges and the rails,  well, trucks, too. Now we don   t have an Interstate Commerce Commission  to regulate them.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk a little bit about your experiences within the library.  Schnake Well, since I had to rely so heavily on government documents, there   s no  way I could collect them. There had to be a library source someplace. The  Edmon Low Library was one of I can   t remember how many repositories for  US government documents. There weren   t that many, but they got all the  government documents that were published. They were at Oklahoma State,  which that was a blessing. We didn   t have computers to guide you on this.  You always went to the racks, and you looked and you looked and you  looked, and then you looked inside the volumes you pulled. I spent  uncountable hours in the library digging but not all by myself because Mrs.   Marguerite  Howland was the documents librarian. She was fantastic, I  mean, wonderful, wonderful librarian. She was so kind. Anytime I ever  asked her a question, she dropped whatever she doing, and she   d go, say,     Well, I think it   s over here, and I think you   ll find it in this volume.    She  remembered all these finite things about government documents.  Of course, I was using them from not just the Interstate Commerce  Commission. I was using Treasury Department, USDA, Commerce  Department, Labor Department, all these things because I was looking at  things from cost of labor to cost of fuels and all these things. I really did  spend a lot of time there. It was a very good experience. To have not had the  19  library help I had, I don   t know what I would have done. It would have  taken a lot longer. I can only imagine how much less time it would take  today. You got all this stuff digitized. You just go ch-ch-ch and, yep, there it  is, print right on your screen. Just to think, word processing, we didn   t know  what word processing was back then. All had to be hand-typed. Then if you  made an error   . I had these huge tables, matrix tables, and they all had to  be photographed and reduced. That cost a lot of money to get those things  done, then to get to Manhattan, Kansas, after I finished up.  My dissertation hadn   t cleared yet. I had a friend down there  James Horne   who was getting  it , finally typed and all this. Then I get the copy back up  there, and I   m reading one of my tables. It shows more wheat being shipped  out of northern Nebraska than southern Nebraska to the same destination. I  say,    How come? That   s not possible.    It was possible because I had  punched a card wrong. I don   t know how many thousand cards I had, but I  had one of these kitchen carts that has the lower shelf and the top shelf. I  loaded it up with boxes of cards, all you could get on there. I think they were  three high on top. I would run from Ag Hall South over to the computer  center down the sidewalk to run that program. When my name  would   come up on the screen, my job was going on. You never heard such  language in your life. People, oh, they cussed.    He got the whole computer  tied up for three hours        Yeah, that   s right.    (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn How big was the computer back then?  Schnake You know, I can   t remember what it was. It was an IBM. I don   t know if  360 makes sense or not. Just to think that now you got something sitting on  your desk that   s got more capacity than that, and faster, and here   s this great  big thing with all that cooling capacity and all that, you know. We had to  use punch cards for entry. I hand-punched them with a gang punch over  there. Kids these days don   t even know what a punch card looks like. I got a  batch of them just to keep so people know what they look like. (Laughter)  Nykolaiszyn As you were finishing up at OSU, what did you hope was going to be your  next step?  Schnake Well, see, before I had got my master   s, I had gone to the AAEA  American  Agricultural Economics Association  meetings back in Maryland, knowing  that the Fibers and Grains Branch of the Marketing Economics Division of  USDA was wanting another marketing person stationed in Stillwater. I went  back there to talk to them and interview with them. He said,    Yeah, just  watch the Federal Register. We   ll pick you off.    I think it was February of     67, I think that   s right, when I was picked off the Register, and I went to  work for the Marketing Economics Division of ERS, USDA. My work was  the work I was doing on my dissertation. I had a job, and I was a, I would  say, full-time / part-time employee anyway. I had all the benefits of a full-  20  time employee while I was working. I just didn   t get forty hours a week pay.  Pay was according to how many hours I was taking.  Then, before I graduated, I was given the opportunity to either go to  Washington, DC, or to Manhattan, Kansas. I didn   t have to go to Manhattan,  Kansas, to decide I wasn   t going to Washington, DC. I just did not want to  get in that rat race up there. I did. I moved to Manhattan in June of    71. I had  a Marketing Economics Division grain marketing position there. You might  say I made a mistake because I felt that since I had been working for USDA  that I owed them some time, but really I didn   t because I   d been giving them  my time. Texas A M was looking for a transportation man in the  Department of Ag Economics down there. There were five people on that  selection committee, and I knew four of them. They wanted me to come  down and interview. I didn   t go. Don   t make that mistake because they  figured they had me. The USDA figured they had me, so they weren   t going  to worry about me. I stayed with them. In    83, they gave us the opportunity  again, our division, to move to Washington, DC, the whole field division. I  think there were 130 of us.  Nykolaiszyn Wow.  Schnake They got three of them into DC. I wasn   t one of the three. I knew that I  wasn   t going, but I had to find another job. I   d been in research all these  years, and I really enjoyed the work I did. Jobs really weren   t available. I  interviewed for a job down in Arkansas. I was highly qualified for it, but  they weren   t prepared to pay me. They wanted a seasoned economist, and  they wanted to start him out at ground-level pay. We hadn   t even discussed  it because the committee chair called me, or he didn   t call me. I finally  called and said,    I need to know.    He said,    I   m too embarrassed to call you.  They want to hire you or want me to tell you that they   ll give you this  salary. I   m not going to even ask you. We   re going to start this thing over. If  they want a seasoned person, they   re going to have to pay for it.    That was  out. That was good, too, because that   s not the climate I really liked.  Then, I saw, it came up on the Federal Register that they had a job with the  Federal Crop Insurance Corporation here in Kansas City, and I called about  it. They were going to have one of their people in Manhattan the next week.  I talked to him, so I did. He really couldn   t give me the answers I wanted. I  said,    Who   s your boss?    He told me who it was. I said,    I would like to talk  to him.    He gave me his name and phone number, and I called him. He said,     Why don   t you come over, and let   s talk.    I was not very smart. I didn   t  know that I could change jobs within the agency, take a downgrade but  didn   t have to take the cut in salary. I knew I   d have to take a downgrade,  and I thought I   d have to take the cut in salary.    What is the highest grade  you will accept, and what   s the lowest salary you will accept?    I matched  the highest salary of that step down. It cost me twenty percent of my salary.  21  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Schnake I never did get it all back. Anyway, you live, and you learn. It was a new  experience. I didn   t know anything about insurance. I   m not sure I learned a  whole lot about insurance because what I was doing was projecting prices  on all commodities that their crop insurance insured. That meant dealing  with fruits and vegetables that I knew nothing about and lots of other crops I  didn   t know anything about. Like I said, when I was in that summer  fellowship, I met these folks I would contact or whatever. I had to rely on a  lot of people to get information because it wasn   t available. USDA didn   t  have available data on production/prices on a lot of these commodities,  particularly the fruits and vegetables.  Nykolaiszyn What goes into forecasting these types of pricing?  Schnake Let me tell you. (Laughs) Leo Blakley, who I mentioned, at Oklahoma State,  gave the graduate students a little talk one day. It wasn   t really a lecture. It  was just lots of practical advice. He said,    Let me tell you that modeling is  80 percent art and 20 percent science.    I can tell you that   s what I had to go  on because you couldn   t model two years out, and I was having to go two  years out. There wasn   t any professional doing that. I called people. I had a  contact in every land-grant university, the one that I knew I would call and  say,    Who do I need to talk to? Give me a university.    They   d tell me.     Okay.    Then I   d talk to that person because I   d say,    Joe Blow said you  could talk to me.    Of course, he was an expert in that field, and he would  tell me.    like potatoes, we had to price potatoes at Texas three different  ways. We had to price potatoes in Florida two different ways. We had to  price potatoes every   .  I was in Washington once, and there was a fellow there. I saw his name tag  said Frito Lay. Well, yeah, he should know something about potatoes. I  talked to him, and I told him my dilemma. He said,    Well, I tell you what.  I   m not the person you need to talk to. I   m in the oil division. I know the  guy that you need to talk to. I   ll go back to Dallas, and I   ll tell him. You call  him in about a week.    Well, I did. Like that man, I would have been very  skeptical because he didn   t know me from Adam. He was just going on what  this fellow had told him. I told him what I needed to know. I said,    I have no  idea how to price potatoes in the state of Texas, let alone Florida and  wherever. I   m not interested in knowing how you do it, what your formula is  in Frito Lay. I   d just like to know, really, there has to be some relatives here.  One   s relative to the other and so forth.    He cut loose. I don   t know how  much time we were on the phone. You know the conversation with him.     Anyway else I can help you, let me know.    I had lots of those happening.  22  I   m going to blow my horn a little bit. In all of my career doing this, I was  never refused once. When I was with the ERS, I had to revise the white  bread marketing spreads. I don   t know if you ever heard of those or not. It  used to be that USDA published marketing spreads, and for bread, they   d  come out with a loaf of bread and say,    It takes this many slices for the  bakery. Takes this many slices for the miller. It takes this much for the  farmer, and so forth.    In the process of that, I had to get a new bread  formula. That bread formula had ingredients that weren   t in the old formula  at all. I thought,    Oh, boy.    There was an oil in there. I couldn   t find it. One  day, I saw it in the Wall Street Journal, very fine print. I called the Wall  Street Journal, found who the person was that was putting that out, and I  talked to him. I said,    Do you know, I have that oil from this formula, and I  don   t have any price for it. Can you furnish me that price on a regular  basis?    He said,    Oh, I   ll tell you what. It   s really thin.    I said,    Well, thin is  better than nothing.    He said,    I will furnish you that price if you will not  indicate where it came from.    I said,    I have no problem with that. I got a lot  of stuff I don   t reveal the source on.     That   s how I got my oil price. Never was published where it came from.  Anybody ever asked me the question, I said,    That   s confidential  information, and I can   t reveal it.    That   s true. I never did deny anybody  confidentiality that I promised. That was one of my problems with Federal  Crop Insurance because I had a lot of confidential information, and the head  of the agency was a strict politician. He thought that I should support  anything that he said with numbers. That   s not what I was taught to do, and  it wasn   t ethical, either. He asked me if I  said he was asking me  to do  something unethical or    against the law    is the way he said it. I said,    I did  not use those words. Those words are yours.    If I   d have said yes, he would  have fired me right there. I could not. I just could not reveal it because   .  It  would   ve  caused some people some heartaches, and I just ate it, you know.  You can take it out on me, and that   s fine. I   m proud of what I did.  Nykolaiszyn You had a lot of challenges in that position.  Schnake You know, I really did. Along these same lines of the prices on certain  things, this guy went to the secretary of the Crop Reporting Board. His name  was Jim Donald, real nice guy. I knew him. He said,    I would like some  prices for fruits and vegetables.    That   s about how smart he was, I mean,  just arrogant. Jim Donald turned to him. He  the agency head  said,    You  know what? You have got the best data bank on prices on fruits and  vegetables of the whole USDA. Nobody else has the data that you have.        You have.    He said,    L. D. Schnake in Kansas City has it.    See, he  my  agency head  was trying to  nail me . I had to literally be my own data  collector. I don   t know how I did all I did. I look back on it now, and I  wonder how I did it, but I did it. I had some good help, eventually. When I  first started, it was all by myself.  23  Nykolaiszyn I know today I interview a lot of farmers, and, you know, we talk a little bit  about crop insurance. There are some who are very thankful for it, and  there   s others who would rather do away with it, but they need it for  government programs. It   s always a   .  Schnake Some need it for government programs, and some need it to line their  pockets. What   s going on, (I don   t know how they   ll ever straighten it out)  when you can have umpteen units and divide  them  all up in some big  corporation up here, not identified, it   s taken in hundreds of thousands of  dollars a year at my expense. It   s not right. Yes, there   s a legitimate place  for crop insurance for legitimate producers, but when it comes down to  politics (and that thing is highly political) it   s not correct. When they opened  it up to the insurance companies, it became rotten because now they   ve got  their snout in the federal treasury. As long as the federal government ran that  program, it never lost any money. They had a surplus. They lose money  every year.  Nykolaiszyn What year did it make the shift?  Schnake Nineteen eighty, if I recall. It was before I came on. I think it was like    84  before they really got really going down the pike. Yeah. Yeah, I did some  work along that.    Well, we could do watermelon insurance in Florida.    I go  down there, and here   s a man with five hundred acres of irrigated  watermelons. He, with four other growers, agreed to come to a meeting to  talk about the potential for crop insurance on watermelons. I said Florida.  This was in Georgia, where this was. I can just see his face now. Oren  Childers was his name. He said,    Dr. Schnake, I really don   t trust people in  USDA, but I happen to believe you   re telling me the truth. I have told you  the truth. We do not need watermelon insurance. We do not want  watermelon insurance, and if you put it out there, it   s going to cut my  throat.    He told why. I   d already outlined this for him in here. I said,    Why  do we want to do that for? It   s not an insurable commodity.    He said,     Every guy that   s got a job in town   s going to go out there and throw some  seed on the ground. Then he   s going to load his pickup when they got ripe,  and he   s going to bring them all to market because he   s got insurance. If he  doesn   t get a crop, he still gets money. It destroys my market, and it   ll bust  me.     I come back, and I tell them that, write up the report. Leo Polopolus, who  was our president of AAEA, (I forget what year that was, but it was when I  was still with ERS) he was on the staff at the University of Florida, and I  walk in his office. I said,    Leo, is it possible to insure watermelons?    He  looked at me, and he says,    L. D., you know that you can   t insure a non-insurable  commodity. I   ve raised watermelons. I know what it   s like. I can  tell you what   ll happen.    Just same story, you know. Anyway, I brought  24  back the report. Here   s these, I mean, we   re talking about professionals, and  they tell me,    You got to go back and redo the study.    I said,    Why do you  want me to redo the study? I told you before we did this what the answer  was going to be, and that   s the answer I got.       Well, yeah, but you skewed  it.    I said,    I didn   t skew anything. I just reported to you what they told me.  The answer   s obvious. A non-insurable commodity, you don   t insure      When I retired, (they waited for my retirement) they put it in. They got  taken. Their lunch got taken.  Nykolaiszyn Oh, I bet.  Schnake I still yet today, I think I   m going to call Oren Childers down there in  Georgia and ask him what happened and tell him I was not responsible for  that because I felt so bad. He had a lot of money tied up in five hundred  acres of irrigated watermelons.  Nykolaiszyn What are other examples of non-insurable commodities?  Schnake Well, if you talk to me, I   m not the right person to talk to because I   m so  biased. Anything that is weather-related, I don   t know how you insure it. I  mean, if you could, why weren   t the insurance companies doing it to start  with? If you can predict the weather, weather, disease, if you can predict  those two things, you can pretty much know what the probability is of a loss  or a gain. That   s where I stand on it. There   s too many things insured that  aren   t insurable. If you want to insure a market out here on the other end   .  If you   re going to prop up a market, which is what that says to these people,  you   re encouraging adverse selection. There are people that call me up.  What should I say? Heretic? It   s just a program that really needs a  microscope put on it.  Nykolaiszyn What year did you retire?  Schnake Nineteen ninety-eight.  Nykolaiszyn Wow  What happened after retirement? What   d you do?  Schnake I haven   t figured out yet how I ever had time to make a living. There   s so  many things I   ve always wanted to do I still haven   t done. Barbara retired in  2010, and life has just been wonderful since we both retired because  basically we   ve always worked. You get to see them after work. She   s such  a wonderful person. It   s wonderful to get to spend the time with this woman.  It   s just great. I fix anything to be fixed. The wallpaper job in this room isn   t  the greatest in the world, but we have papered this entire house, except for  this. This was here when we came. You look those steps You see what a  mess that is right now? I painted that the night before we went to the  hospital.  Interviewer note: Ten days prior to this interview, Schnake  25  underwent a total knee replacement  That   s just primed. We got stuff like  that all over the house going on. I   ve always taken care of my own cars, but  that   s getting to be impossible since everything   s digital. I love to garden. I  like to have a good yard. I don   t know anything I really don   t like.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have children?  Schnake We have one son, and he   s the miracle baby. When we were in Stillwater,  Barbara was really having problems, and we went to see this OBGYN in  Oklahoma City. He told her that,    You   ll probably never have any children.     I tell you, she just cried and cried. We come back, and we told Dr. Honska,  who was our doctor in Stillwater. He was upset that she was told that, and he  really didn   t know what to suggest to us. I had an aunt who lived in Temple,  Texas. My uncle was fiscal officer at the VA hospital down there. That   s  where Scott   White Clinic is, and it   s a good place. I called Aunt Rachel,  and I said,    What if we showed up on their door down there?    She said,     They   d take you in, but if you call, it   s going to be months to get in.    We  said,    Okay, what if we come down next week?    She said,    Sure.    That was  our local motel. Come to find out, Barbara just had massive cysts on her  ovaries, and they didn   t know. They gave her this drug called Clomid. They  didn   t tell us all the possible side effects because she probably wouldn   t  have taken it.  Anyway, what it supposedly did was it swelled ovaries up until they broke  the cysts. We were to move to Manhattan in June of    71. In April, Dr.  Honska called Barbara, and he was about to cry. He said,    You   re pregnant.  I don   t understand why.    We get to Manhattan, and we didn   t have a  OBGYN doctor there. It so happens that a distant cousin, (how distant she is  is her dad and my granddad were first cousins). Her husband and his brother  were in the building business, building houses. Somehow or another, she  found out we were going to be moving up there. She wrote us this nice  letter, said if there was any way they could help, let us know. Well, we got  up there, and Barbara spent her time one afternoon with Janice. She said,     Oh, I   ve got the best doctor in town. He   s great.    He was. He really was.  Barbara went to see him when we got up there. He said,    I don   t know if  you can carry a baby nine months.    The baby was already in the birth canal.  Nykolaiszyn Wow.  Schnake He said,    You   ve got to walk, and you   ve got to walk lots every day.    She  did. She carried him full nine months, and we never could have any more.  Come to find out is we had an RH factor we didn   t know about. She  probably had many, many miscarriages. She delivered that baby with  nothing. She   s tough. He is a wonderful, wonderful person. He   s going to  seminary and working full time, got two boys. I don   t know how he does it  all, but we   re really proud of him.  26  Nykolaiszyn I know you went to Missouri, and, of course, you spent some time at OSU.  How did attending OSU and earning your degrees there impact your life?  Schnake Oh, I have an answer. I just got to think about that a bit. I would say this. I  met some people there that I will never forget. It was their honesty and their  integrity and, I guess I   d say, (I already said honesty) they   re willing to tell  it the way it is. I   m a person who doesn   t like to put up with a lot of fluff,  and I was putting up with some fluff. It was Odell Walker who was needing  this work done, but he wasn   t getting it done. Another faculty member was  just giving me dirty work. I just said quite plainly,    If this is the way it   s  going to be to get a master   s degree here, I   m out of here because I   m not  putting up with this kind of junk.    Boy, that stopped immediately, and I got  a major professor assigned immediately. I really, really appreciated the fact  that Odell Walker was willing to put his neck on the line.  Then Leo Blakley, he was so honest with us, put his neck on the line. Like I  told you, how he said,    Eighty percent art and twenty percent science,    he  went further, and he said,    Well, I will tell you, young men, you have  learned about some powerful tools. You   ve got them in your toolbox, but let  me tell you, when you go out to use the tools, remember at least 80 percent  of the time, a good  sophmorish    answer is going to be the right answer.  You don   t need to use those high-powered tools on a simple problem.    A lot  of people wouldn   t have been willing to do that, and he was. There were  some problems with some graduate students, their personal lives, and he was  the one. I don   t know if he took it on his own. I suspect he did. He was a  quiet man, called us all together and said,    If there   s any way that we can  help you, doesn   t have to be related to your academics, please let us know  because we   re willing to help.    We had some guys that were doing things  they shouldn   t be, running around on their wives. I know that Leo Blakley  did not stand for that. He wanted to head it off. Unfortunately, it didn   t get  headed off. Three of these guys ended up divorcing their wives, and it   s just  because they were being stupid, going down, drinking, getting drunk, and  then having affairs with barmaids and whatever, you know. I thought that  was a bold step for a faculty member to take on that.  The people, it   s just so people-oriented. I like to think that I   ve always been  people-oriented and concerned with people because the people that worked  for me, regardless of how they told me they ought to be rated, I rated them  the way I rated them. I took the heat for it, a lot of heat, bad heat, but I   d still  do it all over again. I think it goes back to the examples. John Franzmann  was honest as  the days  are long. He was wonderful. He   s a wonderful man.  He   s dead now. Unfortunately, I didn   t know about his funeral. Same with  Leo Blakley. Both of those, I would have gone to their funerals. Bob  Oehrtman, another one who ended up at the last being on my committee.  Just really, really deep down good human beings, and I see us losing that.  27  Things just aren   t like they used to be, and we wonder what   s happening to  our country. I don   t think it   s that difficult to figure out.  Nykolaiszyn Advice for students today?  Schnake If you know what you want to do, if you really know what you want to do,  go for it. You   re young now. You can still change, but don   t go into  anything halfhearted because it isn   t going to work. Whatever you do, do  well. This idea of just getting it by never cut the mustard with me. I always  did the best I could do on whatever it was, and I never had to be ashamed. I  never did feel like I   d shirked anything. I still would give rewards to hard  work. Some people don   t anymore, but I think a good attitude goes a long  ways.  Nykolaiszyn Anything else you want to add before we close on out?  Schnake Well, I just appreciate this opportunity to share some of my thoughts. I don   t  know what they   re worth. I   ll put it this way: They didn   t cost anything.  May be worth even less.  Nykolaiszyn Well, that   s a pretty good way to end. (Laughter) L. D., thank you for your  time today.  Schnake I really appreciate it. It was very nice meeting you.  Nykolaiszyn Thank you.  -------  -------
