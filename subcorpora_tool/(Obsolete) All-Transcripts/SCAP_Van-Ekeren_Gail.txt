DANA:	Are you ready?

VAN EKEREN:	Where do you want me to look?

GEIS:	She can look at Illaria.

VAN EKEREN:	OK.

DANA:	OK.  So, I’m Illaria Davis speaking with Gail Van Ekeren for the Alumnae Oral History Project at Smith College, and I just want to start by asking you how did you decide to come to Smith College?

VAN EKEREN:	That’s an interesting story because I was the first one in my family to get to college.  We lived in a small town outside of Cleveland, and my father owned beverage stores, the local beverage store where — we also had a small college in town, and it was the county seat.  So people would talk to my dad.  He got to know everybody in town, and he would always brag about me, because I was doing well in school.  And so, getting closer to my senior year, he had asked friends of his — no, friends of his came up to him and said, “If your daughter’s really good student, you should look at the Seven Sisters.”  And this is funny because I always used to watch football on TV, and he’d say, “Someday you’ll go to a college like that where you can watch the team play football.”  (laughs) And here I am.  But I looked at all of them, and I liked the fact — this makes no sense, I understand — that there was a lake and people went sailing.  (laughs) I lived on Lake Erie.  People went sailing on Lake Erie, but — so I applied to Smith and Mount Holyoke and the University of Rochester, and I got into Smith.  (ringtone sounds) I’m sorry.

DANA:	That’s OK.

GEIS:	Pause for one second.  Do you want to — (recording cuts off)

DANA:	You were talking about the lake.

VAN EKEREN:	Oh, yes.  So I applied to Smith and Mount Holyoke, and I was accepted at Smith, waitlisted at Mount Holyoke.  But I’m a good math person, so I figured they had me because I was good at math.  (laughs) Not much good at anything else.  And so I remember telling my friends, “Oh, I’ll get at least a B average.”   It didn’t happen.  (laughs) I got here, and the first thing my parents drove me here.  Then they left, and then I got all nervous because I wasn’t sure I was using silverware right.  I remember standing when the house mother walked in, and I almost hit her with my head.  I mean, I was very awkward at first.  Not only that, I aced everything in high school without working.  So needless to say, I fell flat on my face.  My first report card, since they had interim grades, were three C’s and two D’s.  My father called: “What’s happened to my brilliant daughter?”  (laughs)
It settled down, and I’ve never — I ended up majoring in physics because I couldn’t do anything else.  All I had to do was understand physics.  But before then, my father wrote me a letter which I still have — and I’m going to cry when I say this — saying, “Driving you to Smith College was the proudest day of my life.”   I still cry.  And I managed.  I wasn’t happy at first because I believe I always identified myself — my self-image was — I was a good student.  I was smart.  Everybody thought I was smart.  And I came here, and I kept looking at people and saying, “They’re not working and they’re getting A’s.  How do they do that?”   But I stumbled along and did not ask to leave.  I was going to change schools my junior year, but my father said, “That’s a good idea.  I think you should.”   And I said, “Nobody tells me what to do.”   And I stayed.  I changed houses, made a few more friends, and really — by my senior year, I was much more comfortable with myself.  And after being at Smith, the rest of my life was easy.  (laughs) I learned how to work.  I learned how to study.

DANA:	What houses were you living in, and what were your house mothers like?

VAN EKEREN:	What were house mothers like?

DANA:	Yeah.

VAN EKEREN:	Well, they kind of added a touch of class, in a way.  They would go around and at night they would close the drapes and turns the lights on, and they would serve coffee after dinner, and they would just make sure everyone was OK.  One funny thing there was, at one of the houses I lived, a young lady was dating someone from Saudi Arabia and had a monkey in her bedroom.  And the (laughs) house mother was commenting that I guess it became quite friendly and they would talk to me: “Yeah, my biggest challenge right now is how to get that monkey out of the room.”  (laughs) And there were also other things.  We had a student die, and the house mother asked me if I would pack up her things.  So they were — they really just added something to the house.  Peace, maybe.  A moment of peace, because they’re serving the coffee, and on tea time they would serve the tea, and you’d bring a friend over for dinner and introduce them to the house mother.  They just added things.  They weren’t disciplinarians or anything.  Yeah.

DANA:	Do you remember what dating was like when you were at Smith?

VAN EKEREN:	What–

DANA:	Dating was like?

VAN EKEREN:	Well, yes.  First we had — what do you call them?  Where we would go to, let’s say, Amherst, or a busload of us would go to Yale.  Mixers, that’s what they called them.  So you would meet people and sometimes you would see them again, and other times you wouldn’t.  In a way, it was like cattle being — but I met some interesting people.  I remember at Yale, someone was making a movie, so a bunch of us took part in the movie.  It was not pornographic.  (laughs) And so it was interesting experiences.  I did date someone, and sometimes they would come to our campus.  And I met a few people that I would date occasionally, but no one serious.  We could only have the men in our rooms on Rally Day weekend and maybe a couple others, but I remember Rally Day weekend.  And you’d of course have the door open, and whatever entertaining you would do, you could do there.  I didn’t date a lot.  But I went on — I joined the outing club, and I do remember some people, meeting them on outing expeditions.  And I always loved the band in high school, and we had a pep band.  It wasn’t the same, but I played in the pep band.
So, dating.  We also had to be in the house by a certain time.  I do know people who learned how to use the tunnels underneath, and I was very naive.  I was new to the East, but my freshman year I went to Harvard with another freshman who was much more worldly than I was.  So we’re there, and she picked up a date and I did not.  So we were staying in Boston, and I went to the cab — I remember this — I went to the cab and said, “Please take me to such-and-such a hotel.”   “Well, we don’t go to Boston.  You’ll have to take the subway.”  (laughs) All right, I can do this.  So I get on the subway and there’s another woman in the subway, and I asked her — I told her where I needed to get off, and she said she would tell me when that stop came.  It ends up she went to college in my hometown, which had a small women’s college in it.  Just funny, but I learned, again — I’ve finally become a woman of the world, but at that time, there was so much to learn because I was raised in a small town.  But I managed.  As I said, I’m still kicking.  I graduated.  And anyway, I’m off of all the subjects.  What else would you like me to answer?

DANA:	Do you remember any protests on campus, or anything about civil rights?

VAN EKEREN:	Yes.  Well, it’s interesting because I led the Goldwater campaign on campus.  I was — I always felt like Hillary Clinton after I got to know her.  She started off as a Republican because her family was in business.  So my father had a small business.  I did too.  But I was also active in the community service, getting people for volunteer work.  And someone asked me once, “How could you be for Goldwater and do that?”  Well, I didn’t — but, protests.  There was a protest to keep the library open longer, and I remember there were sit-ins or something.  I helped, and people were surprised that — all right.  I said, “Good.”  And they said, “You like what we’re doing?”  I said, “Absolutely!”  (laughs) But that’s all the protests I remember.  After I graduated there were more, many more.

DANA:	Do you remember what Smith students felt about what was happening in civil rights in the country and the climate?

VAN EKEREN:	Not at that time.  I know that we had very few women of color on our campus, and that always bothered me because even though I was from a small town we were integrated.  Also, interestingly enough, when I started, they paired the Jewish students together, because I’m Jewish, and I noticed that they did that.  So there weren’t — not at my time, I believe.  All we graduated in ‘67, and a lot of the action took place after that.  I was happy to see when a woman of color came to our house and lived there my senior year, but at that time I believe they had — I’m not sure, but I think they had a number of students — what do you call that?  I don’t remember.  But there were only a certain number of Jewish students, women of color, unfortunately.  But it’s changed.

DANA:	Did you have any other experiences pertaining to being Jewish while you were here?

VAN EKEREN:	No.  I never was aware of anything.  There was a Jewish organization on campus, and I never felt that anyone thought less of me.  So I don’t — it wasn’t a big thing.  But we did have a place to have a Seder and go to High Holiday services, and I liked that.

DANA:	Do you want to tell me a little bit about what you did after graduated and what your life’s been like since you–

VAN EKEREN:	Well, my senior year in college, I took a couple anthropology courses, and I loved them.  However, I had majored in physics, and I was going to teach physics.  And I started in Philadelphia, where I went to a program that — because they needed science teachers so badly, I went to a program where I taught half-day in Philadelphia city schools, and I went to class half-day, and I ended up with a master’s in Education, Pennsylvania certification.  And I went on there for my doctorate in Science Education, something I never, ever thought I would do, but I wanted to go to get more power.  I didn’t get more power, but I loved the field.  I taught four years in Philadelphia city schools, and I always think it’s a God thing.  My first year of teaching was at a all-black high school, and the principal was Marcus Foster.  He was an amazing man.  He told his students that if they would get the grades, he would get them into college.  And he would go around to the businesses in the community and never ask for help.  They would say, “How can I help you?”  And I had a student do a science project on a fair, which was unheard-of, and I remember he called us in.  He called me in and told me what a great job I was doing.  People would also complain about him because he was sending kids to college who would not be successful, and he said, “You’re right.  But their children will.”  And that became my main mantra when I was teaching.  I always — in some cases.  I didn’t always teach urban kids, but if I taught urban kids, I pushed them and told them what [sic] capable they were and encouraged them, and (ringtone sounds).  Excuse me.  I don’t know how to do this, but–

GEIS:	Want to turn the power off?

VAN EKEREN:	I’m turning the sound off.

GEIS:	You can also turn the power off if you need it.

VAN EKEREN:	Well, I’ve turned the sound off.  I’m sorry.

DANA:	That’s OK.  So you were talking about helping your students and encouraging them.

VAN EKEREN:	Oh, yes.  I would just — first of all, I gave them — I encouraged them.  I always liked to take my students from where they are and move them ahead.  I’ve become Facebook friends with a couple who were in my first class, my first class I taught.  And I then — I also taught at another city school, and in the meantime I was taking courses for my doctorate because I needed a master’s equivalency in physics.  And I had to take a year off, so I got pregnant, took my year off, and went to school full time to finish my course requirement.  Then I took my comprehensive exam, but I didn’t defend my dissertation for eight years after that because I went home to raise my family, married my first husband, a veterinarian, and I went into industry.  I became a stockbroker on a dare.

DANA:	(laughs)

VAN EKEREN:	I was in the defense industry.  I divorced, had joint custody of my daughters, and when my younger daughter left for college, I said, “Now I can go back to teaching.”  And one of my daughters came to Smith.  It was there that I — when she was — I think she was a sophomore, right?  Because she and I tap danced at my 25th reunion together.  And I ran into one of my professors in physics, and he had my daughter in a physics lab.  He said, “My first mother-daughter pair.”  She went onto major in math, and I became very friendly with him through the Association of Physics Teachers.  And we got to be really good, really close.  He was doing his research in education, so for years and years, I would always meet him at these conferences and we’d have dinner and he’d talk about his research.  He talked about the politics at Smith (laughs) and how he brought a lot of money to the school because he was doing his work on science — physics education.  And I won’t go into the rest of the politics, but it meant it was really amazing, the relationship I formed with him.  Yeah.  So that’s one of the main things I got from Smith, is his — well, of course, confidence in myself and all that that took a while, but this amazing relationship with one of my professors.  And he died.  He had pancreatic cancer, but he saw me at the last conference, and we had dinner and he told me he was dying.  And we shared stories of — I have a heart condition and — and then I contacted his wife with a sympathy letter.  And she never knew that he had met someone at the conference that year, and he felt badly because he was alone.  She was just thrilled to find out that I was there and — about the relationship we had, which was just so exciting.
I also started robotics teams — FIRST [For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology] Robotics teams when I got back into teaching.  I started five.  My daughter started one at her school in Massachusetts, and I always felt like the Johnny Appleseed.  But I also started five because I ended up moving around in schools because I always pissed off the administration.  I always put the kids first, and I made — these FIRST Robotics make an amazing difference to all kids, not just ones who want to go into science, math, technology.  And I had a great time teaching, and now — I mentioned my anthropology — I am living in Las Cruces, New Mexico taking anthropology and archaeology courses because of that course that I took at Smith.  Anything else?

DANA:	Do you have any advice?

GEIS:	What time is the next person going to be here?  Do you want to just — I’ll see if they’re here if you want to keep going.

DANA:	That sounds good.

GEIS:	I’ll be right back.

DANA:	Do you have any advice for current Smith students?

VAN EKEREN:	For freshmen?

DANA:	Yeah, or students who are graduating.

VAN EKEREN:	Well, I know that my children were much more self-confident than I was.  Of course, with a mother like me, they have to be self-confident or they’ll die.  (laughs) No, I meant that I was not — making the mother who braided her child’s hair, and my younger daughter was disappointed when I wouldn’t become the mother lunch helper.  (laughs) My advice is to be yourself.  Go after your dreams.  Don’t feel embarrassed by who you are.  Also, ask for help.  I never asked for help when I was struggling.  The only person who gave me help — and I really think it’s amazing — was my German teacher.  She called me into her office and she said, “There are two ways to being successful: memorize the vocabulary, or understand the structure of the language.”  And that really helped me a lot because I wasn’t good at memorizing and much better at seeing structure.  So ask for help.  Try to include people who aren’t as comfortable as you are in your conversations.  It’s not easy, but it’s worth every minute of it.

DANA:	Thank you.  Yeah, I think that Kate’s going to come back and–

GEIS:	All right.  It’s time to wrap up.

DANA:	Yeah.

GEIS:	OK, thank you.

VAN EKEREN:	Was it all right?

DANA:	It was wonderful.  It was really interesting.

VAN EKEREN:	Really?

GEIS:	Which town are you from?  Where did you grow up?

VAN EKEREN:	I grew up in Painesville, Ohio.  It’s a small town.  My father owned a beverage store there, small Jewish community, but we had very well-integrated classes, and I look back and it was largely immigrant community.  People right off the boat, so to speak, from Italy and Finland, and they really did well.

DANA:	OK.
