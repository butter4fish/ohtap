Joey Fink:  It&#8217;s August 9th, 2010 and I&#8217;m here with Anne Mayhew in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Anne, I&#8217;d like to begin by asking if you&#8217;d like to tell me about your childhood, where you&#8217;re from, and how you ended up in Eastern Tennessee.
Anne Mayhew:  Okay.  I was born in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas and grew up in South Texas on a farm and in a very, very, small town.  And had an ambitious mother who always insisted that I would go to college, and so that was not open to debate or to discussion.  I probably would&#8217;ve wound up going to Baylor, which is where my mother had gone.  Except for the fact that this was--.  My high school years were years of very serious draught, and my parents couldn&#8217;t really afford to send me to Baylor.  And in the meantime, I had also been fortunate enough to go to the University of Texas campus several times and had really decided I wanted to go there.  Which caused a little bit of consternation in my Baptist family and in my little small town that I grew up in.  But in the end was a great thing for me.    I&#8217;d also been very fortunate in that I had two teachers in school in this small town who were very important in forming my intellectual interests, and it&#8217;s ironic that they had come to this very small town, which was between San Antonio and Laredo, because they had graduated from the University of Texas without proper teaching credentials.  And this was in the late &#8216;40s, 1950s, and the school districts were expanding.  School population was--.  With baby boomers coming along after me, schools were having a hard time hiring teachers who had proper credentials.  And so the one teacher in particular in high school and his wife, who taught in what today would be called middle school, didn&#8217;t have those credentials.  But they did have strong intellectual interests, and they had been students at the University of Texas and had studied what was then a very lively, very exciting area of social science, and economics and sociology and that was kind of just a very good time in that university in that area.  Fortunately, through their tutelage, I started reading what I would now recognize as economic history, although I didn&#8217;t even know that such a field existed at that time.
But I went to the University of Texas with every intention of continuing to study in that general area and was again very fortunate to wind up in--.  When I went to Texas, to wind up in an honors program that was called Plan Two, had that very unlikely name because it wasn&#8217;t plan one, which was the curriculum that everybody went through.  [Laughter]  This was Plan Two and it had been created in the 1930s, really, maybe going back to the &#8216;20s, I&#8217;m really not sure, by a group made up largely of social scientists who wanted a kind of interdisciplinary honors program.  So they accepted, when I was there, a hundred students every year.  I suppose that the entering freshman class in those years at Texas and it was a good deal smaller than it is today, was probably something closer to a thousand.  So it was a selected group.  I probably should not have been in the program by all rights, because I came from such a small high school and it wasn&#8217;t a very good high school and I was terrified I think that the director of the program, who went on to considerable fame, it&#8217;s the man who the Harry Ransom Center&#8217;s named after there.  He was a professor of English.  And he very tired, I was one of the last interviewees.  He was very tired, and he said &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll make it, but I&#8217;ll let you in.&#8221;  [Laughter]    So I wound up in the program.  It was great for me for the first two years.  I did not complete my degree in that program, because again, what with draught et cetera, I was working full-time and it&#8217;s really hard to do that program and work full-time.  But it did provide an excellent first two years of sort of interdisciplinary education.  Which was really very good.  I migrated toward economics and also toward anthropology.  So actually wound up getting my undergraduate degree in anthropology.  And didn&#8217;t really know quite what I wanted to do after I finished college.  I did know that I did not want to be a schoolteacher.  This was the most common route for young women at the time, other than nursing--.  JF:  This would&#8217;ve been about 1962?  AM:  I got my undergraduate degree in &#8217;58, so this was during the bad fifties, and so.  My mother had been a schoolteacher, had been a teacher for most of her adult life.  And she really wanted me to be a schoolteacher.  Partly because--she said, and with some justice, that this was really, gave you economic security, that we would always need schoolteachers, et cetera.  And it was partly rebelliousness that I didn&#8217;t want to be a schoolteacher, because I always really did not want to do what my mother wanted me to do.  [Laughter]  There was also a kind of early, inarticulate kind of feminism, I think, that was associated with it.  I did not want to follow the path that women had taken in the past.  In my mother&#8217;s family, there were eight girls, seven girls I guess, and they had become nurses or schoolteachers and so I didn&#8217;t want to be either one of those.  Although it wasn&#8217;t very clear to me what I wanted to be.  And as I thought about this whole question of feminism, because I felt that would probably be one of the topics of today&#8217;s interview, I was struck again by how poorly articulated the goals, the idea of feminism was for most of us, I think, in the 1950s.  Certainly for people who were students at the University of Texas or wherever, maybe Fort Worth.  If one had been at the Seven Sisters or somewhere it might have been different.  JF:  Sure.  AM:  Well, we knew about Simone de Beauvoir, we read some of these things, it was not--.  The goals were not articulated.  My life after completing my undergraduate degree, as so much of my life, has sort of fallen in an accidental pattern; I can&#8217;t say there&#8217;s really planned out.  There was a wonderful woman whose name was Ruth Allen, and she was on the Economics faculty at the University of Texas at that time.  A very crotchety woman, at least as I thought of her then.  I thought of her as an ancient, crotchety old lady; she&#8217;s probably younger than I am now.  But she had gotten her PhD at the University of Chicago, back in the 1920s, I guess, and she was one of a number of women who got their PhDs in a kind of economics at that point.  It&#8217;s interesting if you look at the numbers, it was kind of a sharp increase in the number of women who were getting PhDs in areas like economics, and then it fell off pretty sharply around the thirties and then declined.  So it was kind of a boom left in there.    Ruth Allen had done work that I found interesting; she had studied people who worked in the timber industry, in the lumber industry in East Texas, and taking a kind of ethnographic or anthropological approach.  And there were a lot of women there who did this--not at Texas, but there were a lot of women at Chicago who did this.  It was an early form of home economics, which has really kind of been lost, but it was about how people actually consume, how people actually earn their livings, and this kind of thing.  It was interesting.    I had wound up taking an introductory economics course with her, with Ruth Allen, and had spoken to her a few times but didn&#8217;t know her well.  But admired her from afar.  The year that I was to graduate from college, she--being a kind of feminist--asked a group of her male colleagues when they were gathered to nominate people for various scholarships--.  She would always ask them, as I got the story later, &#8220;Can women be nominated for this scholarship?&#8221;  So when they got to the Woodrow Wilson scholarships, which were a little different then than they are today, she would still (be asking - 9:54).  And so she nominated me, because I was one of the few female students that she knew and remembered from this class, so.  I wound up getting a Woodrow Wilson to study anthropology, and I went to the University of Chicago.  But in a way that really reflects the conflicts of that era, I also got married just as I completed my undergraduate degree.  And without any kind of thought as to how all of this was going to work, my first husband and I went off to Chicago.  Which he was not terribly happy about; he was from Chicago and he didn&#8217;t really want to go back there, and didn&#8217;t have a very clear career path himself.  Part of me wanted to follow this path of becoming an anthropologist, doing these, having this intellectual career.  Part of me wanted to follow the path of being the traditional 1950s housewife.  So my stay at Chicago was not totally unproductive, and not a disaster--I mean, I did okay in the classes--didn&#8217;t last very long.  I stayed in school there for a year and quit the program.  Partly because the University of Chicago itself, and especially the anthropology department, was undergoing all sorts of turmoil, just a couple of the people I had gone there to study with--the guy, Robert Redfield died, and others went off to California.  Because California&#8217;s higher education system was just growing like crazy at the time.  And living in Hyde Park in Chicago was not very attractive thing to do at that point.  This was before urban renewal, so it was kind of dangerous, scary, or exciting in some ways, place.    Anyway, I quit and had two children, as you will see in the dates of my children&#8217;s birth: 1959 and 1961.  We went back to Austin, where my first husband continued his graduate studies, which had been interrupted by my taking him off to Chicago with me.  My life started to--.  My 1950s housewife life started to fall apart at that point.  Because my husband was not doing very well, and he had all sorts of problems with alcohol, et cetera.  And we didn&#8217;t have any money.  I mean we really didn&#8217;t have any money.  And I had two little kids and so I decided I should probably look for a job.  What I discovered was that someone who had done a year&#8217;s graduate work, in an esoteric field like anthropology, would have trouble finding jobs.  [Laughter]  I was overqualified and also not qualified for anything.  I mean, I had learned to type, I had been forced at my high school to take typing, and had sort of kept it up, so I could type.    Eventually I got a job in the only place where I could get a job, which was at a university.  First working in a lab where they were studying fruit flies, then working as a typist and secretary.  Wound up working for one of the faculty members in Economics, because I was interested in the anthropological perspective, because he was a development economist, and economic development was really a burgeoning field at that point.  And he said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take courses along the way, since you get some free courses?&#8221;  And I thought, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll get a masters in economics.&#8221;  I had taken a number of economics courses in undergraduate.  And then I can probably get a job teaching at a junior college.  So my ambitions were not very lofty at that point.  I just really wanted a job.  Then when I had completed enough courses for a master&#8217;s degree, I went to see the graduate advisor, and he said, &#8220;You know, with your work at Chicago et cetera, you&#8217;re so close to a PhD why don&#8217;t you just go on and take another year&#8217;s worth of courses and do that?&#8221;  So again, accidentally, I mean I can&#8217;t claim that I ever made big decisions about any of this; it was just an accidental flow of events.    So I wound up completing the coursework for the dissertation, for the Ph.D.  Did a dissertation, which was very boring, and I certainly did not find it intellectually exciting.  That was part of a big Resources for the Future project.  This was all out of concern with Appalachia, oddly enough, because there was  great interest in &#8220;why was Appalachia poor, and why were some parts of the country rich and some parts of the country poor?&#8221;  So this was a big project that had been set up to study the Southwest, and I took on a piece of their project as part of my dissertation.  Finished that, and had a great time.  Loved living in Austin, you know, in spite of a rapidly decaying marriage and collapsible 1950s.  But I had pretty much discovered that the 1950s housewife sort of thing wasn&#8217;t for me.  I mean, that&#8217;s one of the things I really failed at.  I didn&#8217;t like staying home.  Even though I love my children, I did not like staying at home all the time.  This was just not something I wanted to do.  I, in 1965, &#8217;66, started looking for a job.  (15:52) Armed with a Ph.D.  And this was a very good time to look for jobs in the academic job market, because the baby boomers were just hitting college at that point, and so lots of universities had rapidly expanding undergraduate enrollments, and they needed faculty.  But in spite of that, I encountered, for the first time in my life, gender discrimination.  And I remember being so stunned.  At that point, you may or may not know this, at that point, the whole academic job market was much less organized than it is today.  I mean, today you&#8217;ve got all of the job listings in those fields that are posted in email or in those little booklets put out, and all the interviews are all set up.    In those days, it was really a network of friends and acquaintances who would get interviews for people, and it was very much an old boys&#8217; network.  And then you would hear about jobs.  I&#8217;d go into the national meetings of economists and was given some possible job openings, and I remember being so stunned when I called one place and was told--this was 1965--I was told, "I&#8217;m sorry, we don&#8217;t hire women.&#8221;  This was a private school, I think in New England.  I can&#8217;t remember which one it was, because I called a number of them.  Other places were just not interested.  And this in spite of the fact that it was a booming market, and that was the reason why I brought that in.    JF:  Were there other women who were in sort of a similar boat as you that you spoke with that were surfing around this job market, trying to break into these old-boy networks, or were you sort of out on your own?  AM:  Well, not at that point, you see.  I didn&#8217;t know of--.  I was the only woman from the Texas department who was--.  There had been two or three other women who had gone through all of the PhD coursework with me, but they for one reason or another were not looking for academic jobs.  Or not at the same time that I was.  So I was the only--.  I suppose there were six or seven of us that year from Texas who were in the job market with new PhDs.  I was the only female.  And I did not know any other women.  See, one of the things that&#8217;s changed enormously today, I think, is today you would have all sorts of email connections and you would have organizations and this sort of thing.  There was none of this, at least that I was aware of.  Now maybe, and I don't know the answer to this, but maybe if I had been in the Northeast or someplace, but I don&#8217;t even have the impression that there was much organization of this.    So I was pretty much on my own, and I had a very--.  The faculty at Texas were very, very supportive.  By this time Ruth Allen had retired, and she may have even--.  I don&#8217;t remember when she died.  But she was no longer a part at all of the scene.  And so all the faculty there were male.  But they were all very supportive, and had never--.  Maybe one or two of them had been less than (19:23), but for the most part they were all very supportive of us.  But they also didn&#8217;t know--.  All of this was kind of strange, and none of us really knew how to handle this.  And what I quickly came to understand was that departments that were hiring also had this same kind of &#8220;we don&#8217;t know how to handle this business of hiring women.&#8221;    It&#8217;s interesting to me and I think it&#8217;s an area where someone needs to go back and do some more work.  Because back in the twenties and thirties, when people like Ruth Allen came out and got their PhDs and went into the job market, apparently there had been some patterns established.  But then it had really disappeared, so the faculty were doing the hiring in the fifties and then in the sixties, or certainly by the sixties, just didn&#8217;t have much experience with hiring women.  And there was a deep--I won&#8217;t say clearly articulated antipathy to hiring women, but there was certainly a reluctance to do so.  One of the questions I got over and over again was &#8220;What do you plan to do?  What are your plans?&#8221;  Talking to my male colleagues, you know we have all agreed that one of the things going into these interviews was to have something about the courses you wanted to teach and wanted you to talk about the research you wanted to do and this sort of thing, so I would answer that way.    Well, what I learned at some point, it finally dawned on me at some point, that they were really asking &#8220;Do you plan to have more children?  Do you plan to stick with this, or are you going to go back to the normal, natural state of affairs and be a housewife?&#8221;  [Laughter]  Even after I recognized that, in some ways it was hard to answer that, because if you said, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to ever return to being a full-time housewife,&#8221; that was offensive to some who still entertained this notion that that&#8217;s where women ought to be.  And it was kind of embarrassing to others who recognized that they were being pretty chauvinistic in their approach to this stuff.  It was all very--.  It was difficult to get through.  I wound up with a job out at the University of Illinois, at Champaign-Urbana, which was not--.  It was a joint position between the economics department and something that had just been established, called the Bureau of Educational Research, I guess.  And this was a kind of hot topic at that point, about the contributions of education to economic development.  Primarily in developing nations, but also in the United States.  And it turned out not to be very--.  Kind of a split appointment, turned out to be not a very good job for me.  So I only stayed in Illinois for three years.  Both because I didn&#8217;t much like the job, I don&#8217;t think they very much liked me, but also because of the ongoing saga of my personal life.  Because by this time, I had divorced my first husband and was living in Champaign-Urbana with two small children.  And in those days, it just wasn&#8217;t a great place to be with--.  It was very family oriented, it was just not--.  But that&#8217;s neither here nor there.  What really happened that brought me here was that I remarried, and remarried a man who had been the faculty of economics at the University of Texas.  Although I always say that he was not my professor, because I have to explain even today.  But we started looking for jobs, and because both of us were economists.  He was twelve years older than I, and was a full professor at Texas when we got married.  And we started looking for jobs and discovered, again, one of the realities of the world that I had not known about until this point, and that was that many universities, both private and public, either had or had thought they had some form of nepotism rules, so that you couldn&#8217;t have husband and wife in the same academic department.  In many cases, schools just thought they had these rules.  And a couple that we knew at the University of Wisconsin [at] Madison, they set out to find the rules.  They were told there were such rules, and they set out to find out where they were written down, and they were not written down.  But it was believed that they were written.  Again, one of the big differences between now and then is that today, every university and college has all sorts of faculty handbooks and that sort of thing.  In those days, it was much looser.  And much more informal in a lot of places.  JF:  Did you find that that could make it harder, because there weren&#8217;t any official rules to point out to go against, or it could make it easier because it gave you more wiggle room?  AM:  Both.  Both.  It really depended on what--.  It made it easier in the sense that it really depended on the way people wanted to interpret it.  Unfortunately, a lot of people wanted to think that you couldn&#8217;t have both husband and wife in the same department.  and when you ask people why not, they said &#8220;Well, you know, you would vote as a bloc.&#8221;  Which makes no sense, because in academic politics, people have friends, they vote as a bloc anyway, I mean what--.  [Laughter]  That was the standard explanation.  JF:  That was the same argument against suffrage.  [Laughter]  AM:  Right, exactly.  [Laughter]  So anyway, we started looking for jobs.  And both because we were in related fields, even within economics, and because we had a hard time finding a place that wanted to hire us both.  And the other thing I learned from that whole experience was that people would say, &#8220;Well, Terry&#8221;--which was my second husband&#8217;s first name--&#8220;Terry, you can get a job here at this university, and Anne, there are some community colleges and other things out here.&#8221;  And Terry was very good about this; he insisted, and probably had more backbone about this than I did, to be truthful.  Because all of this was so new to me.  He insisted, &#8220;No, we both want regular, tenure-track positions.&#8221;  So we kept looking, looking, looking, and then finally drew up a little statement that said &#8220;This is what we both want.&#8221;  So we just shared that up front.  Something that I have said to many young couples since, I think they ought to consider doing.  So that it&#8217;s very clear, the way you&#8217;re going into the job market, so that this doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise to anybody later on that you both want jobs.  It didn&#8217;t have to be at the same university, but it&#8217;d have to have been within reasonable commuting distance.  Well, we found that the University of Tennessee, we knew people who were here; there was one man who had been at the same PhD graduating class that I&#8217;d been at Texas, and he was a relatively new faculty member here.  And a couple of people who had been here for some time who had come from Texas.  And this university was undergoing a kind of late postwar expansion; it had not really grown quite so rapidly after World War Two, as many other universities had, but it was in the late 1960s expanding rapidly in size.  And they were hiring a lot of new faculty.    JF:  Had the University of Tennessee at Knoxville desegregated at that point?  AM:  No, it had integrated, but only shortly before that.  And I cannot tell you the dates now, of when--.  I would have to go back and look that up.    JF:  By the time you were hired there?  AM:  Yeah, it was integrated.  Although it was a very sleepy, Southern university, and to say that it was integrated might give the wrong impression, because I think there were still very few African American students, and very few African American faculty.  I had come here--.  Terry and I came here from Texas and then from Illinois, and this was of course during the--we came in &#8217;68, and this was when the whole Vietnam protest was really taking off and all of that.  I was very surprised by the distance between this campus and what was going on elsewhere.  It was just--.  There were some protests here, and if you read the local histories and if you ask people who had been here, they would say, &#8220;Oh yes, don&#8217;t you remember the whole Billy Graham thing?&#8221;  which is another story into itself.  But there were protests here, but they were very modest as compared.  And the degree of integration here was very, very slight.  When I said to you before we really got started on the interview that I found Knoxville and East Tennessee a very strange and not entirely happy place, it was very Southern.  I mean today I guess I would say Southern Appalachian, but I&#8217;m not sure I was able to make that little distinction at that point.    And they had no nepotism rules.  In fact, they had no written rules.  So they could hire us.  They hired us also, I think, because we had contacts here.  But the funny thing is that I was told, we were both told, that while Terry could come in as a tenured faculty member, because he was already tenured at the University of Texas, I could not have tenure.  I could be here as a regular faculty member with a regular teaching load, but we could not both be tenured.  It&#8217;s about three years after we came here, because I had already started doing some very modest publication, I (30:36) journal in my life, I wasn&#8217;t doing a whole lot, but I was doing some modest publication.  In those days, publication was not really a requirement for tenure here in most academic departments.  If you didn&#8217;t get in trouble and showed up to your class, you would sort of get tenured.  [Laughter]   And this can stay in the interview, because I&#8217;ve said this to a lot of people and a lot of people who were here at the time know that this was absolutely true, that the standards were not very exacting.  So three years after I came here, I got a letter saying I&#8217;d been promoted to associate professor and given tenure.  And being promoted to associate professor was not particularly a surprise because I knew the department had been talking about this, but I thought, we both thought, that I could not get tenure because of what we had been told when we came here.  And stupidly had not asked to see where this was written down.  So I took the letter and put it in a safe deposit box, thinking, &#8220;If ever this comes up, I will have this letter saying I have tenure.&#8221;  Not too long after that at some social gathering, I said to the dean of the college of business and economics, was in the--.  We called it the college of business here.  I said to the dean, who was not the dean who had hired us when we came here--he had gone somewhere by that time--&#8220;Do you know that I have a letter saying I have tenure?&#8221;  And he said &#8220;Of course.  Why wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;  And I said &#8220;Well, you know, I was told when I came here that I couldn&#8217;t have tenure,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not true.&#8221;  So when you said when was I tenured, I ought to remember the date, but I didn&#8217;t know I was get tenured.  [Laughter]  So loose were things at the time.  JF:  And so fragile that you put the letter into a safety deposit box.  AM:  A safety deposit box, yes.  That just seemed to me the sensible thing to do, yeah.  But we came here, although not very happy in the beginning, because it was a very sleepy university with not nearly the sort of intellectual vitality that we had been accustomed to, it turned out to be a pretty good place.  The department we were in was a fairly happy one.  So we sort of settled in, and that was in &#8217;68, and I&#8217;ve been here ever since.  My second husband died a few years ago, so he was here for the rest of his career.  And I would say the university was pretty good to us.  There was support for problems, support for libraries, so I can&#8217;t really complain.  Anyway, that&#8217;s how I came to be here.  And I&#8217;ve not been unhappy, although I&#8217;ve frequently gotten frustrated at the university, which is I guess one of the ways that I&#8217;ve gotten involved in administration, because I kept wanting to change things.  So that&#8217;s that part of the story.  [Laughter]  JF:  Do you recall any turning points or specific events that you could say triggered thoughts in your head about women&#8217;s rights on campus?  Or moments where the light bulb went off over your head and said &#8220;Something&#8217;s here&#8217;s got to change&#8221;?  AM:  Yeah.  I think there were--.  I&#8217;ve thought about this a little, as I was trying to think about this interview.  Made me go back to think about things I hadn&#8217;t thought about for a while.  And there were two things, I think, that happened.  No, maybe three.  The first is that as the university continued to grow, and new faculty were hired, more young women were hired.  In spite of what I would say was, until certainly the late eighties, a pretty strong bias against hiring women.  And those young women, as they came in, brought a much more articulated set of ideas about women&#8217;s rights than I had ever had.  When I think back on it, I think that I just sort of stumbled through all of this.  I knew that women were as smart as men, I knew that I wanted to have a career that was not bound by &#8220;women can do just these things,&#8221; but I was very timid about thinking about other things that women could do, and I was very unorganized in thinking about what rights women should have.  The younger--the women of the next generation after mine--they came in with a much better, articulated set of ideas.    And at some point in there, and I don&#8217;t remember the dates exactly, and I was not involved in these organizations in the very beginning, the university set up a commission for women that reported directly to the chancellor.  I think I mentioned this in my email to you that some of the people who are currently involved with that.  And they also set up at some point a women&#8217;s studies program that was part of what we called the interdisciplinary programs here.  So made it possible for people to teach courses in that program on things.  All of that would have happened sometime in the late seventies and into the eighties; I don&#8217;t remember the dates.  So that was one thing.  A second thing was that I was surprised that changed things for me, was one young woman who came here for a time--she went on to spend most of her career at other universities--but she had come into the economics department.  She was probably ten years younger than I.  In those days, summer teaching was kind of a plum.  People wanted to be able to teach in the summer.  I wanted to be able to teach in the summer because I wanted to earn the money to pay for my children&#8217;s tuition to pay for a private school they were going to in our town.  Not for segregation purposes, but because it was a much better education.  I always need to say.    Karen wanted to teach, I don&#8217;t remember exactly why, but we both wanted to teach in the summer.  We were told that we could not teach in the summer, even though we had rights to--.  There was an elaborate scheme of if you had been there for so long, et cetera, that you were entitled for summer teaching.  We were both told that we could not teach because we had husbands who were teaching.  [Laughter]  This would have been, oh, in the seventies at some point.  And Karen came to my office and said, &#8220;We need to go talk to the dean about this.&#8221;  It was at that point that I thought, &#8220;Oh, good.&#8221;  There are people who have some sort of backbone about this and who are really willing to go and fight about this.  I&#8217;m not sure I would have on my own.  Because I think I was much more trained to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s bad, that&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; and I would rant and rave about it, but I would not really quite prepared to go and stand up to a dean, who at that point still sort of would&#8217;ve been a scary figure for me.    But together we went, and I do remember that the blood all drained out of that dean&#8217;s face when we told him that this was not permissible and that you could not give out summer teaching on the basis of having a husband who is also teaching, and so we, Karen and I, both got teaching that summer.  And that was an important moment for me.  But I attributed a lot of that to the fact that it was that younger generation who really had been better trained and who just had a kind of articulation of these issues.  I keep using that word, but I think that was really very important in the whole thing.  Rather than just making it a personal, &#8220;I would like to be able to do this,&#8221; they had some sense of women&#8217;s rights.  Which I really--.  My generation, I don&#8217;t think, really quite had.  JF:  I was going to say, how do you think this fits in with what was going on in a national level with the Education Rights Act being passed, which raised gender discrimination?  AM:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And that was going to be my third thing.  Okay, but that&#8217;s fine.  Because the most important thing, the single most important thing that happened at this university, was the appointment in the early eighties of a woman named Anne Hopkins.  I think I mentioned her.  And so far as I know, Anne is still at the University of North Florida.  She had had some health issues; I exchanged emails with her a couple of years ago.  I have not heard from her since and I don't know.  She and I frequently would go two or three years without exchanging emails after she left here.  She went from here to Minnesota, and then to North Florida, in administrative positions.    But Anne had been here in the political science department, and moved in the early eighties into central administration as a kind of assistant to the, probably the then-chancellor, maybe the then-provost.  I&#8217;m not sure, but anyway [she] moved into central administration.  In part, I think, because she was in deep conflict with her department.  Because Anne was, again, a fairly abrasive--at least, by local standards, woman--and even though she was my age, maybe even slightly older, she had come from a place that had, again, that provided her with a sense--.  Or maybe she&#8217;s just braver than I am, but that provided her a sense of women&#8217;s rights, and she didn&#8217;t like the way she was being treated in political science.  It may have also been a factor that they were just not treating her as well in that department, which I think had had some history of problems.    At any rate, she went over to work in central administration, and beginning in the middle--.  Then became, I don't remember what her title was, Associate Provost, maybe?  But what she--.  Her portfolio included oversight of all faculty hiring at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  And Anne made many enemies, but also remade this university by insisting of the strict application of the rules of affirmative action.  This is where I go back to Johnson&#8217;s executive order and whatever that was that extended the equal rights provisions to women.  One of the things that the university was deeply concerned with that point was because of a not-very-good history, a lousy history, of not hiring African Americans, and really problems in attracting and retaining African American students, affirmative action was an important tool for dealing with racial issues.  But what Anne also did, which was just so extraordinarily important, was that she extended it so it included women.  When I say she made lots of enemies, I don&#8217;t exaggerate.  Every time there was going to be a new faculty hire, the department had to prepare a narrative summary listing all the people who applied for the position, and listing--.  Saying if there were people who seemed as qualified as those who were brought into campus for interviews, if there were African American candidates or female candidates who seemed as qualified, why they were not interviewed.  And that was the single most important thing that ever happened here.  Up until that time, hiring was this old boys&#8217; network.  I well remember being so angry with the then-head of Economics, because the department needed to hire some replacement for someone who had quit or died, I don&#8217;t remember.  And the department had somebody pick up the phone and call the department head of Vanderbilt, and a few other places around and said, &#8220;Who&#8217;ve you got who would like this job?&#8221;, and then just sort of hire that person.  There&#8217;s no really formal search, no nothing.  Something that just would not happen today at all.  And so Anne, the rep against her was that she bureaucratized, which she did, the whole hiring process, but you had to go through all of this.  In a number of our departments here, which were very, very chauvinist in their hiring, and very deeply bigoted, I think, this made a huge difference.  Because you would have to say, on paper, why this African American candidate who had just received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin, or wherever, was not considered for an interview.  And they would have to do this for women, too.  At that point, things really changed.  I can&#8217;t say that it increased the number of African American faculty dramatically, because it remained very difficult to hire people here, because we didn&#8217;t have a lot of money, and African American candidates in many fields are very hard to hire.  But it did improve that somewhat.  But it certainly improved the hiring of women.    Anne left after a few years; she only lasted maybe five or six years in that position; partly she left because her boss, the provost, George Wheeler, was replaced in a change in upper-level administration, but I think Anne probably had so many scars from what she&#8217;d done, she was ready to get out.  She moved on to Minnesota, if I remember correctly, and went on to have a pretty good career.  But I give her credit for making the single most important change.  And then if you look at the whole history of many of our departments, you&#8217;ll see that--in English, for example, in history--you see just a big increase in the number of female faculty.  And that began to change everything and to make a huge difference for other women coming into the departments.  That really dates to the mid-eighties.  We still have some departments, in areas where traditionally it&#8217;s much harder to hire women, where we still lag far behind, in engineering and et cetera.  But there&#8217;s a conscious effort; most of the remnants of that old kind of chauvinism are pretty much gone.  JF:  So it sounds like a lot of the agitation, or movement to break down gender discrimination, came from the faculty who were in place to bring in new faculty.  And not so much from students or from community activism, protests against the university.  AM:  Right.  No, it came from--I wouldn&#8217;t even say it came from the faculty.  Nearly so much as I think a lot of it came from administration, and a lot of it came from--.  This is where I part company from a lot of the people that I suggested you talk to, who would give faculty protests more weight.  Maybe because I&#8217;m an ex-administrator, for whatever reason.  I give the academic administration a lot of credit for changing it because partly I think they had an ambition for the University of Tennessee to break it out of its Southern mold and make it a nationally recognized university.  And I think it couldn&#8217;t be, so long as we retained these sorts of barriers.  But as that happened, faculty pressure became important, and particularly, as I said, as younger faculty were hired, they were not tolerant of the kind of practices that had been in place.  Although it was certainly true in some departments that life was made uncomfortable for very aggressive, or as various people might have said, abrasive faculty.  There was a corps of people who were pushing for change, and so in that sense you&#8217;re right.  From the community, and from students, no.  There was very little pressure.  Now there was going on in Knoxville at the same time as all these events that I&#8217;m talking about, a fairly active community pushing for more rights and more opportunities for African Americans.  The NAACP had a very active chapter.  People like Sarah Moore Green, I think I mentioned to you, had been pushing for integration.  The whole school integration process here, which happened before I moved to Knoxville, had been an interesting one.  And I don't know if you&#8217;ve ever seen, you probably have, the tape on the Clinton Integration, just outside of Knoxville.  And all of that&#8217;s just an interesting set of events, but that was not well connected, as far as I can see, with the university.  I was sort of aware of it, and there were some people on campus, not faculty so much, and not students, but who were advocates for African American rights.  But it never had the kind of role on campus that one might think.  I think one reason for that, and one reason why even today, the black voice in this campus is not as loud as one might expect, is because East Tennessee is Appalachian, and the percentage of the population that was black was much smaller here than it was in the Western part of the state.  This university has continued to have a huge problem in recruiting African American students, many of whom are from Nashville west to Memphis, and who regard this as kind of foreign territory.  And we just don&#8217;t have the kind of really large black community, and very--.  We&#8217;ve done much better over the last ten years in attracting black students.  But we didn&#8217;t have a good record until then.  A few of the black faculty who have been here, and who have been outspoken advocates, George Wright comes to mind, from the history department, and he recently--.  He&#8217;s not here now.  But the relationship has been a troubled one.  I don't know if you ever arranged a meeting with Cynthia Fleming; she could tell you more about this.  Some of the other people in the local community could probably tell you more than I could.  JF:  So among the women that you--.  That were brought in under Karen&#8217;s efforts to change things, what would you say were some of their biggest concerns, in terms of women&#8217;s rights and women&#8217;s issues?  What were the hot topics, or the things that tended to rally people the most?  AM:  Right.  Salary has been a big issue.  As of course, as it has everywhere.  And this is an area where universities made several efforts to bring women&#8217;s salaries up to--.  There&#8217;ve been special adjustments and special funds.  It&#8217;s a very complicated issue, because women have tended to be concentrated in those academic areas where the salaries are lower: modern foreign languages, in English and history, not in science and engineers.  And we have a huge gap, as many universities do, between what people in engineering and law and business get paid and what people in the humanities get paid.  That&#8217;s a big issue, and a not fully resolved issue.    When I was vice chancellor for academic affairs--slash provost--I tried every year to go through and look at the salaries of women that were out of some range and see if they were inequities.  Much to the dismay of some of my women friends, I generally found that the differences could be explained by things other than overt discrimination.  And this leads me to another related issue: I think women too often--and to an extent this happened to me, although it wound up being okay--too often, women were given all sorts of service responsibilities and were promoted on the basis of the fulfillment of those service responsibilities.  Therefore, as the university changed--which it certainly did over the eighties and nineties, so that there was more emphasis on scholarly publication, on standing in the larger disciplines--then women didn&#8217;t meet those new criteria, and so frequently remained as associate professors rather than moving on to full professor rank, or didn&#8217;t get higher salaries because they weren&#8217;t perceived as being as productive.  JF:  By service responsibilities, do you mean like sitting on committees--.  AM:  Sitting on committees, yes, sitting on lots of committees.  Doing lots of advising, and teaching introductory courses.  One department, which I will not name--it&#8217;s a big science department--has insisted, at least until the time I left in 2004, and I think they probably still are insisting, that they need to hire women who will always have some sort of adjunct to teach the most basic introductory course.  They are a department with a lot of faculty who don&#8217;t have very heavy teaching responsibilities, but according to the people in that department, when I used to talk to them, the men are doing research which takes them out of the range of being able to communicate so effectively with freshmen.  And they see this as a women&#8217;s role.  I&#8217;m putting all of this in much more polite language than I have used sometimes, but then I have repeated conflicts with that particular department.  But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an unusual perception.  JF:  It must seem a lot like back in the fifties when women were being slated to teach or nurse.  AM:  Yeah.  And in that department, at any rate, what&#8217;s happened is that faculty--male faculty have had wives who have PhDs, or close to PhDs, in that same discipline, and they have come in here and served as adjuncts.  It&#8217;s that kind of thing that causes women, even when they&#8217;re hired as tenure-track assistant professors, to be relegated to these other responsibilities, which then just don&#8217;t earn them the salaries.  The other thing that I think is a huge problem, and I don't know the solution to this, is that particularly in the sciences, counting engineering, those are the areas in which this university is now stronger than any other area.  It is very hard for young women to balance the need to get grants, to do all of the publication, et cetera, during what are their prime childbearing years.  This is a huge issue.  And one that has made me think that perhaps we should rethink the pattern of hiring and of tenure in some of these areas.  And I say that with reluctance, because I was certainly a person who wanted this university to be much more demanding in its requirements for tenure.  (57:49)  I really applauded the efforts of people like George Wheeler and Ann Hopkins and that whole string of others, to bring the University of Tennessee into the larger world and say, &#8220;Now people need to be productive scholars.&#8221;  It has just become so hard, in the highly competitive sciences and engineering, for people to do this.  Because their whole sort of apprentice period is stretched out.  So that remains a big problem, I think.    I don&#8217;t think, except in a few departments, and that will soon be taken care of by the normal demographic balance.  I don&#8217;t think there is overt discrimination against women.  Nor do I think that race is a big problem.  I think there is this perception of &#8220;Women are better at advising; women are better at teaching introductory courses.&#8221;  There&#8217;s almost a kind of perverse discrimination that says that, &#8220;Well, she hasn&#8217;t published as much as we would expect, but she&#8217;s so good at these other things so we will promote her to associate professor.&#8221;  Then people get stuck at that level and never make it on to full professorship.  I don't know that that works with African Americans; that&#8217;s not so clear to me.  Because we haven&#8217;t had enough cases, sadly, to know.  we&#8217;ve not had a good record with African Americans.  It&#8217;s sad.  JF:  So--.  AM:  We have had a good record, now, with women moving into higher administration.  Matter of fact, the provost is female, and her three associate provosts are female.  So that&#8217;s very good.  And several of our deans have been female, or are female, even outside of the traditional nursing and social work.  So that&#8217;s all very good.  We do not have the same record with African Americans.  JF:  Did this make it harder to form alliances between--.  Activism between women&#8217;s rights, and activism around racial rights?  AM:  I think so.  There&#8217;s a commission for women, and there&#8217;s also a commission for blacks.  Although these two cooperate in some sense--the chair of the commission for women sits on the commission for blacks and vice-versa.  I think now we have a commission for gay, lesbian, trans--.  I never get it right, LGBT.  So then they all three sit on the other commissions.  I can&#8217;t say that there&#8217;s ever been much cooperation between the two that I have missed, the commission for women and the commission for blacks, partly I think it&#8217;s been a matter of personality of the people involved, but partly it has also been I don't think that the people, the most active members of the commission for blacks, have seen women&#8217;s issues as theirs.  And I don&#8217;t think that women have seen the black issues as theirs.  There&#8217;s not been this view of [these] as related.  In a sense historically, they certainly are closely related.  But that&#8217;s not been the pattern here.  To a considerable extent, the activism for blacks has come from student affairs and from the sort of non-academic side of the university.  JF:  Whereas for women's rights it tends to come from administration?  AM:  Yep.  JF:  --and faculty?  AM:  Yep.  [Recorder is turned off and then back on]  Over the years, women who were leaders in the national women's rights movements have been brought to campus and have energized students, have energized faculty.  And so in contrast to the earlier part of my life story that I told you about, there were ways for women to think about these things, and there are ways for them to say, &#8220;Yes, I have a right to demand this sort of treatment, because this has been done in the country.&#8221;  I think that&#8217;s been important.  Through the women's studies program, through the commission for women, and generally through the support of departments.  I would say particularly the English department and the modern foreign languages, there&#8217;ve been a number of prominent speakers and other things like that.    Student activism has been much less obvious to me in this area.  There are generally--.  There are always students who are members of the commission for women, and there are--.  There&#8217;s a women&#8217;s center in the university center, and they have some programs but I must say that over the years I have been less aware of what they were doing.  Maybe this is just me paying attention to other things, but I don&#8217;t think this is entirely so.  When I have talked to students in the last three years--.  I&#8217;ve been teaching one honors course per year, and that&#8217;s been interesting after many years of not teaching, while I was doing full-time administration.  It&#8217;s been interesting to me to go back and talk to the young students.  And I am sometimes not very happy by their passivity.  (1:05:07) of young women who seem to just not be aware of the importance of some of these issues.  And I think a number of us on the commission for women, and I was on this commission at this point, whether in an administrative role I can&#8217;t remember, were--.  JF:  Would this have been mid-eighties?  AM:  This would&#8217;ve been--.  The event that I&#8217;m going to tell you about right now was probably in 2001 or so.  JF:  Okay.  AM:  2002.  The young--.  Some group of women on campus, and I don&#8217;t remember now how this all got organized--they decided to reestablish the whole homecoming queen.  And we were all--.  I mean, those of us of a certain age were all kind of appalled that they were going to do this.  And they saw absolutely nothing wrong with doing it.  It was a very funny meeting.  And they did reestablish it.  [Laughter]  JF:  So it&#8217;s student activism, but it&#8217;s not--.  AM:  It&#8217;s very--.  It has returned to a kind of traditionalism and they just don&#8217;t--.  I think they don&#8217;t--.  That many of the young women really don&#8217;t understand, don&#8217;t know, that there was a time when women did not have these rights.  They just sort of take it for granted.  And take for granted that there are many other opportunities.  But they still need to be pushing for equal treatment and fair treatment.  But I&#8217;m not sure where--.  I think we have probably failed to pass that on in an adequate way.  That was certainly one of the things that many of us included after the homecoming queen fiasco: we need to talk to more young women about this.  [pause]  I think that the young women who come here are pretty traditional.  JF:  Does this seem to you to be a change since the seventies and eighties?  Or a continuity?  AM:  [Laughter]  Well, probably I&#8217;m going to give you an answer to that which is probably not well-grounded.  I think that there&#8217;s been a serious loss of activism and of concern among the students.  They don&#8217;t seem to me to be angry enough, but I keep thinking maybe that&#8217;ll change when they don&#8217;t find jobs.  [Laughter]  But I don't know.  I found that trying to teach these--these were freshmen and sophomores that I was teaching, and they were very, very bright.  Very polite, and very passive, and accepting of the world and generally assuming that the world was going to be good for them.  They come from, by and large, affluent families.  It&#8217;s interesting that the African Americans of this last class that I taught--there were two young African Americans, both of whom are from far less affluent families in Memphis, and they had seen a different side of the world.  And they were much more overtly ambitious about their own plans, but they didn&#8217;t seem to be so ambitious about changing the world.  It was much more about succeeding, and succeeding through having a successful career in business or a successful career in medicine and this sort of thing.  And I find this kind of disturbing, but then I liked the sixties, so.  JF:  Were there any local alliances in the seventies and eighties that got, that you remember working with women on campus or the women on campus working with them?  AM:   Working with community and others, yeah?  I suppose that probably the most active--.  Two groups in town.  And I was  never very active in working with them, although I was certainly aware of them and supportive of them.  One was the League of Women Voters, which has been a fairly active group here in town in support of all sorts of women&#8217;s rights, and certainly good government, but also much more basic sorts of rights issues.  The woman who&#8217;s currently head of the League of Women Voters here, Jamey Dobbs, D-O-B-B-S, has not lived here too terribly long, but she might well have some of the history of this.    Then the other group that has been much more active in Knoxville is the Tennessee Valley Universalist Unitarian Church.  They have been the sort of liberal voice, along with the NAACP and the local chapter of the Urban League.  Those have been the kind of liberal voices in Knoxville.  And particularly important was the Unitarian Church, for its association with--.  Because a lot of faculty were involved there.  So those are the groups that I would think that--.  For a long time, there was every year on Martin Luther King&#8217;s birthday, there was a parade and events on campus, and a fair number of faculty and some students would participate in that, so that was kind of a meeting across different groups.  Even that&#8217;s kind of faded and become less and less important.  So I can&#8217;t say there are strong alliances, except those two: League of Women Voters and the Unitarian Church.  We&#8217;re not a very, I don't know maybe we&#8217;re just not a very well organized community.    Politically, this is with the legacy that goes all the way back to the Civil War, this is a strongly Republican area.  Kind of mountain Republicanism.  And the local Democratic party, which might have been active in some other parts of the world, is very weak and not well organized, and so.  And there are just all sorts of other organizations that one might have elsewhere that--.  There&#8217;s been an occasional attempt to organize a local chapter of NOW [National Organization for Women], other women&#8217;s groups, but they&#8217;ve never come to much of anything and a few women would get together, usually at the Unitarian Church, which would let women come and meet there, but nothing has ever come of it.  JF:  Did you ever go to the meetings, or know people who did?  AM:   I have been to some of these meetings over the years, and have usually been supportive of trying to do these kinds of things, but I don&#8217;t do much of it anymore.  I just kind of have given up on most of these things.  My energy&#8217;s elsewhere.    JF:  So your sense would be that it was just sort of too small, too few people, to sort of get off the ground?  AM:  It&#8217;s not necessarily that it&#8217;s too small, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s the same group of people over and over and over again, and it&#8217;s probably too small to support a diversity of organizations.  When you walk in and you see the same people that you&#8217;re going to see at the next meeting, you think, &#8220;Why do we need another thing?&#8221;  And I think there&#8217;s always been, and I say this with sadness, that there&#8217;s always been a little failure to, in my view, to sort of put together black and women&#8217;s issues and that sort of thing into a larger sort of movement.  The two have just never really gelled together.  JF:  Can you remember any specific reactions against women&#8217;s rights in the seventies and eighties?  Or are there any events or moments or groups that flash out to you that really, beyond just the grumbling behind the hands about it, but really actively opposed what the administration and faculty were trying to do to lift gender limits and gender discrimination?  AM:  Not really.  I remember one history professor who was very upset because of a flyer that had been posted by the commission of women, and I no longer remember exactly what the flyer said, but it was something that asserted that there had been discrimination against women.  And he was very upset because the commission for women was a beneficial organization of the university, and this seemed to him to be unfair, and he came and talked to me at one point about that.  But that was really a kind of one-person protest.  I was sort of stunned by it, so I remember it, because I just hadn&#8217;t expected this from someone--I mean, he&#8217;s younger than I am, just don&#8217;t expect it from somebody of that age, and otherwise accomplishents, to do that.  No, otherwise I really don&#8217;t.  I think in a way, everything you hear has always been very muted.  People used to come here from other parts of the country would complain after being here for a little while, that part of the problem was that everyone was too polite.  And that may be true.  Most of the grumbling against Ann Hopkins, who was a lightning rod for so much of this during the time she was here, was always very muted, very much behind the hands.  And I used to think that the people that you had to be most careful about in dealing with them, as fellow faculty members and that sort of thing, were the ones who spoke most loudly about being all in favor of women having equal rights.  Because they were the ones who were going to, you know, cut you off at the knees or block something or the other.    I think as women became more important in administrative positions, becoming department heads and then deans and moving into central administration, that there was resentment.  And I know, at one point, when I was vice chancellor for academic affairs, when I used to go with several of my women friends to have lunch at the dining room where a lot of the central administration--.  There would be things I was told, by the chancellor, that there was some concern that I was always eating lunch with these women.  And I said, &#8220;Well who do you have lunch with?&#8221;  Of course, he was with lots of men.  But that&#8217;s different.  You know, they sort of thought we were plotting against them.  [Laughter]   But it&#8217;s much more that kind of thing.  It&#8217;s a very polite place.  JF:  So I mentioned when we spoke before the interview started, there&#8217;s always been this trouble with the word feminism and what it means, it&#8217;s always meant so many different things to different people, if I could throw the million-dollar question at you, what did feminism mean then, and how do you think, how was it used and what kind of reactions to that word?  AM:  Well, I came to understand feminism in the course of the--.  Really, probably the course of the sixties.  Not so much in the course of the fifties, although I read some of the early feminist literature and was certainly influenced by it.  But I suppose it was really in the sixties that I really came to understand feminism as meaning an assertion of the essential equality of women, and the rights of women to aspire to the same sorts of accomplishments and hopes, et cetera, as men have.  And a refusal to accept the traditional roles as being the only roles for women.  So I certainly would describe myself, at that point, as a pretty strong feminist.  Although again, as I say, I wasn&#8217;t as always as brave as I now, looking back, wish I had been.  But I think one sort of had to go into that.    I will confess that I became somewhat alarmed by the 1990s, I guess, really maybe the eighties and nineties, by some of the forms of feminism that some of the younger faculty seemed to be advocating.  Which seemed to be much more anti-male and asserting a kind of superiority of women.  I have never been all that comfortable with all that, although I confess there are lots of days when I think the world would be a better place if women ran it.  [Laughter]  So I do understand that argument, but I&#8217;m not totally comfortable with that very hard sort of feminism.  But I would still describe myself as a feminist.    What I have found somewhat disturbing in very recent times is that the students that I talk to--and even some younger women faculty--don&#8217;t want to be called feminists.  And I don't know whether that is, I&#8217;ve never fully understood whether that&#8217;s a rejection of some of that what I called &#8220;hard-edged feminism&#8221; that I think came along later on, or whether it is a feeling that there is no longer any need for the kind of feminism that I think I adopted, and lots of others of us did, in the course of getting through the fifties and moving into the sixties.  I would still describe myself as a feminist.  And sometimes when I talk to students and I describe myself as a feminist, they&#8217;ve been a little surprised by this.  But I think one still needs to use that term in that sense.    [Pause]  There was a time in there where I was not totally happy with the term because I don&#8217;t think it conveyed a greater assertion of the superiority of women that I would want to--.  Although there are lots of days when I say the world would be a better place--.  [Laughter]  JF:  Well, is there anything that you thought I would ask that I didn&#8217;t, or anything that you would like to add?    AM:  No, I think we&#8217;ve probably pretty much covered it.  I would add that there is a lot that I do not know, and I hope you will have the opportunity to speak to other people about Knoxville history, particularly about racial issues and racial rights.  I really, as I thought about this, thought it&#8217;s a sad thing that I know so little.  I&#8217;ve certainly known in various ways many of the major players in this over the years, but I&#8217;ve never had very close working relationships.  Most of this has been off campus, and to the extent that it has been on campus, and for a variety of complicated reasons, it&#8217;s never been an easy relationship.  And so that&#8217;s something I hope you can learn more about.  Then also, I guess I would add, if you talk to some of the people who&#8217;ve been involved in the commission for women, any of those people, you&#8217;ll probably get a somewhat different version than I&#8217;ve given you of events here.  Because what I have clearly not said, one of the things that I have not said, is that women activists were the cause of change that occurred.  (1:22:54).  But I think it was a national movement and an administrative desire to change the university that I would give more prominence to.  And some of my friends would strongly disagree with that.  So you&#8217;ll find some disagreement.  JF:  Would they attribute it more to local, like grassroots organizing?  AM:  I think they would attribute it more to individual women who have fought for the greater equality.  JF:  I see.  AM:  And maybe because my own intellectual proclivity is not just focused on individuals as much as the cause of change, but also certainly because some of the people who&#8217;ve been outspoken, I think they have been outspoken without necessarily being particularly effective in bringing about the change that was being produced by the people.    JF:  Would you consider them representative, or more--.  AM:  No, not representative, but more--.  JF:  Individuals.  AM:  Yeah.  JF:  With personal ambition?  AM:  Yeah.  Personal issues, yeah.  And I have no objection to that, and one needs the whole mix of this.  But when I think about what&#8217;s happened at university and what&#8217;s happened at the university and in Knoxville, that I think someone should see a somewhat larger context.  That&#8217;s about all.  Okay.  JF:  Well thank you very much, Professor Mayhew.    AM:  Absolutely.  I hope you got some useful stuff.  [Laughter]  [Recorder is turned off and then back on]    AM:  One footnote to all of this: I think one of the things that has been very important in this university and in this town has been the success of the [University of Tennessee] Lady Vols [Volunteers].  The Lady Vols basketball team, and of the women&#8217;s athletics program.  I thought of this just as we were finishing up because I was thinking about how important I think sports have been, and Title IX has been, for women.  And it&#8217;s been particularly important here, because of the enormous success of Lady Vols basketball, and for many people in this community, the University of Tennessee is the sports teams.  That&#8217;s the connection with them.  Over the years, the team that has been the most consistently successful has been a women&#8217;s team.  JF:  Imagine that.  I never would&#8217;ve thought to ask you about that but that&#8217;s a great point.  AM:  I just suddenly thought about adding that, and I think that has changed the views of a lot of people.  Certainly it has been, and I should&#8217;ve plugged this earlier, when you asked about other alliances or something.  When you go to a Lady Vols basketball team, you see all of these women and young girls who are from the community and who don&#8217;t have any other connections with the university but they&#8217;re so focused on that.  That has been very, very important.  This women&#8217;s athletics program here is one of only two or three in the country that has retained its independence from the Mets athletic department.  And they have been enormously successful in this, and so when the whole story is written of women&#8217;s movements in Knoxville, the person who may be even more important than Ann Hopkins or any of the other people who worked on this, as much as I dislike this, was Pat [Head] Summitt, was the Lady Vols basketball coach.  That&#8217;s something to be thought about.    JF:  And bringing women into the university on scholarships?  AM:  And making young girls, sort of giving them inspirational models, and just kind of generally representing what women can do.  As an academic, in a university where there&#8217;s frequently been tension between the athletics and the academics, I&#8217;d probably tend to overlook that, but I do have to say that has been very important.  It probably has also been racially important because many of the women who have been very successful have been black.  When I think about my whole life in the South, I think it&#8217;s very clear that racial integration has been encouraged through athletics, and that&#8217;s been an important thing.  So I wouldn&#8217;t discount that in women's rights too.  JF:  That&#8217;s a great point.  Thank you for that.
