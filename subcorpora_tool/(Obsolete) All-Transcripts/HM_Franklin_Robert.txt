Story_ID: 221942
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start by asking if you could tell me about your mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name, Lee Ethel McCann.  She is a twin and, fraternal twin, Lee Arthur McCann, and so my mother is Lee Ethel Franklin.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: Born in Battle, Mississippi, where the extended family lived at that time.
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she, the family left Mississippi at the age of ten or eleven, and migrated to Chicago [Illinois], so she was on the South Side of Chicago for the later part of her elementary and all of her secondary years.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: They lived on a farm.  They were sharecroppers, hard work, large family, and because she was quite small as the youngest of the nine siblings, she had developed a nickname, so they said she was like a little dot next to these huge brothers, so they began to call her Dot, and, a name my father [Robert Franklin, Sr.] later transformed into Dorothy, thinking that it was short of Dorothy, a proper name, but it never really was.  So, she was an energetic, fun-loving young lady who affiliated with the church and took her spirituality very seriously and that continued through her life.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: She talked a lot about the rigors of farm life, the challenges of experiencing a difficult harvest season, of draught, of having to eat less and work harder, and the dangers of growing up on Mississippi and sort of crossing boundaries of Jim Crow segregation and so there was a sense of, even as a child, of understanding the rules of engagement across the color line, and a kind of etiquette required for surviving.  She talked a lot about her anxiety for her brothers who often tested that line, who often transgressed the racial etiquette of the day and who apparently stirred the ire of the local white townspeople, so she said she lived in an almost kind of constant, quiet fear for her brothers.
Story_ID: 221943
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your father [Robert Franklin, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: My father was born also in Mississippi, his family, in a little place called Water Valley, Mississippi.  They moved around some and he ended up in Grenada, Mississippi for a while and then on to West Memphis, Arkansas, where they lived for a number of years, and then in the, I think in his high school years, he moved to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Did he share any stories with you about his growing up?
Speaker 2: The story that most often comes to mind was of his father, who was a very light-skinned, very fair-haired gentleman who could pass for white, and yet, you know, had this very large family, black family.  They would travel and he would sort of humor us with these stories of how often when they stopped on the road to get a bite to eat or something, he'd walk in the front door and be served without question and then he'd buy all this stuff and, you know, the local folk and the shopkeeper would say, you know, "This is for your Negroes out in the car."  He said, "Yeah, yeah," and he played along and so they got him--you know, they had a laugh about it.  But, I didn't meet him, his father, Farney Franklin, until he came to visit us in Chicago and I began to sort of put the pieces together.  He continued to live in the South until he died.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, my brother, Brian Anthony Franklin, who later changed his name after repeated visits to West Africa, he now is known as Kwame Bandele.  Brother Kwame has taken a real interest in genealogy and, I think, two years ago participated in an international genealogy project, an Africa DNA tracing project.  He submitted blood samples as part of this test and [University of] Oxford [Oxford, England] had contacted him, indicated that the DNA sample traced the family back to Liberia, to the Kru people, so he continues to do research on that work and it was covered in an article and published in the Chicago Tribune in the fall of 2003.
Speaker 1: Do you know if your ancestors were slaves or if they were free?
Speaker 2: They were slaves.  Kwame's research indicated that the--our people, I think the last name, Poe [ph.], came in to the United States through Charleston, South Carolina, and were sold and were split up and worked in, on various plantations there and then over time, parts of the family found their way west and into Mississippi.
Story_ID: 221944
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Esmond Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois] on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I'd like for you to provide a recollection of your grandparents.  Did you know your grandparents on your mother's [Lee McCann Franklin] side?
Speaker 2: Only my grandmother.  I knew her exceedingly well, because we actually lived with her, lived in the house that she owned.  It was an interesting situation because our two, my grandmother, maternal grandmother, and my grandmother, her name, Martha McCann, grandma Martha's sister, who is Mary, and these are right out of the biblical Mary and Martha, when they moved from, migrated from Mississippi to the South Side of Chicago, purchased two houses and these were three-story houses on the far South Side of Chicago.  They had these two houses right next door to each other, with, I guess a half acre of land on each side of the house.  My grandmother used her land, part of the land, for a garden, so it was really, I have these wonderful memories and stories.  You know, here we were on the South Side of Chicago and there's a garden there and she, that garden, she fed that community and fed, it was a part of her religious mission work of providing fresh food to people in need that she served as a missionary for our church.  So, I have a lot of memories of Grandma Martha McCann.  I didn't know, I never met, her husband, my maternal grandfather.  He passed away rather early, and, Ollie McCann, O-L-L-I-E, and so I don't think he ever made the journey to Chicago.  In fact I think he died rather young in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about your grandparents on your father's [Robert Franklin, Sr.] side?  What can you tell us about them?
Speaker 2: My, I knew my grandfather [Farney Franklin] only through these visits.  I don't claim to have known him very well.  My memories of conversations with him are from my early years, nine or ten years of age and below because at a certain point he stopped coming.  He would drive his pickup truck from Mississippi to Chicago and I always recall it was loaded with fresh produce, often apples, is my memory and we were permitted to climb up into the back of the truck and pick apples, select apples that we wanted to eat and that was a great joy, but my grandmother, they apparently separated, because she lived in Detroit [Michigan] with several of her daughters, so our family, the Franklins, were split between Detroit and Chicago.  We haven't established any formal linkage to the Reverend C. L. Franklin, Aretha Franklin line, but some of my uncles there in Detroit claimed that, I'm sure for self-serving reasons, but she lived there and we would often spend summers in Detroit with her, parts of the summer.
Story_ID: 221945
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was in a house, an apartment with my parents [Lee McCann Franklin and Robert Franklin, Sr.] on 117th Street and Vincennes [Avenue] in Chicago [Illinois], far South Side of Chicago, right near the border of Chicago where Chicago ends and the suburb of Blue Island [Illinois] begins.  Our apartment was there on that street, Vincennes, and I recall Christmas in that little apartment, which was really around the corner from the house that my grandmother [Martha McCann] had purchased, and recall my father and mother hiding toys in this, you know, it was a fairly small apartment, but my brother and I used to hide under the table and behind chairs, and that was our sort of playground in the big city, and then the challenge of trying to hide presents in such a small place was always I think a test in the creativity of our parents, but they'd find ways to disguise things and, so, that was my earliest memory was my brother and I, my brother David [Franklin], who was closest in age to me.
Story_ID: 221946
Speaker 1: Can you describe what your family life was like?
Speaker 2: Well, because we, my grandmother [Martha McCann] literally lived just a half block away on, you know, the back street of Vincennes [Avenue], that was Watkins [Avenue], there was an alley separating, cutting the block in half, we often would go out to visit my grandmother.  She had the washing machine, so we would take our wash over to her house, so I recall going, you know, walking down the alley with these clothing and being there most of the day.  We played in the garden and ran around, and then at the end of the day we'd come back until, you know, we were of school age but this would have been three years old, four years old, that we were doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your siblings' names and birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: I, have a stepbrother, who is Michael Franklin.  He is four years older than I am, and then I come next and then my brother, David [Franklin].  Did you ask for--you didn't ask for ages.
Speaker 1: You could state them if you'd like.
Speaker 2: I mean, that'll be a test of my memory, actually, but David follows me and who is, I guess, three years younger, and then next is my brother Andrew [Franklin], and Andrew would be, I think, five years younger and then Kwame [Bandele], born Brian [Franklin], and then my sister, Cheri, Cheri Rochelle Franklin, and my youngest sister is Martha Patrice, and Martha Patrice is deceased.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on growing up in these early years?
Speaker 2: The early years, we moved from the Vincennes location to Watkins, which is where when I went to school for those years of elementary [Esmond Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and most of high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], we lived on Watkins Street in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your neighbors?  Can you describe your block or your community at that time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, I have fond memories of my block and the neighborhood, because it had a distinctive name in that part of Chicago.  There were still marshlands in certain neighborhoods and so with the thick foliage that appeared in the summer, the nickname for that part of our neighborhood was called the jungle, and so, you know, we lived in the jungle and not so affectionately known as jungle bunnies at the time, but we stuck together as we defended ourselves against those who made pejorative comments about those who reside in the jungle.  The advantage, we had relatively larger houses and a little land, unlike, as you moved further into the city, from which my grandmother had moved, you know, things were very tight in a sort of tenement kind of housing; lots of young men, I recall, who were kind of role models and some negative models as well.  Guys who used to race fast cars and motorcycles just a couple blocks away from the house, was sort of the drag strip, and we'd go down and watch them race their cars.  I had one of our, the most charismatic young man in the neighborhood was a guy who had a certain, he was a kleptomaniac, I mean, he could steal anything and so he always entertained us with his latest treasure as he'd show up each weekend with someone's automobile or motorcycle, and then, you know, hours later the police would arrive, drive through, and ask us if we had seen this or that, or this individual, but he was kind of the entertainer of the community.  And there was a beginning of street gang activity in that part of Chicago, so I remember some of these young men preparing, almost, I'd use the phrase preparing for war.  This was in the early 1960s, and as the Blackstone Rangers [Almighty Black P. Stone Nation] then were starting to really take off and trying to, it's an interesting phenomena of coopting or drafting, annexing, small random street gangs into their larger organization.  So, I remember the older boys in my neighborhood talk about how they felt about the possibility of being sort of annexed into the one of two gangs, the Black Disciples or the Blackstone Rangers; Gangster Disciples or Blackstone Rangers.
Story_ID: 221947
Speaker 1: Could you tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sunshine on hot summer days in Chicago [Illinois], shining through thick trees and foliage, the shaded streets, where we played touch football and baseball and hopscotch, the girls jumping rope in the street there in Chicago, you know, dogs barking, the odors of peach cobbler that my grandmother [Martha McCann] used to prepare and everyone looked forward to grandma's peach cobbler.  So, it was a tight-knit community.  My grandmother knew everyone on the block, everyone knew her and appreciated her service to the community.  She would send us with bags of collard greens, you know, freshly picked, to a neighbor, and through her acts of charity and philanthropy, folks got to know us and, you know, that's Martha's grandson and, so people looked out for us and took care of us.  Me, my brother, David [Franklin], and Andrew [Franklin], the three of us at that point.
Story_ID: 221948
Speaker 1: So, could you state for me again what elementary school you attended and just discuss, if you'd like, teachers that you recall that influenced you.
Speaker 2: Esmond Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois] on, I think it was Montvale Avenue.  It was approximately, I don't know, three-quarters of a mile to a mile away, which felt like a long way for young kids to walk, especially in Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] winters.  I recall, I mean, literally trying to march through several feet of snow to get to school and the teachers were always very forgiving, you know, if you showed up late given the weather.  My kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Kirschner [ph.], was a very warm and affirming kind of person.  She was very refreshing because, in a way, this was my first encounter with someone, first of all, a white woman outside a household, spending most of the day with her in this classroom setting and fortunately she was, I think, just a terrific maternal educator, devoted to her craft and just very affirming.  My third grade teacher was really a person who I recall who kind of put the fear of teachers and of God into us, Mrs. Bile [ph.], and--what a name, Mrs. Bile--she had no qualms about putting a ruler across one's knuckles and making us learn the times tables, et cetera.  So those two really stand out in my mind, and then the principal, Mr. Fornasari [ph.], was a real disciplinarian and I recall how he'd walk through the hallway with his suspenders exposed and, we kind of knew the sheriff was in town when he walked through the hall.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?  If your early teachers were describing you, what do you think they would say?
Speaker 2: A ham, a showman, an entertainer, the class clown, lots of energy, not very focused, not very serious about his studies, doing well enough to get by but in need of discipline and focus.  Never a serious discipline problem but on occasion just talked too much, just carried on a joke a little too long, took it too far.
Story_ID: 221949
Speaker 1: What kind of involvement did you have with your family in early years with church?
Speaker 2: It's a core element of our weekly, and sometimes daily, existence.  My grandmother, Martha McCann, was a leader in our local church, St. Paul Church of God in Christ [Chicago, Illinois].  It was several miles away, fifteen to twenty miles perhaps, and it took forever to drive there and so we spent a lot of time sort of surveying the growth of urban Chicago [Illinois] as we drove from home from the edge of Chicago into church, which was on 45th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], you know, midway between the edge of Chicago and downtown our church sat, so we covered all that distance before the emergence of the Dan Ryan Expressway, that would facilitate that journey in considerably less than the time it took us.  She was a missionary and a church mother.  My mother [Lee McCann Franklin] also functioned as a financial secretary at the church and a Sunday school teacher.  They both provided leadership for Vacation Bible School, and we had often had little clean-up odd jobs at the church, so we were there.  We'd go every day after school, this long drive again, and then a day off Saturday and then back Sunday early morning, Sunday school, church, eat there, and then evening service, often evening program, so I can't imagine how we were ready for school on Monday mornings, and we were usually pretty exhausted from a strenuous week of being at church.
Speaker 1: Did you have any dreams and aspirations as a young man that you recall?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, kids are impressionable, television was making its impact at that time as it was being widely distributed, you know, throughout America of the day, and so we recall, you know, our first television set, of seeing the Motown artists and seeing young [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. on television.  When he came to Chicago, you know, we'd watch TV, "Oh, Dr. King is here," and had some sense of the struggle he was engaged in, but it just felt very far away, I mean, Alabama was like another country.  We didn't think of that as connected to our lives in Chicago, particularly.  But, the aspiration and dream, I think, was to sort of become something of a public figure, to become an artist, to entertain, or to be a leader of some kind.  It was just a vague, vague dream, so.
Story_ID: 221950
Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, actually in Chicago [Illinois] we didn't divide the junior high, so from kindergarten to eighth grade, I was at Esmond [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and with eighth grade commencement, then went on to high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And who were your friends?
Speaker 2: There were two best friends, Gregory Dixon and Tony Alexander [ph.], and the three of us were kind of the Three Musketeers, because we were in class together and our mothers, we all lived on the same block back there on Watkins [Avenue] and over time, I guess after high school we sort of drifted a bit, but we were tight during those elementary school years.
Speaker 1: Who was influencing you as a young person?
Speaker 2: My pastor, Bishop Louis Henry Ford, who was pastor of St. Paul Church of God in Christ [Chicago, Illinois], had a significant impact.  I spent a lot of time there at the church.  He was always offering advice and, in some ways, more assertive even than my father [Robert Franklin, Sr.] in terms of offering tips about how to make it in the world.  I mean, he was a very worldly sort of figure who was one of the black power brokers in Chicago, vis-a-vis city hall, and so he knew Mayor Richard [J.] Daley, and Mayor Daley was a frequent visitor at our church.  Bishop Ford, together with leaders like Reverend Joseph H. Jackson of the historic Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago, were among the cadre of black community leaders that delivered votes and, in exchange, received patronage jobs and access to city hall.  So, Bishop Ford kind of opened doors in Chicago for me for my cohort, so my earliest official jobs in the City were negotiated and provided by Bishop Ford.  My first jobs were, you know, with the Chicago Park District, just as a recreational counselor, and then years after a few summers of that, that graduated to working downtown in Cook County Department of Building and Zoning and so, you know, you're kind of learning something about city government and how power operated in a place like Chicago and the strategies of kind of intergroup cooperation and negotiation in seeking to share limited urban living space and, somehow, that worked pretty well despite the ethnic and racial tension that was always underneath the surface.  At least, on the surface people in Chicago were busy at work and kind of negotiated things in a fairly peaceful functional way to make Chicago, guys, it was a city that was just revved up and working, and it was often referred to as the "city that works."  If there was a pothole--you know, in Chicago potholes got fixed--if there were high crime areas, the police were there.  I was struck as I lived in other cities around the country, Chicago's level of municipal and civic efficiency, the bureaucracy there; it was really pretty remarkable in contrast to other places that I have lived and I now see in retrospect, I was sort of part of that bureaucracy through Bishop Ford's agency.
Story_ID: 221951
Speaker 1: The other thing he [Reverend Louis Henry Ford] did was he was a--he played golf, and I later learned he was really quite an exceptional golfer, and this brought him into some unusual circles, because he would spend the month of February in Florida, where he met celebrities and people, as Miami Beach [Florida] was just really growing and taking off as a hot spot for celebrities.  He was kind of in that mix, so we were always surprised Bishop Ford would show up when he returned from Miami [Florida] and would announce that our guest at the big program in April at our church [St. Paul Church of God in Christ, Chicago, Illinois] in Chicago [Illinois] would be Lena Horne; Joe Louis, the prizefighter.  People like that were kinda coming through our church, which was unusual because our church was a church of God in Christ.  It was a black Holiness, Pentecostal church, which generally frowned upon these sort of secular celebrities and that whole way of life, and yet here was one of its most dynamic up-and-coming pastors, who was really almost flaunting his affiliation with these celebrities.  He later brokered that public profile into a job in the official denomination as the director of public relations for the entire denomination, so the folks he was bringing in to Chicago, to our church were now appearing at our national convention or convocation in Memphis [Tennessee], and so there was Bishop Ford, that delivered President [William Jefferson] "Bill" Clinton years later when Clinton was elected and Hillary [Rodham Clinton]; in fact, they, while they were still running for the White House [Washington, D.C.], came to our Memphis meeting.  It's where Clinton later made a speech on the anniversary of the death of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], that came to be a widely publicized speech in Memphis to the black clergy, as he talked about how Dr. King's dream has been, how Dr. King would be disappointed.  So, Bishop Ford had a significant influence at that time.  I had role models that were distant who I didn't know early on.  I guess, you know, I fancied myself as a musician.  I was playing the guitar and the drums and so I went through my Jimi Hendrix phase and through my Motown, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and The Temptations, so we would sing, you know, and spend late hours at the church while we were waiting to go home singing those tunes from Motown.  Ironically, one of our little classmates who was singing later became a lead singer for The Temptations in a later iteration of The Temptations, Louis Price, who lives in Los Angeles [California] now, so we, you know, we of course all went out to see Louis when The Temptations came to Chicago and kind of reminisced, "Oh, we remember this guy.  I sang bass with him before Melvin Franklin did."  You know, Robert Franklin was the bass singer, so we had fun with that and it just kind of reminds me of the importance of the arts for young people, to have something that they can channel that creative energy, joie de vivre, just that love of living, and life and growth.  That later evolved into more serious role models and pursuits and, among them, were people like [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond and Huey [P.] Newton, and just sort of tracking their careers, reading what they were writing, having later a chance to meet them and, in Mr. Bond's case, to work with him when I came here to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia]; so, that was exciting to see that you could have a kind of role model and then later actually meet this person and get to know them better, or work with them.
Story_ID: 221952
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: High school in 1967 to 1971 was Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois]; again, on Chicago's [Illinois] South Side on Vincennes [Avenue].  Morgan Park, like Esmond Elementary [School, Chicago, Illinois], was on what might have been characterized as the border line given Chicago's hyper-segregation between, kind of, black and white communities and although both schools were predominantly white, they were rapidly changing during that period.  Of course, we see the acceleration and the tip occurring after Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination; the urban riots that followed, the polarization in the city and throughout urban America.  But prior to '68 [1968], we essentially walked a mile, mile and a half to get to school in a kind of strange turf.  It was other people's neighborhoods we were entering to be educated, and that was the case with Morgan Park as well.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like?
Speaker 2: On the whole, uneventful.  Again, I think, you know, Chicago was a place that people weren't actively attempting to disturb you unless you made a problem for them, and so, you know, we'd walk to school and generally no trouble.  We, but if we walked beyond the high school, you know, deeper into other neighborhoods which some people did, then that could arouse trouble and there are street gangs from the white community that would intimidate and attack black kids, so I had friends who were beaten up and we had stories about that, and we just kinda knew, all right, that's not a place we go.  Morgan Park had a racially mixed faculty and administration and so they were quite self-conscious about trying to model, how racial ethnic groups could cooperate, could get along in this period without court-ordered desegregation or anything else, and so in retrospect, I see how hard they were working, and in fact, that's when I recall my father [Robert Franklin, Sr.] sort of stepping up as a community leader, because he began to organize, along with other parents, a community basketball league and there is a local white Unitarian church in a section of Chicago known as Beverly Hills [Beverly, Chicago, Illinois], in the Longwood [ph.] area, and we knew that church opened its doors for us to play basketball and brought together young white teams, so that was our first encounter in a kind of competitive, athletic venue, where we had banquets and, you know, sat together at the banquets and met the parents of our counterparts.  So you just had a sense that these are volunteers.  It was not the government.  It was not businesses or the marketplace facilitating this cooperation, but it was voluntarism, trying to sort of build a peaceful civic order, which, on the whole, worked pretty well.
Story_ID: 221953
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in [Morgan Park] High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I, for the first couple of years, finding my way, not very serious as a student, still coasting as I had, I think in [Esmond] Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], starting to discover girls.  I was in the marching band.  I enjoyed playing music.  I was, at that time, a very bad trumpet player and then I was invited, perhaps I should say ordered by the band leader, to learn tuba.  So, here I was, then, a little skinny guy carrying this huge tuba, but I was diligent in learning the tuba and so later it was drums and then guitar.  In any case, that kept me busy after school, again the first couple of years.  By the third year, things had begun to change rather dramatically, and that was following the murder of Fred Hampton, a Black Panther leader on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].  Students had begun to organize peaceful protests, walkouts, and student protests of various kinds, and I sort of got drawn into that and it was a rather rapid, sort of political coming of age for me.  This would have been, I guess, in the, you know, '66 [1966] or '67 [1967].  Only then, did I really begin to pay attention to Malcolm X.  He is, of course, dead by 1965, although my father [Robert Franklin, Sr.] had taken us to a couple of the Saviours' Day meetings that Elijah Muhammad convened each year in February in Chicago, so we kind of recall vaguely being in those large audiences, and how intimidating it was for a younger person, but it was kind of impressive too.  I mean, it was thousands and thousands of people listening to these, so I probably saw Malcolm X as a younger kid but don't really remember.  I remember Elijah Muhammad though, and the people would always buy a bean pie on the way out and the newspapers and so on.  But, it was a strange mix.  My life was on the border between this interest in music, which I did some of in the after-school hours, the avoiding the street gang culture that was quite vibrant by then and growing, and in the high school zone was, they were actively drafting young men into the gangs by then, and then this growing political awareness and so the presence of the Panthers in Chicago.  All of that was a part of the kind of social background or matrix where I was coming of age.  My best, one of my best friends in high school was, I didn't grow up dreaming of becoming an astronaut but my good friends did, and they went on to become astronauts and, in fact, the first black female astronaut, Mae Jemison, was a schoolmate and we spent a lot of time together.  She, even then, was talking about going to medical school, to earn a medicine degree and an engineering degree, and to engage in biomedical engineering, to design artificial limbs.  I mean, this is a high school kid.  She was extraordinary.  So, she kind of inspired me and helped get me excited about intellectual pursuits.  I would go over to her house after school sometimes because she lived around the corner from Morgan Park, and her mother [Dorothy Green Jemison], who really reminded me of [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, was always working on a novel and writing, and she would, the mother would engage me in these conversations and challenge me, "What are you gonna do next?"  "Where are you going to college?"  And really pushing me, and so that was whetting my appetite for intellectual journeying beyond high school.  My parents were doing that and, in some ways, a more low key way they weren't as directive about it.  They just knew, you know, I needed to work on my grades if I was gonna go to college.
Story_ID: 221954
Speaker 1: Who were your teachers then [at Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: There were, I guess I have the most vivid memory of counselors at the school who really took responsibility for ensuring that we were exposed to experiences that would prepare us for college more effectively.  And there's one in particular, Mrs. Carmichael [ph.], who, I kind of felt like, was the counselor/teacher to every student who was kind of college bound.  She was this wonderful, sort of California-style almost quasi-hippie kind of mother Earth sort of person who would take us all in and push us, and if we tell her, "Well, we're thinking about this school" she'd say, "no, no, no, that school's not good enough for you.  Set your sights higher."  And so, she would push us and we kinda, it took us aback.  We thought, well people oughta be happy that we're just considering any college or community college.  She said "No, you set your sights higher, and have you thought about--."  And she was ironically one of the people who would talk about historically black colleges [and universities, HBCUs] for those of us who knew very little at that time about that whole set of institutions.  So, she was a wonderful personality in that community.  I think my English teacher is probably the figure of that four-year period who stands out as one who, after I read, I think it was Richard Wright's 'Native Son' and had to write an essay, she really marked it up thoroughly, but was the first teacher who said, "This has real promise.  You have promise as a writer.  I want you to rewrite this and consider organizing it this way," and for some reason that really hooked me and, again, I got excited about African American literature, about the power of writing, and thereafter I actually wrote a couple of articles that were published in the school paper.
Story_ID: 221955
Speaker 1: In what other ways were you spending your time when you were in high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Again, church [St. Paul Church of Christ in God, Chicago, Illinois] continued to be important but more on kind of weekends and occasional evenings and so on Sundays I was in church in a Sunday school class, but now being singled out to offer little speeches or read scriptures or things during the service, and playing more of a public role.  This pastor [Reverend Louis Henry Ford] had an extraordinary vision that he called the breakfast club, and all the young people in the church would gather for breakfast and orange juice and milk prior to Sunday school, and it was there that we engaged in contests, memorizing and reciting scripture.  We'd be given, you know, little tests on black history and would have to respond and so church became, after the emergence of the breakfast club, a kind of character shaping intellectually challenging space for us.  It was a lot of fun.  There were awards, and I really, you know, for some reason that hooked me.  I did well and saw that with a little effort and a little infusion of my creativity and personality, which was generally being channeled off into my very poor music career, or my budding interest in politics and protest.  At church, if I just made a little effort it went a long way in terms of connecting with people in the church.  They would really affirm and you know the black church style of call/response and people would tell me yes, that's good, and keep it up.  So that was very affirming.
Story_ID: 221956
Speaker 1: In my own study time, I began to read more and I was really being intellectually stimulated by, I recall, I mean this is Chicago [Illinois] in the late '60s [1960s] now, and so there is the [1968] Democratic [National] Convention in '68 [1968] and Sly and the Family Stone concert downtown.  I begged my parents [Lee McCann Franklin and Robert Franklin, Sr.], can I go down?  No, no you can't go, given the chaos that was likely to ensue, which, and some did.  But Chicago was an exciting place to be at that time, and so at home watching this on television, getting as close to it as we could, but to see Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver, Huey [P.] Newton, all these people on the scene, the leaders of SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], and others, and then, of course, with Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death in April of that year, '68 [1968] and Bobby Kennedy [Senator Robert F. Kennedy] in June.  It was, that was a turning point year for me, more young men went to Vietnam [Vietnam War] in that year, or more died in 1968, than any other year of our fifteen, eighteen year engagement in Southeast Asia, and beginning to sort of see the remnants of young men that I knew who were returning from Vietnam, including a couple of cousins, my uncle, my father's youngest brother who also used to make those journeys from Mississippi to Detroit [Michigan] to visit his mother, would stop in Chicago to see my dad and a few brothers and sisters that were in Chicago, and he was killed in Vietnam, and this was the youngest brother so, in some sense, he was closest in age to me as I'm emerging in high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And that had a real impact on war and the meaning of war and the finality of war and death and, this young guy, fun-loving, handsome young brother, who wasn't bothering anybody.  He got on a plane one day and was taken to Asia and never came home.  There was a whole painful mystery around, even, his remains because we had a funeral in which there was a closed coffin and we weren't sure it was him.  In fact, half of the family insisted that it was not when they did insist that the remains be displayed to the family.  So, it was kind of traumatizing never to have real closure on young Willie Franklin [ph.].  So, that was a part of my growing awareness that behind this little world I inhabited, Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], South Side of Chicago, these great leaders like King and Kennedy and Fred Hampton, and others, were being murdered, that the police no longer seemed to be just this efficient bureaucratic Chicago operation, but seemed to be, themselves, a kind of criminal class and the more ominous period in my own coming of age and the reading of literature and James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man,' and findings language to name that sense of alienation and despair and anger.  And then, I guess the other part of this was the college decision because I wouldn't graduate until 1971, but I recall watching the death and the funeral of Dr. King, and much of that memorial service occurred on the Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus, watching that procession of leaders march on to the campus, watching [Dr.] Benjamin Mays.  My father, it was the first time he sort of basically said, "Sit down, I want you to watch this."  And afterward, he said, "I think you oughta consider Morehouse College," so, that was his first time being kind of directive in terms of saying this institution is one you ought to think about.  Of course, I went back to school, you know, I began to ask around and ask Mrs. Carmichael [ph.], I wanted to learn more about Morehouse, and she provided some materials, and began to focus on people like [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond and [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, who were in Ebony magazine, and others who had attended HBCUs.  And I thought, yeah, that's for me.
Story_ID: 221957
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you wanted to be in these high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] years?  Where were you thinking you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, after viewing the memorial service for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I really riveted my focus on Morehouse College and, you know, I knew nothing about Atlanta [Georgia] or Georgia, or very much about Morehouse, for that matter, but more and more, I recall articles in Ebony magazine that featured pieces on Dr. King, Dr. [Benjamin] Mays.  After [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was nominated as vice president at the [1968] Democratic [National] Convention [Chicago, Illinois] in '68 [1968], there was this big spread on him and they mentioned Morehouse, and he talked about both his time at Morehouse, but also his career in politics as a Georgia state representative, and that just kind of riveted for me as, I think, a junior in high school at that point that this is something that could be interesting.  That's, you know, something I could do, I think.  I was starting to read some of the classics in political philosophy and getting turned on by Plato's 'Republic' and things like that, and again, these teachers, my English teacher who was really encouraging and pushing my reading broadly and writing my thoughts.  I began to write articles on possibilities for both human peace and cooperation among communities that can find common ground before I had read much about that, and so this idea that politics was about the art of consensus building and compromise and cooperation was quite attractive to me.  So, I began to attend high school fairs on colleges, looked at a lot of schools, my father [Robert Franklin, Sr.] would take me to these fairs and, I don't know, none of the schools I was learning about had quite the impact that did Morehouse, and so I was soon discovered by the Chicago [Illinois] area Morehouse College Alumni Club [sic. Morehouse College Alumni Association], who had a representative at one of these big high school fairs, and he sort of got his claws into me and said, "Look.  Yes, you ought to go to Morehouse, and I will get you materials and we want you to see the school," and on and on, so he kind of helped provide, paved the way.  I thought that politics was going to be the direction and so naturally declared a major early on in political science.  I was excited to enroll in all those courses.  Meanwhile, some of these young, dynamic charismatic figures like Eldridge Cleaver and Huey [P.] Newton are quoting, you know, [Karl] Marx, Mao [Tse-tung], other revolutionary leaders and, I thought, yeah and all this stuff, that fits with this politics and the nature of a just society and the good person, so that was really my intellectual field of interest; at the same time, a declining interest in becoming a musician or artist or all that.  I began to see that as more, kind of, my childhood fancy, but now as I'm coming of age, realizing, you know, here at the age of, what, sixteen, I needed to begin to get serious about what was to follow.
Story_ID: 221958
Speaker 1: I actually had an interesting crisis moment in my high school time [at Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], as a high school junior.  It was in the spring of the semester, it was following a protest of some sort in the City [of Chicago, Illinois], and it was announced by a couple of my friends who were explicitly affiliated with the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  I was never really affiliated.  I would show up at meetings where the younger wannabes would get together and talk about how we needed to pay attention to what the police were doing on our campus, and in the community, and mistreatment of people.  And, so these two friends of mine indicated that the next day they were going to pull the fire alarm at Morgan Park High School, get everyone outside the building and while people were out, before they were ushered back in, to declare a walkout in protest of, I can't recall if it was the lack of any African American speakers for our big assemblies, something like that.  Well, these guys weren't real close friends.  I think we just sort of hung out because we were in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  That was the other interesting, ironic, in some ways contradictory affiliation, but I think I enrolled in ROTC because I didn't want to have to deal with the gym and the physical education, kind of the regimen of that track.  If you went in ROTC, you could wear a uniform, you could drill and you could learn about firearms and learn about the [U.S.] military.  I thought that would be interesting stuff to learn; maybe at some level, just thinking about the Vietnam [War] background and so, in any case, I chose that, and did well there as a young cadet and leader in the ROTC on campus.  But all of that by way of pointing to this growing interest in politics, and so these two guys who, one of whom was also in the ROTC, the next day sure enough pulled the fire alarm and everybody was out and everybody was told to go back in the school and there they were, demanding, don't go back in, protests, we're gonna walk out.  I was seen with these two guys, they were brothers, and the next day was asked to appear in the principal's office, and the vice principal was there with a police officer, and asked the police officer, says, what did you--you know, the way this happened was during this lunch period the following day this police officer, this huge guy, he had to be 6'5", and a big, you know, he looked like he could play linebacker or tackle for the Chicago Bears.  He walks up.  He was on campus, stationed on campus, walked up and said, "You, follow me."  So, he marches me around to the vice principal's office.  It was an African American gentleman, Mr. [Mitchell] O'Bannon, and I go and sit in the office and O'Bannon asks me, "What--I understand that you along with a couple of your friends pulled the fire alarm yesterday."  And I said, "No, I didn't pull the alarm."  He said, "Well, Officer so-and-so, what do you know?"  He says, "I have good sources that tell me you did, and I saw you with these two, and they apparently readily admitted that they had."  So, I was expelled from school and told not to come back.  Well, this created a crisis in my household because my father [Robert Franklin, Sr.], this hardworking guy who was working at the Campbell Soup Company [Downers Grove, Illinois] at that time, largely working through the night, and so he tried to rest during the day.  Here, he had to be disturbed to come to the school to speak to this vice principal who essentially said, you know, "Your son is affiliating with the rabble-rousers.  Their grades are terrible and we can expel them or send them away, but your son's grades are not so bad, and we'd like to work with him, but I can't afford to have troublemakers at my school.  So, we're going to transfer him to another school."
Story_ID: 221959
Speaker 1: So I recall on that occasion, my mother [Lee McCann Franklin], the next day now, takes me to this other school, [Christian] Fenger [Academy] High School [Chicago, Illinois], closer to our house, and when I got there they indicated they didn't want Morgan Park's [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] troublemakers in their student body either, so I would actually not be welcome, so they were gonna block this transfer.  So we're jumping through these hoops.  We go back to Morgan Park and my mother makes this real plea and, let's see, when we go back, I guess maybe that was the following day that was went back with my mother and father [Robert Franklin, Sr.], my mother sat there and essentially begged this guy to let me back in school and I recall she cried, "We work hard.  We don't want him to get with the wrong crowd.  He knows better.  He goes to church," and so on.  I just recall feeling very angry that she, the humiliation of seeing my mother cry in his presence and making this case for me.  And then, when the guy, when the vice principal [Mitchell O'Bannon] asked me if I was sorry for what I did, or if I had it to do over, would I, what would I do?  Would I affiliate with these folk?  Lead the march, walk out?  And I recall saying, "I'd do the same thing," and my father asked him if he would leave so we could speak (laughter) and he really confronted me for the first time in that way and said, "look, we're trying to get you back into the school and we're not gonna have you saying these foolish things," and so on.  He may have shaken me up a little there, and I recall feeling the beginnings of some reform; in any case, when the guy came back, the vice principal, I was repentant enough to say I do apologize and I would like another chance and you'll have no more trouble.  So, I recall him, he lays out all these stipulations:  you will sit alone in the lunch room, you will check in with this police officer so he kinda knows where you are during the off, you know, during your free time and study period and the lunch period.  At the end of the school day, you will leave campus.  You cannot linger unless you have an approved school activity; so, all this stuff, yes, yes, yes, I'll do it.  So here, again, spring, junior year, and you know people--
Speaker 2: Quickly--you mentioned that you didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, who cared about due process in that time of this approach to street justice.  They essentially tried and convicted me on the testimony of this hearsay from the police officer, and whatever these two guys, I mean, I later talked to them, I think, by phone and you know, I wasn't that close to them, and who knows, they may have tried to do a plea bargain or something (laughter) but the fact is I hadn't, literally, you know I hadn't pulled the alarm.  I was cooperating with the process, though.
Speaker 2: Why do you think when confronted by the principal and the administrators, police office, et cetera--why do you think you were saying, you know, that I'd do it again?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Well, the part of it was a kind of defiance, a sense of reaction to the injustice of the situation; I mean, suddenly I felt, okay, this is just a little bit of what the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] were feeling when they'd get called in and roughed up and interrogated in unjust ways and I was trying to articulate some of that, that this was not fair, that I was innocent and so I know that it was defiance and a sense of injustice, but that moment with my mother and my father, seeing both of their behavior, both his very aggressive confrontation of me and her crying.  That was that moment for me of realizing, okay, I'm causing some chaos in our household because of my politics and my behavior and conscience.  I need to figure out a better way to do this that is less disruptive to them.
Story_ID: 221960
Speaker 1: So I determined if they gave me the second chance, I would go back and really do the right thing and try to become a star student [at Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], and so I did complete that junior year, those remaining probably a couple months, it may have been April, May, June; but, it was funny because I became a sort of local campus celebrity because I actually did have to eat lunch alone and I had--wherever I sat, had to be, you know, the people had to move or they had a table for me, so in this entire crowded lunchroom, people coming over--"There's [HistoryMaker] Robert Franklin in his fatigues and his black beret and he goes, and he's reading Plato while he eats lunch," and so that just fueled my sense of okay, I'm gonna show them.  I'm gonna show him and I'm gonna show my parents [Lee McCann Franklin and Robert Franklin, Sr.], so I had a lot to prove, I felt.  And, it is interesting, part of the discipline of that life during those weeks, those months that I was kind of on spot and carefully monitored.  I recall, I mean, thinking about some of the Panthers [Black Panther Party] who were in prison, and at Malcolm [X], rereading Malcolm's autobiography ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Alex Haley and Malcolm X]; in fact, people would come by, walk by the table and just put a cassette tape on the table.  I was listening to some of Malcolm's speeches, some of the older guys were doing this for me, so this sense of how to use your time, you know, in the whole as it were, and to use it in ways that the oppressor didn't expect.  He's trying to punish you, break your spirit, produce conformity and instead I would say, okay, I'm gonna learn how to sharpen my intellectual sword and be able to use it to press for justice, so, within that brief period, I began to, my writing and classroom participation, everything kind of just sort of got notched up, ratcheted up, and the crowning moment was this English teacher, I've forgotten her name, who recommended that I be placed in honors English when I returned for my senior year, and I recall there was actually like a conference.  I later learned from Ms. Carmichael [ph.], the counselor, who sort of had her ear to the ground and heard, she pulled me aside one day.  She said, "Robert, you realize the teachers are debating whether or not you should be placed in a couple of honors classes because some of your previous teachers said you weren't ready, and you're not a serious enough student," but your English teacher, your history, these other folks are saying, "no, this guy is really revved up.  He is reading everything."  One of my goals was to read every book in the library of our school, so I got through hundreds of books, I know, and I actually, some of the books I needed to read and wanted to read were in the reference section, so part of my boyhood defiance was I ripped off a copy of the 'Robert's Rules of Order' [Henry Martyn Robert], stuff like that.  I wanted to kind of read carefully, so, (laughter) so I had to take them out and I later returned them to the vice principal [Mitchell O'Bannon].  He thought this was an act of some religious reform, that he said, "Oh, people, they never turn books back in!  You brought these back."  So, again, it was my way of, see, yeah, I'm not who you thought you were, was the agenda.
Story_ID: 221961
Speaker 1: So, you were matriculating into your senior year [at Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Senior year, 1970, you know, '71 [1971].  I guess seventeen, I turned eighteen in February of '71 [1971], and really taking my school seriously and on fire intellectually, reading, writing, involved in campus activities.  I later learned that [Mitchell] O'Bannon, this vice principal, took an interest in me at that time.  He would invite me and we would talk, so people seemed to be, you know, happier with me.  I did have a job after school, part time thing at a local food store.  That was a piece I failed to mention earlier, that made my day of reckoning when I was kicked out of school even more traumatic.  Before I, once I announced that I was kicked out that day, before going home I had to go to my job, so I went and worked my hours.  I thought it would be a good idea for me to bring a peace offering home to my parents [Lee McCann Franklin and Robert Franklin, Sr.].  So, foolish teenager that I was, I worked in the produce section and employees were permitted to purchase things and pay for them and then put them aside with their name on the back, and then we would clean up the store and afterwards leave with our bags.  Well, I put a large fruit basket, essentially, put it together, put it in a bag, paid some markdown price that I discounted for myself, had a friend discount and pay for that and put it aside, so, anyway I got caught and leaving the store, my boss opened the bag and said, "Come aside."  And he said, and he opened the bag and said, "What is this?"  I said, "Well, it's food I paid for and I have a receipt."  He said, "This doesn't cost this amount."  So, he said, "I'm gonna have to let you go."  So, in one and the same day, I (laughter) was kicked out of school and fired from my job.
Speaker 1: And did you get to keep the fruit basket (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Uh, I think some of it.  He removed some (laughter) and I would call this, talk about the dark night of the soul.  Walking home, thinking okay, what in the world has just happened to me today?  So, going home and talking that through with my mother, and you know, her response was, okay, this is just a wakeup call and you're gonna have to make some changes and you'll be okay, and you can do this.  So, she was really wonderful in that moment when I was just completely broken and worried about how my father would respond, and so she ran a lot of interference on that.
Story_ID: 221962
Speaker 1: My senior year [at Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] proved to be really a remarkable year, star student, I even was voted, received the citizenship award from the school at their senior ceremonies because I was now trying to actively work with the administration and trying to promote better relations in the school between various groups.  And, so that was the senior year, and I was accepted at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], so I was thrilled that I knew where I was headed and that was published in our little senior book that was distributed.  I discovered one other student from Morgan Park was headed to Morehouse, so I didn't know this guy, Howard Menco [ph.], so I later met Howard and it turns out when we got to Morehouse, we became roommates, given our Chicago [Illinois] Morgan Park connections.
Speaker 2: Did you and your father [Robert Franklin, Sr.], anywhere between this junior and the senior year, ever further discuss activism or, you know, things that were happening politically, the stance that you've taken, or otherwise?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.  I actually wrote about this little, this little vignette.  It was a prologue to my first book, 'Liberating Visions[: Human Fulfillment and Social Justice in African American Thought,' Robert Michael Franklin] because I began to play the records, the speeches, of Eldridge Cleaver, in particular, 'cause Eldridge was so interesting, fascinating to listen to, and I read his book, 'Soul on Ice,' [Eldridge Cleaver] and he was just very clever, creative, kind of wild and zany guy, and so, of course, [President Richard Milhous] Nixon was in the White House [Washington, D.C.], and listening to Cleaver talk about Nixon and the injustice of the Vietnam War, the need for the people to rise up, the power of the people, look at what the people did in China and Russia [sic. Soviet Union] and so, it was that kind of, those heady times.  I'd ask my father, come and listen to this.  Well, my father never quite got beyond the voluminous use of profanity and expletives in Cleaver's speeches.  He pointed out, he challenged me, he said "Now, you know, I hear the substance of his position, but he's not gonna get a serious listening unless he learns how to use language in a more disciplined way," and that kind of registered with me, although immediately I just wrote it off, you know, dad's just old school, old generation, but I came to appreciate the larger point being made about the art of communication and rhetoric and how you persuade people, how you articulate a point for a diverse audience, and so, at any case, we would debate the merits of what the Panthers [Black Panther Party], the Nation of Islam, other groups that were quite vibrant and active there in Chicago.  So they local enough that we could actually go see or knew some of these people.  In our drives into church, we'd pass by offices of various organizations including Operation Breadbasket [Rainbow PUSH Coalition], so young [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson was there on Halsted Street, in an old movie theater [Capitol Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], and so all these folks, all these role models, were right there and, you know, it was an exciting time to be able to kind of pick and choose styles and substantive arguments and approaches and put them together for myself.
Story_ID: 221963
Speaker 1: What level of education did your father [Robert Franklin, Sr.] have and how did that inform how he mentored to you, how he parented you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father completed high school and had some college.  He never completed college.  In fact, he took business courses at, I think they were held at the Wendell Phillips School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], evening night school, kind of college level business management, 'cause I recall seeing his books and looking at his books, texts for class.  He was attempting to move up the corporate ladder at the Campbell Soup Company [Downers Grove, Illinois], where he had, at that time, was essentially the manager of a warehouse where the produce, or finished products were kept and then shipped out.  He then moved.  He took classes.  I recall him talking about chemistry classes he had to take because he was now moving into an area of food sampling and tasting and, you know, wearing a white jacket.  It was a big deal, because he always kept a shirt and tie on and needed to, you know, keep the white jackets clean and my mother [Lee McCann Franklin] was working on that, so we always had a ready supply of new Campbell Soup/Pepperidge Farm/Swanson TV Dinners at our house.  I was reared on that stuff, because they were always testing new products and employees got this stuff.  In any case, back to your question, he, I think didn't know much about the world of the historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs].  He had talked about Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as a place he had wanted to attend and was never able, so there also emerged that part of me that wanted to sort of fulfill his dream and do what he wasn't able to do and to do well at Morehouse so he'd be proud of me, and you know, I'm happy to say I think I fulfilled that dream for him and he was able to participate, you know, vicariously in my journey through college there.  Similarly with my mother, high school and some college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and again, kind of, sort of energies and life siphoned off into the business world as she worked at an insurance company and learned finance and accounting, which she then used at the church, because she was sort of hired by the church as a financial secretary/accountant, and took courses and clearly valued higher education and learning, but it wasn't a part of the household talk and culture, even in my extended family in the way that having a good job was.  And that's why the affiliation with Bishop [Louis Henry] Ford.  Bishop Ford's affiliation with Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, my extended family's presence and the political bureaucratic infrastructure of Chicago [Illinois] politics was essentially our life and everyone had, you know, well-paying jobs, kind of, police, firemen, teachers kinds of enterprises.
Story_ID: 221964
Speaker 1: So, what was your first day like at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to begin with the journey to Morehouse from Chicago [Illinois].  My father [Robert Franklin, Sr.], working hard, was not able to depart, to travel with us, so he said goodbye there, but we--my mother's [Lee McCann Franklin] brothers, my uncles always seemed to sort of shadow her and be present in our household, so one of them took us to the Greyhound bus station, and we traveled from Chicago to Atlanta [Georgia] by bus, and it was, as I recall, a nineteen-hour journey through these small towns and winding roads and, you know, trying to read and sleep and deal with just a monotony of these roads.  I recall listening, or sitting at one point next to a woman who was, must have gotten somewhere in Kentucky, I think, and began talking about the fact I was going to college and how she knew, she was sort of an elderly white woman, talking about knowing a young, colored girl in her neighborhood, who had gone to college and how proud they were of her, and so it was just kind of a way of talking about race that I hadn't experienced before, and, again, I had a little anxiety about well, gee whiz, what was the South, was it going to be like, and Chicago is a different way of doing things.  And in any case, so I arrived, and we arrived at the Paschal's Motor Hotel [and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia], where my mother stayed (laughter).  We were met at the Greyhound bus station by a pastor here in Atlanta, who was Bishop [Louis Henry] Ford's counterpart in Atlanta, so he was a very active member of the city and the civic community here, Bishop John Husband, John D. Husband, and Bishop Husband met us and he had known my mother from seeing her at the national meetings in Memphis [Tennessee] and was quite pleased to be of assistance to Bishop Ford, to welcome us to Atlanta, and so he gathered us up and took us over to Paschal's and we checked in.  It was kind of exciting being in a hotel in Atlanta and not far from the college, so our first time, you know, I had to appear at the college for orientation the next day, and we took a taxi and then realized how close it was and said, oh, we can walk in the future; so, we walked and going back and forth each day.  I guess she was there maybe two days, on the third day I recall when we did take a taxi because it was going to take her on to the bus station back, and when we approached the college in the taxi, I saw this line, long line of young freshmen men lined up, and I was going to join that line.  I thought, well I don't want them to see me getting out of a car with my mother bringing me to Morehouse College (laughter) so I said, would you mind if the taxi takes us on past the school and I'll get out and I'll walk back, and she was okay with that.  I later learned she, when she went home, she called one of her cousins and said, "I just left my son at Morehouse and I cried all the way back to Chicago," and he recalls telling her, "well, you know a lot of mothers left their sons in prison today, and a lot of mothers said goodbye to their sons in the cemetery, and you should be proud.  You hear what you're saying?  You left your son at Morehouse College."  So, it apparently transformed her attitude and outlook.  And, I recall standing in that line with my shirt and tie on, and my brand new briefcase and I was just excited about Morehouse and undergoing the rigors of getting registered in the old school, pre-computer era where everything is done by hand and very slowly and meticulously and, you know, the excitement of being with these guys and meeting guys from around the county, literally.  I mean, I'd never met young men from Bainbridge, Georgia to Los Angeles, California, and trading stories and getting housing assignments.
Story_ID: 221965
Speaker 1: They had admitted a very large class [to Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and so all of us were not able to reside in the two dorms, I think, set aside for freshmen men.  So, I ended up in the fraternity house for a temporary assignment, which was not a good place to put a freshman (laughter).
Speaker 2: Which fraternity house were you in?
Speaker 1: The Omega [Psi Phi Fraternity] house.  These guys, really, took great pride in their party exploits and reputation, something right out of 'Animal House,' the old movie where, you know, they began the school year with vigorous partying and music all night and everybody cranking up the stereos, so I was a little annoyed and a little excited and realized, okay, you know, I know about focusing and thinking back to my little time in the hole, as it were, back at Morgan Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I said, "You block out the world.  It's you and this text.  It's you and your ideas and the paper you have to write."  So, I did that.  I was later transferred to a proper dorm for freshman.  Had a good first few weeks there attending class, and amazed by the freedom of college.  You can go or not go, show up or not show up.  You know, you pay the consequences or not, but I had a great, great first year.
Speaker 2: What are some of the highlights of your experience at Morehouse College?
Speaker 1: I, soon after getting oriented and getting into my classes, the extracurricular life of campus was, allowed a few opportunities to run for elective office, which I did.  And, I think I was elected a freshman, to the freshmen council or something like that, and began to make a reputation for myself.  I early on developed a reputation, the nickname, the Senator.  They called me the Senator, and it was kind of fun because there were a large number of guys from Chicago [Illinois] at Morehouse, and, unfortunately, didn't have a very good reputation with the faculty at Morehouse.  They tended to think of these guys, you know, these are the hoodlums from Chicago who, somehow, found their way to Morehouse and I recall my French teacher, a very distinguished gentleman named Edward [Allen] Jones, E. A. Jones, who, three-piece suit and the pipe, and he taught us how to tie a bow tie after class if we were interested.  He once pulled me aside and said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Robert] Franklin, you're not like most of the young men that I've taught from Chicago," (laughter) so, he said, "I'm very pleased you're quite serious about your studies, and please continue and take another year of French."
Story_ID: 221966
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you a member of any organizations [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Did you ever join a fraternity, or sports?
Speaker 2: I did not join a fraternity.  I had a budding interest in fraternity; in fact, temporarily, my roommate, an older junior student, when I moved out of the [Omega Psi Phi] Fraternity house, he was a member of the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, and so he was extolling the virtues of the Sigmas and trying to urge me to think about that.  And then, I was, you know, the Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] presence was strong at Morehouse, so I was thinking about that fraternity and, so, but, you know, got through the first year.  The second year, ran for office and was elected student representative, one of two student representatives, to the board of trustees, and that was kind of a big deal because you got to attend the board of trustee meetings and one of the meetings was in New York [New York], because at the time, I think Charles [E.] Merrill [Jr.] of Merrill Lynch [and Company, Inc.] fame, was the chair of the board, and we met at the Merrill Lynch offices in New York City, so I recall, you know, the plane ride up and the excitement of attending the meeting and have that moment in the meeting when they'd ask and what do the students think, and what's going on with the students and we'd lay out our concerns about the quality of services on campus and our desire that the school would take a stronger stance against apartheid or whatever it might be that particular year, so I had a good time in that role and thought, okay, this political science trajectory and pre-law was coming into focus and thought that I would do that.  I attended a nearby church but was not terribly active in church at that point.
Story_ID: 221967
Speaker 1: I grew restless at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], however, toward the first--the end of the first semester, the Christmas break.  I realized, this is gonna be difficult to do for four years, and part of it I think was feeling I wasn't being challenged enough, that the environment, I don't know, was becoming so familiar and predictable that I could do that, but I needed more, and so I recall beginning to think about international overseas opportunities.  One of my professors, a professor of international studies, was a gentleman from, gosh, I think he may have been from Liberia.  In any case, he began to challenge us to think about study abroad opportunities.  He talked about how important it was for Americans to discover the larger world and, you know, we still had Vietnam [Vietnam War], and some of our students who weren't coming back the following year because they were drafted or student deferment wasn't granted or for whatever reason, they were going, you know, in the [U.S.] military, and so that was still real close to us.  So, I did apply to two different scholarships and received both of them; in fact, one of them entailed yet another trip to New York [New York] as a finalist for The English-Speaking Union [of the United States] scholarship.  I had to meet with this committee and they'd tell it that for the first time in the history of this Luard [Morse] Scholarship, that two students would receive it, and both of us were from Morehouse, so my counterpart, Asa [G.] Yancey, Jr., we were selected to go and I ended up at Durham University [Durham, England] and he went on to Scotland to Edinburgh University [Edinburgh, Scotland].
Speaker 2: And Durham University is in--
Speaker 1: In England, in the northern part of England in Durham County near, just south of Newcastle [upon Tyne, England], not far from the Scottish border, so way up north in England, a small town, the entire county, in fact, had a population of thirty thousand people and so, you know, here I was transplanted from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] to, you know, Atlanta [Georgia] with all of its vibrant black culture in life and Morehouse to Durham, and it was kind of, it was, people use this phrase culture shock.  But every day there was some new discovery, a new sense of wow!  We don't do it that way at home, and learning the history and the contours of English culture, of mining town English culture and the kind of blue collar, this working-class subculture within England.  So, it wasn't all this stuffy Oxbridge stuff.  It was a different kind which had strong parallels for me of Chicago and the kind of ethnic, these hard working European ethnics and black migrants from the South who were just trying to eke out a good living, so I was really kind of fascinated by that, saw again, this common ground I'd been trying to write about as a senior in high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], saw it in a new way as my own kind of unfolding and kind of boundary stretching and bursting was occurring, and developed friends who resided in various parts of the British Isles, as well as international students, students from throughout Africa, Caribbean, and other parts of the world who were students at Durham during that same year.  So, it was an interesting time.  This was 1973 now.  It was the year of the OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] oil embargo, and it was the coldest year.  You know, England, in good times it's cold (laughter) with all the heat working.  This was the year they had to cut back on heat in student dorms, and so we, you know, I wore English sweaters and my leather jacket and things the entire year 'round, and always felt chilled.
Story_ID: 221968
Speaker 1: You know, I arrived in, I guess, September, October, November, we arrived at December, and it was time for that Christmas break and I was anxious to find warm weather, and so took off, found a charter flight from London [England] to Barcelona [Spain], and then three, maybe two or three weeks later, returned from Madrid [Spain] back to London.  So, there were a couple of other students who were on the same charter who I did not know, but they were from Durham [University, Durham, England], other colleges at Durham.  Long and short of it is I made it to Spain and, you know, my agenda is, I need warmer weather, and it would be great to see some more people of color, so there I have southern Spain and then on to Morocco, North Africa.  And that was, you know, really a life changing experience to arrive in Morocco to encounter Islam and a Muslim society close up, peeking into mosques, buying, you know, purchasing the garment, djellaba, and wearing that and often being mistaken for Moroccan and then realizing, oh, I don't speak Arabic.  I know a little French and working my way through things here.  I was with one other guy at that point I had met along the way.  It was always fun to meet people who were fellow, you know, who were travelers 'cause there was a kind of generosity and a kind of shared vulnerability and shared adventure that always, I felt, made for great friendships.  So, I returned to England after that break, got through that year, studying political philosophy, anthropology, and sociology the entire year 'round, which itself was dramatically different from, you know, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], six, seven, eight classes per semester, different classes.  Suddenly in my junior year, three courses all year 'round with a tutor for each course, a meeting and the tutorials on a weekly basis, so it felt like immersion in a kind of master's degree type program and I've really, really enjoyed that a great deal.  The year concluded and I requested an opportunity to, one of the things that the scholarship required is that we spend some time in the households of British families, so the families who were part of The English-Speaking Union [of the United States] network invited us, so I spent a few evenings in Cambridge University [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England], where one family lived, and then up to Scotland, this really remote, gorgeous and haunting part of Scotland, near Inverness, Scotland, where we all felt it was like the edge of the world, and then down to Wales and to London, and ultimately wrapped up that year and requested that the balance of the scholarship money be spent on a tour of the Soviet Union, so I had a chance to go and visit Moscow [Soviet Union; Moscow, Russia], Leningrad [Soviet Union; St. Petersburg, Russia], and a little town on the Black Sea called Sochi [Soviet Union; Sochi, Russia], and there, there was an opportunity to encounter an alternative belief system, here was an atheistic communism organizing the entire society, and leaving the Soviet Union back to England, back to home for the first time, and being away almost a full year as a nineteen-year-old, now, I guess twenty by that point.  With the experience of Morocco, the Soviet Union, still kind of bubbling inside my head, how do I explain these radically different approaches to truth and to the nature of reality and wanting help to kind of explain that and describe that.
Story_ID: 221969
Speaker 1: What was life-changing about your experience in Morocco?
Speaker 2: I think that was the first time I ever experienced the, I'll put it this way, the superficiality of my own Christian identity.  The sense that this was not, I was sort of born into this tradition.  I was socialized.  It was just another part of this familiar component of my cultural identity.  But I didn't ever really have to make any significant choices along the way.  It was just sort of, you know, accept this and be a good person.  But, there, you know, with this radically different system and seeing students and young people and old people who kind of really seemed very devoted and talk about their faith, and what Allah requires, it was just really pretty impressive to me.  So, I was curious both about this alternative belief system, in part thinking a little about Malcolm X's experience too, what he found in this tradition that was life-changing for him.  So, I was intellectually and spiritually curious, and I guess really searching in a more deliberate way at that point, having lived there, been visiting there just long enough to feel that, hmm, I could live in this culture.  I could get into this.  It would require a lot more learning and growth in terms of the language, but that was impressive and it made me reexamine my own, kind of beliefs and identity and future directions.  I don't think I had ever quite done that in that way before.  Political orientation, you know, even as that was evolving, didn't reach as deeply as the kind of theological spiritual stuff.
Story_ID: 221970
Speaker 1: So, what did you do next?  You returned to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Returned to Morehouse, but first back to Chicago [Illinois] for the summer, which was, it was just strange being back in Chicago.  After that year, the Soviet Union still fresh on my mind, when I was in the Soviet Union there in '74 [1974], that summer, [President Richard Milhous] Nixon was on his way to Russia [sic.] and I recall because [Leonid] Brezhnev, the premier of the Soviet Union at the time, they were making preparations for Nixon's arrival as I was leaving, so I recall watching this stuff on TV.  So getting back to America and to Chicago and watching television, watching them report the Nixon trip to Soviet--it just, I don't know, it was very, I had a sense of no, there's a larger reality here that is not being reported.  I talked to those students and I know they're being told to hold these American flags and they're being ordered to show hospitality, but it ain't necessarily so, and, just a different more cynical, critical theology.  We talk about it as a hermeneutic of suspicion.  It brought a kind of suspicious perspective to news and media, comments by government officials, et cetera.  And so began to probe beneath the surface of what was reported.  So, it was an interesting--I had a lot of arguments with my family and with people that summer back in Chicago, as I would challenge them.  Why do you--you know, because it says so in the Chicago Tribune.  No, wow!  He's right, or these reporters are depending on second and third-hand information and it's not that way, and so that was kind of fun.
Speaker 1: Did they ever ask you, what are they doing to you at Morehouse College?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  There was some curiosity, you know, and what is happening to our sweet, little, they used to call me Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert Franklin].  What is happening to Bobby?  And I was at church and I was still kind of going through some of the motions, but you know, things were different.
Story_ID: 221971
Speaker 1: I guess I should mention also during that year in England, when I returned from the experience in Morocco, I actually did affiliate with a Bible study group on campus at Durham University [Durham, England], I think in part my search was for a deeper understanding, reckoning with, you know, my own kind of Christian identity and those texts that I had grown up with but never really critically studied, and so there were a group of very committed young Christians on campus who were doing that, who I admired and respected, and they became kind of role models for that kind of nurture and growth.  So when I got back to Chicago [Illinois], not only was it difficult to be with my family or friends, who kind of just accepted the American way of life as the ultimate and unquestioned best, but also in church, entering that culture, where people seemed to take things for granted and just sing the same old hymns and mouth the same rhetoric, and then I was kinda raising more critical questions about our faith and about sacred scripture, and people there were a little disturbed by some of the things I would raise.  So, summer did get by.  I think I did get a job, once again, at one of the county departments in the city, then, thinking I was still headed to law school and into the political thing, but now you know some, there is a lot of disequilibrium now in my own mind, as I'm trying to sort out what am I going to do with these experiences I've had, Morocco, Spain, Soviet Union.  So, I returned to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and as a senior in political science I was expected to apply to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and get ready for that track, and I found my passion for that waning in ways that alarmed my professors.  In fact, I was sort of groomed as the star political science student for the year.  Each year there was one.  And, the professor of political science at Morehouse then was a legendary figure, Robert [Hughes] Brisbane, who had written a number of books and, you know, they were, we were known as Brisbane's boys, or Bris' boys, and I was the chief among them for that year.  I, in fact, received the Brisbane Political Science Award [sic. Robert Brisbane Outstanding Award for Students of Political Science] for excellence in political science.  I think I was one of the few students who ever got straight A's in all the political science courses offered, and so, but I started raising questions in class about the political thought and philosophy, and so on of an unusual kind, because I was raising questions about a sort of ultimate dimension of human existence and human purpose and human nature, and they were kind of intrigued and a little disturbed.  It was like, why are you going there.  And so, I began to unsettle my professors, and they didn't quite know what to do with me.  In fact, I later learned through a friend they thought, "Is he having a nervous breakdown, or why is he questioning everything?"  I was then sent to a couple of theology professors on campus, and these are people I did not know, and frankly didn't respect very much; you know, I mean what is theology and where does that get you and how does that change the world?  But they said a few things that were helpful to me, including one in which said, "When you feel that you are being tugged towards something different that you don't, can't put into words, you should trust that feeling, move with that tug, don't resist, see where it takes you," and it could be--they began to talk about strange things like a call to ministry, a call to service in the arena of the religious tradition.  Gee whiz, I don't want that, but ultimately that's where I was headed.
Story_ID: 221972
Speaker 1: During that senior year, as I was trying to sort out what was going on inside, and not certain about my future intellectual direction, I was not passionate about the pre-law studies and applying to law school, I felt I could do that, but that wasn't my greatest interest at that time.  I began to learn more about the world of, kind of, religious studies and comparative religious studies and thought well, maybe this, I could do this.  And yet, you know, this is my senior year at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I have already been slotted as the star student.  I can get the recommendations for law school, but it wasn't happening, and so I've always thought about and wanted to attend Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and knew nothing about whether or not Harvard had a divinity school, of all things, and almost it felt accidental to me, I have other ways of explaining it now, but coming out of a library one evening at Morehouse, I saw a college brochure on a big bin where brochures were being discarded.  They were old, or dated, so they were throwing them out, apparently, and I saw this stuff and I happened to see that kind of crimson and white color brochure on the top of this pile, so I picked it up and I knew these were Harvard's colors.  It turned out, sure enough, Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Divinity School?  I never heard of it.  I wonder if it's still open, maybe they closed this place, they've thrown out the brochure, after all.  There was a pull-out card inside and I filled it out and sent it in and sure enough, received an application.  Meanwhile, I'm conferring with some of the religion professors.  So, what does this call to ministry, what does that mean?  And how do you, what do you do?  And so, they began to talk about seminary and a three-year master's degree and study, and I said, "Well, can I look at kind of Christianity and Islam and atheism and all this stuff that I'm interested in?"  And they said, "Well, yeah.  It's not ordinarily what people do, but you can."  I thought that well maybe I should be looking at a Ph.D. program where I really could look at--so, it's funny, because I had almost forgotten and my professors reminded me, that I had applied both to the Harvard Divinity School for their master of divinity program, preparation for ministry, and to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in the Ph.D. program in compare--what's called history of religions.  I was accepted into both programs and received a very generous award for the Ph.D. program at Harvard, and so once, you know, my political science professors were kind of looking over my shoulder at this and they were just completely befuddled.  They can't believe you're doing this.  But we are proud and you've been accepted at two Harvard schools and have got these tremendous awards.  The theology professors who didn't know me now starting to claim me and excited that they helped mentor me into Harvard Divinity School.  My now pastor of the local church quite excited and he, as I was beginning to accept, you know, this idea that I would become a seminarian and a minister, some, a lot of people urging me to stay here in Atlanta [Georgia] and to attend ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  I thought, yeah, makes sense.  I could do that.  But, this pastor, of all people, saying look, you've been accepted at Harvard.  Not many people do that.  It's a great opportunity.  You need to go there, so do that.  You can come to ITC any time later, but go there.  So, I thought okay.  I'll get to fulfill my dream of going to Harvard.  I was later reminded by a professor at Harvard that I was the only student he had ever known who was accepted into both programs and said no to the Ph.D. program, because it was so competitive and coveted and I actually went into the Master of Divinity [M.Div.] program to pursue this training.  I just felt I didn't have the language or the background to enter a Ph.D. program at that point.  I saw this M.Div. as a way to help me kind of find my footing.
Story_ID: 221973
Speaker 1: I matriculated at Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in the fall of 1975, and entered a whole new world of discourse and study and approaches to reality and, you know, the usual categories of power and self-interest and so on.  It was prominent in political science.  We are now replaced by concepts of justice, of virtue, of faith, and I was attracted to that, but still interested in this power stuff and politics.  So, it was a good journey, a good experience, the intellectual stimulation of being there, the opportunity to--I actually went over and audited courses at the law school in constitutional law and studied with Alan Dershowitz, and later became quite famous as a defense attorney, and moved around the university [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I took courses on the history of medicine and public health and was just really, you know, soaking it all in--the wonderful intellectual culture that that university community offered, and you know, spent every dime I had on books and collecting a library, and beginning to do kind of hands on service, particularly in the hospital setting, where part of my training was in something called clinical pastoral education, where you learn essentially counseling skills, and I happened to be assigned to a mental hospital, the Boston State Hospital [Boston, Massachusetts], and so I really began to learn a whole new literature on psychopathology and the medicines, the styles of treatment, people who are emotionally, behaviorally disabled, as they're labelled.  That was fascinating stuff, and to bring religious themes and concepts into dialogue with psychology to talk about deviant behavior and these unusual kind of ideations and cognitive processes and to discover that there were a number of texts that looked at the interesting parallels between dramatic religious experience and conversion and psychopathology, psychosis and interesting breaks.  I was just fascinated with all that stuff.  I did nurture some of the interest in comparative religion; not as much as I thought I would, but it was still rich because it helped me find a way to talk about, to identify common ground among the various religious traditions, points of difference, how conflict might be negotiated, resolved, and that was a good place to do that as opposed to, I mean, I met with friends of mine who were in very more parochial Christian settings who, that was not on their agenda in the same way.  So, this gave me a sense of still fulfilling this public role that I wanted to assume, which I later found the language for naming it as the process of becoming a public theologian, that is in contrast to someone who is a more of a pulpit theologian who speaks to the church only, but the public theologian is a person who is in a larger public domain, using the categories of the faith tradition to ask about or raise critical questions about what is in the common good, what is in the best interest of the least advantaged members of the community.  So, I could still bring this interest in justice and the appropriate use of power to empower people together with the faith language of love and justice, and really in a way, discovered [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] for the first time in an intellectual way and found him as a kind of compelling model for what I was doing.  He had a--he went to seminary, he had a Ph.D. in theology and ethics and I thought, yeah, this is--it's okay to do this--
Story_ID: 221974
Speaker 1: What did you do after you graduated from Harvard [Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  What were your next steps?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that I could go back to Chicago [Illinois].  There were opportunities to work in my home church [St. Paul Church of God in Christ, Chicago, Illinois].  I had training work as a hospital chaplain, and so, but I also felt I didn't have enough in the area of academic skills and I was being told by professors at Harvard there was a need for more African Americans in the professoriate and I thought that could be interesting, to teach.  I still had my, you know, teacher, Dr. Robert [Hughes] Brisbane, as a role model, and the impact he had on students at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I thought it'd be great to have that impact on other young minds, so I decided to go home, reconnect with my family.  My mother [Lee McCann Franklin] was a bit ill at that time, and I wanted to be closer to her.  I wanted to get back to Chicago itself and to pursue more academic work, and so I went back and actually enrolled in the University of Chicago's [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] Ph.D. program.  I was accepted there.  In fact, I recall that was the only school I applied to for doctoral work.  It was kind of rolling the dice; if I get accepted I'll go, if not, I'll know I need to take some time off and work.  Well, I was accepted and that was exciting because several of my favorite teachers at Harvard were Chicago products, and so, I was in the Ph.D. program at Chicago, and a chaplain at a local hospital in one of the toughest neighborhoods in Chicago.  So, there I was, you know, wearing my collar and a white lab jacket in the hospital, dealing with up close and personal, you know, the real life and death concerns and predicaments of people, and studying religion and psychology, keeping alive that interest.  But, as I was immersed in that setting, began to pay more attention to the kinds of problems that especially poor people were bringing in to the emergency room, the gunshots, the lovers' quarrels that ended in someone being harmed, the domestic violence, this child abuse, and I said now I could spend my life focusing on these individual problems and be an individual healer, or I could step back and try to look at the systems and the behaviors that seem to compel people to behave in certain ways, that don't offer people lots of options for how they express their anger, or how they organize their lives.  And so, once again, that social political societal interest kind of disturbed the equilibrium I was developing as a chaplain dealing with the private side of people's lives and demanded I be more attentive to that larger societal dimension.  So, my academic area shifted from religion psychology to ethics and sociology, and brought those together while at the University of Chicago.  I ultimately began to ask the question, "What does African American religious political tradition have to say about the two ancient questions of moral philosophy and ethics?"  Who is the good person?  What's the good life, and what's the just community or the good society, and brought those two together in my dissertation and that was later published as my first book, 'Liberating Visions[:Human Fulfillment and Social Justice in African American Thought,' Robert Michael Franklin].
Story_ID: 221975
Speaker 1: And upon graduation with your doctorate, you went on to do what next?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I left in 1983, I guess.  I didn't, I hadn't completed the dissertation and doctorate, but I received an attractive job offer, I was completed.  Finished classes at [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So, I went back to Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] because they were looking for someone to help direct the ministry program, so I went back and worked as the assistant director of the program that had trained me years earlier, and that was exciting, but I wasn't getting the dissertation written so I was frustrated that year in Boston [Massachusetts].  I did meet the woman that I would marry, however, so that was the one good thing about being in Boston that year, and Cheryl Goffney [Franklin], from Houston, Texas, was a senior in medical school at Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts], and we met at a reception in February of that year, I guess 1985, black history reception, Black History Month reception, for students in the professional schools at Harvard and new staff and professors.  So, we were connected and liked each other, continued to talk, and problem was that she was headed back to Houston because the medical students have to place and to match into a residency and she matched into the Baylor [College of Medicine, Houston, Texas] program back at Houston.  Meanwhile, I was unhappy back at Harvard, I wasn't getting the dissertation finished.  A friend of mine [Larry Greenfield] who had been the dean of students back at the University of Chicago when I was there as a student, well he was now president of Colgate Rochester [Crozer] Divinity School [Rochester, New York].  I spoke with him.  He found out I was restless.  He invited me to come and join the faculty at Colgate Rochester Divinity School.  So I left, took off to Rochester, New York.  Cheryl went down to Houston.  We had a long-distance relationship for that year, '85 [1985], and decided we would get married in '86 [1986].  So, she was able to transfer to Rochester, to the University of Rochester's [University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York] residency program, while I continued to teach.  And so, we were there in Rochester for four years, and it was really at Colgate Rochester Divinity School, it is an interesting school with a Baptist tradition in their heritage, the seminary that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] attended, the Crozer Theological Seminary [Upland, Pennsylvania], in an effort not to sort of go out of business, ended up moving to Rochester and joined that collection of seminaries, so it was Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School many, many years earlier.  So, a lot of prominent black clergy in this country had attended Crozer with Dr. King and followed King to Crozer at a time when it was located in Chester, Pennsylvania.  Well, now it's in Rochester and I was being asked to come and become dean of black church studies at Colgate Rochester, so I didn't realize it at the time, but it was actually a position of some national visibility in the black church community.  So, I began to have opportunities to lecture and preach around the country and to meet many of the leaders and clergy who were quite prominent and influential, and so that was really the first step on to the national stage in terms of my role as, again, this language of a public theologian, being able to help define the action agenda for the church, calling attention to problems that needed our energy and activism, preparing students to enter ministry and do that work, and some more writing, and my book ['Liberating Visions: Human Fulfillment and Social Justice in African American Thought,' Robert Franklin] was being circulated in those circles and it was a good place to be for that time.

Speaker 1: Well, 1988 rolled around, and I was a guest speaker here at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] for the Black History Month chapel program at Candler School of Theology [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and I talked about the black church studies program at Colgate Rochester [Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York], which was the first of its kind to have in a seminary, predominantly white seminary, an academic program on the black church that looked at its history, its theology, its distinctive styles of worship, music, and preaching and its ethics and there's a role that it played in the Civil Rights Movement.  I hadn't known that you could actually teach academic courses in that area and so they were, the students at Emory were excited.  Why don't we have such a program?  We're here in Atlanta [Georgia] where [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] lived, and so they invited me to come and help establish such a program.  So I joined the faculty at Emory's Candler School of Theology in the fall of 1989, and helped to set up that program.  Had a good experience there, we moved to Atlanta and I had this wonderful opportunity of getting to know many of the pastors and religious and political leaders of Atlanta that I've read about and known from a distance, and was happily in the Emory University community for a few years, when my research on why black men leave the church came to public visibility; in fact, there was an article in the Atlanta Journal [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] that focused on some of that research.  Someone at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] saw the article and called me and asked if I would consider becoming a consultant, 'cause they were working with black churches and clergy, given the importance of those churches, and helping to guide African American communities.  The question was could clergy be trained to help deliver what might be called secular social services, so the church has a place where after-school public health, after-school violence prevention programs, where economic literacy could be taught where greater voter participation could be encouraged, so these were interests of the Ford Foundation, and they were really wanting to experiment with working with black clergy and churches in that area; so, they invited me.  You know, I'm an emerging low-level expert on the black church at that point, having been at Colgate Rochester, and ultimately they persuaded me to join full time, so I left Emory and worked at the Ford Foundation as a program officer.
Story_ID: 221977
Speaker 1: And what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I was a program officer in the human rights and social justice program and it gave me an opportunity to do some international travel, again, with the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], as I connected with Ford's offices, particularly in Africa.  I was also able to advise the president of the foundation [Franklin Thomas] at that time, very interested in doing more in the area of religion, on my perspective on what ought to be given privilege and priority in the world of religious studies and religious movements.  But at that time, when the, I guess, in '96 [1996], '97 [1997], the president [James H. Costen] of the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia], ITC, invited me to become the academic dean, his assistant, as it were, and ultimately he hoped that I might succeed him as president.  I was not interested in leaving the foundation.  I was not interested in being an academic dean, and so I said no.  He later did, in fact, retire and then the chair of the board invited me to apply and I said no.  They then sent an executive headhunter search team up to New York [New York] at the Ford Foundation where I was, and said, you know, we really want you to consider; a third time, no.  Finally the board, a committee of the board of ITC invited me to have lunch here in Atlanta [Georgia] and that's where they kind of turned up the heat and reminded me of my obligation to serve the community and to give back, and reminded me that, in fact, one of these bishops on the committee said, "I knew your grandmother [Martha McCann], and she would want you to serve and to give back and do that," so I thought, whoa, they brought out the heavy ammunition on this one, so I agreed.  Although this was not something I was initially inclined to do.  It was a real privilege to step into the president's office of an important institution for black church leadership formation.  So, I was at ITC for almost five years.
Story_ID: 221978
Speaker 1: And what happened after your tenure at ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Then I, let's see, at that point was, I had a second book ['Another Day's Journey: Black Churches Confronting the American Crisis,' Robert M. Franklin] out which elaborated this idea about the public theologian, and was attempting to really have more opportunities for writing, publishing, and speaking, so I really grew weary with being on the fundraising treadmill and looking for an opportunity to return to the classroom, and that did, in fact, emerge.  It happened in an unusual way, though.  I requested a sabbatical from ITC, so that I could get out and just see the larger world.  It was interesting toward the end of my time at ITC.  I felt a little like my sophomore year at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], when everything felt very familiar and very, you know, predictable and it wasn't enough of a challenge.  So, I wasn't growing in ways I wanted to.  So, I requested the sabbatical and I think there were many in the institution that felt, you know, this is not a good idea, and some were concerned that I was gonna take the time off and not come back, and I assured them, no, I just need the time to recharge my battery, I've been away at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], I was commuting between New York [New York] and Atlanta [Georgia], and my kids are young, are growing up, and I haven't spent adequate time with them, young family, so I just needed a break, and I got an unusual break as I began to travel to other countries.  I actually visited India, and while in India, coming down, walking down the side of a mountain, I had an orthopedic accident and ruptured both of my knee tendons, the quadricep tendons, which I later learned is a fairly common sports injury, but it is most unusual to rupture both tendons at the same time, which is what happened.  Here I am ten thousand miles from home on the side of a mountain, on a morning of ninety-six degrees in the shade, by myself and don't speak the language, and I've got to get back to my hotel and I should add I'm on an island, on a mountain on an island, an hour outside of Bombay [India], now called Mumbai [India].  I didn't know, I couldn't walk and didn't know what had happened.  I just recall hearing these two dull thuds, boom, boom, inside my knees and like two large rubber bands popping.  Well, ultimately four guys on the side of the mountain who were selling beverages to tourists walking up, put me in a chair and carried me down a mountain, got me onto the boat, an hour back to Mumbai, back to the hotel, to the hospital, and ultimately they said, "You're gonna have to have surgery," and instead of doing it there in India, I was anxious to get home, and so onto British Airways for a nineteen-hour journey home.  Well, you know, absolute misery, but back, and at that point, I knew okay, my recovery is gonna be two months and then several--in fact, over a year of physical therapy to get back.  That became the occasion for resigning from ITC, and when that news got out, the dean back at Harvard [Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] learned that I was essentially going to be free, and so he invited me to become a visiting professor at Harvard Divinity School, so here is my third journey back to Harvard; now, in a position that was truly comfortable as a visiting professor, no committee work, I just taught my courses.  I was still commuting 'cause the family didn't move, and at the end, toward the end of that time, the dean at Candler [School of Theology] at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] called and said, "Would you be interested in returning to Emory?"  And I said, "Yes, I would.  It'd be good to get back to Atlanta with my family and stop travelling."  So, that's what landed me back at Emory, and it's where I am today and teaching, writing, and doing more in the area of public communications as I provide radio commentary for 'All Things Considered,' in National Public Radio [NPR], and I'm really enjoying that and want to do more of that kind of work.
Story_ID: 221979
Speaker 1: So, in your current position [professor of social ethics at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], do you mind sharing some of your views about faith-based initiatives?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really have mixed opinions about the current government investment in, and way of interpreting, faith-based initiative.  I have actually no trouble with the effort of faith communities to establish separate non-profit entities that receive funding, that compete for funding based on their capacity to deliver services and provide services to communities in a nondiscriminatory way.  My trouble with the current government's approach to faith-based initiatives is, I think, a crossing of the line of almost direct government subsidies to religious communities who may, which may, in fact, involve discrimination in employment and even in the delivery of services.  So, yes to the big idea that the faith community should be a part of the service delivery infrastructure of a community, and ought to receive public support for that when their own resources are limited; but, no to making the church, mosque, or synagogue an arm of the government that becomes dependent upon the government for its funding, that is accountable to the government.  I'm far more interested in an independent, robust faith community that is able to challenge the government and exercise its social justice responsibilities, its prophetic voice, as we like to talk about the prophet, as that figure in the Old Testament who speaks truth to the power, in the prophet Isaiah, the prophet Jeremiah.  The black church has always been a prophetic institution, the conscience of the nation and I would hate to see that prophetic voice silenced or muffled in any way because, well, after all, this church is dependent upon government funding for its community ministries.
Story_ID: 221980
Speaker 1: What is your perspective on the status and role of the black church in 2004?
Speaker 2: I continue to feel that the black church is a sleeping giant when it comes to really transforming local communities.  We could do a lot more if we were to act in concert in a unified way according to a strategic plan.  I think currently the, some scholars suggested, between sixty and seventy thousand black churches in this country act largely, behave as if they are sort of free agents, local congregations, organizations, that respond to their leaderships' vision of what they ought to be doing and may not have a sense of a larger perspective and a strategic perspective, and I just feel that with the problems that are now on the scene, increasing incidents of HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in the black teenage population, with one third of young African American men going to jail or prison are under the supervision of the criminal justice system, only 18 percent, by the way, go to college with growing disparities between the black middle class and the poor so-called underclass, there are a lot of serious economic political cultural issues that need attention, and unfortunately too much, most black churches are preoccupied with the very legitimate spiritual needs and interests of their parishioners.  But I think as I understand authentic Christianity, Jesus was challenging his disciples to be servants to the community and particularly to what He called the least, those who are the least advantaged members of the community; those who don't have a voice to represent their interests.  That's a part of the responsibility of the church, and if the church is preoccupied with the interests of upwardly mobile, well off people, if it begins to preach a gospel of health, wealth, and success instead of a gospel that challenges the power structure, then we will have distorted this great religious tradition and the vision of this extraordinary leader, Jesus of Nazareth, and made it into something else.  We ought to be honest about the fact that we are now worshipping another god, and in another tradition.
Story_ID: 221981
Speaker 1: Many have recently been inspired by Mel Gibson's '[The] Passion [of the Christ'].  Do you have any comments on the impact or the substance of that movie?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Yeah, I actually tried to express my perspective in an editorial that was recently published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper and essentially tried to make three big points; one is the anti-Semitism in the film and there are accents of anti-Semitism, in particular, by director's neglect, by failing to portray Rome as equally culpable with the segments of the Jewish community who sought to execute Jesus, letting Rome off the hook makes it look as if the Jews alone conspired and pulled off this crucifixion, and that wasn't the case even according to the New Testament, so I think that's problematic.  The second point--so, anti-Semitism was wrong and some elements of this film did push in that direction.  Second is that African Americans, because of our historical experience of slavery, of suffering, of persecution, have regarded Jesus in a way different from many of the white church traditions; seeing Jesus as a suffering servant, as a grassroots leader who was the victim of state-sponsored terror, who see Jesus in his suffering and in his vulnerability, not the exalted Christ in the silky white robe, but rather the broken, dirty, bloodied Jesus of Nazareth, and many American viewers who are accustomed to this sanitized makeover Jesus, are gonna have trouble with these images of this bloody, grotesque, beat down, but the black folk through our lens of historical suffering, recognized that Jesus as the Jesus that drew us into Christianity, when prior we were adherent largely to African traditional religions.  So the third points are these different lens of viewing this film, and I think of black theology's appreciation for this focus on the Jesus as a kind of political victim.  The third was that the film would evoke memories of young black men who were lynched in this country and, while the community looked on with a fear because they wanted to retaliate against the authorities for lynching our young men but were afraid to, and the grief of feeling the loss of this talented leader taken away from us at too young an age, and feel the pain of young--that Jewish mother, Mary, as she lost her son in that fashion.  So, it was, I think, a powerful film.  I think it did evoke those memories for me.  At the same time, I think it was a missed opportunity as a film to educate people so that they would appreciate the why behind why this suffering and this brutality was visited upon Him, the story of the Roman Empire at that time, the story of Judaism in the first century, and the story of Jesus, his teachings and his life.  Those were the three stories, I think, needed to be somehow intertwined that Mel Gibson missed that opportunity and focused solely upon twelve hours of the last, you know, segment of Jesus's life, human life.
Speaker 1: Some have concerns with the racial characterization of Jesus in this film.  What is your perspective?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was a little off put by that, given what we might expect; you know, this sunbaked Palestinian Jew to have looked like.  Gibson goes to, you know, largely Italian, southern European characters to play those roles rather than, you know, North African and Middle Eastern personalities, so we don't get as much of a reflection of the world of North Africa and Israel at that time, when there was considerable racial, ethnic, color diversity.  But, I would say at least the film did a better job than many previous efforts out of Hollywood.
Story_ID: 221982
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, concern would be the capacity to ignore, to be in denial over significant issues that need attention.  That's a great concern.  How's it that we continue to be able to pull that off, to carry on our lives and to sleep well at night without a disturbed conscience?  Meanwhile, you know, large segments of our community live in quiet desperation, large numbers of our young men in prison population have swollen in the past fifteen years from one million to now two million and, you know, half of those in federal prisons are African Americans.  Meanwhile, we worry about the future of marriage in the black community.  In 1970, 68 percent of African Americans were married, twenty years later in 1994, only 48 percent of African Americans were married.  That's a lot of ground, to lose twenty percentage points in that twenty-four-year period.  I'm concerned about father absence and fathers not available to rear and support the children.  These are some of the worries and concerns, and I still have a sense that there is considerable denial regarding these issues, and sort, of we've accepted the American capitalist ethos of, you know, every tub on its own bottom, every individual that makes an effort will be rewarded, and those who don't sink, and that's just tough luck for them.  That's really a departure from the ethic of, you know, responsibility for your sister and your brother, and the mutual accountability we've always had in our community.  Hopes is that, and in fact, this is the focus of this next book that I'm working on now that I'm planning to call, 'Crisis in the Village:  Restoring Hope to African American Communities' [Robert M. Franklin].  And in it, I want to look at crises in four institutional sectors in the black community:  the black church that faces a mission crisis, the black colleges [historically black colleges and universities, HBCUs] face a crisis of relevance and purpose, the black civil rights organizations face an identity crisis, and black families face a crisis of commitment.  I want to try to both celebrate the achievements and heroic hard work that these institutions have performed in the past in bringing us where we are today, but then look carefully and deeply at the areas of distress and the fact that we invest a lot of energy, but don't make much impact in many of these problem areas today, and then end up in terms of restoring hope, to sketch a strategic plan, if you will, how these institutions, colleges, churches, civil rights and nonprofit groups and family, can work in a concerted way to produce change.  I'm encouraged by some of the work that people like [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley and Tom Joyner, what they're doing with the State of Black America [sic. State of the Black Union] conversations.  Now, it's just an annual conversation, but it represents for me a kind of, a moral checkpoint that each year we ought to check in and read the pulse and get a sense of how are, not all of us, but how particularly the least advantaged members of the community, how are they faring.  And if there isn't measurable progress, we need to retool all of our institutions to ensure that education, mentoring, financial resources, government initiatives, et cetera are working to help those in greatest need.  But, we need a plan.  We don't have a strategic plan that would help the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the National Baptist Convention, The Links [Inc.], the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], all these groups, none of them is reading the same book, that's the same map, to talk about what should we do in the next six months that we can check in with this larger conversation and ensure, yeah, we've covered our ground.  Have you?  And if not, let's help you.  That's the kind of thing I want to point toward.
Story_ID: 221983
Speaker 1: Gay marriage is being hotly debated today, both as a theological and a legal issue.  What are your views?
Speaker 2: That we haven't had the conversation we need to have as a society to make this significant policy change at this time.  It may happen, and if it does, then as a society, I think we will have decided it is in everyone's best interest; but, I don't think we've had that conversation yet so, I, at this time, would be opposed to extending or expanding the definition of marriage until we have the conversation.  At the same time, I think that the rights that gay and lesbian people seek should be respected, should be granted equal protection, and that as a society at the very least we can do now, is grant civil rights to civil unions, et cetera.  The issue of same-sex marriage and--is not gonna go away.  But, I think we should be cautious about rushing to transform our definitions of what this particular institution means, what we expect from it.  And so, presently, I'm more inclined to support civil unions with full package of benefits and privileges, and let that be a civic political process with another secondary process being what the religious community does in the area of marriage.  After all, religious communities sort of brought to the world marriage, the concept of marriage as something that God ordains, desires, et cetera.  All sorts of forms of family were experimented with throughout history and in various parts of the world.  Governments have sort of blessed and conscienced polygamy and all sorts of family unions; some still do today, but it was the faith communities that really brought this vision of a monogamous relationship between men and women that would have procreation and the production and nurture of children as, kind of what we expect from this thing we've invented called marriage, or this thing that God instituted.  And so, to radically transform that understanding, I think, is troubling to me, although, as I say, in the end if, as a society, we decide yes, these unions really do meet the test.  They do what we expect of marriage, then that's a decision I could live with.
Story_ID: 221984
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Write the great American novel (laughter).  There are parts of the world I still want to travel to and see, Antarctica, farthest reaches of China, and the islands of the South Pacific, and there are still places I'd still like to set my feet on.  There are things I'd like to read.  I still feel as if I'm catching up with my liberal arts education that I never quite completed.  I'd love to go back and reread everything I've already read, and with a sense of what it means to be an educated person, still not, I haven't quite made it according to my criteria and standards.  So, the opportunity to read and to meet people that I'd love to meet, especially some world leaders.  I think it'd be fascinating to hear more of the stories of people, change agents, that have made our world different and a lot of people still around from Nelson Mandela to Desmond Tutu, to leaders of the Czech Republic and so on.  So, that's what I'd like to do.
Story_ID: 221985
Speaker 1: In closing, how do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: That he was a good citizen, that he was a man of the [Holy] Spirit and virtue, that he sought to practice what he preached, that he was a bridge builder, who sought to link the diverse parts of the human family, and that he laughed a lot, that he experienced the joy of life, of the love of children, the beauty of nature, the unique fulfillment of parenting good children, and seeing them grow, so.
Story_ID: 221986
Speaker 1: What was your father's [Robert Franklin, Sr.] reaction to your career path and your accomplishments?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  He was quite, he was very quiet.  He didn't, I don't recall him saying very much, but it was a kind of cautious respectful distance is the way I recall it feeling, I think, and I used to try to figure out, is he disappointed that I didn't go to law school and this politics thing, or is he now content that I found, you know, this respectful and certainly very conventional way of serving the community and people in ministry.  He had not himself been, you know, as active as my mother [Lee McCann Franklin] in church and so, and he worked often, so often on Sundays he was not with us when we went to church, so I wasn't quite sure about his loyalties, but he had his own sort of quiet spirituality and approach to things, and not as expressive as my mother and the folks in our church community.  But he, in time, expressed particularly as I moved into the Ph.D. program, admiration for how serious I have become about my studies and about life and he would sometimes reference, you know, you've come a long way, you've turned things around.  He was proud of that, and I think a certain amount of awe in there with respect to the religious calling.  I think he sort of saw, you know, there's something special going on here that is not my doing as his father, and I want to let that happen.  I wish I knew more about how to nurture it but I don't know, you know, this is someone else's business as it were, but I respect it, I admire, so I felt all of that.
Story_ID: 221987
Speaker 1: How and why did you come to be involved with providing commentary for NPR [National Public Radio] and what perspective or persona are you expected to provide in this role?
Speaker 2: I was, I suppose, recommended by one of my former teachers at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], to the program people at NPR, who were searching for broader representation of voices and commentators to weigh in on the subject of religion and society, broadly interpreted. My Chicago professor, Martin [E.] Marty, is one of the nation's leading commentators on religion.  He served on my dissertation committee and has since become a friend and I'd imagine that they asked Dr. Marty for women, African Americans, Hispanics, and others whom he knew, and so they called out of the blue one day and talked to Dr. Marty, folks at the American Academy of Religion, with whom we double checked your name off, thought highly of you.  "We wondered if you'd be interested," and essentially made the pitch, if there is something going on in the world, in America, that I find interesting and would like to develop an idea for, send them an email and they give a green light on the idea, draft a commentary, check in, I would read it over the phone, we'd edit and then I'd head off to the studio where we'd be on the line.  They're in Washington [D.C.], and I'd record and so, I did the first of them in January of, I guess, 2001, following President [George Walker] Bush's inauguration.  Black preachers were in Washington during that inaugural weekend, protesting the election process of Florida, and I wrote a commentary about how seeing this relatively small number of black preachers protesting in the rain that weekend in Washington was a reminder of the historical role of the black church and of black clergy as God's poets, speaking truth to power and resisting injustice in every way.  That turned out, they really liked that.  It got a lot of good response.  I got emails from Hawaii and Maine and all the people listening everywhere, so I was, I kind of enjoyed that, and it gave me an opportunity to learn how to write and communicate with a broader public and to try to say a lot in two and a half minutes, so I have since continued and written occasional commentaries, monthly for a while and less often now.  I'm actually working on a piece now, on the black church and same-sex marriage, and urging black clergy to recall their role as truth tellers and as protectors of the least advantaged members of the community and so, as we have the debate about marriage, my hope is that black clergy don't assume the leading role of opposing gay marriage, that we can play a role of at least insisting that we have the conversation, but to show respect and tolerance to it toward all people; I think that's where [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] would be.
Story_ID: 221988
Speaker 1: In the 1950s and '60s [1960s], a number of visionary, courageous activists emerged from the black church.  Where are their successors, and where or when may we expect to see them rise to prominence?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that their successors are, in many respects, distracted today.  They aren't as focused as some of those leaders were on social change, on transforming communities.  I think that many, many of them, perhaps many of us, have been seduced by the material temptations of the culture, are far more comfortable with the logic of capitalism and its way of rewarding a talented few and ignoring the masses, and so I fear that some of the leaders of the megachurches today who, I think, by virtue of being able to assemble thousands and thousands of people, have some of that energy with young people, I'd say with some of the juice that Malcolm [X] and [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and others had, but are channeling it in ways that I find to be far more parochial institutional maintenance oriented rather than socially transforming, and my hope even in trying to spell out, or humbly offer, a strategic plan for these organizations and institutions to work together, is that many of those leaders will take more seriously their responsibility to the larger community and its needs.  I think right now we are suffering from amnesia.  We have forgotten the tradition and the movements of the past, and a certain amount of short-sightedness.  We don't see the larger connections.  Dr. King's last book was titled 'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?' [Martin Luther King, Jr.].  The last chapter in that last book was titled "The World House."  He had this global vision of human interdependence and interconnectedness.
Story_ID: 221989
Speaker 1: In that final chapter, "The World House," [in 'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?'] [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] is looking at the interdependence of the human family, and he really develops a kind of global ethic of mutuality and responsibility that I find I'm missing in today's culture, and yet, if you look at where King was at the end of his life with that, I really see that last chapter of the last book as a clue to his last testament as it were, talking about economic justice, and the need to transform societal institutions and the means of production in ways that allow everyone to participate; everyone to contribute, everyone has something to say and to express.  Society can be smarter about including and helping people find their way in, then we currently simply almost laissez-faire allow capitalism again, you know, those, the best and the brightest and the most talented make it in, everybody else, you're kind of on your own.  King argued that was immoral and that we can do better.  We can do better if we try.  So, I'd love for those, our leaders today, especially leaders of the megachurches too, to kind of rediscover or meet for the first time the King that I see in that chapter "The World House," and to think about their ministries in the global possibilities, not simply expanding church buildings, increasing revenues, expanding membership roles, but taking government and corporate sector to task for how all of our institutions are behaving and the impact they have on people's lives.  See if we could just turn the corner and do things differently.  We know from the anti-smoking campaigns, the anti-drunk driving campaign, that peoples' movements do work, and the media, the elites, the masses, all have a role to play.  We just haven't seen a kind of plan that helps us work together.  I think King is doing some of that in that chapter.  It's inspiring, some of the work that I want to be doing now that I've had a chance to experience a bit of institutional leadership at ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  I know a little something about philanthropy and the world of money in America, and how philanthropy happens, how government institutions operate and so to just try to be a more synthetic bridge-building figure in that whole matrix of institutions.
Story_ID: 221990
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about megachurches?  Do you think that they have a place in the growth of the good and just community?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think that they do, insofar as there are many people who choose a megachurch, who wouldn't attend any other church, so to that extent, you know, the market does respond to need.  People who want this, the experience of anonymity in a crowd of five thousand or twenty thousand, but who do want intellectual stimulation, who do want spiritual nurture, and who are also there just as seekers.  They're not sure what they want.  That's what I find significant and promising is that they're really dependent upon whatever the particular leader holding forth has to offer, and my disappointment is that too many of these leaders have become spiritual entrepreneurs.  They are CEOs of organizations and not radical change agents and spiritual kind of exemplars that Jesus was, that [Mohandas] Gandhi was, that [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] and Malcolm X were.  They weren't necessarily trying to build empires.  They were trying to lead movements.  They were dynamic.  They could have stopped and built but they kept--they stayed in motion.  They wanted to enable others to build and so, in a sense, I think some of our most talented leaders, the entrepreneurs, the innovators, are stuck in institution building mode rather than, I would argue, their true calling is to be movement leaders who stir up people's dreams and energies and lives, who point them in directions, who talk about new ways of living together, of sharing our prosperity instead of hoarding to ourselves, of taking responsibility for the orphans or for the kids who are failing in our public schools, make them the agenda, the priority for the next five years of your ministry.  Very few of those leaders are doing that kind of risky ministry.  It is risky.  They may fail and I think that as a consequence, many avoid.  They want to do what they know they can do well, what works.  They do know how to raise offerings.  They do know how to attract people.  They do know how to entertain people and to deploy people in very good and legitimate ministries, but it's still, I think, missing the areas of greatest human need in our community.

Speaker 1: This photo was taken on my wedding day, June 21, 1986, and it occurred in Houston, Texas.  This is Vargo's Restaurant [Houston, Texas], where our reception occurred immediately after our wedding ceremony at the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church [Houston, Texas].  My wife, Cheryl Goffney Franklin, is an obstetrician/gynecologist.  She was still in her residency program at this time when we married and she moved to Rochester, New York, so we like to laugh that this is one of the last days of joy and smiling she experienced before entering the rigorous three years of residency in Rochester, New York, of all places, the place of lots of snow and long winter and I think she had trouble with it as a Houston girl.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This, I think, of course is at the White House [Washington, D.C.] following a meeting that President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton convened in February, I believe in 1998.  A number of African American leaders' organizations, civil rights groups, church groups gathered and he gave an address.  The press was on hand and each of us, there must have been forty or fifty of us, afterwards, had an opportunity for this photo op to walk through and I presented him with a copy of my book, 'Liberating Visions[: Human Fulfillment and Social Justice in African American Thought,' Robert Michael Franklin].
Speaker 2: This is my kindergarten photograph, so I'm guessing that, I was born in '54 [1954], this must have been about '58 [1958], about four years old when I got started, and I think you see some of the just barely controlled mischievous energy in this smile.  I recall having a great time running around that playroom at Esmond Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: This shot is my, the class in kindergarten, the kindergarten class at Esmond Elementary, my photograph there on the far end, in bow tie and suspenders, is the photograph that is also blown up in an earlier shot, and these are my friends.  These are the people I began my educational journey with in life, and I'm sorry to say that I, today, am not in touch with any of them and I know that one of them, a dear friend at the far, why his picture is etched out or scratched out there, but this is a copy and anyhow he died a few years ago, Tony Alexander [ph.].
Speaker 2: Mae Jemison's not in there, is she?
Speaker 1: No, she's not in that one, Mae, probably in my high school yearbook.
Speaker 2: This is my father, Robert Michael Franklin, Sr., and this was the sad day, that occasion, he's seated in the front seat of the limo where we attended the funeral of my youngest sister, his youngest daughter, who, Martha Patrice Franklin.  We buried her that day in Chicago [Illinois], and she died at the age of twenty-one from a disease, scleroderma, hardening of her lung tissue, and my wife captured this photograph of my dad as a kind of quiet, reflective moment as he is waiting for people to get into the cars as we are departing.  This rose was on her casket and someone picked it up and gave it to him, so--
Speaker 1: This is an article published in April of 1994, which discusses the research I was engaged in while at the Candler School of Theology [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and it discussed the reasons for the male exodus from religious congregations, and this article was picked up by members of the staff at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and they were very interested in the role congregations might play in helping to channel and train young men into productive lives and so this article presented me to a larger audience and the work I was engaged in.
Speaker 2: Excellent.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is--let me think, what year is this?  In its 1998 issue, Ebony magazine presented, this is a 1998 issue of Ebony magazine, focusing on ten men on the moon as they characterized us.  I'm in pretty good company there, actors and artists and power brokers in Washington [D.C.].  In any case, I had just been inaugurated as President of Interdenominational Theological Center [ITC, Atlanta, Georgia] the year earlier and was honored to be featured in this men on the moon piece.
Speaker 2: Right, next.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Now Mae is somewhere in this book, but she was a year behind me.
Speaker 2: This was my junior year of high school, 1970, Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois] photograph, and this captures that somewhat quasi-militant look of the '70s [1970s].  This was the year that I got into trouble at that school, but was fond of wearing fatigues and tinted glasses and the spirit of H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and other revolutionaries of the time.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, great.  Next.
Speaker 2: Also, in 1998, at the January 1998 Martin Luther King Memorial Service [Martin Luther King, Jr. Annual Commemorative Service] at Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], Vice President [Al] Gore was invited to give the keynote and as is the case for these ceremonies, there is also a second speaker or preacher, and I was, I had the privilege of delivering the follow-up sermon as the new president of ITC, and Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King and the King family were present and Al Gore later congratulated me on teaching him something about preaching.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is the occasion of my brother opposite me on the end, Kwame Bandele, who was born Brian Franklin, he turned forty years old and so I flew to Chicago to surprise him for this party, and my three brothers are there, Brian, Andrew [Franklin] in the white colored suit, and then David [Franklin] immediately next to me, so we're in order of age there (laughter) with my mother [Lee McCann Franklin].  My mother is in the center.
Speaker 1: This photo is a current photo.  It was taken at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] to serve as my public relations photograph.  It appears on the Internet for the Emory faculty directory, and if I had known I was going to live this long I would have taken better care of myself.
Speaker 2: The baby photo is my first few months of life, I suppose, and my mother says I was an afternoon baby and I've always been best, at my best in the afternoon; never a morning person, never a late night person, but afternoon I can get things done.
Speaker 1: And then, this photograph captures me at a time after recently accepting my call to ministry.  This is in Chicago in 1982, I suppose.  I was in the Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I was the Protestant chaplain at St. Bernard Hospital [St. Bernard Hospital and Health Care Center, Chicago, Illinois] in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is my wife, Cheryl, Dr. Cheryl Goffney Franklin, just after we moved to Atlanta, so in the early 1990s, and I think just after the birth of our little girl, Imani Franklin.
Speaker 2: And I'm rolling.
Speaker 1: This shot was taken about seven years ago.  My daughter, Imani, then about seven years old, and now thirteen, going on fourteen, my wife, Cheryl, and myself and my son, Robert [Franklin].  He is now ten.  He was three at that time, and we decided we needed a nice family photo for Christmas cards that year and we managed to pull that off at a local studio.
