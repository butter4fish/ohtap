Speaker 1: Now I often see it as Floretta Dukes McKenzie.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you still use the Dukes?
Speaker 2: I still use the Dukes, the Dukes is my maiden name and I guess it's just kind of out of respect for my father that I, that I use it.  And Dukes is D-U-K-E-S.

Speaker 2: Well presently I'm an educational consultant.  The firm does carry my name, the consulting firm.  And it's called the McKenzie Group.  And we work with mostly schools and school programs, K through twelve, but give some attention to community and post-secondary education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is September 12th, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Washington, D.C., at 1101 17th Street, Northwest.
Story_ID: 119922
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask.  It just requires a short answer.  The first one is ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food I guess chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Autumn, favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination is Solomon Islands, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I think it's, "I'm doing the best that I can."  In fact, my family teases me about it.
Story_ID: 119923
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let me ask you about your family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Ruth Jeter Dukes, Ruth, R-U-T-H, Jeter, J-E-T-E-R and Dukes, D-U-K-E-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is January 18th, I think it was 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your father's full name and--
Speaker 2: My father's full name, Martin Walter Dukes, and he was born about 1909, August 25th.
Story_ID: 119924
Speaker 1: Now can you tell, tell us what you know about your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Ruth Jeter Dukes] side of the family--don't have a lot of information 'cause both my mother's father and mother died when she [Ruth Jeter Dukes] was very young.  They were mostly--they lived in South Carolina, around Spartanburg, and was a fairly large family group.  Maybe about eight girls and two boys and the mother I think died in childbirth when my mother was about two years old and her father died when she was twelve.  And she was all--the sisters and all were scattered about.  Some were older at that time.  And she ended up going to Florida to live with an aunt.  And there she went to high school and met my father [Martin Walter Dukes].  I think they were heavy into athletics.  She was playing on a basketball team and he was refereeing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 119925
Speaker 1: Now is there--are there any stories passed down from her [Ruth Jeter Dukes] side of the family about what your fa--what, what her side was doing during Reconstruction or during slavery or even any African stories or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not too much, except that her father was a very dedicated father, worked very hard.  And there were a few schools that were available to them.  And he struggled to put his girls in some of the little private schools.  And somehow the family recognized education as the way out of poverty, so they were very much interested in going to school.  So they'd go and live with a sister and if there was a little college there, they would go to that college and so they were very, very much interested in escaping from poverty through education and that just continued to be the mantra of the family.
Story_ID: 119926
Speaker 1: Fascinating thing, well my mother [Ruth Jeter Dukes] graduated from high school, my father [Martin Walter Dukes] went to college.  His parents were both doctors at that time.
Speaker 2: Where were they from?
Speaker 1: They were from Florida.  And while he went to, to school and the parents knew Mary [McLeod] Bethune.  And so my father--his parents died fairly early.  I think the mo--mother died when he was about eighteen and Ms. Bethune provided for him to go to Bethune-Cookman [College, now Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] because she knew the family.  And so living in Florida in a little community, the thought of education was very important.  People would come through like Ms. Bethune and the whole community would gather in a, in a little--they called it an auditorium, but it was, just a little meeting place.  And we'd sit and wait for Ms. Bethune to come.  And I remember as a little girl I was sitting there, and she was about an hour and a half late or two hours late.  And when she came, everybody stood up.  And I remember clear as today, I asked somebody, "Why are we standing up for this lady?"  But even at that time, Ms. Bethune was revered by all, all black people.  And it just was kind of interesting, no it was very interesting and inspiring to grow up in a community where education was very, very important and you know, it was like your mission in life was to, to get educated and, and get a career and, and at that time they'd say just be somebody.  And that was very important part of, of the lifestyle.
Story_ID: 119927
Speaker 1: Tell, tell us about growing up.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up was in spite of what people might think, growing up in a very segregated community where occasionally the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] would drive through the city.  And when they would come through, parents would tell you to cut off the lights and be quiet and you know, let them move on through.  You know that was a, was a, a kind of scary, it was kind of scary.  But on the other hand, the life of, of this little black community just revolved around sports, music, there were male choruses singing the songs that men used to sing, 'Honeysuckle Rose' and the Negro spirituals.  As soon as the community was able, they bought instruments for a marching band.  And instead of working in the summer, parents would put together like seventy-five cents a week for you to take music lessons with the bandmaster.  Little library, very inadequate as compared to libraries today, but we had a librarian and who was the math teacher and she would stay in the afternoons to keep the library open.  And we would talk about what we were gonna do.  I remember talking about becoming a geography teacher; had a wonderful geography teacher, a man, Mr. Stevens.  And the other you know, friends would talk about what they were gonna do.  And we had this friend, and I'll call her Joan Smith, and she lived in what we called Death Alley.  Death Alley was so bad until the police wouldn't go down Death Alley at night.  But we were--
Speaker 1: This is in Lakeland [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we'd walk her to the head of Death Alley and she would have go and, you know go home, you know after choir practice 'cause we were--I guess the two most influential institutions in the life of children at that time when I was a kid, was the church and the school.  So we'd go to church and practice in choirs and place--well back to Joan Smith.  So we would talk to Joan about what are you gonna do?  I'm gonna be a teacher.  My sister would say I'm gonna be a pharmacist and on and Joan said I'm gonna be head nurse at a hospital in Atlanta [Georgia].  And so we said okay, you know we never disputed just because we didn't, we didn't know her mother, we didn't know--I think she lived with an aunt in Death Alley.  So about twenty years later I went home and I asked about Joan Smith, and she was a head nurse in that hospital in Atlanta.  So I don't know, I say to, to kids now it's important to have dreams and goals because really if you believe hard enough and work hard enough, you can achieve whatever you want.  But I mean out of Death Alley comes a, a very excellent nurse or healthcare leader.  And so I guess the bottom line Larry, is that we didn't feel that there were barriers to our becoming whatever we wanted to become.  A number of the young people who were ahead of us, they went to college.  They came back and talked about their experiences.  In fact, they would be invited back to the school.  And one came back and recited Paul Laurence Dunbar's, 'Keep a-plugging Away.'
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I ended up--my father moved to Washington [D.C.] because my sister wanted to go to School of Pharmacy at Howard [sic Howard University College of Pharmacy, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was fifteen.
Story_ID: 119928
Speaker 1: Now tell, tell me something before we--I don't wanna hold you up on this story, but you said your grandfather was a doctor and, and your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, and my grandmother.  They wouldn't let her--
Speaker 1: What's her story?  Now that, that's really--
Speaker 2: Well I think that they came from a family of freed blacks in Florida.  And as I understand it in Zora Neale Hurston's history of Florida, the Dukes are mentioned.  And his--my father's grandfather was a presiding elder in the Methodist church.  And somehow he sent his father, who was Martin Carol Dukes, to medical school.  And he met Florida Lillian Dukes who was the--who was happened to be studying at that time.  And they came back to Florida and my father's mother couldn't practice because only men were practicing then.  So she worked as a pharmacist and a teacher in the black community.  So that also was a real spur to us that if folks at that time, if our ancestors could be successful and go to school and they even had stocks.  We looked in some of the boxes--you know lived in one of those houses that was up on pillars.  And so folks had packed away things.  My parents' parents lost money in the crash.  In the Depression they had stock certificates that were of course no good, but they had bought stock.  They had property.  They--my father played violin.  They had instruments, house had a piano.  So somehow they managed to achieve and accumulate.
Speaker 1: Now, now where did your grandfather go to medical school, or--
Speaker 2: I think it must have been Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandmother too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's remarkable.
Speaker 2: Yes, so my sisters and brothers believed that there was a tradition of medical work in the family.  So my brother, I have a brother who's younger than I.  My father [Martin Walter Dukes] got ill and was dying.  My brother went to see him after he had--my brother was a mathematics teacher and was studying for an M.B.A. at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] and he visited with my dad and told him he was gonna become a doctor to keep tradition going.  And he did.  Went back to school, took all the chemistry and stuff he needed, and now he's a doctor practicing in the city.  Now we don't know where the next doctor--the generation will come, but we believe that somebody's gonna become a, a doctor again to keep it going in the family.
Story_ID: 119929
Speaker 1: Now what, what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father [Martin Walter Dukes] had a difficult life.  He was very bright, but he became an alcoholic, but he worked very hard for his family; worked sixteen hours a day.  Accounting office here, then he worked at pressing clothes because he believed that it was his responsibility for us to get an education.  While he never made probably more than about 4,000 dollars a year, my sister and I went through school and got master's and we lived in a little two bedroom house, and he never asked us to go to work or do anything other than be successful in school.  And so I was very pleased when I got to the place where I could help him, help the other kids.  There are six of us.  And so once you get your education, I'm next to the oldest, you're supposed to help the next ones get theirs.  And it wasn't helpful to my marriage that, that I was contributing to education for some, you know, the younger brothers and sisters, but that was what you were supposed to do and we did it.
Story_ID: 119930
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me about school, about you going to school.  What, what elementary school did you attend and--
Speaker 2: I attended elementary school in Florida.  What do you call it, Washington Park.  It was before they had campuses here.  The elementary and the junior high--the elementary and the high school all were on the same campus.  And it was a little frame school with potbellied stoves in the corner, but didn't need too much heat inasmuch as it was Florida.  Had very good teachers.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers you, you remember?
Speaker 2: Well one very special one, a woman by the name of Mrs. Bunch, Mary Bunch who came to Florida--she met the dentist who lived in the town and so she came and became the English teacher.  And she was a Columbia graduate.  So you know when I said we had good teachers, it's not an exaggeration.  And she was just the epitome of correctness.  And so while I--the, the subject matter I liked was geography.  The style I liked was Mrs. Bunch.  And she's still living.  And she's had a tremendous impact on so many students because she always tried to do it right and, and just you know, stay out on the cutting edge and didn't take any foolishness from you.  I had some others, Mrs. Daniels--at that time some of the teachers would use the belt or the ruler if you didn't have your, your lessons, your homework.  You never came without homework.  And if you didn't get it right sometime you'd get chopped a little bit.  But school was, was serious business then.
Story_ID: 119931
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?  What did you like most about school?
Speaker 2: Geography and English, all the social sciences.
Speaker 1: Why, why geography?  You don't hear--I don't hear that much from people in--
Speaker 2: Escapism.  You can put yourself in all the places that you read about.  And so when I graduated, I went to Teachers College [Washington, D.C.] and studied geography.
Speaker 1: Now just a minute.  It's interesting point here, 'cause we sit in this building, right next door to the National Geographic Society.
Speaker 2: And I'm a Trustee of the National Geographic Society.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to make that point while we're--so this starts when you're a child?  That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my dad [Martin Walter Dukes] would always collect the National Geographic.  So when he found that I was majoring in geography, he says, "Flo, you're not gonna be able to do anything with that, that's a waste of time."  I said "Dad, if you're good, you can make it no matter what you study."  And he did not live long enough to know that I had, had made it to the Board of Trustees of National Geographic.  But that was one thing I sure would have loved to have, have told him and had him share with me.  He loved the geographic and, and I guess that's part of why I, I, I liked it too.  But I like the, the subject.  You learn about the weather, you learn about science, you learn about different people and places.  And, and then it gets in your head that when I grow up, I'm gonna see some of these places.  You know I was enamored with the Fjords of Norway and I went to see them.  You know, it, it's, it's--and since I've been on the board, I've worked with them to improve geographic literacy and particularly to do a program for city schools, urbans.  Not just state programs, but programs for kids in cities.  And they are doing that.  And unfortunately, with this [Washington] D.C. program they were taking some students to California and that's how they were on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.  Yeah, but they were going to see on the water site with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle.
Speaker 1: That's like two years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the program is stronger than ever and one of the strongest city programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause kids need the stuff of dreams, and that's what education can do for you.
Story_ID: 119932
Speaker 1: Now when you were growing up, did you--did music play a big part in your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know you took, you took lessons you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, took piano first.  You know would sing in the choirs and my sister played the piano.  Then we got this--we had our music man, Mr. Pope.  And he came to town and all the kids decided, you know, what you wanted to play and I wasn't too great with the piano.  So I said well maybe I'll take something you don't have to use your fingers much.  So I decided to play trombone.  And was in the marching band, first chair.  And that was a wonderful diversion for us, you know, learning the formations, marching in parades, in band competitions for the state of Florida.  And so when I say that we had full life as children, we really did.  And when I went back to, to do a speech at a community college in Florida and they had the band playing and I saw only about one African American musician in the band, I--you know I asked folks what's going on because even in the, the '50s [1950s] or '40s [1940s], we had 100 piece marching band.  Where are they?  And I, I conclude that folks will have to recruit blacks into bands in southern states where you know now they're integrated, because sometimes they'll feel not wanted.  But goodness knows they have the skills and can, can learn the music easily.  So that's very troubling to me.  Choirs in, in some of the places that are now integrated; you don't see African Americans much.
Story_ID: 119933
Speaker 1: Now did you--what was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah church was a big part of growing up because I, as I look back on it, church was a place where you could practice your leadership skills.  At about eleven or twelve I taught summer bible school.  They would, you know, let you teach or you could teach Sunday School.  But--and they had a lot of activities, you know from morning to night.  It was a Baptist, so it was the Baptist Training Union at night.  So you'd go from Sunday School, pop home for a little food, you know, church service, then back in the, in the evening for evening service.  And during the--they would always have plays and opportunities for you to practice speaking, singing, just a community center.  And some churches are trying to revitalize that, or revive that kind of thing and I think it's tremendously important to the community.  And churches can play a definite role in helping to raise children.
Story_ID: 119934
Speaker 1: Well we were talking about school and now you, you, you met Mary [McLeod] Bethune at school.  She spoke.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you, when you were in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah she would--
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to talk to her?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was, I was young.  My father [Martin Walter Dukes] would talk with her.  And as I indicated, she gave him--he was a, an athlete, football player.  And so while his--after his parents died, he wanted to continue his education.  And he contacted Mrs. Bethune and she gave him a scholarship to go to Daytona Beach to Bethune-Cookman College [now Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And through her relationship with his parents, he could always count on her to, to help out.
Story_ID: 119935
Speaker 1: All right now what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended Washington Park High School in Lakeland, Florida.  And I was saying that my sister always wanted to be a pharmacist, so she applied to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And we didn't have much money.  My dad [Martin Walter Dukes] was director of recreation in Florida.  And the powers that--and Florida wanted the black children to pick strawberries four months, go to school four months, and then do something else agricultural, you know.  Well you know they wanted us to split up our school year based on the agricultural needs of the community.  Well my father led a march on the county seat saying his children couldn't do that and he didn't want any children--and the black community supported him.  They abolished his job.  And so he had to go north to get a job 'cause he couldn't get a job in Florida where we were living anymore.  So when my sister decided she wanted to go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] to study pharmacy and she was admitted, my father was living here working at the general accounting office.  So he said it'll be simpler for the whole family to move than just to bring her up here to go to Howard.  So we moved and I was a senior in high school.  And somehow it was not traumatic for me to, to leave Florida in the last year because they told me that I'd be going to Dunbar High School.  And I'd heard about Dunbar as one of the best high schools in the country.  So I was looking forward to, to the change, even though I would probably would have been the valedictorian in, in Florida, I, I guess reading enough geography I was adventurous enough to--not to for that to depress me, so I came to Dunbar.  And I attended for one year and graduated from Dunbar High School.
Speaker 1: What, what year was that when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And had a good experience there.
Story_ID: 119936
Speaker 1: Now '52 [1952] is I guess the [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower era, things are kind of chilled out a little bit after the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: World War II, after World War II.  Black people are migrating, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, moving.
Speaker 1: Even your family.  For various reasons, people are coming north.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah and at that time, you know they could look to the government for low level jobs and could count on certain benefits that they, they wouldn't have other places.
Speaker 1: GI [Government Issue] benefits too after the war.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my father [Martin Walter Dukes] had too many children to go to war.  At that time if you had too many kids, they didn't take you, you know.
Story_ID: 119937
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did you decide which college to attend?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a teacher and I knew my father [Martin Walter Dukes] couldn't afford both of us at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  So I decided to go to, to D.C. Teachers [Washington D.C. Teachers College].  I heard it was a, a good teachers college and that's what I wanted to be and could save us all this grief and I got part-time jobs and I guess my father paid for my first semester.  Then after that I was able to take care of the rest of it myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you work while you were--
Speaker 2: I worked all the time.  And worked at stuff like, you know, little department stores, retail, worked in restaurants.  You know, even sales jobs were not available to, to black and women, or blacks at that time readily.  So you just took what you could get and save your money and keep going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are there any teachers or mentors at [Washington] D.C. Teachers College that you--that stand out?
Speaker 2: Dr. Whitehead.  Can't remember his first name.  Wonderful education teacher pedagogy, and then Paul Cook who is still alive, Dr. Paul Cook who became president later on, English professor.  But very personable.  And geography teacher, Gertrude Williamson.  She was, she was excellent.  So it was not a disappointment moving from high school geography to, to college geography.  It was still very stimulated--[stimul]ating and excellent.
Story_ID: 119938
Speaker 1: All right so you graduated from [Washington] D.C. Teachers College.
Speaker 2: And couldn't get a job teaching.
Speaker 1: Why, why not?
Speaker 2: 'Cause there were--they had a surplus of too many teachers in social studies especially.  So I kept working and got admitted to Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] graduate school.
Speaker 1: This is 1956?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], yeah.  And paid for my first semester, and then I was working at the printing office from ten at night to six in the morning and going straight to class and sometimes I'd drop off to sleep.  And one of the professors would see me do this a little too often and got a fellowship for me.  At that time professors could identify a person who they thought was deserving, and I never filled out an application or anything.  So I was able to do the master's in one year 'cause you know with a poor family you couldn't keep putting off real serious, you know complete work.  So I was able to do the master's in, in history in a year.  And then went to teach in Baltimore City [Maryland].
Story_ID: 119939
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you know receiving a master's degree, who, who were the teachers at Howard that really sort of--
Speaker 2: [Dr.] Merze Tate and Dr. [Rayford] Logan who wrote 'Caribbean History'.
Speaker 1: This Dr. Rayford Logan?
Speaker 2: Rayford Logan was my mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he and Dr. Tate were the two who helped me get a fellowship.  They were some brilliant people and you didn't play--they weren't friendly, friendly people, but they, they cared about their students.  So I wanted to teach secondary school because you know my experience there.  But Dr. Logan thought I should each at the college level.  So he got a position for me at Albany State College [sic, Albany State University, Albany, Georgia] and he called me and said I was supposed to go down there to teach.  And I said Dr. Logan I don't want to teach at college level.  And he was a little disappointed, but, but that was just--it's just an illustration that they saw themselves, you know, really placing you, taking care of you.  And they actually wanted you to follow in their footsteps.  So you're not a history teacher, you're a historian.  And they would do things like--at least Dr. Logan would have you read your thesis to the class.  And if it was bad stuff, boy you could feel badly.  So you really had to do your best work.  He would give a--he would lecture and expect you to take it verbatim.  And you'd have to occasionally read back something to him.  So that was quite an experience and I learned a lot.  And loved those people at Howard and I guess that's why I'm giving a lot of volunteer time to Howard now.
Story_ID: 119940
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now were--who was some--do you remember Dr. [William Leo] Hansberry?  I mean or, or pro--pro--Professor Hansberry?
Speaker 2: Yes I remember, but I was not in--I was in diplomatic history with [Dr.] Merze Tate and, and [Dr. Rayford] Logan with a history of the negro in, in the United States.  We would do some of the research that went into Logan's book.  But Howard was African American history and I didn't have but a year in the--
Speaker 1: So you didn't have time for electives.
Speaker 2: And I, you know, I would see Professor Hansberry and everybody would be talking about, and Sterling Brown was there too.  And but I, I didn't have the time.  But they were quite interesting figures on the campus.  Everybody knew them.
Speaker 1: [Dr.] E. Franklin Frazier?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was there too.  They had some really distinguished professors during the time--well they still have some but I mean like they had almost everybody was something.  Merze Tate's books were very important and popular, and now there's a Merze Tate lecture.  You know so it--Charles Thompson, he was the dean and so it was a wonderful place to go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now when you--
Speaker 2: I could have stayed forever, I didn't wanna go to work.
Speaker 1: But you only had a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had to get out and help.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119941
Speaker 1: So you were married at this time, by this time?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See I got the bachelor's when I was twenty, when I was twenty-one I got the master's and then I went to work and a couple years after that I married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And married a musician.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he play--
Speaker 2: Jazz.
Speaker 1: Jazz, okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: That should have been interesting to have a jazz musician.
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  You know we'd--I'd go to see him play.  And it was at the time when the jazz groups were traveling around the country and big concerts.  And during the, the Howard and Teachers College years, that was the--really the heyday of Howard's theater.  And we would save our lunch money to go and see everybody from Sarah Vaughn to everybody in the world was coming through, Count Basie and, and so we'd go to the matinees and that was, it was quite a time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one can only imagine now when you see the, the theater boarded up in 2003.  Who knows, in the future it might be open again.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They're talking about trying to renovate it or something, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they've had a couple of goes at renovating, but it was something.  I was--see at that time if you--people in your neighborhood, they knew you were in college or in school and they would expect you to do the right thing and be very serious.  So one time I went to the Howard [Theatre] and a neighbor was there and this guy was kind of disreputable, but he knew where I was supposed to be.  So I applauded some act and he said you paid your money, you shouldn't be applauding.  Crazy guy.  So for a while you know I said I gotta get out of here 'cause he--don't you applaud, you paid your money, you're not supposed to, yeah.  But it was his way of showing his displeasure that I was in there during school day.  See because we would, we would slip over and do a matinee.  But it was a wonderful time to see all the best musicians in the country.  And it didn't cost anything if I could save lunch money to go.  It was, it was very, very exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119942
Speaker 1: Now did, did--now with people, I, guess pe--people were talking about the Civil Rights Movement then, they had to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Hot topic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very.
Speaker 1: On Howard's campus I would guess with Charles Houston being around.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with--and Thurgood Marshall, all of them coming back to the campus.  And [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] would, would come.  And a fascinating thing, you know before he was so popular, you know nationally, he'd come to the campus and the--wherever he would be speaking would, would be just packed.  And they put speakers on the buildings so you would stand outside and hear him.  And of course the, the marches, what was it, McCrory's and Murphy's, the five and dimes and the, you know, desegregating some of the, the stores here and all.  Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] students, we were very much involved.  The, the movement looked upon Howard for the foot soldiers.  And even this city has been looked upon to provide the folks to fill the ranks of those who were really demonstrating.  I remember even when I became an administrator during Vietnam [the Vietnam War], I'd look out and my whole school would be gone, a whole high school marching.  But Howard was a central place, not just for demonstration, but for some of the intellect to really support in the courts the argument against segregation.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, the training ground act--actually for the whole legal push.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's why I was so proud when the Michigan case came up.  You know some people say well why would Howard do a, an amicus brief of that?  Why would they get involved?  They got their law school.  But it's, it's our role to--for choice.  And so you know we were kind of in the forefront of the, you know Supreme Court case with Michigan [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003].  And so we still have the tradition.
Story_ID: 119943
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, you started teaching in Maryland, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, right after you graduated from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, couldn't get a job in [Washington] D.C., still had too many teachers, so I went to Baltimore [Maryland].  And would commute for about three years.  And it was a good experience.  I think I learned how to--had more support in really learning how to teach in Baltimore than I would have had here.  But then I came back here and taught in a junior high school.  And always curious about, you know, how can you run a school so that it works for children rather than against them.  And decided that I wanted to become an administrator.  So I studied counseling and then I did one of those TRIO Programs for the Office of Ed. [Education] College Board was the fiscal officer, interested in transition from high school to college.  'Cause I still believed that upward mobility requires a good education, and that anybody can, can move from where they are if they are educated.  And so I wanted kids to love school like I did, and to get the best from their teachers like I did.  I, I have very few teachers that I can say were really bad teachers.  I, I can't even--well maybe I was so determined, I didn't even pay them any attention, but I don't, I, I can't say I had a bad teacher, I can't say I had a bad job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I'm not quite a Pollyanna, but--
Story_ID: 119944
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the, the problems with the--when you started teaching, what were some of the problems that you noticed that didn't--I mean some things that you saw that didn't quite match up with what you'd been taught?
Speaker 2: When I started, I worked with people who didn't mind my observing them teaching and they would come and critique me.  So it was that kind of give and take and where generally people who cared about children.  Then later on I did work with some folks who--I was working in a school where public housing children made up the major part of the school population.  And I didn't think that some of the folks cared as much about educating the poor kids as they did those who came from better, more affluent homes.  And that bothered because I think the best teachers should teach the poor kids.  And if you're affluent and you understand, and your parents have already got you ready to learn, you don't need as much skill as the others.  So that bothered me and then sometimes I would see that poor parents weren't treated as well or respected when they would come to school to inquire about their kids, or were not expected to participate.  And I think that all parents have to participate and be encouraged to participate.  And kids need all kinds of experiences.  They need to see things, to study.  And I, I must admit that some of my geography students I saw later on in life and they would tell me the places they had visited after because they learned about them in our classes.  And that did make me feel good.  It's nothing more exciting than teaching when you see kids who say that and, and these--were sending their children like to Africa or exchange programs.  But then nothing more exciting than to see kids who follow in your footsteps and become teachers.  If you're doing it right, you're gonna get somebody who wants to do it too.  And so I've had a, a number of students who became teachers and became counselors and they said that working with me they wanted to do the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, that to me was the highest compliment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In terms of some of the problems in education as a--I mean now you, you taught for, for several years and then you went into administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how, how many years did you teach?
Speaker 2: Probably about eight.
Speaker 1: About eight years, okay.  Right as a schoolteacher, I mean did you--and I mean and I'm talking about with the poorest kids too, did you have pro--problems with discipline and violence in the schools?
Speaker 2: Not too much.
Speaker 1: There's a, you know, a big violence in the schools problem now.
Speaker 2: I think if you respect the children and you expect them to respect you, it goes a long way.  And I would say I'm responsible for teaching, you're responsible for discipline.  If you can't keep it quiet, then I can't do my job.  You know we both have jobs to do.  And so I never had--and they were rough.  One time I got my back window of my car broken out.  I said you know, naive, young.  I said how'd they break out the window out of the car and they know I like them, and I know they like me.  You know but that didn't have anything to do with it.  You know sometimes the anger and frustration of, of poverty, you know leads folks to do stuff.  But I just was shocked.  I said we get along.
Speaker 1: Was it parked in the parking lot, or--
Speaker 2: It was on the street.  I don't know who did it.  But you're young and naive and--
Speaker 1: It might not have been a student.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  But I didn't change my behavior toward them.  It's just--it, it happens and you gotta keep going.
Story_ID: 119945
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you were teaching when--in '63 [1963] when I, I guess the March on Washington came to [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you participate in it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and well went mostly with family then and you know, students were all everywhere.  And I was here with the, you know the, the poor.  When, when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] put that poor--the village down there and now that caused--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that was--yeah, just before he died they started that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that caused more concern probably than he--you know the March on Washington was accepted.  But the--
Speaker 1: Yeah that was really a, a shock.  March on Washington was called by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the Poor People's Campaign was something that I know J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was upset about it.
Speaker 2: It was a little difficult, yeah, yeah trying to explain it.  You know we here often were called upon to explain why they doing this, what, you know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Resurrection City he said was here in D.C.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right here.
Speaker 2: Everything right here.  And you go down and you know, the church would take, you know food and provisions and things.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember where you were when Dr. King was killed?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think I was in the, the library in the school.  I can see the library.  There's certain things in life you can just actually see where you were.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Couldn't believe it.  Then there were riots here.  And I had the--I was doing the TRiO Programs, you know, getting kids into college and getting them financial aid.  And our office was right down near U Street.  And the National Guard was everywhere, but we still opened, you know, we had no problems.  I had a coworker, I think he was Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] graduate, he couldn't understand why our people would riot.  Breaking up their stores and things.  I'll never forgot that.  I never quite felt the same about him after that.  That he couldn't understand why people would riot.
Story_ID: 119946
Speaker 1: Well we're talking about the riots after [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], Resurrection City [Poor People's Campaign] down here in the heart of Washington [D.C.] and you were talking about the burden that it places on pe--pe--people in D.C. to constantly explain the national situation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and to put up folks who were coming in for marches and they wanna stay in your school gyms, they want all your churches have got to provide.  And frankly Washington has not gotten credit for its ability to work with all of these forces, and particularly, forces trying to, to make sure that civil rights is reality for everybody.  I never thought of that before.  But we really have been in the forefront of so much of it that making it happen, you know the base.
Speaker 1: Right now I, I remember the Million Man March.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the--all the work that Bob Brown did hear and other people, you know, to, to gather.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and to make sure that the--the city is ready and it treats folks right.  And frankly I think we've got a, a good police chief who understands--
Speaker 1: Present day, Charles Ramsey from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Okay.
Story_ID: 119947
Speaker 1: Well tell, tell me about your career as a school administrator.  Now you, you went back to school at a certain point.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Well you started administrating before you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I was teaching and heard about TRIO Program looking for a director and I was already a counselor at a high school, getting kids into college and getting financial aid, so I did that for a while.  Then I decided that maybe after about three years of that, my place--I could better serve by being in school systems, so I came back to the school system, applied for a job as a, an exec in the secondary school office.  Had never been a principal, but got the job supervising principals.  Stayed in that for maybe a year, turned over to superintendent, I became an Executive Assistant to the new superintendent who was Hugh Scott from Detroit [Michigan].  And Hugh had a, a kind of--it was a rocky time with the board and, and he decided to make me a deputy superintendent.  I was about thirty-three then.  And I accepted.  Then Hugh decided that he was tired of the battles with the board and accepted a position at Hunter College [New York City, New York], and recommended me to be acting superintendent, about thirty-three, thirty-four.  And I accepted and I was a ninety day wonder.  I managed the school district, opened schools and all.  And they were doing a superintendent search.  And [HM] Marion Barry had--was president of the school board.  So Marion said, "Flo, why don't you compete for superintendent?  You're doing a good job."  I said you guys will eat me up and spit me out in the little time.  I said I don't have enough experience, you know, I didn't have enough grounding.  I didn't think I was ready, so I refused to be considered.  And then Barbara Sizemore was selected, and I became her deputy superintendent because I knew the system and generally could get things done.  And one thing, an op--I was an operations type.  You know getting things done, getting books and you know people, and so I still didn't feel that I had enough experience to be at the level that I'd managed to, to get to.  So folks in Montgomery County had been talking to me about coming over there.  And so they were--every position they would have, they'd call and say you interested in this?  And finally they offered me a, a regional superintendent's job, assistant superintendent.  So I took my career from a deputy superintendent, number two, to about number three job over in Montgomery County [Maryland] 'cause I did hear that one of the board members had said that you--that we wouldn't have these positions, African Americans, if we weren't working in a blue, a black system.  So I said I don't believe that's true; I think I'm pretty good.  And if I'm--you know I've got to go and test it.  And if I'm not good, you know, I'm just not good.  But I need to go and find out if I am.  So I accepted the job in Montgomery County.  And served very successfully running schools there.  So much so until it was a superintendent of Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--his name--Hornbeck, invited me to the state to be the number three person at the Maryland State Department of Ed. [education]. So I did that.  But then I looked outside and I said I have no constituency at the state, and you use to knowing who you work for and the folks, if they didn't like what you're doing, they let you know.  But I didn't have a, you know it didn't have that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 119948
Speaker 1: So Montgomery County [Maryland] asked me to come back in the number two position there with a guy by the name of Charlie Bernardo as superintendent, so I came back.  And had success in that role.  Then Charlie Bernardo and the board didn't get along.  Then I'd met--who was then commissioner of education died but I knew some folks who knew the commissioner.  So he invited me to be the first black and woman commissioner, deputy commissioner of education, Ernie Boyer.  So I'm still curious about how all these systems fit together, local systems, state systems, urban systems, suburban systems.  And if I could work at the federal level, then I would have had the opportunity to see and to work at every level.  So I left Montgomery County and went to the federal government.  But still in my heart of hearts, I wanted to come back to the city 'cause I love cities.  And I like working for folks who if it weren't for public education, they wouldn't make it.  So some of the folks wanted me to stay with Montgomery County.  In fact the guy who they made superintendent said I'll be your deputy if you stay.  I say well somebody's gonna kick my butt.  I'd rather for it to be my people.  So, so when the position of superintendent opened and I was appointed under Carter.  I never expected him not to be re-elected.  Well he wasn't re-elected, so I needed a job, so I applied for [Washington] D.C. and got it.  And you know some people say you can never go home again, but I came home.  And I had a wonderful seven year tenure.  In fact I just got tired.  I had at least two more years on the contract.  But we did some things in working with schools, working with the community, that were replicated by other districts and I think I enjoyed working in D.C. as superintendent more than I enjoyed anything else.  But everything has to come to an end, and here I am. About fifty-three, and I believe that you have to know when to go.
Story_ID: 119949
Speaker 1: So the system was doing well.  People said well why are you going?  I said some of the problems that I thought I'd solved are coming back.  And I think you need somebody fresh to try to make a go at it.  And then a major law firm here had an educational litigation section, said, "Flo if you want to run your own consulting firm, we'll back you with it and you can support our efforts in litigation."  So I said hey, 'bout time I try running something, a business on my own because I always thought--you know educators think that they can only teach or only do education type stuff.  But I think skills are transferrable.  And I'd been working with the private sector on a couple of corporate boards, so I said I'll try that.  And so I decided in '88 [1988] that I would set up the consulting firm and the law firm supported, funded, you know funded it.  And I of course had part ownership.  And so we were doing good.  But the American Bar Association [ABA] said law firms, you guys cannot have consulting firms, it's not ethical.  And they had made me a partner in the law firm.  And so they said you gotta, you know, get rid of this consulting firm.  So I said well fine.  So we worked out a separation agreement that really worked in my favor.  And that I was in their very plush quarters, so I moved down here and we've been here and I think we do quality work.  We do a lot of what we want to do in education.  Sometimes we don't make any money because we take some of those projects that--where they think you're, you know, you do charity work, but hey that's, that's the way we are.  So while we've--don't make a lot of money, we've managed to stay open for sixteen years and it's still very exciting work.  It's very different.  No project is the same; we work for EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, helping them with curriculum on--for skin cancer.  We work with organ donors to try to get people who treat--teach driver's ed., to get kids to sign or people to sign their organs over.  We work for the National Science Foundation in trying to improve achievement in math and science.  So it's just a wide range of things.  One time we were training superintendents, trying to make sure that women and minorities got more leadership.  So it's been quite a, a, an opportunity for a little girl from Florida started out very, very poor.  I'm not affluent now, but to really get some wonderful experiences and work with some exciting people.
Story_ID: 119950
Speaker 1: Now what--as a school administrator, what, what would you, with all the experience that you've had, can you kind of summarize, what, what would make a--what, what makes a urban school system work, actually work for the, the people in our poorest communities?
Speaker 2: I, I tell you one of the things thing I think you gotta do.  Have the ability to build a team.  Pick very capable people, even people who are smarter than you are, so that--
Speaker 1: That's hard for most people to accept.
Speaker 2: No but you, you know if you, you've got confidence, you can get pe--very smart people to work with and for you.  And then do very careful planning and monitor you plan.  Don't just do a plan, put it on a shelf.  And then talk about, but share with your community what you're trying to do.  If you didn't achieve it, tell them, and tell them what you're gonna do now that you didn't get where you thought you were gonna be.  If we didn't achieve everything we wanted to in reading, what we're gonna do different in order to try to get there?  And get everybody to participate.  When it's time for the budget, your principals have gotta be able to talk about the budget to their communities.  Your principals have to have viable PTA's (Parent/Teacher Associations) and evaluate them on that.  I don't care what kind of community it is.  Every school has to have a volunteer program.  They can come from the private sector, they can come from the community, but you gotta have people who are helping you, showing the kids that the adults care about their education.  So there are a lot of components.  Then you've got to develop a good public information system.  So that you tell your own story, not waiting just for the newspapers and the TV to tell it.  So it's a lot that goes into it, but it can be done.  Some people speak of the years that we were in [Washington] D.C. as Camelot 'cause we had a love affair going with the city and they had one with us, but you know you can't keep it going forever.  You hope that somebody else can, can keep it.  But--
Story_ID: 119951
Speaker 1: I guess one thing I learned is that, you know, with some of the jobs I can be kind of laid back and cool.  But when you work in a city, you let 'em know this is your heart, this is, I mean you want, you know this has to happen.  And one time I, I did--I was getting tired and I got reckless.  I was--I thought the city was giving me a budget I thought was inadequate to do the kind of job they wanted me to do.  So we had--we were so well organized until the community came and blocked up Pennsylvania Avenue.  My board didn't really know that, you know they would do it, but they had to come along.  And then I realized I was a little out of control if--but they expected me to really go to the wall for it and I went to the wall but I should have brought folks with me before letting something like that happen.  But--
Speaker 2: So you gotta stay in touch with the community.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and with your board.  No matter--you respect your board, your board respects you.  You don't put them out in a situation where they're, they're not altogether ready, like you're out of control.  And I didn't like that in myself so I knew my time was about up when the--well we got the budget we wanted, but that, that still didn't say it.  You've got to be under--you've got to understand all the dynamics of the situation and no matter--well and you get tired sometime and you, you don't process it all like you should.
Speaker 2: It's a big job, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A lot of responsibility.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's an important job to provide leadership in education in an urban school district.
Story_ID: 119952
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me at this juncture when you look back on, on, what you've done as a consultant, as a, as a, a, a superintendent and as a teacher, what, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is mentoring others in leadership roles.  I'm still working with younger administrators.  They still call to get advice on how to handle different things.  I work with the Harvard Urban Superintendents Program.  I work with Danforth Superintendents Forum and I think in some ways I model the behavior of an effective superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I think I also model the fact that you've got to keep learning.  I don't know everything about anything.  I've got to keep learning.
Story_ID: 119953
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community to--today?
Speaker 2: My hope for the black community is that the, the community can again believe in education as the true vehicle for upward mobility, and for self, and for development, personal development.  And will use it, believe in it, get their kids to really try to achieve and excel.
Story_ID: 119954
Speaker 1: And one last question is--this is slightly different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That I did the best I could.
Speaker 1: Back to the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'll tell you why that's meaningful.  My father [Martin Walter Dukes] never complimented me on anything and I always got good grades and passed tests and, and he said to me "Flo, none of that matters if you cannot tell yourself that you did your very best, then it's not worth anything."  So I've always gotta be able to say I did the best I could and believe it and be honest about it.  And that's all you have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you ma'am.
