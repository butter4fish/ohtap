 Kite  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  It is May 31, 2001. We   re at the Cimarron Heritage Center in Boise City,  Oklahoma talking with more ladies and a gentleman about the dust bowl.  We   ll start and let each of you state your maiden name and your married  name, when you were born, and where you were born. After we   ve done all of  the introductions, then we   ll start with questions. We   ll let you start first.  I   m Ina K. Labrier, from Kenton, Oklahoma. My maiden name was Ina  Katharine Roberts, and I was born at Wiley, Colorado, just ten miles out of  Lamar. I lived there until I was twenty-five years old. I married Ross Labrier.  We first moved into New Mexico just over the state line, and then we moved  to Kenton, and we   ve been there for about fifty-five years.  When were you born?  August 29, 1912.  Okay, number two.  I   m Marcia Rice, and I was originally Marcia Foreman. I was born May 6,  1917, south of Wheeless four miles, and I live five miles south now. We  bought land adjoining my parents   , so I   ve always lived there, except for a few  years that I was away at school, and when I first married, I lived at Kenton for  two years and at Folsom, New Mexico one year, and I married Lee Rice. He  was a Wheeless boy also.  All right, and one more.  I was Dorothy Settles, born at Texhoma, October 23, 1916. I lived there until  May of 1937.  And then in thirty-seven, where did you move?  I went to Missouri, but I came back here in 1940.  And finally, we   ll have you introduce yourself too.  5  L. Jacobs  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Rice  Kite  Rice  D. Jacobs  Rice  Well, I   m Lloyd Jacobs. I was born in Southeastern Kansas, August 7, 1911. I  came out here with my folks, and I was three and a half years old in 1914. I   ve  been here most of that time since then. I left in    35, during the dirty thirties,  because I couldn   t make a living.  We   ll come back and ask you to tell us more about that in a little bit.  All right.  Well, we usually start with, what was a typical day like when you were  growing up? Would you consider where you lived to be city life or country  life? We   ll just kind of go from there.  Well, I was typical country. I was raised on a farm and went to school for all  twelve years or more of school. Then I went college. I went to Colorado  Aggies it was called then, Colorado State now. I only went one year, because  you could teach after you had one year, and it was depression times. I started  teaching in    31. I taught until    38.  Where did you teach?  Just little country schools.  Here or in Colorado?  Out there in Colorado, just schools right around home. I always stayed home.  How about you guys?  Well, I   m a typical farm girl. I always lived on the farm, and we   ve always  farmed and ranched. Then I went to Goodwell to PAMC to college. The first  year, I wasn   t old enough to get a certificate, so I went the second year and by  that time, you had to have two winters and a summer, then I got my teaching  certificate. I taught my first school out here at Hurley. I taught there two  years. In the mean time, I married Lee Rice, and we lived at Kenton. He  worked for the Whittenburg Ranch, so then we went to Folsom, or he did. I  went back to school and finished. Then we came back out here, and I taught at  Mineral School, which is one of the original schools. Then we moved to the  Felt community, and I taught over there for two years, and then I stayed home.  A lot of moving around.  Well, a little, not very far away though.  You know, I   m glad to hear you say that, because that   s something interesting.  My mother and dad lived in the east part of the county, and mother taught at  Mineral too. You were probably about that high.  A long time before I did.  6  Kite  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Kite  How long was that school in existence?  I don   t know.  Well, it stopped soon after I married, because George Skelly   s children went  there, and I think it was probably in    40 when it stopped, or something like  that. I couldn   t say exactly. They had a little store and a school there when we  married. I remember that, because George Skelly was my husband   s cousin,  and we   d go over there once in a while. They had a school about that time. I  can   t tell you when it quit, but I do know about that.  Well, I think it just went about two years after I was there.  How long was that?  Let   s see, I have to stop and count up  laughing .  Well, would that be about right?  Yeah.  It might have been even    38, after we were married, but I know it wasn   t very  long.  Mrs. Jacobs, tell us about the house where you lived.  Oh, I lived in a lot of them  laughing . My dad went from the city clerk, who  had to dig the pipelines to lay water mains and stuff like that, to the manager  of the utilities company, and we moved all over Texhoma. We went to school  at the one school. There is Texhoma, Texas, and the cemetery   s in Texas.  There was a grade school in Texas, but all of the high school came over to  Oklahoma. That   s about it, as far as going to school is concerned.  Do you remember how many kids you went to school with, how many were in  your class?  There were 28 in one class, and I don   t remember how many there were. The  class that I should have graduated with just went crazy.  What do you mean?  They got held back. They had to take their senior year over again, and they  graduated with my younger sister. I didn   t get to keep up with them.  Did you go crazy too?  Yeah.  What did you do that was so crazy?  7  D. Jacobs  Kite  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Rice  Labrier  Rice  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Rice  Well, the war had started, and the boys thought they were going to be drafted,  and they rebelled. They rebelled about everything, and they just goofed off, so  in order to get a high school education, they had to take their senior year over.  That   s weird.  That   s an original story. I haven   t heard that one before  laughter . So what  was it like going to these little country schools? And then what was it like  teaching in them?  Well I thoroughly enjoyed it. You felt at home with the parents and the  children. They were all well behaved. It was wonderful, but the main story I  wanted to tell you was when the dust blew. I parked my car on the south side  of the Wood   s home. I lived in a little well house. That was the teacherage. I  parked my car on the south side of the house. We had a windstorm in March  for three days and nights. When the wind let up, Mr. Wood came and dug the  sand away from my door so I could get out, and he said,    You   d better come  over and look at your car,    so I went over, and we looked out the window, and  there was a spot about the size of a basketball. It was all you could see of the  car. It was just that corner on the top. It was just completely covered. Some  of the men had to come dig it out. Anyway, it didn   t bother the car though.  The men said that it started and ran fine. They said,    Maybe when you get to  town you ought to have the oil changed,    but we never could tell there was a  thing wrong with it. It was fine.  Did all of that dirt and sand damage the outside of it?  Not particularly. It just whipped around it and just piled up. That   s the way it  would do. It would just whirl and keep piling the sand up.  Is that the first dust storm you remember?  Oh no.  What was the first one that you remember, what was that like?  Well, the black duster we talked about was the first black duster. Let   s see,  that was in 1935. We had a lot after that. Of course, it was dry, and we   d have  dust storms, but now what we call the black dusters.  They   d roll in, just like a big, old cloud.  They just rolled. It would be calm, and this would just roll in.  Has nobody brought you a picture?  We   ve seen the ones that they have in the museum here of the Black Sunday.  Well, it would just roll. It was just rolling. Then it would come over, and  8  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Rice  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Lemons  everything would just get totally black, dark. You couldn   t see anything.  Some people say that they were scared when they saw these and other people  said that they weren   t. What about you? What was your impression of this  Black Sunday?  I was scared.  I can   t imagine how you wouldn   t be.  Well, it was an interesting thing. It was calm. It just rolled in. You just  wondered what was happening, but a lady that lived on the ranch below us said  she just knew the world was coming to the end  laughing .  There are several that I   ve heard say that.  How about you? What did you think?  Well, I didn   t live down in this area at that time. I lived at Lamar. It rolled in,  and I remember the worst part to me, it seemed like, I was teaching at the time,  and it seemed like the night after we   d get out of school, here would be one of  those dusters blowing in, and you couldn   t see. I had a place that I stayed in  just in case of those storms. We only lived five or six miles from the school.  That sounds foolish, but we couldn   t make that five or six miles in a car. I   d  stick my head out and drive with my head sticking out the window. You  couldn   t hardly see the bar pits. You couldn   t hardly tell whether you were  going or coming. The lights didn   t penetrate through it.  So you had a place in the middle kind of set up that you could stay in?  I had a house where I could stay in case of a storm of some sort or something  like that. I   d stay at certain people   s houses, and I   d pay them to stay with  them for a night or two. Lots of times, I couldn   t get home that five or six  miles, because it would just be so bad. You just couldn   t see to drive. Isn   t  that right Marcia?  Oh no, you couldn   t.  You couldn   t see inside the house.  That   s right, unless you had a good light. We didn   t have electricity then.  Well we did, because we lived in town. It was just a cord hanging down with  a light bulb on the end of it, but you couldn   t see that light bulb most of the  time.  So what would you do whenever you saw this storm coming? What would be  the procedure? What do you do when you have a dust storm coming?  9  D. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  Rice  Kite  Labrier  Rice  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Rice  D. Jacobs  Rice  L. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  Well, we started getting sheets and blankets wet and hanging them up over the  windows and doors and prayed. Believe me, lots of us did. This big storm  they   re talking about, we got caught at the church. We had to hurry to get  home.  But if you had some chickens or a few animals, you   d try to get them inside, or  they would blow away. You   d want to get in; definitely everybody would get  in. A few of the men would be out sometimes, and usually they would go to a  fence and follow the fence line, just holding the fence to get back home. But  we also did that in snowstorms  laughing .  Yes, it helped both ways.  Did the chickens behave any differently before you could see or before the  winds started to pick up?  I don   t recall that they did anything particular.  No warnings from animals that the storms were on their way or anything?  Not unless it   d be a horse kicking. You know, horses want to kick if they hear  a storm coming. I don   t remember any, do you?  No, not in particular.  Well okay, after the dust storm is over, and the winds start to calm down, what  happens next? What do you have to do to clean it up? I can   t imagine that  you could.  It   s awful because you have all those big sheets and blankets and stuff that you  have to wash.  Well, the dust was so fine that it wasn   t like sand. It was just dust. If you   d  sweep, you would really stir that up again, but you had to get it out of your  house. It was all over everything.  Shovels were not unusual, were they?  No, absolutely not.  Nobody had sweepers; there was no electricity to run it.  And most of the houses were not that tight. We used ceiling tape and taped all  of the windows and doors, everything to try to keep the dust out as best we  could. It was pretty bad.  Everybody did that, I think. I don   t remember us having this trouble, but I   ve  heard people talk about in the ceilings, the dirt got so heavy in the attics that  they   d have to go in there and clean them out or the ceiling would fall through,  10  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Rice  but we didn   t have that problem. I lived in a rock house as I grew up. It   s not  the kind of a rock house I have now, but it was a good rock house. I don   t  think we had it quite as bad as some of the people that were in     Frame houses?  Yes, frame houses and such.  The dust couldn   t get through that rock.  No, and I think it might have been that the roof was right next to the rock, and  it kind of kept it out, I believe a little bit.  How many rooms were in that house?  We had a kitchen and a dining room and a big, long living room, and two  bedrooms on the other side. Of course, we didn   t have a bath. Later on, they  put a bath in the west end of the kitchen.  How many people were living there?  Oh, my grandparents, my parents, and I, five of us.  Are you an only child?  I was an only child. I said I wouldn   t raise one, but I did  laughter . You  never say you won   t do something, that you don   t do it.  Yeah, I know  laughing .  But we lost our first baby, and they told us we   d never have one, so we felt  blessed that we had her.  Only children are unusual out in this area of the country, it seems like.  Is that right?  It seems like it.  We don   t run into very many.  The people we talk to, not very many are only children. Were you an only  child?  I was the only daughter, but I had three brothers.  And what is your birth order? Were you the oldest, youngest?  I was the second, and then I had two brothers younger than me. Talking about  11  Lemons  Rice  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  L. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  Kite  L. Jacobs  chickens and things, we had such a hard time raising anything. It was dry, but  one summer we had some chickens, and that was before we had pressure  cookers, but we finally got a pressure cookers in the county, and you could get  it from the extension office for twenty-four hours. Mother and I canned  chickens. We got that pressure cooker one day, and my dad, my uncle, and my  mother and I really worked on those chickens. We stayed up all night canning  chickens, but that sure was good next winter  laughter .  What other kinds of foods did you can?  You preserved your pork by putting it down in a salt cure. You   d put it in big  barrels, and you could fry your sausage down and cover it with lard. You   d  dig that out next winter, and it was nice and fresh.  Provided you cooked it long enough.  Yes, you have to cook it long enough. You couldn   t let it be half-cooked.  My sister was going to show me how to do it; I don   t remember how many  quarts she put up. You just put them down in the cellar and leave them, and  when you want them next winter, you go get them. There wasn   t a one of  them that kept. You can imagine what that smelled like.  She didn   t cook it long enough?  That   s right.  So she was putting kind of raw pork down in there.  Yeah, covering it with grease.  Lard.  In the winter, when you had beef, usually we   d share with the neighbors, and  we   d take like a quarter each. We hung ours on the windmill tower, and it  would freeze. You know at night, keep it, and then we   d take it down and  slice it off and cook it. It had to stay frozen. You couldn   t have it except in  the wintertime. That   s the reason we   d share with neighbors, a part of the beef  at a time.  You   d wrap it under a tarp. Wrap it and put it down where it was cool on the  cement floor during the daytime and hang it out at night.  A lot of people think that winters have gotten a little milder over the years.  They couldn   t hang that beef from the windmill nowadays. I   m not sure if  that   s good or bad.  But we did then. We hung ours on the north side of the house.  12  Kite  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Rice  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Rice  L. Jacobs  Rice  If you didn   t hang it up high enough, would coyotes get it or hungry neighbors   laughter ?  Cats and dogs.  We just had a pulley and pulled it up and hung it up.  So what was the best food? What was the best thing to eat?  Beans. That was the only thing that was plentiful.  We   ve noticed this phenomenon that something like beans or corn mush or  something you had to eat all the time, the people who ate it during the  Depression either they really like it now or they completely hate it now. So  with beans, which way did you go?  It   s fine with me.  I love them, and cornbread. And if you raised cabbage, you made kraut and  put it in the jar. You   d mash it as you put it down in the crock jar, put salt on  it, and add some more.  What about you? What was your favorite thing to eat?  Well I believe beef was a favorite for me. My folks raised lots of chickens  when I was a little girl. My mother raised hundreds of chickens, and we sold  them, sold eggs. That was part of our living. I still prefer beef.  Too many chickens, huh?  Well, I   m a rancher. I should expect to like meat.  You   re the original    where   s the beef    lady.    Where   s the beef?     It   s hard for me to cook; well I can   t cook without meat. I can cook if you   ll  give me some meat. I just can   t cook without it  laughter . But we cooked lots  of beans too. I cooked lots of beans. In fact, lots of times I buy them by the  hundred pound sacks. I cook a lot of beans.  And we had sorghum molasses. If we had any rain at all, we could raise a  little bit of cane, and we had a neighbor, they had this mill. You   d run the  stalks through this     Squeezer, rollers. It   d squeeze it out.  Rollers, and it   d squeeze the juice out. And this lady then cooked it. She  knew exactly; she   d just lay a little wood in at a time, and just cooked it slowly  and kept skimming. She had the nicest sorghum molasses, golden colored.  That with your beans and cornbread and once in a while some kraut   13  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Rice  L. Jacobs  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Kite  Rice  Kite  Rice  Hot biscuits.  And hot biscuits.  Almost every morning at our house, we had to have hot biscuits.  And we used to bring them, if you had corn; you could bring the corn into  Ralstons' here. They had a mill, and ground your corn.  Made cornmeal.  So what were your daily chores?  Trying to exist  laughing . Well usually, you   d clean out the dust every  morning. If you had some animals, take care of those. I   m doing all of the  talking I think, don   t you?   Well actually, I was going to ask you Mrs. Jacobs, you mentioned pulling the  blankets down and you had to wash them. What was the procedure for that?  Out on the washboard?  On the washboard, and wring them by hand, and drag them out and put them  across the line, and hope it didn   t blow before they got dry.  A never-ending task.  I guess we were fortunate. My mother had an old kerosene engine on a  washing machine. As long as I can remember.  Oh, sure enough? Well good deal.  Yes, way back there, years and years ago. I   ve heard Ross   s aunt tell how  when they were youngsters they lived up north of where I live right now, the  old Dacey house, where the Dacey family was raised. They told Aunt Millie  Scelley how they would go to the creek and they cut a tree down so the kids  could walk across to go to school. They   d get out on that tree, and they   d  reach down in the water and wash their clothes and then hang them to dry. I  didn   t experience that, but that was Ross   s family that did that.  That   s the crudest washing machine   We finally got one that you could shake it, with a handle on it and shake it  back and forth.  Did those work, the handle shaking ones?  They did pretty good, uh-huh. Then you   d take it out and let it set in a tub. As  Dorothy said, then you hang it on a line.  14  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Didn   t Fite Combs have one of those in that? I wonder what happened to that  bunch of stuff he had.  Well I remember our first washing machine looked like a barrel. It was made  out of these wooden barrels that we used to have, and it had a little engine  under it. I don   t know how it worked inside. I don   t even remember. I know  Daddy would go out there and crank that washing machine up, and Mother  would wash on it and run a hose through into a tub and rinse them and hang  them out. I was real small, so that   s been many a year ago.  It wasn   t a Maytag   I don   t know, it might have been Maytag brand. I can   t tell you.  Everybody has Maytag washers.  But I couldn   t tell you. We had Maytag   s afterward, but that old washer, I  don   t know.  It almost sounds like a homemade contraption.  But it wasn   t. We bought it. I remember that, because mother was real proud  of that washing machine.  We   re living in Lloyd   s parents    house, and you walk across the floor, and the  dust filters.  Still, huh?  You can dust this morning, and you need to dust at noon, and you dust at noon,  you need to dust that evening.  Even today?  Right, right.  Does that remind you of the dirty thirties?  Indeed it does   You feel all nostalgic, and you want to go back there.  Oh no.  Look at that.  Observing a painting   We took children, us older ones, took at least two kids, one on either side,  home from school that way.  15  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Kite  D.

I have my foot against the  curb, even if it happens to be a ditch. That   s the way we got home from  school.  Just a way to find your way along, huh?  You had to. You couldn   t see. There was no pavement anywhere.  Wow, when did you make this?  Oh, I did that after Lloyd, not very long ago, maybe twenty years.  Have you made other paintings?  Uh-huh.  All about the dust bowl?  No.  Just various things?  Just that one.  Did you have feed sack dresses?  Yes, and underwear.  I showed that to some of the people over at Texhoma that were not in my class  at school, and they said,    I remember that.     It brings back memories. That   s pretty dusty looking.  Yeah it is.  Did you guys ever do any artwork about the dust storms?  I do artwork, but not that  You   d rather forget that.  I did embroidery work, but that was as much art as I ever did. I wasn   t an  artist.  You mentioned feed sack dresses. Did you make a feed sack dress, or did your  mom make them for you?  16  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  My mother made them for us when we were growing up, and our underwear.  My mother would go to buy feed for those chickens, mother always had a big  bunch of chickens, she was very careful to pick her sacks that she could use for  dresses and underwear and everything else. I think we all wore them.  Everybody wore them.  Some of the people ripped the up and washed them and put them out so that  people like us could buy them.  I was going to say, or we would exchange, until we got those to match. They  were quite attractive when you got a little braid or something to put on them.  Two or three sacks you   d get. They were big sacks, you know, a yard square,  but you had to have about three of them alike to make a dress. So when we   d  buy feed, we always tried to get about three alike.  Do you remember a favorite one, a favorite pattern of a dress that you had?  I was just so glad one time when mother went to a teachers    meeting in  Oklahoma City, and when she came home, she brought a dress for Marion and  I. It was store bought. She didn   t make it. Oh, we were proud of those things.  What did it look like?  Straight up and down with buttons down the front.  I think the proudest I ever was was a suit that my mother made out of my  brother   s old suit. He   d worn the elbows out, and she ripped this all up and  washed it and pressed it good and made me a suit. I was in college. She sent  this when we were having homecoming. I was so proud of that. It was so  neat. It lasted a long time. She was a good seamstress. She could make all  those things.  I think everybody was a seamstress at that time. They had to, or they wouldn   t  have any clothes.  You mentioned homecoming at college, what kinds of things were you doing  for entertainment? What was fun?  Mostly, you were busy working. I had to work to go to college. I worked in  the laundry to get money to go.  What about you?  I went to hospital work. First as a medical technician, then as a nurse, and  then as a nursing home administrator, and then I retired.  What about when you were smaller and living in the area? What would you  do for fun times if you had an extra minute or two to spare?  17  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Rice  Kite  Rice  Kite  L. Jacobs  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Or if the neighbor children came over, what would you do?  Play games.  What kind of games? Do you remember?  Oh, Drop the Handkerchief and Tug of War. I was trying to think last night of  some of the games, and I couldn   t think of them. Hopscotch and jump the  rope. I couldn't think of course, we always had some card games to play in the  house too.  Yeah, do you remember the card games that you   d play?  Oh, no, I can   t tell you.  Old Maid.  Yes, Old Maid, and dominoes.  Rook.  We   ve always had dominoes and Rook. I don   t remember any other, but those  were some of the games that we played.  Talking about neighbors, we lived a long way from a neighbor. We didn   t  have close neighbors, so it was just totally our family.  Was it special to get together with your neighbors?  Oh yes. We   d usually try to go to church on Sunday, and then most of the  time we   d all go to one place on one Sunday and another neighbors on another  Sunday. You   d have a good time together.  How does that sound from a guy   s perspective? Did you have different things  to do for fun, or was that very similar?  There was nothing much. We   d only go to church on Sunday, like Marcia  said. If there was work, we worked, day and day. Of course, we had a lot of  chores to do, cows to milk.  What kind of farm equipment did you use?  Horses, mules. That   s what I   d start with. Of course, I graduated up, and my  dad bought a tractor in 1932 or    33.  That was your first tractor?  Uh-huh.  18  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Rice  L. Jacobs  Lemons  Labrier  Do you remember what kind it was?  A caterpillar, a Fifteen-Cat. Dad put me on it. The man showed me how to  drive it. Dad said,    Take it home,    and I did, and I   d never been on it before.  I   m trying to figure out how old you would have been. 21, something like that.  Yeah.  Were you sad to see the horses and mules go?  Well, we kept most of them for a long time after that, because we used them to  cultivate with. We didn   t buy any equipment to cultivate with. We still had  our horse-drawn cultivators. When he bought that tractor, he bought what they  called a one-way, a nine-foot one-way, and then we plowed the ground with  that, but we still used our teams to plant and cultivate with.  One-way? Does that mean that it just turns the ground one way; it   s not a  double?  Yeah, just one way. One-way, that just means that it throws the dirt one way.  That   s the way we did that for a number of years.  Was that a big step? Were a lot of people getting tractors at that time? Were  you one of the first or the last?  Well, that was a big step. A few of them in spots began to raise a little bit of  grain, feed, and stuff. In this area and out where we lived, there were seven  years, five that we didn   t raise anything, and two of them we did raise a little  feed, and then it got better. In 1940, it rained, and we raised big crops. And  wheat crops, that   s when we went to getting combines.  And it just went on from there.  Went from there and graduated and just kept going.  You know, we   re each from a different area, but we   re all from the west end.  Yeah, that   s right.  Did you ever have water fights? We had water fights to entertain.  I rode a horse to Bertrand School three miles, a quarter, either that or walk.  We walked it quite a bit.  What kind of community gatherings would you go to? It would have had to be  something big for you guys to come in town, I guess.  We had our own in our own communities, or we did at ours.  19  Lemons  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Rice  D. Jacobs  Rice  Kite  Rice  Lemons  Kite  D. Jacobs  Rice  Lemons  Kite  Rice  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Yeah, what kind of things were you doing in your community?  Oh, we had church suppers. I don   t remember. Maybe some kind of a school  program, and people would all go to that.  I remember that my mother used to go out to Kenton to some big church  doings, and us kids, Marion and I, had to stay at home. The girls were off in  college, and we had to stay at home and be sure dad ate. Mother would come  and be gone a whole week out at Kenton. It was state programs or something.  We used to have singing conventions, and they   d all gather. It might be at  Kenton or Felt.  The local community.  Well, they   d come or the Hammontrees always sang a lot and came from  Keyes, and anybody that could sing or play, we   d have big singings, really  good times.  We just spoke to Mrs. Hammontree in Keyes yesterday. She mentioned her  singing.  Uh-huh, Mildred.  Yep.  What would happen if you got somebody up there that couldn   t sing?  Well they   d try.  You listened anyway   Clap when they   re done   Get them off.  Cheer them on   Well it was kind of unusual, but my husband was quite a piano player, and  they called him the cowboy piano player. He played for hee-haws and for the  church all the time and everything. He was quite a piano player. People  always liked him.  He was very good.  The piano I have in my house was brought in when he was about four or five  years old, and he would have been 97 in September. I still have that piano,  and it holds a good tune; it really does. Everybody talks about how that piano  holds a tune. My daughter   s a good piano player, but not like her daddy. I   ll  20  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  have to say that. She   s good, but her daddy had a special touch.  The cowboy piano player.  And they called him the cowboy piano player. He was known down state. At  that time, we went to the Methodist Church all the time, and they knew him  down state for being the cowboy piano player. They   d heard of him.  Do you have any pictures of him playing?  Yes, I have, and I had a bunch of tapes, and somebody came in and put some  music on top of them and ran them off and ruined the tapes, so I was real  disgusted about that. That just happened, it   s not something     Yeah, you can   t do anything about it.  You can   t do anything about it. When he was sick, we had a boy there, and he  wanted some popular music, so he put it on top of  my husband   s  piano tapes.  I only have two or three tapes of his. They still use his tape, one of them on  the Easter pageant out there. There   s one song that Jane sings and he plays.  The Easter pageant, that   s another thing, it   s been going on for fifty years out  there. You   ve heard at that.  Out at Kenton.  The Kenton Easter pageant. We celebrate our fiftieth year this year.  That   s just a little east of town, right?  Yes, it   s on our ranch. The first time they had, we took old sheets and made  costumes for the disciples. Those were the only ones that had costumes. The  rest of them just played the parts. At that time, we took old sheets and died  them different colors. I helped make a lot of them. They used to go up the  hill, and when the time came for the crowd, everybody got out of the cars and  went up the hill with them to make the crowd  The crucifixion is on top of the  hill, where they show it, where they play the last part of the pageant.  Isn   t that coincidental; that was the beginning of the hospital too.  Yeah, well I didn   t remember.  The same year, fifty years here.  All right, well that was fifty years last spring. At the time, we just used local  ranchers in it, but now we have to ask for help, because it   s gotten so big. All  of the neighboring towns near and around, some of them come and help us. Of  course, the high school kids love to come out and practice on Sunday  afternoon. That gives them somewhere to go. I used to always have a house  full on Sunday.  21  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  I didn   t know that. I didn   t know that you were having to beg for help.  I wasn   t begging for help.  No, I mean for the pageant.  Well, there aren   t enough people out there anymore, but then there   s people  coming from everywhere to help.  Well good.  You don   t have to ask too long, huh?  Well we don   t even have to ask. They like to come and help out there.  Fine, great   There   s a few of them I guess maybe they ask. I don   t work with them  anymore. I worked for a good many years. I dressed them for seventeen  years. That was quite a chore, seeing that all of the costumes were made.  I can imagine.  But it gets everybody working together or we couldn   t put it on. People just sit  in their cars, and we have it fixed so you can turn your radio on and listen to it  if it   s cold.  What about other holidays that you remember doing special things on? The  Fourth of July?  The Fourth of July, they nearly always had a picnic out somewhere. Here, we  used to go down to the river here at the ranch, the old Flying W Ranch.  They   d go down there. There were big old cottonwood trees down there then.  We   d go down there and put up tables. It   d be a big community thing get  together on the Fourth of July, usually.  Did you ever have fireworks at all, or was that just a recent thing?  No.  Have horse races and things like that.  Foot races.  Did you ever fight a prairie fire?  No.  That   s why they don   t have fireworks   22  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Kite  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Well this is something recent. The other day we were moving a bunch of  cattle and we looked out and there was a prairie fire right across the road from  us. I said,    I   ll bet that   s the first time they ever had a woman out there on a  walker telling them which way to go   Fighting fires.  The trucks had come, and I showed them where to turn  laughter .  I saw you coming in here. You were pretty fast. You   re pretty speedy on that  thing. You   re not walking; you   re kind of running.  It   s a runner   Well I do all right. I broke my hip last summer, so I have to walk with it. I  feel safer with it. I was doing pretty good until then.  Well, talking about running, you mentioned earlier that you left this area when  the dust storms started. Where did you go?  Southeastern Kansas.  And what did you do there?  I worked on a farm. I got a job from a farmer for a dollar a day at three days a  week. And my wife and I lived on that. I walked to work; I could not drive  my car; I walked to work so we   d have gasoline to go to town to get a little dab  of groceries or kerosene, since we had no electricity.  That   s twelve dollars a month. That   s what you lived on?  That   s what we lived on.  I know you could live on a lot less back then, but was it hard to get by on  twelve dollars?  It was; it was hard to get by on that. You see, we had to have our flour and our  cornmeal and our sugar. If you used much of that, which you did the flour and  the cornmeal to make your cornbread or light bread or biscuits, you go skimpy.  You save it to make your money stretch out and go, and you had to have a pair  of shoes once in a while and some clothes. I want to tell you, it was hard to  do. It was hard to make it. I finally graduated up from that, and went from  that and got a job on a farm at  25 a month. I thought I was in pig heaven  then.  Twice as much.  Yeah. I worked the hours too. He had a tractor and horses and mules, which I  did both. I drove the tractor and plowed. He mainly raised corn there, and had  23  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  a lot of sheep, around 50 to a 100 head of sheep. One of my jobs every  evening was to coral those sheep, not to leave them out where the coyotes or  stray dogs could get into them. He had a big collie dog, and when I had to do  that, I   d take that collie dog with me. The dog wouldn   t work for him, only  when I went with him. So I took it with me and kept working with him, and  before I left there and got a better job over by Chanute, Kansas, I had that dog  where I could just go to the gate, where I had to shut when the sheep came on  in, I   d say,    Go get them; go bring them in,    and he   d go off down that way,  down behind them and get around them. Of course, those sheep all knew what  it meant, and here they   d come. When he got up there with them all, I   d close  the gate and that was it. He saved me a many an hour  Then I moved on from  that to working on a ranch and farming for Mr. Frank Young. He was an oil  man.  Is that still in Kansas?  That was in Kansas, near Chanute, Kansas.  We   re all from that area. I   m from Bartlesville, and Shelly   s from Springfield.  Oh are you?  Yeah.  I lived out west of Chanute on his dad   s place. I was a roustabout   I guess  that   s what you   d call it. He found out that I could weld a little bit, and he   d  have me come in and help at the shop there at the office in town. He had  drilling rigs and all kinds of oilfield work to do there in his shop.  That   s when you were making  25?  Yeah.  Do you remember when you got that job whether you bought anything special,  or did you celebrate in any way when you doubled your salary?  We bought a line of clothes for the wife and I, and the little boy. We   d had a  little one in that time, and we bought some new clothes, the first thing. And  then the next two or three paychecks after that, I traded and got us a better  automobile to get around in. I had an old Baby Overland, and I traded it in and  got a Pontiac Coupe.  What was the first car you had?  Baby Overland.  Okay, right. I   ve never heard of that before.  You haven   t?  24  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Lemons  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Rice  L. Jacobs  Rice  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Rice  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Rice  No.  The Whippet, you   ve heard of that?  I   ve head of that, yeah.  Well that   s what it was to start with was a Baby Overland, and then a Whippet,  and then it went from that into the Jeeps. They used that same motor in the  Jeep. During the war, they made those jeeps and used that Overland motor in  that jeep.  When did you come back from Kansas? When did you come back to  Oklahoma?     43.  Do you guys know of other people who left when times got too hard?  Lots of people left.  Oh, you wouldn   t believe. The Grapes of Wrath.  They wanted to go to California.  Well you take our area out there, and there was a gob of them left out there.  But in the long run, I don   t think they were any better off than we were.  Probably not.  Did you stay in contact with them?  Yes.  But they didn   t come back, either.  Some of them came back and some of them didn   t. Now like the Roberts, the  neighbors that I have right now are two miles from us, our closest neighbors,  but we   ve been there for fifty some years together, so you kind of get close  like that. They went to California and stayed for several years, but they all  moved back.  You know, one thing about that time, there wasn   t a very big discipline  problem with the children.  Never.  In fact, my two brothers said that my mother killed the peach trees. We had  some little peach trees. They said she killed those peach trees getting the  25  Labrier  Rice  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  L. Jacobs  D. Jacobs  Rice  D. Jacobs  L. Jacobs  D. Jacobs  Labrier  L. Jacobs  switches off of them   You know, there   s a difference between being mean to children and making  them mind. They need to be taught.  That would be called child abuse.  You would be imposing on their person.  So what kind of things would you do that would result in a switch from the  peach tree?  Maybe not doing their chores or just mischief, not anything too severe. They  weren   t very bad.  We were talking to a lady yesterday that said she got in trouble because she   d  climb up on the windmill   One of my brothers did that, and then he was later a pilot during the war. He  liked to be high.  We had a real high shoot where the trucks could go. My daughter, at two  years old, climbed up there, and I started to get her down, and she said,    Oh  mama, get down; you   ll fall      You   re not the only one, huh?  Well, I was trying to get her down. I had to let her climb down. She wouldn   t  let me get her.  Well, during this time people were leaving, some people were staying and  toughing it out. Do you remember any tramps or hobos coming through the  areas where you lived?  Not in this area there wasn   t, because there was no railroad.  But there were lots of them over at Texhoma.  Some of them were even educated people that just could not find jobs.  Oh, very educated.  They   d hitchhike the trains.  Lots of New Yorkers, Chicago, all in the east, just desperate for work.  Or for some people, to eat.  They hitchhiked on the trains mainly. They did that at Texline, my  26  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  grandparents lived at Texline. They   d have a hobo or two everyday, begging.  Did they feed them, your grandparents?  Yeah. They never turned a one down.  I don   t think anybody did, do you? If they had something to eat, they   d feed  you.  But my mother would ask them if they   d want to pull some of the weeds.  Yeah, so she would actually have them do some chores, huh?  Right.  Did they do a good job?  You bet. And one day she even forgot she   d had a man, and there he was out  there in that hot sun just cutting  laughter , and I said,    Mom, are you just  going to kill him?    She said,    Oh my goodness, I forgot all about him,    and  she fixed him a glorious meal.  What did he get that was different than what she would normally give?  Oh, we didn   t have a big breakfast. We just had some oats and toast. He had  bacon and eggs and fried potatoes and gravy   What about gypsies? We   ve heard some people talk about gypsies. Did any of  you have any experiences or know of any?  When we lived at Wiley, our farm was cornered to Wiley. Wiley was on this  corner of the section, and we were on this corner, and there was a road in  between. That was a favorite spot for the gypsies. There was always a bunch  of gypsies in there in wagons. I don   t remember them ever causing any  trouble. People talked about the gypsies, but to me, I think they were just  people that were hungry and needed care.  So were you scared of them or anything?  Oh no, I don   t remember ever being scared of them. Maybe we kind of  watched a little bit, but I wasn   t afraid of them. I wasn   t trained to be afraid of  them.  Do you have any pictures of gypsies? Did you ever take any pictures or have  any of them at all? They   re kind of mysterious. No one ever has pictures of  them.  Well, I don   t know, but they were just wandering people in a wagon. They  just had teams of wagons. They   d unhook those wagons at night and let their  27  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  horses eat, and then they   d move along the next day, because they didn   t have  any place to go. That   s the way I remember it. That was when I was a little  girl, though.  Does that sound similar?  Well, I only saw one group, and they came to Wheelis. I went to school up  there, and they came by the store. I didn   t know anything about it, they just  talked about them, but those are the only ones I ever saw.  What did they look like?  Well, just ordinary people, poor people that were just in the wagons. Like they  said, they just traveled that way.  And they   d stay for three or four days or a week. They could get something to  eat and some help, or maybe they   d work a little bit. You couldn   t tell. Like I  said, that   s a long, long time ago. That   s been, I expect 80 years ago.  Do you remember how big the group was?  Sometimes there would be several wagons, and sometimes there would be just  one or two. That   s the way I remember it. I don   t remember too much about  it.  This little girl, she was selling the lace, and I thought Mom ought to buy it  from her so she could take something home to her folks, and she did. She said,     Do you want some that   s not so wide?    and Mother said,    No, I don   t need  any like that,    and she said,    Well, would you like me to come back the next  day?    and mother said,    No, I expect this is all I can get.    But those people  were dark complected and had real long black hair. They were just as nice and  polite as they could be. Nobody complained of anybody being robbed of  anything. They were evidently good people, but they were foreigners too.  I think most of them were good people. They just didn   t have anything to do.  Maybe they   d go in and get something to eat or something at somebody   s  house, get a chicken or something like that, but I don   t remember us ever  having any trouble, and our house was a quarter of a mile from where they  camped. I don   t think that the people were bad. That   s the way I remember it.  Do you recall any sort of community assistance, giving to people who had  fallen on hard times? What kind of programs would there be?  The churches went together at Texhoma, and that meant membership  contributed food and clothes that they couldn   t use. They set up a place in  town in one of the empty business houses, and people going through could go  by and pick up food and clothing.  Is that the same sort of things you remember?  28  Rice  Labrier  Kite  D. Jacobs  Rice  Kite  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  Well, people in our community have always been helpful. If there   s any  sickness or deaths or anything happens, people are always willing, even today,  we still are willing to help one another. We   re very concerned about our  community, our fellow man, all the way.  That   s one thing we   ve got to say; our communities all work together. The  other day, we had a funeral and had 130 people. We didn   t know how we  were going to feed them. We called Boise City, and we called Felt, and both  of them helped us. Not Felt, Wheelis, but they all sent food, and they still do.  Our communities work together.  When you had community, the churches would get clothes and different things,  did you ever have to go and take from that assistance? Did any of your  families ever have to use that means to get by?  Not in my family.  No, people just always came in if you needed help, like sit up with someone  that was sick or anything like that. I know that one time our neighbor, Herman  Bulls, he was running a saw, and it cut his head open. My husband and my  brothers went to Amarillo to sit with him. Just things like that or in the  community, if it was harvest time or anything like that, they   d always go in  and help harvest. Any way you can help, they always do.  I just wondered how bad a family had to get down before they would accept  community help, like food or clothes or something like that.  Some of them were pretty stubborn.  And the WPA came in about that time.  I was going to ask you about    New Deal    programs in this area.  That helped a lot. That   s when they dug out that dinosaur track or dinosaur out  from our pasture down there. What museum is it in now? I forget.  Isn   t it at Goodwell?  It was, but they took is somewhere farther.  Did they take it to Norman?  Norman, I believe. I believe it   s down there. That was taken out of our  pasture. They put a bone up to represent it made out of cement. My husband  rode by that bone on a horse, and he said it was just the height of him on the  horse, so that just tells you how big that one bone is out of that. It   s out there  on the side of the hill. But we have quite a time, because people shoot it down.  You can   t believe how people mistreat things. We   ve got Coronado   s writing  out there, where he wrote his name, his signature on our place, and they   ve  29  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Kite  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Lemons  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Labrier  Lemons  Labrier  tried to chip it out. We have to keep the gates locked. We didn   t used to have  to do that. People never thought abut tearing up everything, but anymore you  have to protect things or they   ll tear them up.  Is that on part of the tour that   s tomorrow?  That   s what I was going to ask her, if we   re going to her house  laughter .  Yeah, we   re going on the tour tomorrow.  I don   t know whether they go to Coronado   s writing over there or not. It   s on  the north side of the river. It   s called Castle Rock, but there   s a place on one  side that has his name in 1541.  Wow, if we don   t see it on the tour, can we come out on our own?  Yes, if you   ll ask us, come up and we   ll go with you, because we don   t just let  people go in.  Sure.  Makes sense.  What   s the name?  Coronado.  Oh, sure enough?  Yes, he made a tour and went up into Kansas and came back, and his signature  is on one of the rocks out there in our pasture.  Great.  I   d like to see that.  People are just chipping on them. They tried to chip the dinosaur tracks out of  the bottom of the creek.  Oh no   Yes, some of them have. You just can   t believe it. People have made  imitation dinosaur tracks, which is fine, but they shouldn   t try to take those out  of the creek. There are two sets out there north of Kenton, two sets of tracks  going across with dinosaur tracks.  Yes, we went out and saw a lot of them when we were here before.  Did you?  30  Kite  Labrier  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Kite  Rice  Labrier  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  Rice  D. Jacobs  Uh-huh, we were walking in the dinosaur feet   Well, that   s good.  What other sorts of New Deal programs were in place out here?  Well, they were very much partisan. The Democrats were in office, and if you  were not of the same   what should I say?  Affiliation?  Thank you. You weren   t likely to get a job.  Going off of that, what was the feeling and the attitude toward Roosevelt?  What did you think about Franklin Roosevelt?  Oh, where I was, he was next to God.  Did your family agree with that?  Oh yes, my dad was a democrat, and I wasn   t old enough to vote, but I thought  whatever Dad said was right. I have since changed my ways   What about the rest of you guys and FDR?  Well, I thought he did a lot for the country. He did a lot when he built those  electrical plants, damns and things. We later got electricity out here, which we  didn   t have. We finally got telephones. It   s been great. It   s really helpful.  And roads. When the WPA were working, it was dirt roads, but they worked  on them, and they got the roads so you could get around. Sometimes you  couldn   t get through. I remember one time we sold calves, and Cat Williams  was living out here on the on the point, and he took his tractor down north of  here and pulled our trucks through to get the calves through, day and night.  The only way we could get them through was to send them all around because  the roads were so bad, but he helped us pull them through. That shows you  what kind of neighbors you have. One neighbor helps the other.  What were you going to say about FDR and the New Deal?  Well, he did, he helped a lot, like Marcia said, our country in different ways.  There are a lot of people that didn   t like him.  Well, that   s true.  What I said is local. The local people were the ones that punished you if you  weren   t the right political affiliation.  31  Lemons  D. Jacobs  Rice  L. Jacobs  D. Jacobs  L. Jacobs  Labrier  Kite  Labrier  Kite  D. Jacobs  Rice  Labrier  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  L. Jacobs  This is a little bit different, you said about electricity. Do you remember the  first time you got electricity? What was the best thing when you first got  electricity?  Pulling the chain   It   s been great to have deep freezes and refrigerators and things. Before we  had that, when we kept out milk in a milk trough where the water ran through  and cooled the milk and butter and things. That   s the coolest it was.  To get electricity up to my folks    house in 1944, I dug holes by hand. Dad  would talk to them and tried to get them. The electric line ran right on the  south side of our place, a quarter of a mile from the house, and they wouldn   t  run the electricity up to our house, but they said if we   d dig the hole they   d run  the electricity up there, and I dug them by hand to get electricity put in up to  my folks    house.  30-foot holes, 30-foot poles   awful.  It was great, because like Marcia said, and I still have the old milk trough  outside where we ran the water from the windmill through that and into the  stock tank for the cattle. I still have part of that old milk trough out there that  we used, they used for years.  I have one still hidden up there at Kenton at our Bed and Breakfast.  You   ve got that Bed and Breakfast that as you   re going up to Black Mesa it   s  on the right?  No, no. We   ve got the one in town. That   s Monnie Roberts   . That   s our  neighbors.  All right.  Oh, I didn   t know they had one.  Well you did have, didn   t you?  Well we have.  You still have one in town.  But it   s in town, ours is, and that   s out in the country. Sometimes we use my  upstairs, but we don   t unless we get tight. I have two bedrooms upstairs, and  sometimes we use them and rent them out.  Do you remember when you first got indoor plumbing?  Yeah, because I did it.  32  Lemons  L. Jacobs  Lemons  Rice  Lemons  Labrier  Rice  Lemons  Rice  L. Jacobs  Rice  L. Jacobs  Labrier  Yeah, when was that?  Well, it had to be in    45 or    46 when I put it in the house, because I did the  work myself, and my dad helped.  How about you guys?  It was about that time. My husband and I built a kitchen on our house. We  laid the blocks up with blocks and built another room on. Our little house was  considered pretty nice. A railroad man built it, and it was well built, but all the  rooms were small, and we really needed some more room, so we built this  kitchen on ourselves. It was fun  In fact, I   ve done a little bit of everything.  Besides laying blocks, I   ve driven tractors and combines and ridden horses   laughing . I   ve done just about all of it.  Well how do you think living through the Depression and the thirties has  effected who you are today?  Well, I think it   s made us realize how much money   s worth. At that time, we  couldn   t buy anything, and I think it taught us how to save our money. In fact,  I live off of my social security, and I save some of it. That   s what I   m  meaning. We learned that we cannot just spend everything because we   ve got  it. Am I wrong?  No. I teased my husband all the time. I said,    When are you ever going to  take me out to eat?     laughter . I said,    Everybody else goes out to eat, but we  don   t.     What   d he say?  He said,    Well, everybody doesn   t get to eat at home like we can     A long  time ago, when we were first married, we met up with some of our neighbors,  and they were going to a movie. They were buying groceries, and they were  buying some of the best. Well we were very conservative, so we just didn   t.  We hardly ever went to a movie or anything. We just didn   t feel like we could  afford it. Later, somebody said,    Well you guys sure did well. How did you  get so much?     laughter . We were conservative all right. Not that we have so  much, I don   t mean that.  The dirty thirties taught us that lived through it to save, not to throw anything  away until it   s worn plum out, and then you still don   t throw it away  You still  try to repair it back or use it to repair something else.  In other words, not to be extravagant on anything.  Right, right.  Well, when I taught school I got  75 a month, and you couldn   t get a teacher  to take hardly  75 a day.  33  Rice  Labrier  Lemons  D. Jacobs  L. Jacobs  Lemons  L. Jacobs  D.

My folks had irrigating water, and they couldn   t pay for it. I  paid for the water and I bought the groceries, so I think we learned to get by  and be careful with our money.  How about you Mrs. Jacobs? How do you think it   s effected who you are?  I really don   t know.  If you   d come to our house and see what she   s got hoarded up, you would  know   Laughter   Did it make you a pack rat? That   s what he said.  She wouldn   t tell that. That   s the reason I had to tell it, see.  You better wait    til I get you home   Laughter   Well, they   re trying to gather things for our museum at Kenton. I tell them all  they need to do is come to my house  laughter .  Yeah, a little bit of everything. That seems to be a common response, to hold  on to everything and just keep it no matter what.  Whether you need it or not.  Yeah.  But we   d divide. If somebody comes along and needs it, we   ll divide with  them.  I have a lot of jeans that our boys have let me have and he   s worn out. I   ve  been going to make a quilt or a bedspread or something, but I just have them  piled up, and that   s quite a bundle when you get it all in one place.  Well I made some. I made my quilt.  Have you? Well, you couldn   t make one any warmer.  It won   t last as long as that would.  How long have the two of you been married?  It was 46 years in March.  Wow, congratulations.  Thank you. She   s above us.  34  Rice  Kite  Rice  D. Jacobs  Labrier  D. Jacobs  Kite  L. Jacobs  Kite  Rice  Labrier  Kite  D. Jacobs  Kite  Lemons  Rice  Kite  Labrier  Lemons  Kite  Labrier  I   ve been married 63 years, and my husband is 90 years old.  63 years   It   ll be 64 this fall.  Lloyd   s going to be 90 in August.  We would have been married 63 years next week.  Would you?  I   ve been married 19 days.  Oh have you?  Almost coming up on my three-week anniversary.  You have a ways to go.  Well that   s wonderful. Just make it last for that long.  I was hoping the 63 women might have some advice, if you want to pass it on.  Of what?  Advice to keep it going.  Of how to stay 46 and 63 years married.  Just be considerate of one another and thoughtful of one another.  Good enough.  I lost my husband 18 years ago, so we had been married only 45.  I can   t think of anything else, can you?  No, I think we   re at the end of our list, unless there   s something else you want  to add. If you can think of any advice to help me out down the road    Laughter   Put God first in your heart, and it   ll work.  -------  -------
