Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you what I call five People magazine-ish type questions. Okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I like red. I, I think it fits my skin color well and so I like red. It's, it's bright. It, it--it's lively. It's, it's not downcast, so I like bright things.
Speaker 1: Okay. What about food? What's your favorite food to eat?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess my favorite food is rice. I grew up, as you know, in the Gullah islands [Sea Islands]. And so, you can make rice in about fifty, seventy-five, a hundred different ways and I like it in, in a number of variety of ways.
Speaker 1: What time of the year suits you best?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall. The spring, with all the beautiful flowers and the, the sunshine, and the green and, and it's kind of like a new breath, and I like that. It's warm and gentle and beautiful. And then, the fall is, again, kind of the changing of the season, a lot of colors. I like the trees, and growing up in the rural area, you, you're sort of in tune with nature. I've come to like winter a lot. I like the snow, you know, when you don't have to work in it, but it's beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay. When you go on vacation, do you have a favorite destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, I tend to go back to South Carolina and we go to Hilton Head Island. And there, we go with a number of friends. And many of the guys that I go with, we play golf in the mornings. And then in the afternoon, we, you know, spend family time with our individual families. My wife [Leslie E. Johnson] and I ride bicycles. And in the evening, go to dinner and then, we'll probably meet at somebody's place for a little while. And that's how we vacation.
Speaker 1: All right. Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: It all works out (laughter). I, I, I always think that it, it does. You get up in the morning and you have all kinds of problems. And I always tell people, you have all kinds of problems and--or challenges, but it always work out. So, I always believe that if you have that core, it, it gets you through things.
Story_ID: 647633
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family. Let's, let's begin with your mother, and her side of the family. Tell me your mother's name and spell it for me.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, my mother's name is Ermine, E-R-M-I-N-E, and her maiden name was Campbell, C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L. And, and then she married my father who is, or was, Adolphus Johnson [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.], A-D-O-L-P-H-U-S. And so, her name is Ermine Campbell Johnson.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: Now, she was born on Edisto Island [South Carolina], E-D-I-S-T-O Island, and that's one of the Gullah islands [Sea Islands] off the coast of South Carolina. There's a big river called the Edisto River. And many of the slaves came through that river through the coast of Charleston [South Carolina]. And so, it's one of the Gullah islands where predominantly African American, and when we say, predominantly African American, we're talking about 95 percent of the population. It's not that way anymore. My mother's mother was a lady by the name of Laura Campbell [Laura Singleton Campbell], I'm sorry, Laura Campbell, but she was a Singleton, S-I-G-L-E-T-O-N [sic.], so many of the Singletons are my cousins on the island. And also, her family name was Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T. And so, the Wrights and the Singletons are my cousins. And then, my mother's mother was married to a Campbell, and his name was--my grandfather, name was Emmanuel Campbell [Emmanuel Campbell, Sr.], and they called him Manny. Now, I never met any of my grandparents on my mother's side. When my mother got married, you know, fairly young at eighteen, she moved to, with my father, to Charleston. And for a number of years, they lived in the City of Charleston. And then, my father, being a country guy, decided that he didn't want to raise his children in the country--in the city. And so, my three older siblings--my mother had told me--and my mother and my father, they moved to Wadmalaw Island [South Carolina] where I grew up. And so, it's interesting is that my fa- my mother was the, the real person that kept the family. She knew everybody but I, I didn't live with my mother's side of the family. Many African Americans I know grew up with their mother's side of the family. I was the opposite. I grew up my father's side of the family. And from time to time, we would go back to Edisto Island. I remember my mother's oldest brother, and his name was Emmanuel Campbell [Emmanuel Campbell, Jr.]. And I have a really great picture of him, of--when he came back from the war, World War II [WWII], and he would always come to our house. And he and my father got along really well. And he would pick us up, and take us in his car, and took, take us around the pear trees, and we would pick pear and things like that. He would give us money, so it was always wonderful to see--we call him Uncle Junior--to come to the house. And then, my mother had another brother, she had two brothers, and the other one was Thomas Campbell. Now Uncle Tom, he was also a World War II veteran, and he lived, though, in Jacksonville, Florida. And he would come up for Christmas just about every year. And his wife was a lady by the name of Bernice [ph.], didn't have any children, but they adopted quite a number of children, and I got to know them really well. And my sister and I would go to some summers in, in Jacksonville, and would spend like a week or two. And, and Uncle Thomas' life and the family life, and all of them were really centered around the church. And so, we would attend church almost every night (laughter) when we went to Jacksonville, Florida.
Story_ID: 647634
Speaker 1: Let me a- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] had a sister--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by the name of Laura [ph.]. You can see, you'll, you'll see a lot of names floating through. And it'll come back because my sisters, a number of my sisters and, and all of us are named liked that. And my mother's sister, as I indicated, her name was Laura, but she died young, and so we never got to know her. But my mother was a great storyteller, and she kept us in- informed, and so even though we never met her sister, it seemed like we knew her really well. And, and her sister had a child by the name of Carrie [ph.]. And Carrie was--I guess, my mother's niece, but they grew up like sisters. And so, Carrie became our aunt, and she lived in New York [New York], and she lived actually a long time, and was really, really, really a special aunt in certain ways. And she would, during the, the year, she would buy us school clothes, and she would send us things for Christmas, and she would always come home, and we were always so excited when Carrie was coming home. She never got married and so, we became--my brothers and sisters--her children in, in a sense. And then mother had another brother, who died the month before I was born, and his name was Jack, and his name was Jack Campbell. And, and so she--and I was born a month after he died. He died in a, in an accident. My mother tells me that he drove a truck, one of these country trucks, and he was coming home one night, and then had an accident. And I can--it's amazing, I can remember so many of the details he talked about. When she went to the hospital to see him, his neck was broken and, and he said to her, you know, I know that I can't live like this. And that was her youngest brother, and then he died the month, as I had indicated before, I was born. And, and so, she named me Jack after him, and so, that's why I got my name. Of course, my father's Johnson [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.], so I became [HistoryMaker] Jack Johnson, but, and then I have a first cousin named Jack Campbell, who was my uncle's oldest son. And, and I think he had about seven children, one of the, one of my favorite cousin is Laura [ph.], which was his daughter, which was named after his sister, which was my mother's sister (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sister.
Speaker 2: And so, that's where you see Laura. And also, I have a, a sister by the name of Laura--well, I had a sister. She passed away, but her name was Laura, actually Laura Winns [Laura Johnson Winns]. My brother-in-law and I are really still good friends, and I'll get to that side of the family a little later on. As you can see, it's kind of complicated. There's a lot of people. And then, my cousin, Jack, all of my cousins on my mother's side, they were all really brilliant, intellectual people, so they were all, always the valedictorian of their school. So, Laura, Jack, another brother named Edgar [ph.], and a number of other people, and these were Jack's children--my uncle's. Now, my cousin, Jack, went to Vietnam, and after he returned from Vietnam, he really never recovered. He was in the--I think he fought with the Big Red One [1st Infantry Division] which is, up there in the cavalry. And he just never really recovered from the psychological trauma of Vietnam [Vietnam War]. And so, that's one of the--the brutality of war, and the reality of it. And, and I remember my aunt saying to me that when Jack was having his problems, she said, "You know, when, when my husband died," talking about her brother, my, my, mother's brother, Jack--she said, "we had to really struggle to make it." And then, she said, "As soon as my children's son got of age, the, the government that never helped at all, took him away to fight a war that, that, you know, we had no interest in, the country really should not have had an interest in, and really quote, unquote destroyed my son." So, that's one of the--I guess the tragedy of that side of the family. But I said all this to say that I, I really know my mother's people well, but I really didn't, because I didn't grow up with them. As I indicated, they all grew up on Edisto Island [South Carolina]. We saw them often. People came and visit, but we didn't live around them on a day to day basis.
Story_ID: 647635
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson]. Did she talk to you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes. My mother--I would say, she, she had a tough life. Edisto Island [South Carolina], you know, this is the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s], and the racism and the poverty is such rampant in, in South Carolina. This is pre-Strom Thurmond days. So, the--in a sense, South Carolina was basically, in those days--actually, if you think about, you know, the folks are really just coming out of slavery because slavery ends in 1865. And so, their parents are born in the 1880s, the late 1870s. Of course, there is pride to--well, during that time, you, you couldn't even learn to read and write. And then, my mother talks about, you know, her father [Emmanuel Campbell, Sr.], her mother [Laura Singleton Campbell]. Her father was a farmer, and she never talked about what her mother did. And I think her mother never really worked outside of the house. I, I know, she told me one time the story about--I think her mother, and some of the ladies would, you know, cleaned people's houses, or take in what you call clothing to, to iron. And she told me a story about a lady that was talking to her mother, and you remember my mother was born in 1919. And so her mother was--I don't know her age, but I think she was born in the late 1800s. And she said this lady was whispering to her mother. Her mother had told her the story of this lady whispering, saying that she was ironing the, the clothes of this man. And some of the clothes that she was ironing was his KKK [Ku Klux Klan] outfit. So you know, I, I think people didn't realize that the KKK were secretive but, but they had such psychological fear and trauma over the African Americans that worked there, that they could have the audacity, to have them iron the outfit that they were going to put on. And so, the, the African American community, or the black people, knew who were members of the KKK, but, of course, they were not empowered to do anything about it. And they definitely were not going to tell the authority because they were the authorities. So, that's one of the stories I always remember.
Story_ID: 647636
Speaker 1: She [Johnson's mother, Ermine Campbell Johnson] always talked about, you know, growing up, going to the little school, how they had to walk a long distance to the school. The school didn't have any- anything, but a little stove to keep them warm. It's a one room school. The teachers, I remember, the school was Jane Edwards Elementary School [Burrough School; Jane Edwards Elementary School, Edisto Island, South Carolina]. And she always talked about it 'cause the, the lady was the principal, Jane Edwards, and she always liked Jane Edwards. She, she liked the principal a lot. I think the principal was a person that made the children feel good. She talked about her uncle. She had an uncle named Peter Wright and I remember him, and I got his obituary. I still have that and he died when he was eighty-nine. He was really an outstanding, really a man, one that people in the community respected a lot. And he had a number of children. I know one of his children, a daughter.
Speaker 2: How, how much education did your mother receive?
Speaker 1: My mother finished, you know, what, what, consider, almost high school. And then, I remember when, when I was growing up, she went back to school, and finished, after, after half her children were grown. And I'll talk about that in a little while but, but, basically, the schools were very rudiment, and things like that. My mother was very, very smart, and she writes really well. And, and she was, and she knew everybody. And, and she, and I think the, the struggles of her childhood allowed--give her a lot of compassion for people. And I think she passed that on to many of us. So, so, her high school was, you know, elementary school days were very typical. She said that in those days, I think, African Americans only went to school, like three months of the year, or if they went to school, then when the farming season came, they, the school, the black schools closed. And then, they worked on the farm. You know, people worked on the farm; then school would start up again.
Story_ID: 647637
Speaker 1: Were her parents [Johnson's maternal grandparents, Laura Singleton Campbell and Emmanuel Campbell, Sr.] sharecroppers, or did they own their own land (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, they--the, the interesting thing about Edisto Island [South Carolina], the Gullah islands [Sea Islands], if you look at the, the research of the Gullah islands, I found that all, for some reason, all of the black people owned their own land. And how they acquired it, I, I don't know, but it's really kind of interesting. Now, I have the deed of the land that my great-grandfather [William Johnson] acquired on my father's [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] side. And I haven't talked about my father's people yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we still own that land, and that land is on Wadmalaw Island [South Carolina]. But on Edisto Island, where my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] grew up, they owned, you know, small tracts of land, small pieces of land. And people planted their own vegetables garden and, and, you know, when I say garden, it was a pretty big size. And they sold it in the market. They took it to market, which was in Charleston [South Carolina], to sell it. And if you go to Charleston, where the marketplace is, that's where many of the people from the island came and, and sold their various crops during the season. And so, I think that's--but I don't know how land were--was acquired, but most of the--in fact, all of the people owned their land. Now, they did work for the big farmers, and many of them were the foremen and actually, acquired all the skills to run and operate huge farms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, of course, the island had a huge seafood industry connected to it. The oysters were I understand, some of the best in the world; the shrimping, the fish, the crabbing, and all of those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 647638
Speaker 1: Describe your mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] to me. What type of person was she? And what was your personal relationship? You had brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, my mother was--well, first of all, she was a tall lady. She was about 5'11" or so, and she was kind of tall and real in, in a sense. She was a great storyteller. She, she loved to talk. She really had a passion for, for education, and she wanted us to acquire the educational opportunities that she really did not have. And she was a really hard worker, and she wanted things to be different. Interestingly, you know, she died last year, October 2006. She was eighty-seven. And she never lived alone, I guess, in a sense, you know, like people have their own apartment. They grow up. She never lived alone. And when she was sixty-six--I think she was--she called me one night and said, "Well, I want you to know that I have another son." So, I said, "What are you talking about? You're only kidding." And she said, "Well, you know, the, the Cuban--," not the Cuban--the Haitian boat people were--had arrived. And many of them ended up in Charleston [South Carolina] at some of the, the places where they were being kept. And she was a member of this church, and they were, what they called missionary. And so, they went to this missionary thing on Sunday, and they were talking about the kids. And so, she said, "Well, and I brought one home with me." And, and she raised him from--I guess, he was about eight at the time, and she raised him 'til he finished high school. And that's the kind of person she was.
Story_ID: 647639
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father and his side of the family now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: And you told me your father's name was Adolphus Johnson [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Adolphus--we, everybody called him Chauncy. And--
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born on Wadmalaw Island--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --South Carolina. And--
Speaker 1: In what, do you know what year?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was born in 1915--I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in 1915. And he had, interestingly, there were eleven in the family. He had--it was nine boys and two girls. My two aunts on my father's side was Catherine Johnson, of course she married a guy named Frank Glover [ph.]. And the other one was Dorothy [Dorothy Johnson Brown], and she married a guy named Henry Brown [Willie Brown]. So, those are my two aunts on my father's side. And then, my father had, as I had indicated, my eight brothers, Richard [Richard Johnson], Samuel [Samuel Johnson], a brother Sunny whose name was Benjamin [Benjamin Johnson], Uncle Freddie [ph.]--all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they all lived right around each other.
Speaker 1: All right. And what about your father's parents?
Speaker 2: My father's parents--his father, who I knew quite well, was Mathaias. And they called him--well, Mathaias, and we called him Pat. And he and I had a really great relationship. Now, my grandmother's name was Victoria [Victoria Middleton Johnson]. And she died--her name, but she came from a family called Middleton. And if you searched that part of the history of the South Carolina, you'd see that they were huge Middletons and Wayleafs [ph.], and all those, but her name was Middleton. And so, she was Victoria Middleton. And my father was, grandfather was Mathaias Johnson. As I indicated, I knew him real well. And he was pretty close in his eighties, late seventies, early eighties, when I was a kid. And, and when, when I got home from school, I, I have to take off my clothes. That was the first thing I would do. I would run over to his house, and he would, either be sitting down or in the house, and things like that. And then, he was a, a farmer, and then, of course, he was a minister. And by the time I was a kid, his eyesight was changing. And so, he would always say, "Okay, Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], you got to read the Bible for me now." And I would read and, and it was kind of interesting because I would, you know, the Old Testament, you get to these tough pronunciations. I would--and then he would say it, so I realized that he knew all the things that I was reading. And we would talk, and he didn't talk very much; but he was a kind of a strong man, very involved in his, the church and in the community.
Story_ID: 647640
Speaker 1: So, tell me more about your [paternal] grandfather.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, my, my grandfather, as I indicated, was Mathaias Johnson. Now, I do remember he had two brothers that I knew of. There, there were more than that, but as I indicated, they were pretty old by the time I came along. He had a brother named George [George Johnson], and George lived on the other side of us between my grandfather and us, and my--well, we were in the middle. And then, my grandfather lived on the left, and George lived on the right. And he was married to a lady named Nancy [ph.]. And I remember always going to what we called Uncle George's house, and he lived on the river, the Bohicket River [sic. Bohicket Creek], right on the water. And, and he would always tell us to be careful not to fall in the river because it was very deep where he lived. And then, a little further over was my grandfather's youngest brother, and his name was William Johnson. Now, William was the, the--my grandfather, there were eight of them. I don't recall all their names, specifically, right now. I know them, but I just not--can't pull all the names out of, but my--William was the youngest brother. And he was named after my grandfather [sic. great-grandfather], who was William Johnson. Now, my grandfather is a person that purchased all of the land that we lived on. And as, and there were fifty-six acres, which was a lot of land that he purchased. The twenty-six acres, they were divided, it was divided 'cause there was a twenty-six acre lot. And I have the deed to that twenty-six acre lot, and that was in 1888, and he paid $626.26 for that land. Now, it, it's always been a mystery to me how he got that much money because that was a lot of money. Now, my Uncle William, my grandfather's youngest brother--I asked him about that because he lived pretty long. I was a lawyer by the time he died. And I went to his house one day, and we were under the tree talking, and I said--we used to call him Uncle Leeding [ph.]. I said, "Leeding, how did your father acquire that land?" And he said that he acquired the land because he had served in the, the war, and that he had been, after the Civil War, they all got some money, and that he took the money from the, that he got the land. Now, I tried to--I have a cousin, Jeanette [ph.], my first cousin, and she is, she lives in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] now, and she's kind of the historian. And, in fact, where I got the deed from, I got it from Jeanette, so she's been researching the family really well. And we have not been able to tie my grandfather into the Union Army. But I did ask my uncle, I said, "Where did your father come from?" He said, one, he came from Jamaica, and, two, that he was owned by the Johnson Tea Company [ph.], and that's where he got his name. Now, I haven't, we haven't been able to verify that, and that he was a race- a sailboat racer. And, and in the old days, they used to have sailboats on the islands and racing. And I know there's a big sailboat racing club on Wadmalaw Island [South Carolina] now, and that my grandfather used to race sailboat for someone. And maybe, and some people speculate that there's where he got some of his money from--from some of the winnings. But nevertheless, he married a lady by the name of, again, another Victoria Middleton [Johnson's paternal grandmother, Victoria Middleton Johnson]. And then, my--they had eight children, which was my great-grand- which was, and one of them was Mathaias, which was my great--
Speaker 1: Your grandfather?
Speaker 2: --my grandfather and--
Speaker 1: Now, what was your, what, tell me, what was your great-grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather's name was William Johnson.
Speaker 1: So that was, okay, William John- Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that was William Johnson, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and the, the uncle that I knew really well, the granduncle, was Uncle William Johnson. And we called him Uncle Leeding. And he was the one that really told me a lot of the story about his grandfather--his father, which was my father's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Right. And that's William Johnson?
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he's the one who, they said, came from Jamaica--William Johnson?
Speaker 2: William Johnson came from Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, one day, I said to my uncle, I said, "Well, where did Uncle William live, my grandfather [sic.] live?" And he said to me, he said, "He lived up north." And I said, "Up north?" And I said, "Well, I didn't know we ever had any family from up north." And he said, "Yes, he came from Summerville [South Carolina]" (laughter). So, so, I laugh, because Summerville is twenty miles north of Charleston [South Carolina], so that was up north in terms of his being.
Story_ID: 647641
Speaker 1: Now, Uncle William [Johnson's paternal great uncle, William Johnson] was a very productive farmer. And I always remember, he never had a car, and he rode his horse everywhere on the island [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]. And also, he was the authoritative figure on the island. And, and what I mean by that is that when families had issues, they would always go to him. And he would listen to both sides and instruct, you know, we didn't have a police department, and all those kinds of things, and I think that was part of the black culture that they went to the older person. And that person was Uncle Leeding [ph.]. And--
Speaker 2: And how are, how are you spelling his name?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --because, (laughter) you know, it's never been written.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, I don't know how we, we spell it. It's a nickname.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and so, I'll have to get--I'll talk to my brother to find (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But say the name again.
Speaker 1: We call him Leeding.
Speaker 2: Leeding? Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, so Uncle Leeding--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so, I guess it's L-E-E-D-I-N-G. I, I--how he got it, or am I spelling it correctly? I, I have no idea (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: I know it's never been written down. I can tell you that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You know, I heard it from a kid (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 647642
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, more about your [paternal] grandfather [Mathaias Johnson].
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Now, my grandfather, as I indicated, you know, I don't know whether he ever worked off the island. I do know that he was a very able farmer. And when I grew up, I would work with him on the farm. He was already old, but he still liked to plant, and so, he would plant watermelon. He would plant corn. He would plant string beans. He would plant cabbage. He would plant cucumber. And so, that's where I learned all of my farming skills from him. And he and I would, as I, I indicated, I spent a lot of time with him. That's the, the thing that I loved to do. I got off from school, and my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] and my father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] knew, whenever they want to find me, they'd just go to my grandfather's house because that's where I was. And so, he would--and there was a man, name was Arthur Gadsen [ph.], who was his age. And so, they had grew up together, and both of them were in their eighties, and they would spend a lot of time together. And they would talk to me, a lot about growing up on the island and, and going to school and--
Speaker 1: What did they tell you? What were some of the stories they share, shared?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they, they talked about, you know, I think it was some exaggeration, but they talked about going to school at Rockville Elementary School [Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]. And they would tell me about the little green school that they attended, and that they walked to school. And they would say, "Well, you know, you, you guys ride the, the bus. And we didn't ride the bus." They would talk about going to the creek, and getting oysters and shrimping, and they just kind of talked about their life on the island, and how they would cut the trees for firewood. And then, they would talk sometimes about second year, you know, they would mention so, "Oh, yeah, that was the year when a certain person died." There was a story on the island of a police officer by the name of Overstreet. And he was a very feared person, was a mean spirited guy, that would come on the island once in a while. And that, and the story is that he had killed one of my uncle's sons, who was recently married, and had went to work one day, and he came home. And he was in the, the wood doing, cutting trees for firewood, and that the, the guy, officer indicated that he had mistakenly shot him. And, and everybody on the island did not believe that, and the reputation that he had killed about four or five--well, about ten or eleven African Americans. And so, they talked about that story--I remember they talked about that story. My grandfather talked about his singing adventures, that he was a really a great singer. I never heard him sing. My oldest brother [Francis Johnson] tells me that he was an operatic type singer but was not trained. And so, he would laugh about, you know, when he was in church, and he was singing and things like that. So, those were the kind of stories that I re- I remember him telling.

Speaker 1: Now tell me about your, your father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Well, my father, as I indicated, there were about eight brothers, and they all lived together right around there. My father was a really right or wrong guy--I call it. He, he believed--there wasn't a lot of middle ground with him. And he was a very determined person, and he had a really deep sense of right and wrong. And that, and he always thought that you should be right. And the other thing that I, I thought that I got from him was standing up in the face of, of adversaries. And, and determined to do what that, right, and so, I, I think I got that strong will from him. He was very, very strong willed. He worked as a longshoreman on the--in Charleston [South Carolina]. And I don't remember the company name [United Fruit Company] at now, but the, the successor is the Chiquita banana company [Chiquita Brands International, Inc.]. But many of the, the fruit boats that came from South America, the longshoremen unloaded those ships. And my father was a, a member of the union [International Longshoremen's Association], which was really rare in those days. As you know, South Carolina is, absolutely a non-union state, but because the shipping dealt with interstate commerce, they could form a union. And he worked, not every day, longshoremen don't work every day. So, he, and he always tried to work at night because you got paid more at night, and he'd make a lot of money. And then, he was a farmer by day in, in a sense. So, he planted the vegetables, tomato, corn, you name it, and string beans a lot. He liked, liked to grow string beans in particular. I think he liked that because it grew so fast. And then, he loved to be in the river. He loved to go and fish, and he loved to, to pick oysters. And so, that was kind of his passion. He liked to be around people, but I, but in retrospect, when I look at him now, I noticed that he liked to be alone. And I think, and I was always, I was--well, I don't know how he could do it, but he would love to go in, in the sea at night, in the river at night. And I think where it was--and I'm talking about, you know, midnight and later, where it was--I guess it was a quietness about the river. And he was a great swimmer. He liked to dance, and he kind of liked to tell jokes, and he really liked to entertain. And my uncles on my mother's [Ermine Campbell Johnson] side, and my father--they got along exceptionally well. They were, like, like when my [maternal] uncle [Thomas Campbell] from Jacksonville [Florida] came to visit, he'd stay two weeks, and he and my father would be gone the whole time. And by the time, it's time for him to leave, my father would have taken him over the entire island [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]. They would have known everybody. They would have been talking. They would have been drinking (laughter), you know. And so, they got along really well.

Speaker 1: How much education did your father have?
Speaker 2: My, my father probably went to what, high school, at the most, you know. I, I never saw him, dealt with what I call the intellectual side of life. My mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] was focused on that, and, and, in fact, I think my mother brought him along on the education side of life. My father's people were from the island [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]. They focused on island life, and I don't think that they focused on educational aspects. In fact, I know they didn't. And my mother was the person that began to push education on the island. And she and a lady by the name of Annabelle--and I'm trying to think her last name right now--Gabson [Annabelle Gabson (ph.)], I think her name was, too. They really pushed education. We had a good elementary school, Rockville Elementary [Rockville Elementary School; Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]. The, the principal was a lady named Ms. Edith Frierson [Edith L. Frierson]. And she'd taught everybody, and so, like, you know, when I got there for the first grade, she said, "Oh, you're Chauncy Johnson's [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] son," you know, and things like that. So, she'd taught my father and she taught us. I remember, I got in trouble one day at school because my father came through, and I just decided to leave, and went home with him (laughter). And I came back the next day, and find everybody was looking for me (laughter). So, I don't know why he took me home with him. I told him that the principal had said I could go or something like that, so we were off. But and, in fact, my sister, my oldest sister, Ann [Anna Johnson Prioleau], and it was another lady--they were the first two to go to college from the island.
Story_ID: 647645
Speaker 1: Tell me, your siblings, your brothers and sisters, and where you fall in, in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well--
Speaker 1: Tell me their names.
Speaker 2: --my oldest sister is Ann [Anna Johnson Prioleau]. And my brother is Francis [Francis Johnson]. And then there is Beatrice [Beatrice Johnson Knight], and she lives in DeKalb County, Georgia. And then, it's Laura [Laura Johnson Winns]. And then it's Lorraine Pritch [Lorraine Johnson Shaw], P-R-I-T-C-H, Lorraine. And it's me, Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson]. And then Adolphus, Jr. [Adolphus Johnson, Jr.], he lives in Minnesota now. And then, Sandra [Sandra Johnson Gourdine], Michael [Michael Johnson]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Dexter [Dexter Johnson].
Story_ID: 647646
Speaker 1: Thinking back, when you think about living on the isl- well, before I go there, is there a story about how your mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] and father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I don't quite know how they met. I, you know, the, the island, Edisto Island [South Carolina], and Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina], Edisto [Edisto River] is probably the, the biggest river around in that region. It's a huge, deep river. And the river separates Edisto from Wadmalaw. And my father and a friend of his, they always liked to go to Edisto for dancing and all the things like that. And so, he was on Edisto Island one night; and that's how they met.
Story_ID: 647647
Speaker 1: When you think back about growing up on the island [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina], what sounds, what smells, and what sights would take you right back to that, that time? What do you think about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, first of all, flowers. As, as I said earlier, I love the springtime. And if--when you walk the island, there is nothing but natural beauty. You know, the pear trees, the plum trees, the apple orchards, the, the wildflower, just is beautiful. And then, the other beautiful sound, and then, then the contour of the land where the creeks run, and things like that. And so, then, there's a whole lot of, lot of wildlife, and I love the sounds of birds. In fact, the other night, I was on the computer trying to identify all kinds of species. And I knew, as a kid, when we walked the, the fields, and we got to the bird nests, I could look into the nest and, and knew what kind of bird it was, based on the eggs, and the colors of eggs. And some of the eggs are like really beautiful blue with black spots. I think, if I recall now, that will be the, the eggs of the blackbird with the, with the, with the deep red wing. Then, there's the canary, which is red, and they had a kind of a brown colored eggs. And then, you could walk through the, the woods, and you could hear the, the birds making sounds. And you knew, whether it was a mockingbird, or you knew whether it was a thrasher, or you know whether it was a hummingbird, or you knew whether it was a blackbird, or you knew whether it was a canary. So, those kinds of things came, and it just came naturally, because of your day to day life. And so, those are the things that I, I really remember so vividly. And then, the, the freedom of--we could, you know, just--my brother, I had two first cousins. And my brother, and the four of us, and then, there were so many other cousins and friends and all that, we were all the same age. And so, we would get up in the morning during the summertime, and then we would go swimming in the creek. And then, after we got through swimming, by the time we got through, the tide was low. Then we'd go back into the creek, and then go crabbing. And then, we'll get our crabs, and then we'll cook it, and we'd eat the crabs. And then, it's time to do something else. Many of my friends' fathers were deep sea fishermen, and by three o'clock or four o'clock, their ship will be coming in. So, we'd get on our bicycles and ride down to the dock, and wait 'til their fathers came in with their catch of the day. And so, that's what life was about, and so it--really exciting and free.
Story_ID: 647648
Speaker 1: Do you have a first childhood memory? What is your very first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the first one--there are two that I remember. The first one was my--I have a brother [Adolphus Johnson, Jr.] that's only a year younger than I, a year and a half. And for some reason, he and I had a dispute. We were fighting, and I remember my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] separating us and things like that, so that was kind of like the first time I remember my mother. And I guess, the first time I remember him, so we probably were only like three, or something at the time. I may have been three and a half, and he was two and a half. And I remember that incident. And then, one of the other incidents I remember was my father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.], and about four of my brothers--four of his brothers--were at my house, our home. And then, all of a sudden, I saw them--they were like, like big kids, and they started running. And they were--we lived on what we call the hill, and way down was the main road. And they were all, except--they were just running. And I'm like, this is the first time I really saw my father running like that, you know. And so, I start following them. And my Uncle Freddie [ph.], had a son named Herbert [ph.], and he had been in the Korean War. And he had, was coming home--I guess someone dropped him, and he was walking up the hill. He had his uniform on, and they were so excited to see him. And they just ran down there, and when they got there, they threw him down (laughter). And they were picking him up and stuff like that, and that was the first time I saw someone in a uniform. And that was--I, I probably was four years old or so at the time.
Story_ID: 647649
Speaker 1: You said you lived on the hill. Describe your house, the house that you lived in and, and your relatives that lived, and friends that lived around you [on Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, they called it a hill, but in South Carolina, everything is (laughter)--
Speaker 1: It's low country, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and it, on an island, there isn't any hill. But it was a little higher ground than everybody else. We live--if, if, if, if this chair was my house, there is a little further to the left, up the street, was where my aunt lived. We call her Blossom, but that was Dorothy [Dorothy Johnson Brown]. And the river ran around her home, and then it came through a little path up to kind of, like the front of us. And so, we lived also in kind of the front of the river. And the road ran kind of this way. And then, on the outside of the river, a little creek was where my [paternal] grandfather [Mathaias Johnson] lived. And then, across from the road on the other side, was where Uncle Samuel [Samuel Johnson] lived. And then, a little further was where Uncle Freddie [ph.] lived. Now, the first house that we lived in was a typical South Carolina house in those days, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what that is.
Speaker 2: Well, and I'm trying to remember because we moved when I was fairly young. But when you came up to the road in front of the road, in front of the house, it was just all kinds of flowers. My moth- my father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] used to tell my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson], "You, you must think this is a graveyard. You got so much flowers," (laughter), "in, in front of the house." And you come around, and there was, it was a, a wooden frame house, and kind of narrow, but long. And as you came in, around, if you came around, it was kind of like the back. And that was--you go up about three or four steps. And then, we had a kitchen on the left. And then, on the right, was kind of a dining room, now another little room. And then, back there was a dining room; and then there was another room. And then, further back, was two other rooms.
Story_ID: 647650
Speaker 1: Let's talk about traditions and language on the island there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Talk, talk to me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I think the--you have to kind of understand the derivative of, of the language. And that is that in the introduction of slavery, especially in the course of Charleston [South Carolina], it's about 90 percent of the slaves came through Charleston. And then, you have these islands off Charleston--James Island [South Carolina], Johns Island [South Carolina], Wadmalaw Island [South Carolina], Edisto Island [South Carolina], St. Helena Island [South Carolina], and a number of other islands. And as people migrated, African Americans migrated on those islands. They were--most of the islands, I guess, Wadmalaw is 98 percent African American. And the, the few white people were the big farmers. And the separation of the race was as separate as you can ever imagine. And so, you have all these people, African Americans, who--there is no real educational structure. And so, the language is a mix of a lot of different languages. For example, if you were from, a slave from Senegal, or from Gambia, or if you're from Mali, or Guinea Bissau, or some of the other western African country, you didn't even speak the same language. So, the language became a mesh of, a mesh, you might say of other languages and English. And so, then the question, and so, that's what the derivative, I would say, is what we call the Gullah language. I was, when I came from law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], after I'd gotten into law school, one of my uncle Richard [Richard Johnson], we call him Dick after Richard, owned a nightclub called the Johnson Baby Grand on Wadmalaw Island. And he had lived in New York [New York] for many years, and then retired, and came back, and he opened his nightclub. He used to go to the Baby Grand in New York, so he was (laughter) thinking about a Baby Grand, and so he built the Baby Grand. And I came there one night. And my uncles and some of their friends, who are under this big tree sitting, and they were, you know, drinking and talking and all that. And I sat among them, and I smiled to myself because I said, you know, if I were not from here, I wouldn't understand a thing they were saying (laughter). And, and yet, I understood everything. And it's kind of interesting to me because sometimes I'll read a book that's written in the Gullah, and I really can't comprehend. It's hard for me to understand what they're saying, maybe because the people who write it really don't live on, on the land, on the islands. So, the Gullah language is kind of an interesting. It's, it's kind of--I don't know if it's language that you can write. I don't know if it's language that you write that well. I don't know whether--I think people who have done that, done a great job. But it's language that, if you're part of it, you really understand it. And then, sometimes people will say to me, "Well, could you speak it to me?" And I, I really cannot, but when I go back to the island, I fall right, I can fall right back into the, the texture of the language, you might say. And I, I can talk to some of my friends, and we reminisce, and I guess we reminisce in terms of the Gullah. And so, that's how the, the Gullah language is--it's a very unique language. It, it's some changes, most substantial changes are taking place. And it's because we're all hooked up now through the communication technology. And so, everybody watch the same, watches the same television station. And we're all supposed to talk alike when we watch television. And so, we are seeing more and more of that culture shifting, and then it'll last--I would say thirty years. Beginning the last thirty years, we've had a huge migration of wealthy white people, for the most part, who have come to the island and bought land, and used it for their summer place, or try to develop it. And that brings a huge mixture of a culture, and it shifts the language. And then, we have many of the northern landowners, owners not following the tradition of what existed in the South, and, therefore, African Americans not having access to some of the places where they had access to, when they were growing up.
Story_ID: 647651
Speaker 1: What about food and, and other traditions? Are there traditions that you remember that, even if they're not practiced now, but some things that, from your childhood that were, were traditions in your home [on Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had our own entertainment in a sense because you're cut out from the, the mainland. We were fortunate in that we lived very close to Charleston [South Carolina]. We were in Charleston County [South Carolina]. So, you had the, the connection to the big city and the culture. And Charleston is just a great historical city with all of the influences. And we had, the radio station I pumped in from Charleston which is only twenty miles away. And we had two very progressive deejays, a man by the name of Bob Nichols, who was very intellectually gifted, played the, the sounds of, you know, the blues, and all the other tradition, as well as the Motown sound [Motown Records] when I was growing up. And then, a lady by the name of Flo Myers; and the two of them really dominated the culture in some of that way.
Story_ID: 647652
Speaker 1: But on the island [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina], in terms of food, you know, everything kind of grew, centered around rice; everybody ate rice every day. And on Friday, one of the traditional things was everybody ate red rice and fish. And so, and red rice that's--is rice cooked with tomato, and sometimes it has chicken in it and pepper, and all of the great spices, and it's very tasty. And then, they'll have a really good fish. And if you didn't have red rice and fish on Fridays, something is missing, you know. The, the entertainment was such that for example on a Sunday afternoon or a Saturday, or 4th of July, we would have what we call oyster roast. And the--we'd go into the, the rivers, and get the great oysters, and you have the brick cinderblocks where you put it on billeted square. And then, you build a fire under it, and then you put, you clean the oysters. When I say, clean it, I'm not talking about open it up--I'm talking about just cleaning the mud that came from the river, making sure it's clean, and then you put on top of a tin under the fire, and the oysters would open up. And as it gets hot, it opens up and, and people come in, and put some hot sauce on it, or what have you. And that would be--we call it an oyster roast, so those were the--I guess, real, a little different, those, you know, people have fish fries and all that kind of stuff but, you know, African Americans have that all over the country. But the oyster roast was, I think, something very unique to the island.
Story_ID: 647653
Speaker 1: Tell me once again, the name of the elementary school that you went to.
Speaker 2: The elementary school was Rockville.
Speaker 1: Rockfield?
Speaker 2: Rockville, R-O-C-K-V-I-L-L-E, Rockville Elementary School [Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Rockville doesn't exist in name anymore because the name was changed to Edith Frierson, F-R-I-E-S-O-N [sic.].
Speaker 1: But when you went, it was Rockville?
Speaker 2: Rockville, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the--Edith Frierson [Edith L. Frierson] was the principal of Rockville when I was there. And she was the lady that taught for about sixty-five years on the island. And she ran a really strong school. And, as I indicated, she taught my father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.], and then she taught all of my sisters and my brothers. She taught everybody on the island.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they taught, not only my generation, but the generation before me. All of the people on the island, on the island that I grew up, now, actually they really, they have very few newcomers. I was at a shrimp dock--I guess about a year ago, and I met, met a white man, and I was talking to him, and we were talking about the islands. And then, he said, "Well, I'm from here." And then, I said to him, I said, "Well, I said, do you remember Oliver Seabrook?" And he says, "No." And so, I said to him, I said, "You cannot be from the island if you don't remember Oliver Seabrook." And then, he said, "Oh, I came here about fifteen years ago" (laughter). So, the--and I said that to say that, Edith Frierson taught everybody. The, the school is interesting because my first cousin, Norma [ph.]--I remember the first day I went to school. And in those days, you know, your, your parents would take you to the school bus, but they didn't really take you to the school the first day. And so, you had one of your older cousin, or one--and Norma was only a year older than I, but she had been there the year before. So, the first day of school, Norma was my chaperone, you might say. And she took us, and then she--I remember, like yesterday, she pointed out, and she said, "That's the old school." And the old school was a green little wooden building. But when I went to school, we went into a brand new brick modern, you know, air condition- well, it wasn't air conditioned, but central heat, auditorium, everything. And it was the first year. Then I understood later when I went to law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], why that happened. What happened was that the civil rights litigation, the Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], was traveling through the courts. And the, the attorney that was representing the southern states, and in South Carolina, in particular, because the cases were coming out of South Carolina, he informed the state authorities that in order for you to win in the [U.S.] Supreme Court, you will have to show that you have equal facilities. So, South Carolina went around and built all these brand new schools for blacks. And I was the beneficiary of, of course, a very segregated school, but one that was new. And that was, and that was my first year.
Story_ID: 647654
Speaker 1: And what year did you enter--did you go to kindergarten or first grade?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten (laughter)? And the reason I laugh is because South Carolina did not believe in, in kindergartens for, for African Americans (laughter), you know. They didn't believe in pre-K. It was not any notion. So we went to first grade, and you had to be six years old actually. So, for many of my generation, we didn't get any education, except to the extent that you had a parent that could help you before sixth grade--I mean, before six years old.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, I went, though, early. My mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] had, of course, you know, a bunch of children. And she just decided it was time for me to go. And so, she said, "Well, you, you are smart. You need to go to school." So, I went, five years old--I turned five in April, and I started school in August. Normally, I was supposed to wait until the next August. And, and my mother sent the birth certificate. And I can recall, like yesterday, the principal [Edith L. Frierson] came in the classroom [at Rockville Elementary School; Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina], and she had my birth certificate, and she says, "Is anyone here by the name of [HistoryMaker] Jack Johnson?" And I just refused to (laughter)--I guess, I was embarrassed or something, so I wouldn't hold my hand up, and, and so she left. And I realized now that she was going to say that I was too young. And then, the first PTA [Parent Teacher Association], my mother talked to the, the teacher. And she said, and they talked about me being too young for--to be in first grade. But the teacher said, "Well, Jack's a good student, and I'm going to keep him," and so, that's why I ended up going to school a year early.
Story_ID: 647655
Speaker 1: And your elementary school [Rockville Elementary School; Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] goes through the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Well, we went to the, the eighth grade--actually through the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first teacher was a lady by the name of Mrs. Pyatt--no, no, no, Ms. Orr--no, Ms. Lewis [ph.]. Ms. Lewis was my first grade teacher. And she taught me first and second grade, and she was a, a very, very nice lady. She was--South Carolina has a kind of really interesting tradition--well, not tradition, there were a group of African Americans that looked white, and Ms. Lewis was one of those persons. And for the first two years, I thought Ms. Lewis was a white person. And I found (laughter), and what happened, she used to feed the birds every day. And so, I said to my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson], "Why do white people like to feed birds every day?" (Laughter) And, and she said, "Who are you talking about?" I said, "Ms. Lewis." And she said, "Oh, she's not," and then, I found out, and it was the first time I realized that she was African American. And she was a good teacher, a great person. And then, my third grade teacher was a lady by the name of Mrs. Orr, O-R-R. And then in, in fifth grade, I had a lady by the name or Mrs. Pyatt, P-Y-A-T-T. And I always thought that she was the best teacher that I've ever had in my life, maybe (unclear) for some of my law professors. She was a little lady, I remember, she was light skinned. She had her hair tinted kind of bluish gray. And she drove a pink car, Pontiac. And I was like, pray every day that she not come to school, that we have a substitute (laughter), but she was so hard, you know. I mean, and, and she taught and she was hard, and she was tart, and she was--and when I got to high school [Haut Gap High School; Haut Gap Middle School, Johns Island, South Carolina], I realized that everything that I learned, that I remembered that I learned in her class. And she was just, just one super teacher, and a really good person, you know, but you had to come to school prepared, you know. If there were five subjects, you, you were going to study her classes. I mean, she was unbelievable. Ms. Davis [ph.] taught me in sixth grade, and she introduced me to dramatics. And so, I was always in a dramatic, always in dramatics. And we were in school plays and I, I participated a lot, and in those kinds of things. And I remember when I was off to high school, she hugged me, and said, "Hey, look, I want you to go into the dramatic club when you get to high school."
Story_ID: 647656
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student. I was, you know, when I go to various schools, and I meet parents and things like that, I always got C in what we call conduct, right. Which meant that I played around a lot, and I was noisy and, and all of that. And so, I always try to let parents know that, that the children need to be normal, whatever that is. And so, that's what I was academically gifted, but I was a pain in the neck to my teachers sometimes. You know, I realize that. So, I was, I was friendly. And then, I helped out with my classmates. You know, many of us lived on the farm and, and some parents didn't see the value of education as much as my parents [Ermine Campbell Johnson and Adolphus Johnson, Sr.]. And so, some kids would stay home a lot and things like that. And we had recess, which was very important, and the, the teachers would say--I remember one time she said, "Recess starts when you finish this assignment. And if you can't finish the assignment, you know, no recess," but, and so, I finished my assignment. And I looked around, and I realize half of my classmates didn't know (laughter), and never would have finished it. So, I guess I learned something early in life. Well, I'm not going to let them make an A like I made an A, so I'll give them 60, 70 percent of the assignment (laughter). And so, I kind of wrote another paper, and I slipped it to a friend. And then, in the next ten minutes, they all were outside and, and they all kind of supported me in a special way. And so, I was, you know, if we were playing football or basketball, and you have to pick five people, they would always make certain that I was one of the guys that was picked, even if I wasn't the best player because of that kind of relationship that we build. And then, there are a lot of the, the classmates were our friends. And, for example, my best friend, during the years that I grew up, was a guy by the name of James Peterson [ph.]. And his father and my father were best friends. And so, I knew his father well, and the father knew, he knew my father. And, and when we would visit each other's home, you know, things like that, so the connection between us in elementary school [Rockville Elementary School; Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] and also in terms of family were generational. And even when I visit the island now, although the people have passed away, but all of the people that I see, were people that went to high school with me [at Haut Gap High School; Haut Gap Middle School, Johns Island, South Carolina], elementary school, or their children or somebody; and so, we're all still connected in that way.
Story_ID: 647657
Speaker 1: So, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school on Johns Island [South Carolina]. Now, I've spoken a little bit about Edisto Island [South Carolina] where my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] grew up, and Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] where I grew up. But Wadmalaw is the, the kind of the last island on that string and there's a big river that separates it from Edisto. But if you come from Charleston [South Carolina], you come into an island by the name of James Island [South Carolina]. And if you saw the, the movie 'Glory,' you'll see that the Massachusetts regiment [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment] had their first encounter on James Island. And the, and the battlefields there are marked. And my uncle [Emmanuel Campbell, Jr.] lived, my, my mother's oldest brother, lived very close to that battlefield, the little scrimmage they had there in the woods. The second island further down is Johns Island, and Johns Island is a much bigger island. But the, you know, the schools are segregated, so Wadmalaw doesn't have enough people to have its own high school. So, Johns Island and Wadmalaw had a school that was the high school. So, although I live on Wadmalaw, I was fortunate to attend high school on Johns Island. And so, I got to know all of the people on Johns Island, as well as Wadmalaw, or many of them. And the school that we went to is the name, Haut Gap [Haut Gap High School; Haut Gap Middle School, Johns Island, South Carolina], H-A-U-T-G-A-P. And Haut was an Indian [Native American] tribe that lived near the land where our high school was. And so, it's, it's really named after the Indian tribe there. And I, I guess a gap is, you know, in the old days where you go down the road and you see that gap, and that's where you turn. And so, it's Haut Gap and, and it signifies the Native American that live on that area. The, the principal of my high school, a man by the name of John E. Scott, and John Scott was a tall, slim, distinguished, very elegant man. And he carried himself in just a wonderful way. And we had--I guess another person that had a lot of influence on me was a man by the name of Nathaniel Cook, and he was the football coach, but he was also more than a coach. He was a--he just touched your life in, in a lot of ways. In the classroom, he taught in a way that made learning fun, but you like him, and so, you came to class because you kind of like him a lot and, you know, his class was going to be kind of different. In high school, I, I took, took the traditional courses. I took algebra and algebra I, algebra II, geometry. And I had a group of friends and we were kind of competitive. And so, we would, you know, get our problems. We'll work and work it and things like that. And then, when I got to geometry and algebra II, I realized that I didn't finish my tests as quickly as some of my friends did. And so, I began to see some separation in terms of, you know, a guy named Vernard Morris [ph.], who I thought, unfortunately, and another guy named Jonathan Gaster [ph.], they did not go to college, but they were better in chemistry and physics and algebra II than I was. And, and I still think about what great opportunities were lost because people didn't have the resources, or didn't have, or life didn't focus--well, not, not life focus, but they were not fortunate enough to pursue. And, and so, there were so many of my classmates that were just so gifted in so many ways, and very few went to college. And I knew that they would have done so well. And even in my elected office, I'm, I, I often think about, wow, if I'd had four or five of my classmates to be in this region [Prince George's County, Maryland] and run my campaign, and, and have the, the loyalty and the friendship and, and, and the pursuit of making life better for people, what that could have done. So, I think one of the tragedy of my high school was that so few of my classmates were able to go to college.
Story_ID: 647658
Speaker 1: Let's talk about extracurricular activities during high school [Haut Gap High School; Haut Gap Middle School, Johns Island, South Carolina]. Did you continue with drama, as your, your junior- your elementary school teacher [at Rockville Elementary School; Edith L. Frierson Elementary School, Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] said you were talented?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ms., Ms. Davis [ph.] insisted that I--and dramatic club was fairly good. And I can't recall the few productions that I played in, but we spent a lot of time there and with my classmates. I found that it was far more difficult in high school than elementary school. The, the acting was far more precise, and you really had to project. And that's why I always still admire actors and actresses because I think that there are few people that can come on a stage. And, and if there are five hundred people, everybody gets the same impression of who that person is. So, I got involved in the dramatic club. Of course, we had football which was the sport that everybody had to play. I wasn't very good at it. And then, in turns of, I, I became very active in the yearbook. And we--I, I think it was, like the something editor, I don't know what it was. Then I was the president of my senior class and, and got involved in the other activities. So, we were just busy. The school was kind of small. I think we had probably a hundred people at the most in my high school graduating class. I'm told that it was probably about eighty-five to a hundred of us. We knew each other really well. We talk a lot. School was fun for us. You know, we lived far distances because Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] is a good little distance from Johns Island [South Carolina]. And then, Johns Island is a big island on north and south. And so, you live quite a few distance from our classmates, and so we didn't see each other on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Okay. Student government? You were the president, you said, of, of your class (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the president of my senior class. I don't recall what I did during my junior year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in school. Sometimes I can remember my ninth grade really well. That's my second year at the school. And I remember the, mostly the, just around the academics, and the fun that we had to--beginning to know the various students, the football practices, the, the other activities that we had on campus.
Speaker 1: Were you in any honor societies?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know whether we had a lot of honor societies--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, because the--you, you got to kind of think in terms of Charleston in South Carolina and the, the various, and the segregated system that we had, and being a rural school system. For example, I, I was looking at my yearbook and most of the--I, I was a member of the Future Farmers of America [National FFA Organization] (laughter), you know, so.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was, and I was involved in what we call 4-H, and I don't know if people knew what that meant and 4-H means. It, it's an organization that's involved in healthy living. And I can still remember the, the pledge, the 4-H pledge. And I remember growing chickens, and raising them, and taking it to the market, and having it judged, and winning a ribbon for the kind of chicken that I breed, so that was a pretty big honor. So, we had different type activities in high school--the 4-H club, the Future Farmers of America. We were all rural. The football, the art and, and things like that. But in terms of honorary society, they were not--our schools were not members of that.
Story_ID: 647659
Speaker 1: What teacher influenced you the most? Who helped you prepare to go to college?
Speaker 2: I think, Mr. Cook [Nathaniel Cook]. There was another man by the name of Jones [ph.], Mr. Jones; Hagler [ph.]. They were teachers that, in a way tell you that you had to go on. You had to do more than just stop at high school. The English teacher, Mrs. Seabrook, was the, the person that said, "Hey, look, you, you have to go to school. This doesn't end here." And, and she talked to me about Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina]. You know, in those days, schools was--South Carolina was still very segregated. You couldn't go to the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina]. You couldn't even think--dream about those things. So, what most people went, was South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], or Benedict. My oldest sister [Anna Johnson Prioleau] had attended Benedict. My other sister attended Benedict--I mean, I'm sorry, South Carolina State. My oldest sister attended South Carolina State. My sister [Lorraine Johnson Shaw], younger than I, attended Benedict, and she was, not younger, one year older than I, and we were very close. And so, and she came home, and she was all excited, you know, about what was going on at college. And I'm like well, that's where I'm going to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, that's where I, I went.
Story_ID: 647660
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school [Haut Gap High School; Haut Gap Middle School, Johns Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: In 1966. And that was a tough time to come out of high school as a kid. The Vietnam War was really, really getting at--it's pretty close to the peak. Many of my classmates--the moment they turned eighteen, were drafted. I was lucky in a sense that I finished a year younger because I told you the, the incident of my sister so, I mean, about my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] and me starting school early (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) School early, yes.
Speaker 2: And because of that, I couldn't be drafted. And I remember in high school, the [U.S.] Army recruiter came to our house, and tried to convince my father [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] to sign me into the Army. And it was, you know, like I said earlier, my father was strong willed and determined, and, and, and, basically, in a sense, sent this man off (laughter) on his merry way, but an understanding never to come back on his property again (laughter); and that Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson] was not going to be going into the Army, at that time anyway. I did eventually go.
Story_ID: 647661
Speaker 1: So, you went to Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I went to Benedict, and it was just a tremendous experience for me, the four years that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was the president then?
Speaker 2: When I got there, the, the president [J.A. Bacoats] had just passed away. And, apparently, he had been the president for like thirty, forty years. And so, we had an interim president. And then, finally, we had--the latter part of my first year, we got a new president by the name of Ben Payton [Benjamin F. Payton], who is now the president of Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]. And so, he came in my first year and, actually, he left--I think, my senior year. So, we, well, left right after I left, and so we spent our four years together. He was a, a very gifted man. He was from South Carolina. He had acquired a Ph.D. from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and come from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and had some, you know, vision. And so, I think the media was excited about him coming back to the school. And, and I think he came back with some new ideas, and began to move the school from just a teachers institution to a real liberal arts college with the emphasis on business and technology. And, and that's the direction that I think he began to put the school in.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, tell me about your years at Benedict.
Speaker 2: Well, my years at Benedict were just tremendous growing years. I did well academically. I pledged to a fraternity which--
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: Omega Psi Phi Fraternity which, you know, I was kind of quiet, I think, and the fraternity brought a different side of my personality. You know, I was from a little rural area country. And so, I think the--Columbia [South Carolina] was a big city for us and the people that have grow- who grew up in Charleston [South Carolina] and Columbia and Greenville [South Carolina]--I think they were a, a little more enlightened in some ways. And so, it took us, it took me a little while to adjust to--not really adjust, I think, but adjust to the, the different cultures, and the way people do things. We had a lot of students from the North. My roommate was a guy by the name of Charles Collier [ph.] who was from Asbury Park, New Jersey. And he thought I was a little country (laughter). And then, the other day, I went back to--I was in Asbury Park and I laugh because I see this little town that's--look like, you know, I, I don't want, I know people from Asbury will be looking at this. And I got to be careful how I characterize their little town. And then, I'm like, oh, my goodness, he wasn't from any big town, you know, and it was just a perception. You know, I got involved in my fraternity. I got involved in academic life and, in fact, I became the president of my fraternity. And one of the things that I did, the first thing that I did, I, I--my first formal meeting was to introduce a resolution to prohibit hazing. And that did not go over well with my frat brothers (laughter) at all; but I--when I look back, I'm very pleased about that.
Story_ID: 647662
Speaker 1: We got involved in the demonstrations, as you know, this was the, the late '60s [1960s]. Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was still alive for the first two years of my college years. The civil rights struggles in South Carolina was, was going on. My oldest sister [Anna Johnson Prioleau] had been jailed when she was at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] for demonstrating. And so, that was part of what I was going to do. My folks [Ermine Campbell Johnson and Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] would not, weren't going to be happy about that, but we got involved in, in some of those activities. We got involved in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] which was really big and strong and powerful in, in those days. So, there were a lot of connection between the campus [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] and off campus activity. I remember, like yesterday, when walking from Goodson Hall, which was one of the dormitory to the cafeteria, and hearing that Dr. King had been killed, and the, the helplessness that we felt. And then, our reaction, probably that night to the, the demonstration, we began to throw rocks at cars. And really, the city ended up being closed down, quarantined. And I think it was, and, you know, I know it was a reverse of what Dr. King would have wanted because he was nonviolent. But when you are eighteen or nineteen, and you feel hopeless, and I think that's one of the things that we try to work on here in Prince George's County [Maryland]. And I--my understanding is that when people are hopeless, they tend to do things that people with hope don't do. And we felt hopeless during that time. And I re- recall the schools closed down for a week. And we went home, and I guess everybody kind of got a chance to, to moan and watch television.
Story_ID: 647663
Speaker 1: One of the other beautiful thing I remembered about Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] is that we had these seminars once a year where they would bring in people from all over the country. And I remember meeting people, like Jackie Robinson came to campus. And I talked to him and that was just a moment that I would never, ever forget. Benjamin E. Mays [Benjamin Mays] came, and I spoke to him. And Kenneth Galbraith, Galbraith [John Kenneth Galbraith], rather--I think, was from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], an economist--he came. We talked to him, you know. And so, they were always--Dr. Williams from--I think he was from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] also. And so, we got to meet really inspirational people.
Story_ID: 647664
Speaker 1: I majored in business administration and accounting and I was fairly good at it--a good student. And the professor--well, the head of the department was a man by the name of William Bartholomew [ph.], and he was probably no more than twenty-eight years old at the time. He was a Ph.D. from Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and real liberal. And he'd come--you know, the Civil Rights Movement was big, and he wanted to be a part of the African American college [HBCU] and that experience, and very progressive. And my senior year, I got, you know, the--this is after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] passed, and affirmative action. And so, these big corporations are recruiting. And the Equitable Life Assurance Society for the--of America [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial] came down and interviewed. And they offered me a job in the accounting department, and as a management trainee, and the salary was just fantastic, and I took the job. And I was on campus one day, and Dr. Bartholomew had got me involved in applying to business schools. And I got accepted to Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis], which is in St. Louis [Missouri]. And so, he says to me, "Well, I guess you're preparing for graduate school." And I said, "No, I'm going to take a job with Equitable." And he was so frustrated and he, in a kind way, gave me a great lecture. And he said, "You know, Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], if you, if you don't go to graduate school, who's going to run Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] in the future?" And I think in those contexts, I had, I was--had not thought about twenty years in the future. And, but also, it was the first time that someone had said to me that I could run a big institution. And I did take the job, but it, it stuck with me. And the next year--
Speaker 2: This was after graduation that you took the job?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, you graduated from Benedict--
Speaker 1: Benedict in 1970.
Speaker 2: --nineteen seventy [1970], okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And, what city did you go to work at Equitable?
Speaker 1: Well, I went to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: New York City. And that was a big transition from South Carolina. Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] to New York City. But, you know, not in a real sense because, you know, the, the African American community--I went to a museum one day and saw a really good exhibit on from fields to factory ['Field to Factory: Afro-American Migration, 1915-1940'] that showed the, the movement of people from the South to the major cities. And all my classmates and cousins, and even I was talking about my aunt that lived in New York City. So, if you're from South Carolina, it was no way that you didn't have a relative in New York City. That was where people went--New York and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], at least in, from my area for quote, unquote opportunities. And so, New York really wasn't a strange place for me because of the, the relationships I had there, but it was a great place in terms of the opportunity that I had. And it was--the job was really challenging; and, and I did really well. And, in fact, I often think if I stayed, I'd probably be pretty wealthy now. But anyway.
Story_ID: 647665
Speaker 1: And then, the--as I indicated, the war [Vietnam War] was going on. And, my senior year, the elections, when Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--well, it wasn't my senior year, but before that, Bobby Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, and all those people were running. And, and the issue of the fairness of the war, and who was fighting the war was a central part of that discussion. And so, they decided--the, the authorities decided to have a lottery. And I recall, like yesterday, I was on campus and got that morning, and we had something we call the canteen where everybody hung, hung out, you know, and where you saw all your friends and where you, you meet your girlfriend, and all that before you go off to class. And, and so, I walked in and, and my best friend on campus was a guy by the name of Bobby Guess [ph.], who's from Union, South Carolina--in fact, he's still my best friend. And Bobby said, "What's your birthday again, Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson]?" And I said, "April 3rd." And they go down the list, and then he, "Oh," you know he's so disappointed 'cause my lottery number was eighty-three. And the [U.S.] military in those days used to tell you that if your number was from one to whatever, that you must understand that you're going to be in the war, or you're going to go to the [U.S.] Army. You will be drafted. And if you're like from two hundred to something, then you, you shouldn't plan your life, but--and if you're in the bottom, you forget about it--just go and plan. And so, Bobby was in the three hundred and something, and I was eighty-three. And so, I was just dejected that day on the campus. So, I took a job, and then I--my brother-in-law, my sister's, my sister [Lorraine Johnson Shaw] that's about two years older than I, she had graduated from Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] before me. And my brother-in-law and she got married. And she married a man by the name of Lathan Shaw [ph.], and he was an academician, and taught at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]--history. And so, he says to me, "Hey, look, I got into the, the reserve [U.S. Army Reserve], and I can get you in," because in those days, the reserve was only for rich kids. And if you're in the reserve, you didn't go to the war. And so, he was able to get me into his unit. And I got into the unit, and I left Equitable [Equitable Life Assurance Society of America; AXA Financial], and went to Seattle [Washington]. I flew to Seattle, and then took a bus from Seattle to Tacoma, Washington where I trained at Fort Lewis [Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington]. That was in March of '71 [1971]. I could remember--I got sent to Lewis, it was raining, raining, raining--cold rain. And the, and it's very cold up in that area of the country, early March. And although I was a country boy, I wasn't used to being out in the field at night training. And I remember one night it was just so cold that we were in the field. And we were on (unclear) back, and we were going to spend three nights out there. And, you know, the Army teach you, how you, you know, make, show you--you change your clothes, so you could not have problems with your feet and all that. But it was so cold, me and my tent mate, we said, you know, we're just going to sleep like this. And so, we just, we kept our boots on, we kept our clothes on, and we just stayed like that for three days. So, when I got back to the, the, to the company area, I saw the barracks, and the barracks look like the Hilton. It looked like the best Hilton (laughter). And then, from there, I went to Fort Sam Houston, Texas [San Antonio, Texas] where I trained as a combat medic. And I stayed there until we completed our training. And then, of course, then we were going to go back to civilian life. But I do remember all of the young people that I met, and all the friends I met while I was in the Army, and they were from all over. And I met this guy from Texas, and he and I became--Thomas Hagen [ph.], he and I became really good friends. He went to Vietnam and spent a year there, didn't do well.
Story_ID: 647666
Speaker 1: Interestingly, when I was in--grew up in South Carolina, you know, I talk about Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina]. And there were these big plantation owners and the, the, the one that I knew best was a guy by the name of Oliver Seabrook. And he was a big, big farmer and pretty well off. Then it was the Whaleys and some other folks on the island where many of the African Americans worked on the farm and ran the farm for them. And Oliver Seabrook had a number of children. I knew them from a distance and I worked for a lady by the name of Meryl Whaley [ph.] and she had a, a son, a grandson who was my age, but they would never speak to us. And so, when I would work for her and her grandson came, you know, he would never look at me, and I wouldn't look at him. We just didn't speak. And I say that to say that when I got to Seattle, Washington, Tacoma, Washington, and we were in a company one day--company, which is a [U.S.] military company, and people were calling out where they were from. And I say I was from South Carolina. The next thing I knew, this big, fat, white guy comes up to me and said, "Golly, Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], you're from South Carolina. I'm from South Carolina, too--we homeboys" (laughter). And, and so, he and I became fairly good friends during the time that we were trained, so I was kind of laughing about it that I had to leave. I had to go from South Carolina to Tacoma, Washington, which is three thousand miles to, to meet a white person that, that we communicated on the same level. We were both from South Carolina.
Story_ID: 647667
Speaker 1: So, you were in the reserves [U.S. Army Reserve] for how long?
Speaker 2: Well, six years, actually--
Speaker 1: Six years?
Speaker 2: Six years. And we, you know, we trained and did all the, the kinds of military stuff like that and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, I--but after I left the [U.S.] military, I went back to New York [New York] for about six months. And then I went, then I decided, instead of going to business school, University of Washington [sic. Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], that I would go law school.
Speaker 1: How did you decide that you would go to Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I was in my senior year in college [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], I thought about law school. And I got--and I applied only to one law school, which was the University of South Carolina [University of South Carolina School of Law, Columbia, South Carolina]. And I can't remember the dean's name, but he was one--and I think he was from Charleston [South Carolina], but he was one of these old kind of redneck deans. And he called me in for an interview. And, and then he accepted me into the law school, but he accepted me in a real unique way. He said, "Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], I think I'm going to give you a try."  (Laughter) And I have never forgotten that, so I decided that I don't think I was going to take that try.
Story_ID: 647668
Speaker 1: We were talking about how you decided to go to Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your experience now at Howard.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, after I decided not to go to the University of South Carolina [University of South Carolina School of Law, Columbia, South Carolina], and having left South Carolina for a couple of years, I got a chance to see it from a different perspective, and realized that the university was going to be too limiting for me. And so, I decided to go to Howard. When I was at Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia South Carolina], a man by the name of Herbert O. Reid [Herbert O. Reid, Sr.] had come to Benedict to recruit, and had mentioned--from Howard actually--and really wanted me to come down, to come up to the university. And then, when I was at Benedict, a man by the name of Hagler had taught me--I'm sorry, not Hagler--can't think of his name at, at the moment, but it will come to me in a minute. And he taught, and he was a Howard University law graduate. And I thought he was probably the most knowledgeable and brilliant person I met intellectually. And so, I wanted to, so he, he kindled my interest in law. And so I went to the, the Howard law school. And I got to say that has been the best experience of my life--the, the three years there were transforming. It, it gave me a worldview of the society. It, it created for me a, a vision of what democracy, and equal protection, and justice, and the rule of law means in a free society. It, it reinforced a whole African diaspora for me, and gave me a, a connection to the whole of Africa, through the Caribbean and, and Americas, and touched those whole concepts for me. It, in a way, helped me to understand my obligation and, and, and a requirement that, that we have to make a difference. And when I became the district attorney [in Prince George's County, Maryland], all of the issues that I pursued were issues that were fundamental to the constitution of liberties and equal protection, and the, and the, and what the university represented in the American culture, and how it was a change agent for people of color and for freedom. And I became a part of that legacy. And so, Howard has been the fon- life defining and life changing for me. And then, the, the greatest achievement I thought that I have ever received, or the greatest honor was a couple of months ago when Howard gave me its distinguished alumni award in, in the 140th year of the university. Hundreds of thousands of graduates, they've honored 250 people as distinguished alumni. And I was given the honor as one for community service in politics. And so, that was to think that I came from Wadmalaw Island [South Carolina], and to go to a university like Howard and there, I was fortunate to learn under great professors and great students, and but they thought me worthy to honor me like that. I, I often say that I've forgotten many of the details of constitutional law and evidence, and the things that I studied there. But the lessons I learned at Howard, I will never forget, you know, professors that taught me the whole concept of preparation, and hard work, and devotion to a task and, and intellectual effort in, in the context of changing lives was just so meaningful to me.

Speaker 1: Do you remember who the president of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes, President Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek]. And I thought he was a thoughtful man, a very smart man. He was a visionary. He was Afrocentric. He understood, I think, the politics of the university in the setting of American life. He did things that students were--in all idealism probably thought wasn't proper. And now, as I am of the age that he was, or older (laughter), I can understand exactly why he did the things that he did. He was a great leader for the university and a great leader, I think, in American society.

Speaker 1: Who were some of your classmates at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, quite a number of them. Wendell Webster [Wendell W. Webster], who is a very good friend of mine, was the editor-in-chief of the law journal [Howard Law Journal]. Alice Gresham [Alice Gresham Bullock], who became--was a very good friend--she became the dean of the law school. And there were just so many others. Joe Irving [ph.], who was the first person that invited me into his home. And he's had a distinguished career in biking. Victor Tynes [ph.], a guy from Greensboro, North Carolina. The very first day I came and I met him, and I said, "How is Washington, D.C.?" He said, "Look, Washington is wonderful. There's only one problem with Washington. It doesn't have home rule." I said, "What is home rule?" He said, "They can't vote." And I'm like, "What do you mean, people can't vote?" And so, here was a student in 1972 talking about the essence of democracy for the people that live in the District of Columbia. My roommate was a guy from Louisiana, Dennis Dawson, who now lives in California. He's doing extremely well there, but he's from Louisiana, went to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], undergrad school, came to Howard law school, very smart, played the saxophone. I was a good cook and, you know, so we would, and so, I would cook, and after exam and, you know, invite some friends over. And he said, "Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], you know what, man? We are living good, we are living good." So, Brenda Wood [Brenda Wood Kahari], who was just really gifted, moved to Zimbabwe, and has lived in Zimbabwe now for thirty years. The last time I spoke to her, she had a British accent. I said, "Brenda, you've changed." She was from Ohio, and also from Washington, D.C., got to know her a little differently in the last four or five years, and learned about her struggles, how her parent- mother died young, and she grew up with her sister, and things like that I didn't know. And so, you end up knowing things about your classmates long after the school and realize the fortitude that they had and, and what brought them through. She was very gifted, very bright, kind of on the shy side.
Story_ID: 647671
Speaker 1: You received your degree [from Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] in 1975?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I moved to Atlanta [Georgia], actually with the Office of the Chief Counsel [sic. Office of Chief Counsel] for the Internal Revenue Service and, of course, Atlanta was the region. And when I went down there, I was the, unfortunately, the first African American to, to ever work as an attorney in the entire Southeast for the IRS. And I say that, unfortunately, because there are just so many brilliant people that, that didn't have the opportunity--they should have had the opportunity long before I got there. The, the regional counsel was a guy by the name of Henry Stockel [ph.] and he was from Maine. And he was a short, heavy built, bald head, real traditional conservative man, but he was the best boss I've ever had. He was a hard task master. When he had a meeting, I would set two clocks because it was no way that you would not be at his meeting on time. But at the same time, he would, he was fair. And I have been at a lot of places where I was discriminated against over the years, but I can really say that because of who he was, no one discriminated against me in his office. So, that was one of the major lessons for me is that it starts at the top. And people may have personal views about things, but if--it's not going to be tolerated at the top, they wouldn't do it. And my understanding--I don't know how true this is, but I think it is that he called all of the, the lawyers in the office, and said that I was coming down, and that I was going to be treated like everybody else, and that if they were going to have a party, even at their home, and if they were going to invite all the lawyers, then they're going to invite all the lawyers, but they were not going to invite some of the lawyers, and not invite all the lawyers. And so, and so I was, I look back, and I wonder how I got invited to everybody's Christmas party (laughter). But that's the way he was. He left there, and he became the general counsel for the, the [U.S.] Department of the Treasury. I left a little after and came back to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Well, you were there for how many years?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked at--see, the chief counsel is really one office, and the regional counsel is just a part of the chief counsel. So, I worked in the Atlanta office for a year there, and when I was there, I practiced tax law, but basically, collection and bankruptcy. So, I learned a lot about bankruptcy and, and companies that go bankrupt. They owe a lot of taxes and how do the IRS collects its taxes and, and what, the claims and things like that, that we pursued in bankruptcy.
Story_ID: 647672
Speaker 1: And then, I came to the, the national office. And in the national office, I went into what we called the interpretative division. And the interpretative division was the, what we call the, the lawyers' lawyers for the chief counsel. And so, the chief counsel had a thousand lawyers, and those of us who were in the interpretative division--well, first of all, you, you only got there if you had huge recommendations. And so, I was one of the, the lawyers, and we set all of the legal policies and rulings for the chief counsel's office [Office of Chief Counsel]. So, if there were a litigation issue, for example, in Texas, and another one in California, and another one in New York, and people had different views, then we would write what is the position of their, the chief counsel. And once we wrote that position, then everybody followed it within the chief counsel. Now, you just don't write it. You have to have all of the legal basis, the intellectual support, because if you were challenged, unbelievable, you know, to tell somebody in another office that your position, or your intellectual thought is not going to be followed. Well, you're going to be challenged and so, it, it was an office that required a lot of intellectual rigor, a lot of discipline and, and precise writing in terms of putting, to establishing your position (laughter). I've, I can give you a little story. First case, one of the first cases I had, I learned politics in this one, too. I got this case, and I decided that it was not intellectually sound. So, I reversed it, and then I wrote, you know, why it was not intellectually sound. Now, I didn't know that--I, I knew, but to show how naive I was--the, my supervisor was the person that I reversed (laughter). So, you can imagine, the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], of course, is when- whenever you brought your product, it was your best product. So, you know, you cannot say, well, this is my thought because it was the only way you can evaluate a person, so you bring your very best product. So I, so I, after I've done that, I sat down with him, and I could see the steam coming out of him. He says, "You know, Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], I've read this memo six or seven times, and I haven't seen anything that would convince me that X, Y, Z should happen. In fact," and then he went on to mark all, all these, you know, so I came up here and I say, oh, I see I made a mistake and, but anyway, after that, he and I got along pretty well.
Speaker 2: Now, what office are you in because you left Atlanta [Georgia], and where did you go?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I went to the chief counsel's office.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we had--within the chief counsel, if you were in the Southeast, you were in the Southeast region. If you were in the Northeast, you were in the Northeast region. They're all under the umbrella of the chief counsel.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But then, when I came, I came to the chief counsel's office, what was called main office. And then, I was in the interpretative division of that office. We have ruling regulations division.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: We have, what we have the--
Speaker 2: So you--
Speaker 1: --criminal tax division, and all of those things.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the interpretative division kind of serves as the attorney (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Attorneys--
Speaker 1: --for all of the other divisions.
Speaker 2: --all the attorneys. I gotcha.
Speaker 1: At least, that's the way it was in my day.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 647673
Speaker 1: And so what happens now? 'Cause you're there, actually working for the chief counsel's office [Office of Chief Counsel] for nine years. Is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, eight years--
Speaker 1: Eight years?
Speaker 2: --because I was in the chief regional counsel for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I specialized in partnerships and corporation transactions. So, when you read about these reorganizations, the big companies that are reorganizing or one company is buying the other, we make certain that all of the--they normally will request a ruling on the, the significance of their transaction and what are the tax consequences. And, of course, they have one position, and we normally will make certain that it is a position. We always say that the chief counsel is that it is not the form, but the substance, and it is what it is. So, if you call your organization a trust and, but when we analyze it, and then we determine that it's not a trust, then it's not a trust. If you call your organization a partnership, and, therefore, you want to get tremendous tax benefits to the individuals, but when we analyze the transaction, and if it's not a tran- if it's not a partnership, we're going to tax it at what we see. And so, I say that to say that, you know, you're talking about a huge corporation. And there is just a lot of intellectual preciseness in terms of the interpretation of the tax code that comes with it. One of the, the great cases that I worked on was the--show you how old I am--is the Chrysler bankruptcy. And the, the, the issue that I worked on was Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC], of course, issued so much debt. In other words, it borrowed money from folks, and, you know, the bonds that they sell. And many of those bondholders were foreign holders. And so, the question was, when Chrysler reorganized, do you have the same debt, or you have different debts? And if you have different debts, then you have huge tax consequences. And so, I worked on, on issues like that.
Story_ID: 647674
Speaker 1: You know, the, the challenge that we had at the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] is that other thousand lawyers that they had, 90 percent, 95 percent, or 97 percent were white, and they were all connected in some ways. When I was there, the, the Irish Catholic for the most part, controlled the IRS. And, and, so there were lots of institutional issues that the African American lawyers had to overcome in order to be promoted, and things like that. And so, we had a lot of challenges that we worked on, so not only in terms of you have to meet the high rigor, but meeting that it's just not enough to be promoted. There's a kind of a, they were a really glass ceiling, good old boy network. There was a man by the name of Joe Hairston [Joseph Hairston], who hired most of the African Americans, and I think was really helpful. And, in fact, we probably had more African American lawyers at the IRS when I was there than we now have percentage wise, so I think the number has declined. And, and the reason that we had as many is because you had someone who believed and recruited, and forced his way around the naysayers and, and it made a big difference. And so, I was involved in the recruiting and, and also to, for many years, mentored a lot of the young lawyers in terms of the kind of product they had to produce at the IRS.
Story_ID: 647675
Speaker 1: So, what happens when you leave the IRS [Internal Revenue Service]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Well, why did you leave the IRS?
Speaker 2: It, it was a great experience. It was a little confining, I think. I, I just don't know if I wanted to spend my life doing that--just sitting, and reading, and writing, and thinking. I think those things are great, but in the context of coming into an office, staying at a little booth, or having, or arriving where you get a window office, and, and spend the rest of your life, you know, arguing about tax law, it's, it's significant. It's important, but, you know, at the end of the day, you, what we are really talking about, really the consequences of transaction that rich people enter into. So, I began to look around, and I had a number of really great offers out of the region, but one that really intrigued was to teach at a law school. And North Carolina Central law school [North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina] was really fascinating for me. One of the--the kind of unspoken thing was that African Americans were, at least in my day, were not smart enough to be tax lawyers and, and many of us moved away from tax law. And so, the opportunity to teach tax law at what I thought was a predominantly African American law school, which is really fascinating. Now, when I got there, I found out that we probably had more white people than we had African Americans at the law school. But nonetheless, in any given class, the, the percentage of African Americans would have been very significant, almost 50 percent in some classes, even more. And so, I taught for four and a half years actually at North Carolina Central, and it was really a fascinating time. I taught income tax which is the, the general introduction to tax law. I taught partnerships, and I taught corporation reorganization. I taught taxation of accounting, and those type courses. And there was a really a--I, I found that the, the, the students' excitement--and which is amazing--and the ability was equal. Sometimes you had to break down some of the concepts a little differently, and so you have to work through a concept until you get to the real teaching. And, for example, when I taught the time value of money in the, the deferral area of tax law, I walked through some basic concepts early on, like that, maybe if I were in another school, I would've just jumped over. And so, I would say little things. I'd say, "Okay, you have a hundred--." I'd say, "We're going to talk about the time value of money, and as we deal with the deferral area of tax law. And the question is what, if more--what, what's worth more. Is a hundred dollars earning 2 percent worth as much as ninety-eight dollars worth earning 7 percent?" And so, the person has to sit down there and figure out, and once they do the arithmetic, they realize that the ninety-eight dollars earning 7 percent is worth more than a hundred dollars. Well, for some, that, that may be simplistic, but for some folks that grew up on Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] and other areas, that's a concept that's kind of new for them because a hundred dollars seems like it's always worth more than 97 percent. And, and, so, the, the, the deferring of income has significant economic value if the deferral brings a, a return greater than the present value of money, and so, that's what we--or the present value of, of a, of a dollar. And so, we talked about those kinds of things; and then, I would get into it.
Story_ID: 647676
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the school was fascinating. I got very involved on the admission committee, and also on the hiring committee. And make certain and, and in those two things, I was interested in two things: one, making certain that we get enough women in the law school at the time; two, that we get enough minorities, African Americans and others; and three, that we balance the admission between urban and, and rural folks, so that we can have a really good mixture. And that really was, for me, the essence of what we call affirmative action, and that there are so many talented people. And all of the people that we admit were qualified, but you have so many applicants that quote, unquote are qualified, and so how do you bring in a law school that's reflective of the community? And so, Central [North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina] was a great part for that. But anyway, you know, life requires you to move on. And I left Central back in 1987, and really had a total transforming of, of my career.
Story_ID: 647677
Speaker 1: So, you tell me that your career takes a, a different turn?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, a career and my personal life took a--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: --a pers- a different turn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], I, I met my wife. Her name is Leslie [Leslie E. Johnson]. She was a year junior to me. We--she was, she grew up in New York, and she was from, and she attended Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee]. And so, we began to date in law school, and we got married after I finished law school--well, after I begin to practice. And so, when I came back from Washington [D.C.]--I mean, from Atlanta [Georgia] to Washington is, is when I got married. And we got married, and we settled down in the Washington area. And she started off with the Legal Services Corporation. And now, she does--she's a hearing officer for the District of Columbia hearing and (unclear) and regula- and does regulation, and also (unclear) on to the county council--I mean to the city council--on its (unclear) issues. We have three children. My oldest daughter is a, is a medical doctor, and she's married now, and she lives in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Nia [Nia Johnson Jones], and she and her husband--her husband is also a doctor--and his name is Thomas [Thomas Jones]. And they have a little son, Christian [ph.], and so, and they're doing well in Houston. And we, and then my middle son has my name, Jack [Jack Johnson, Jr.], and he's a Howard graduate. He graduated in 2000 with a degree in finance. And he's in the banking business and works with a big home finance company, and he does a number of things for them. And so, he's doing really well. And then, my youngest, Zachary [Zachary Johnson], will be graduating from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in two weeks actually, the end of May of 2007. And--in the middle of May, I'm sorry, and he is going to join Wachovia [Wachovia Corporation; Wells Fargo and Company] in the investment banking area, so he's moving to Charlotte [North Carolina]. And as he and I were driving to Charlotte to find an apartment, I talked to him a little bit about the reverse migration. I said, "When I was growing up, it's no way that an African American would be moving to Charlotte for a job. You know, it would normally be moving to the North for banking and other things."
Story_ID: 647678
Speaker 1: And after I left the, the teaching [at North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina], my classmate, one of my schoolmates rather, a guy by the name of Alexander Williams [Alexander Williams, Jr.], ran for state's attorney in Prince George's County. And as Prince George's County is the second largest county in the State of Maryland and at, at that time, you begin to have the migration of the middle class African Americans from the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.]. And many of them were migrating east into Prince George's County, so the numbers were changing. And one night, Alex came to my home and said, "Look, I'm going to run for state's attorney, and I would like for you to be involved in my campaign, and I would like for you to be the treasurer." He knew of my financial background. And so, I jumped at the opportunity to help him out. And, but as the campaign evolved, I got more and more involved in the campaign, not only in terms of treasurer, but running a lot of the day to day activities. And after the--we won, and it was, it, it was just a transforming victory for Prince George's County. It was the first time that they had elected an African American countywide, and this was really a big shift in politics. Alex asked me to come in and be his deputy. And so, so the chance to do something different like that was exciting. And so, I went in, and I ran the office for him--ran the budget, got involved in all of the criminal justice issues; worked in the community.
Story_ID: 647679
Speaker 1: Alex [Alexander Williams, Jr.] served for eight years. And then, Presiten- President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] named him to a federal judge, to sit in Greenbelt [Maryland], which is in one of the areas in the county and the, the vacancy opened up. And my election was probably more difficult than Alex in some ways because at that time, the, the, the old, good old boys decide that they really wanted the office back. And so, there were--and it was an attempt to appoint someone, but the attorney general blocked it. And so, my election was difficult, but we won, we won a landslide. The day before the election, people were predicting that I wouldn't win. And then, I think my Howard University [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and, and my father's [Adolphus Johnson, Sr.] traits brought me into an issue that was really, had been disturbing me for years. And that is the brutality of the police department in the county.
Speaker 2: Before, before you go into that, who was the attorney general at that time?
Speaker 1: Curran [J. Joseph Curran, Jr.], and he was the attorney general with the state, and he issued a ruling indicating that the, the judges in the--out here in Prince George's County [Maryland], could not have appointed someone that they wanted to replace Alex, and that the, that they really didn't have a vacancy. And so, that really gave me a better opportunity to win the, the seat.
Speaker 2: And, and this was for state attorney's?
Speaker 1: And this is for the state's attorney which is the lead prosecutor--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for the office.
Story_ID: 647680
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so, when I got into the, the office, we begin to chal- not challenge, but take on the whole issue of police brutality. Our police department had a reputation for that, and it was well known, and probably deserved. And so, that was a really challenging prosecution, but not so much in terms of the prosecution, but the politics of it. I didn't realize, at the time, how the--institutionally, the police get so much support from all the politicians in the state, all the institutions, the newspapers--you have it, and the, and the judges, and the whole criminal justice system. And so, that those cases were very challenging and, in fact, the first case that I charged, I could not get anyone in the office to prosecute the case. So, we had to--I end up firing two of the, the lawyers for failing to carry out their constitutional duties to, to ensure that justice is served fairly. And, and that, interestingly, there is a guy that I had met named Lloyd Johnson, last name--he called me. He was a prosecutor. He said, "Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], if you hire me, I'll, I'll try the cases." And so, I hired Lloyd, and Lloyd came on, and tried those cases. We had a number of all the cases. And then, I set out to, to make certain that the face of the office represented the face of Prince George's County [Maryland]. And so, we began to hire a lot of young African American lawyers. And there were lots of criticism by the media claiming that my lawyers were not as well qualified as traditional lawyers had been, and those kinds of things. But not only were they well qualified, they were more qualified, and they've all done so well over the years. And so, those were the, the eight years of my prosecution years.
Speaker 2: What was the makeup of the police department?
Speaker 1: Well, they were probably getting 40 percent African American at the time, pretty close to it, at least 30 percent. But the, the, it was kind of interesting how so many of the African Americans, or a number of them, had taken on that whole custom. And so, when I talked about prosecution, I had to prosecute black officers, as well as white officers. It wasn't that--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we were prosecuting only white officers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 647681
Speaker 1: And, you know, we worked really hard. We, we brought crime down, and we built a kind of a reputation. And, and so, the, the people in the community were really pleased with that. And the, the county is, as, as I indicated, it's the large, second largest county in the state. It's the richest predominantly African American county in the United States. It's a really wealthy county. We have more people earning, families earning $150,000 than five of the counties in the state. We, having the greatest economic boom that you can ever want to see. I mean, the rate of growth in terms of economic activities, like 11 percent a year, the huge budget of about $3 billion a year. We got 140,000 students in our school system. We fund them to the point of $1.5 billion a year. The general assembly [Maryland General Assembly], we have the second largest delegation that represent us in Annapolis [Maryland]. The president of the Senate [Maryland Senate] is from Prince George's County [Maryland]; the chairman of the, the budget and taxation committee [Maryland Senate Budget and Taxation Committee]; the, the vice chair of the ways and means committee [Maryland House Ways and Means Committee]. You have the chairman of the judiciary committee [Maryland House Judiciary Committee], so we are a very powerful county, economically and politically. And so, after I served my term as county--as a state's attorney for eight years as a district attorney, we--I ran for county executive; and was elected by a great, a good margin.
Story_ID: 647682
Speaker 1: And so what we have done is create what I call a livable community and--
Speaker 2: Livable community?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that concept really goes back to my childhood on Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] where we had the freedom to roam, and see the beautiful flowers and the birds, and where there were great families, and, and a child could grow, and hope, and dream. And so, what we do then is that we start with the aesthetics and the visual because we are, to a large extent, what we see. And so, we create a, a beautiful--we set out to do a--if there's a lot of money, in creating the aesthetics of our community, to make it clean, to plant a lot of trees, to make certain that the roads are, are paved properly, that the sidewalks are there, that, that the older neighborhoods are rebuilt. The whole idea that if you move in a neighborhood thirty-five, forty years ago, you're old now, and older people cannot lift their legs high. And if the sidewalks are crumbling or buckling, it's, it's a problem. And so, we work to, to first create the, the visual aspects of how to live, so that the young people can feel good about their neighborhoods. And when they get off the bus from schools, or what have you, they begin to feel good. We tried to do things to connect people, so people, so that the neighborhoods are not isolated. And so, and, and we have developers to make certain that they maintain a certain amount of the trees and natural buffers. And then, the second part of the livable community is that you have to invest huge amount of monies into education. And education for us is what I call lifelong learning.
Speaker 2: Was this a problem before you came to office because, as this being one of the richest counties [Prince George's County, Maryland], was there a problem with the schools? Was there not enough money being funded to the schools?
Speaker 1: No, yeah, we were very underfunded--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in, in our educational arena. And, you know, we set out to correct that. The last two budgets, we were able to basically, just literally, give the school system whatever they asked for. In the last three years, we have added 100 million additional dollars every year to the school system. So, we, this year alone, we, we're going to add $190 million more than we added last year. And the year before, we added $126 million more. So, we're just investing huge amount of monies into schools, especially in the pre-K [pre-kindergarten] areas where, you know, we, we understand that if you don't teach and learn at the early years, you're always behind. And if you don't do it by third grade, you're really behind. So, we, we put a lot of money, and we think that the second leg, as I indicated, of a livable community, you got to have a beautiful clean place, really nice and pleasing, places where you can kind of roam a little bit, where kids can kind of dream, feel good about their neighborhood. And then, we have a great school system with a huge amount of monies.
Story_ID: 647683
Speaker 1: And then the third part of it is the safety aspect. People want to--not they want to, they have to live in a safe environment. And, you know, although we are a very rich county, we are a challenged county on the same hand because we have a lot of apartment complexes and close to the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.]. And we have a lot of challenges there, and we have a lot of poverty. And so, we have to work hard to make certain that we have healthcare for everybody. And that the, and that the, those negatives that affect so many of the issues, so many of life in African American community affect us, but that we work hard to try to, to overcome many of those. And, and so, it's all--everything revolves around a livable community. And then, the other part of it, of course, is the healthcare issue that I talked about. We have ninety thousand people in our county that doesn't have health insurance, and so, we build, we are building a number of clinics around the place. But the, the idea, though, is that if you're going to build a clinic, it has to have the same qualities that you and I would insist on if we're going to the doctors. When you put people in a second class environment, they cannot feel good about them self in the environment. And, and, and so, how children see themselves has so much to do with their achievement. Now, you know, Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina], I didn't have, we didn't have any resources, financial resources. But it was a different environment where we could feel good about our self, where I could walk across the fields and, and listen to birds, and be a part of the 4-H club, and go swimming, and go crabbing, and that was our life. And so, you don't really need a lot of money. We get on our bicycle, and if we had twenty-five cents, we could ride to the store, and get a bottle of soda. And we were happy, you know. We didn't, you know, I was reading a book and it, in fact, it's by Sidney Poitier called 'What Man of a Man' [sic. 'The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography'], I think it is. And he talked about what they didn't have, and the, and the thing that he talked about what they didn't have, was that they didn't have the negative influences. And I think that's what Wadmalaw didn't have. It didn't have the negative influences. And so, the question then is how do we eliminate the negative influences from life in Prince George's County [Maryland]?

Speaker 1: We are so financially well off. We have a project that we're building in this county that's--it's the fourth largest project in the world. It's the biggest project on the East Coast.
Speaker 2: That's the National Harbor and (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's the project. Alone it's going to have six thousand employees at one place. On the other part of the county, there is a place called Konterra [Maryland]. It's going to be bigger than that project. That's being developed. We have the flagship university in the State of Maryland, University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland]. They're building a huge research center. We have the weather prediction center [NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, College Park, Maryland] that's there, the Center for the Study of Languages [sic. Center for Advanced Study of Language]. There are some other developments that are going around there on the two, two quarter. It's being developed. University, Uni- I mean, University Park [Maryland] is another area that's just huge, and that's a billion. So, it, it's all kinds of economic that are coming, but the question is how do we prepare our young people for those challenges with BRAC. That's a base alignment [base alignment and closure]. Right next to us is a, a [U.S.] military base that's going to bring fifteen thousand new employees. I met with them the other day. Most of the, the jobs are in the technical area, of course, the pier, the signs, the engineering--unbelievable. And opportunities--I met yesterday with a company, and I was meeting with them because the International Brotherhood of Electric- Electrical Workers [International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers] wanted me to talk to them about ensuring that they hire many of the workers, or the union members who live in Prince George's County [Maryland]. This company tells me that they have a training program for electricians and, and pipe fitters, and boiler makers all over the world. And they're looking for people that are interested. They have a really good program where they pay 80 percent, but they require the individual to pay 20 percent because of the psychological commitment. And they're ready to put these people in a apprenticeship program. And I say, all that to say that there are just so many opportunities for our young people. But the challenge is for us to, to get them away from the drug culture, the culture that glorified violence, the negative environment. It, it's just a huge challenge for us as leaders. When we have almost 50 percent of African Americans in this country, males that are dropping out of high school. It, it's a crisis, and it's something that we just have to recognize is a crisis. And we can't ignore it anymore, when we have our jails filled out with young people. It, it's a huge challenge, so we can live and I can go to neighborhoods in my county where every house is more than a million dollars. And every home in the neighborhood is a minority, and 95 percent of those homes are African Americans. And that's beautiful to see those achievements, but on the other hand, we still have a tremendous challenge. And so, we have it in Prince George's County, and we have it all over the country. And it's something that we, we have to do, but I think that the, the livable community, where we start with how we view our self, and how the environment is, is the right environment to grow up in, is, is a really fundamental place to start.

Speaker 1: Well, you have a, a big challenge, and this is actually your second term. Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And at the end of this term, I would have spent twenty years in public life. And anybody who understands public life in America knows that that's a very long time, especially in a region like the Washington [D.C.] region, where the spotlights of major newspapers and all the institutions are always focusing on you.
Speaker 1: Has that been a challenge for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it, it has been a challenge. It is a challenge. You know, when you come from--one of the elected officials here say to me, in, in jest. He said, "Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], you come here to Prince George's County [Maryland], you get elected." He said, "I cannot go to South Carolina, and get elected." And this is, and he was laughing about it. But I was not, and am not one of the, the, the chosen, I would say. The major newspaper in this region has never endorsed me. I've won eight elections without the endorsements. It--not that it would make a difference, but it, if, it, it only say that I'm, that my challenge is greater, and under greater, I would say, scrutiny. But, but that's fine, too. I think, coming from Wadmalaw, South Carolina [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina], where you learn early to use whatever talents you have, and whatever help you get, and you're able to make good choices, and you learn those choices early on in life. You know, and you make early decisions, I think, sometimes even coming home late in the evening when it's--and no one tells you this, but it's--there's a blackberry patch. But you know that, instinctively, that the snakes are out, out there because they eat a lot of blackberry. So, you just take a longer way home. And I mean, no one tells you that, and you're seven or eight years old, and you learn to make those kinds of choices. And so, I guess, in politics, you still have to avoid some of--
Speaker 1: The blackberry patch (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). Not the blackberry patch as much as those who circle the blackberry patches (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: You talked in the very beginning about your grandmother, and the fact that you, you stayed in church a lot. Has that been a part of your life growing up and into your life today (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Well, let me say this. No, when I, I was talking about my [maternal] uncle [Thomas Campbell], and when I went over to his, visit him in Jacksonville [Florida]. They were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in church a lot. I talk about my grandmothers [Laura Singleton Campbell and Victoria Middleton Johnson] in, in ways that you would think that I knew them, and I never met any of my grandmothers. And, in fact, the only grandparents that I knew was my father's father [Mathaias Johnson].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, we, we went to church, but not like people do in the Washington area. I, I found that to be really interesting because you would think that on the island, it'll be different. But the church services on Wadmalaw [Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina] are much shorter than the services that I attend in Washington, D.C. Now, we went to Sunday school just about every Sunday, but, you know, if, if something were happening and we didn't go, but, normally, we did. And my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson], and there were two ladies that taught Sunday school, Mary Jane Johnson, and Stella Peterson [ph.]. And then, after that, we would have church, but by 1:00 or 12:30, we were out. And then, what we did have is a big dinner that my mother cooked, and we always had company on Sunday evening. And so, for South Carolina folks, this big Sunday dinner, you know, they wanted to get back home to get to that big Sunday dinner (laughter). But all the family, 'cause many of them came from, you know, Edisto [Edisto Island, South Carolina], or Johns Island [South Carolina], or other family members were going to come to visit 'cause that's when they visit each other. And they really had to get back home, too.
Story_ID: 647687
Speaker 1: Well, when you think back about your life, is there anything that you haven't done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I've had a really--I, I, I've been blessed. I really had a full life. You know, I've travelled--Africa and other parts of the world. I've travelled all over the United States. I'm blessed with a great family. You always think of alternative, you know, had I pursued, been this, I'd be you know, quote, unquote better off, but then my children [Nia Johnson Jones, Jack Johnson, Jr. and Zachary Johnson] are doing extremely well. So, I've been just really blessed with the direction, and I don't think that the directions are really choices that you sit down and make. I always think that there's the, the hand of God that, that directs your life, and at least has directed my life. And I think the, the faith that my mother [Ermine Campbell Johnson] instilled in me and, and the need for an education have carried me to where I am today.
Story_ID: 647688
Speaker 1: Because this information you're interviewing in your story will be available for future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Well, I think for the young people, the, the first thing they got to know is that life takes you in the direction sometimes that you really have no idea of where you're going to go. And it, and it, the most important thing is just to be prepared, to get yourself a good education, and have really strong values of, of commitment to yourself and to your family and, and wanting to be somebody. And that the other thing is that I found is that you're going to have some real challenges. But when I look at all of the challenges that I've had in life that I really didn't want, I realized that now that they were preparing me for my career, and giving me the ability to deal with the issues that I had to face, and the decisions that I have to make, that I've had to make. And so, be true to yourself, just want to be somebody, work hard, have faith in God, faith in yourself, and get a good education, and you'll be all right.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Boy, you know, I'd hate to think of legacy (laughter).
Speaker 1: We know you got, we--you have plenty of years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Let me ask you this, how do you want to be remembered when it's all said and done--
Speaker 2: When it's all--
Speaker 1: --after years and years and years from now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think the--when I travel the county, the, the things that I'm proudest off is that everybody sees me as just Jack [HistoryMaker Jack Johnson], and they just know me as one of the neighbors, their friend, their cousin's cousins, or somebody like that. So, I love the fact that God has allowed me to stay who I am. And then, I think that I--when people look at Prince George's County [Maryland], they would, hopefully, remember that during my lifetime, I really transformed this county, that I moved our law enforcement from one that was perceived to be divided from the community, and, and rebuilt it into one now that is so respected. And no one has to fear anymore, and they have the respect of the people, and we've given them the resources to do their job well without violating people's constitutional rights. And then, when we see this county from the economic point, we're going to see that during the years that I've been here that we have rebuilt and reenergized the county, and that people see us differently now than they saw us. And it was a, and, and it's kind of a perception issue, and that we've changed that perception, and that we are now equal in the eyes of the region. And even Wall Street has recognized what our achievements have been. And so, we're probably the only predominantly African American community with a African American leader that have gone to Wall Street three times, and gotten bond rating increases, so we're up, we're economically on the move. Educationally, we're on the move. And then, we're on the move in how we see ourselves.
Speaker 1: And so, you want to be remembered as--
Speaker 2: As the architect of all of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that we've made this county great and--
Speaker 1: That's it?
Speaker 2: --but I hope I'm around to think about it a long time (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you for taking the time because I, I know you have a very busy schedule. And I really do appreciate you taking the time to share your story with us for The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, thank you very much. It's been really fun, it really has been a lot of fun.
