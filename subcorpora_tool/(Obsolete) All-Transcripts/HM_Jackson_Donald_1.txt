Story_ID: 54172
Speaker 1: Please give us the names of your parents and spell them for us and give us the date of their birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  See if I can do that.  Both my parents are deceased.  My mother's name, Lillian Peachy Jackson, her birthday was November the 27th and her birth date, see I don't have my wife [Rosemary Jackson] here to tell me these birthdates.  She died when she was 68, so she was born in 1925 [sic, 1920], that would make her, I think it's somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Okay, you can approximate on it.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Good.  And my father [John Wesley Jackson], who passed last year [2001], his birthday was August the 12th.  He was 78 when he passed, and he would have been 19--let's see, 19--between 1925 and 1930.
Speaker 1: All right.  Can you tell us something about their background, where there were from and how they met?
Speaker 2: Little bit.  My mother was from Texas.  She was from San Antonio, Texas, and they moved up here to Chicago [Illinois] from San Antonio, Texas.  And my father relocated from Jackson, Mississippi, and he had more of an interesting background because he--his father [Ivory Jackson] had killed a white man retaliating against some injustices in Mississippi and the family--he thus moved his family here, and my father was the oldest and was and--met my mother.  He went to Wendell Phillips High School [now Wendell Phillips Academy High School] and he was a boxer athlete and met my mother and that's how they met through-high school, although she went to Hyde Park [Hyde Park High School, now Hyde Park Academy High School] and he went to Wendell Phillips High School.
Story_ID: 54173
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah that is quite a the story, so your father's father [Ivory Jackson] actually was in a confrontation with a white man and killed him and had to move to--
Speaker 2: Yes.  He--my father's father had--they had a total of, how many is in there, of eight children and it placed a burden on my father [John Wesley Jackson], because shortly after they moved to Chicago [Illinois], his father was killed in a card fight.  So, after playing cards his father was stabbed to death and bled to death.  And at a earlier age of 15, my father had to--he had to work after graduating from Wendell [Philips Academy] High School, he had to go to work and became the--the major bread winner for the family, although my grandmother [Golena Washington Jackson] was a school teacher, so she taught school for a number of years and they were able to do that to make it quite well, but because of my father's father's early death, he did not have a male role model in the family, so he became that, and as a result they called him "Big John."  And he was the protector of all of the brothers and the sisters in his family.
Story_ID: 54174
Speaker 1: Was he [Jackson's father, John Wesley Jackson] large in stature?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was--my father was six/three, six/two or three and was a, as I said, was a boxer and was also a good looking man who was attracted quite a bit to women.  And he--because of his size, I mean, he wasn't obese or anything like that, he was just very, very huge and everyone referred to him as "Big John."
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a scavenger worker, a garbage man, but for a private scavenger service, and did very, very well and was the number one driver that they had.  And he used to take us on those jobs with him and that was a time they were burning coal in--in basements and they had ashes and they would put the ashes into these ash cans and they would have to kneel down the scavenger workers and put these cans on their backs, and I remember working with him one summer and I saw him and his partner do that, and I said, "Oh I can do that" and I was, at the time, I was a freshman in--at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] and he put the--I said, "Let me do that," and they said "Okay," so he put the can on me and I proceeded, you know, you gotta bend down and I proceeded to bend over and the can just--just put me in the wrong direction.  I said, "Take it off, take it off."  And then afterwards he say, "now see that's why you've got to finish and go to college", and I mean he was a caring man, as well as my mother [Lillian Peachy Jackson] was a--just an avid house wife cause she did not work, and he took care of her.   And although we were not well off, he provided for us, he stayed with our family.  He did not desert us even though he had had some--some run-ins with the law for policy.  At that time policy was big, the numbers.  And, but he--
Speaker 1: Did his route help him facilitate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah, he was able through--although his route was out north, but just his interaction with what he did helped there but he--help facilitate his numbers business.  But he always--I got a scholarship to Northwestern so there wasn't--a basketball scholarship, so but you know I still needed money for, you know, weekends and so forth, and he would always come up on the weekend, make a trip to make sure I had five, ten, fifteen dollars to get a pizza, and a--although he never came to any of our basket--my basketball games there at Northwestern, he was such a caring man that he took the time to come up to make sure that I was there and let him--and he let me know how proud he was of me in his own words.  Although other people you know thought that he--he was rough and not a caring, kind young man, I saw him just the opposite.
Story_ID: 54175
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about your mother [Lillian Peachy Jackson], could you tell us something about her?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  Our mother, we called her "mom," and she was--she--she, I think,--I can only recall that she had one job and it was for a short period of time.  So she was at home always there to take care of us and provide for us and motivated us to do our best and a very kind woman who was big on family and she--when we grew older and we were at Christmas time, we were at different houses and she missed that and encouraged me to--we started what we still do today is an annual Christmas Eve, we all come together and gather at my house and we, you know, the grandchildren and the nieces and the nephews and exchange gifts then.  And that started because of her, and a--so she was very, very big on family and had really, she never had to whip us or threaten us--well she would threaten us with, "I'm gonna tell your father" [John Wesley Jackson] and that's all it took.  So in that--those days, gangs were huge and it--the attraction of the gangs were there, but we never got into them because our father was--we knew that we had to answer to him, so she would give us that threat of "I'm gonna tell your father" and that's all it took.
Story_ID: 54176
Speaker 1: I'm wanna to backtrack just a minute and then we'll talk about your childhood and the memories of growing up in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Lillan Peachy Jackson] have any stories about how they--her family got to San Antonio [Texas] in the first place and how they moved from San Antonio to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  To be perfectly honest with you, I have more stories on my father [John Wesley Jackson] and what happened to him.  I think because back in those days, they were moving.  The only interesting story is that my mother's mother, we called her "Nana," was a masseuse, and she was very, very light-skinned and we know that in her lineage that--that there was some mixing there and that I think it was her father who was white cause my grandmother, her mother was very light-skinned and she would work in these masseuse and these very important physical training places and some of the gyms where they didn't allow blacks and so she passed for a long time made a very good living, very active, tall strong woman, she passed for white so that she could have a good job and provide for her--for her family.
Story_ID: 54177
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you reflect back and give us some sense of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood that you grew up in, or the neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess they would be neighborhoods because we--we, you know, we were right on the--you know we were not poor because of the job my father [John Wesley Jackson] had as a scavenger, yet we were not what I would call middle class, so like we never grew up in a house that we owned, it was always apartments and it started on the South Side.  And the--on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] we were near Comiskey Park.  This was before they had the Dan Ryan Expressway and back then it was the street cars and--near Chinatown.  We were at 2901 Wentworth and it was near Chinatown.  They were big on the fireworks, I mean.  So they would put these firecrackers in the tracks, and as the street car would ride along the rails, you would hear the pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  It was very, very big.  And at that time, they had on 31st Street, they had this--this bear where this wrestler would--this is-this is a true story, they would have a bear on a--on a, like a porch, an up porch and he would wrestle the bear and it was like unreal.  But at that time, you know, segregation was--was--was alive and well and you couldn't, you know, you couldn't go across the tracks.  The tracks were there to divide you from, you know, Chicago's segregated neighborhoods.  And whenever we would venture over there, that's what would happen.  And the--then we--we moved to the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  And we would going--at that time we moved to the West Side, but we still went to grade school at St. James [Elementary School] on the South Side, so we would have--we would pass through downtown and this was a time where within the black community, the businesses in the black community thrived and the business stayed.  Monies turned around in the black community.
Story_ID: 54178
Speaker 1: And downtown was a foreign body to most of us.  You'd go down maybe for--maybe for a big show or someone performing, but mostly you--you spent your money and your time, especially 47th Street, that was like the mecca, where the Regal Theater was and you'd dress up to go there and they had all of the major, major acts who would perform and it was a--just a thriving community of blacks, theaters, movie theaters, restaurants, so there wasn't really a need to go downtown.  And you just passed--we would just pass through it, but stayed in our community.  So that was--and then when we moved to the south--we moved to the West Side and then we moved back to the South Side on Wabash.  And I remember the El tracks that were going up and down and then on Friday night, the community would come alive with the blues clubs and you'd hear the music and we would be waiting up for my old man to come home.  And--but he always came home, sometimes, you know, not every night, but he came home.  And one time in particular, this was right at payday and my mother [Lillian Peachy Jackson], she knew where he hung out, and had me and my brother and sister go and get him from this bar.  And he'd put us on the bar and said these are my kids and he would be proud but we wouldn't crack a smile and we wouldn't leave until we had him in our hand, and we'd bring him home.  But those were some of the memories.  And then when we moved back to the west side, for me, it was mostly--my time was taken up playing basketball on the school yards.  Marillac House [Social Center] at Jackson and California was where I really spent a lot of time.  It kept me out of the gangs and all of that, so it was--the basketball that came into my life that became my outlet for everything.
Story_ID: 54179
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about school.  What schools did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, after I--St. James [Elementary School] on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], grade school, and then after that we-
Speaker 1: That's Catholic?
Speaker 2: --It's a Catholic School and then we--cause we were initially raised in the Catholic Church and then we moved to the West Side and it was Our Lady of Sorrows, where I was--I first started playing basketball, and I played baseball, and I ran track and--but at that time, Our Lady of Sorrows had very few blacks.  And my first sign of racism that I can remember was I had played basketball with my white teammates and we did really well and played baseball with my white teammates and ran track.  And so when the summer came, you were kind of on your own.  So we were encouraged by the coach, and this was in grade school, to practice together.  At that time you didn't have official--you know, you couldn't come together as a team, you had to do it on your own.  So I went to play with them in their park and--in a white area, and I was the only black and I was comfortable with that.  And--but I was a pretty good athlete, so I was the one hitting the home runs.  And this one white kid, who I thought was one of my best friends, said after I had hit the home run and he got really frustrated and he says, "Jackson, why don't you go and play with your own, I'm tired of you."  And then I said, "What do you mean?"  He says, "Why don't you go play with your own kind" you know sort of like that and then it kind of struck me that "whoa" I am the only black here.  And it sent me back and that's when I began to notice, you know, of course, who I was.  And it sort of followed me around that I was generally the only black in that environment.
Story_ID: 54180
Speaker 1: But--and then--so from the grade school [Our Lady of Sorrows], I went to a Catholic High School, St. Malachy, which was again on the West Side at Oakley--Oakley and Washington, I believe.  And they had--it was mostly blacks who were there.  They had their click of ball players.  And I could play but they didn't let me make the team.  They sort of voted on who made the team.  And this was my freshman year, and I wanted to play ball, so, at that time my mother, and this was in 1958, she--we went to Chicago Stadium, where [John] Marshall [Metropolitan] High School, they had just taken the state championship.  And at that time, after you won state, you would come back and play the Public League against the Catholic League.  And they were playing at Chicago Stadium, and it was packed.  And I saw George Wilson and Bobby Jones and I mean just--Ralph Wells and they--they--they just beat this Catholic team, and it was great basketball and it was in Chicago Stadium.  And I looked at my mom and I said "I'm going to transfer to Marshall and I'm gonna play on this team."  And she kind laughed and said, "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."  And I said, "No, I'm very serious.  I want to play.  I can play with those guys."  And so that summer, this was '58' (1958) I convinced her to let me transfer, and I transferred from St. Malachy over to Marshall.  And initially I was going to try out for the basketball team.  Well, all of my friends had come up to me telling me how they had been cut and how they had tried out and they were cut and they couldn't make the team.  Great basketball and I mean how, you know, and so I'm listening to all this and so I'm saying, "My God, I don't think I can make this team."  So I did not officially try out for the team until I went to a gym class.  To enroll in gym class and fresh-soph, and at that time I was six, two--six, two or six, three, so I was tall compared to others.  And the fresh-soph coach was a guy name [Nathan] Bosco Levine, and he said to me, "young man, he says, can you play ball?"  And I said, "Yeaaah".  And he says, well, we're having our last tryout for the fresh-soph, cause at that time you had fresh-soph and then you had varsity where--and I think they need to reinstitute that, you know, where you know it can give you a time to adjust.  So he said, "This is our last official tryout, be here tonight at six o'clock is when we're trying out for the team."  So I said, "Okay".  And I'm still hesitant, very hesitant.  So then I was deliberately, I says--I was deliberately late.  I think I showed up like at--at a quarter to seven, thinking that it would be over and I wouldn't have to go through this embarrassment.  So then I walked into the gym.  They were running up and down the court, and I'm saying, "whoa."  And he said, "Jackson, go change, put your shorts on and put your shoes on and get in here.  I don't know why you're so late.  I told you six o'clock."  And I said, "Okay, Coach, okay."  So I came back up, nervous.  I didn't know anybody on the team.  And this--these were--this was Marshall, this was the dynasty.  They had just taken state championship.  And he said, he called a time out and he says, "Okay, go in there, you're gonna replace--you're gonna start at center cause I was six--two.  And I got in there.  And one thing I had, I was very fast.  I can run up and down--and Marshall, at that time had a--had a fast break offense at the time, running up and down the court.  And I got in there and I did really well.  And afterwards he says, "You made the team."  And I replaced this out guy.  And see, I was a newcomer.  I was the odd guy, you know, I had just transferred over and so they nicknamed me "the farmer" because I was the--I would always wear ties to school and press my own shirts and if I was wearing, you know, a pair of kakis for a long time, I'd dye them so I'd have a different look.  And so I  would--I would wear weird combinations.  I'd wear a plaid shirt with a plaid tie, but I had a tie on cause I had no one to tell me about fashion, and I had my hair, I would always comb my hair up in a different way.  And so they nicknamed me "Farmer," because at that time, instead of calling me a square, they called me "Farmer."
Story_ID: 54181
Speaker 1: But I quickly noticed then that it was the basketball that made you popular, so I was very leery of--of the girls cause I knew that they were only after me because of basketball, and so I had no girlfriends while I was in high school [John Marshall Metropolitan High School].
Speaker 2: High school?
Speaker 1: I had no girlfriends.  I had friends who wanted to be--as I said, I was a little bit unusual.  And you know I was attractive young guy, and--but I knew I had girls who studied with me in a study group and who were--who were really smart, and I could learn from them.  They would--eventually they would say, "Okay now Don, enough of this studying here, we gotta, you know, can we go out?"  And I says, "Wait a minute, wait a minute, what are you talking about" and they would want to take it a step further and eventually that would end the friendship cause I only wanted to keep it in the study group.  And so, no I--and my wife [Rosemary Jackson], as a matter of fact was--went to Marshall, she was a freshman, we had just--I was a senior and that's how I met her and she had went up to this friend of mine and said tell Don Jackson that I really like him.  And I said, well, who is it?  And there was this girl with this pig tail, and I walked back and I said, you know, "Look Rosemary, I said you know, I'm a little old for you and I said, I'll tell you what, I'll be your big brother."  And I'll never forget this, I said, cause "I'll help you out when you need a friend and then--like if at your senior prom, if you don't have a date, I'll take you to your senior prom."  So what happened was that we went through a--she moved up, became a senior.  I was a junior at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] at the time and I get this phone call.  And she says, "Don Jackson", I says, "Yeah."  She says "This is Rosemary."  I said "Okay."  She says, "Remember you promised me-" she said promise, I just--it was a suggestion, it wasn't a promise, but she says, "Remember you promised me that if I needed a date for the senior prom that you would"--no it was a junior prom, that what is was,  her junior prom, that you would take-"that you would take me to the prom?"  And I said, "vaguely," so I--but at the time when she said it, I said oh, that might be pretty cool.  Here I am a junior at Northwestern, I come back there and show all the teachers, you know--you know, what I made.
Story_ID: 54182
Speaker 1: So I was talking about my wife [Rosemary Jackson], and so I agree and now I have not seen her since three or four years.  So, I'll never forget I got my sister's friend to borrow his car.  He had this Chrysler that was an old model Chrysler, but really slick, and I was sharp, and I told my roommate at the time, Jim Pitts "I'm gonna go down here and I'm gonna you know do this for this lil girl--little girl.  And I'm going to, you know, I'm gonna let everybody see, you know, what a Marshall [John Marshall Metropolitan High School] grad can be like," you know.  And so I walked into her house and picked her up and here is this young lady who had--she grew from like 5/4 to like 5/10 or 11, fully developed, and I'm like "whoa, what is this?"  She just floored me, I mean absolutely floored me.  And, so, it took on a different twist, now.  I mean now I'm thinking, cause even by that time at Northwestern, I did not have a girlfriend.  You know I was, well, you know, I was into the books and playing basketball and all that kind of stuff.  So I wasn't into girls.  And we went to the prom and all night long, I'm just like saying "whoa" what is this, and you know, I mean, of course I was a hit--I was a hit for her and we had a nice time and as a result of that, we started dating.  And that's where it started, you know and I'm helping this--I'm helping this little girl out for her prom and it mushroomed beyond that and that's where--that's how we met or we really got together, you know, from high school back then.
Speaker 2: All right.  Yeah, you were talking about how you met your wife.  So you all started dating?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we started dating right after that prom.  And very serious, I mean, she was really my first full time, I'll say full time girlfriend.  You know the others I had dated but you know nothing for any length of time or any period of time.  And you that was--so I have--you know we've been married now for going on 38 years.  So I've been knowing her for over 40 years.  And she was my first full, I'll call full fledge girlfriend.
Story_ID: 54183
Speaker 1: Let's back track a little bit in terms of school.  We talked about athletic accomplishments and life on the team and that sort of thing, but how did you like school, as a student, and what subjects were you interested in and what teachers stood out, you know.  Were there any teachers or any other adults that helped you along the way?
Speaker 2: Yes. My favorite subjects were English and Math.  And as a freshman at St. Malachy [School] I was a wiz at algebra.  And then when I got to [John] Marshall [Metropolitan High School] and got on the basketball team, it took on a different light.  I mean I was the star ball player, and I took it lightly, geometry, very, very lightly and actually got a low grade in geometry.  And at that time for you to stay on the team and to play, you had to have your grades--you--and the coach back then would spot check classes.  He would come into the class when wouldn't even know it.  If you were absent from that class, he would not let you play ball.  I mean he did some, which I think they should think about doing today.  So I mean it kept everything in perspective of what the priorities were.  And my last year I recall this teacher, who was my first division teacher, she was a geometry teacher.  And she encouraged me to take geometry again, cause she said you know math is going to be there for you, and I took it again.  And she also encouraged me to, cause I loved to act and I was into singing and the arts and--but playing basketball, you know, wasn't cool, it wasn't, I mean, for you to sing or act you know you--and at that time, you just had better play basketball cause this was Marshall.  And--but she encouraged me that last year to do a couple of things.  She encouraged me to let some of my artistic talents come, she encouraged me to sing, which I did, she encouraged me to act, which I did.  And then she got into, "What do you want to do?  Don, now you should go to college," and I said, "I don't want to go."  I mean I'm not cause at that time, my sister had gone on to a junior college, and she was the first one.  And I said, I don't know.  My brother had gone to the air force right after he graduated from high school.  And then things--fate came in and a good friend of mine, Jim Pitts who--we played together on that State Championship team.
Story_ID: 54184
Speaker 1: Now it's interesting that the summer before I went to Marshall, before I transferred from St. Malachy [Elementary school], I played against this tall linky guy who I had not known on the playground and it was Jim Pitts, and he had--he had been going to the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School] at the time.  He went to the Lab School in University of Chicago, and we had just played each other and beat each other up, and he was really a good ball player.  So at the end of our session, I said "Man, I don't know who you are but you know you're really tough and you know I hope to see you down the road sometimes."  Well, unbeknownst to both of us, we both transferred to Marshall.  Now Jim was like six-nine.  So instead of Jim playing on the frosh-soph team, he played on the varsity team.  Well Jim was kind of an unusual guy cause he was very smart and so we were both kind of categorized as--he wasn't called "a farmer," but we were squares, you know, so we hung out together and became very good friends.  I took trips with his family.  And the recruiters, the college recruiters came heavily after Jim, Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois], in particular.  And so he, Jim, invited me on one of the recruiting trips to go with him.  And I went and you know I'm looking at the campus with him.  And unbeknownst to me, I didn't realize what he was doing.  So at the end of the trip, we're sitting with the coaches and they say, "Well, Jim, how do you like Northwestern"?  And he says, "Well, you know, I like Northwestern fine.  I would consider coming here if you give a scholarship to Don Jackson."  And I kind of looked at Jim and then they said to me, "Don, how do you like Northwestern?"  So I said, "Oh, I like it fine."  They said, and this is funny, they said well, would consider coming here.  I says, oh, I'd love to.  And they says well, you have a scholarship.  And then they looked at Jim and Jim says, well, you got me then.  And if it wasn't for Jim Pitts, I never would have gotten that scholarship, although I was a starter on the team at the time and I was a good ball player.  So I said--and what I told the coach then, I said well I'll consider coming here for one reason--under one condition, rather.  They says, "Okay, Jack, what's that?"  I said, "If you don't play me all the time."  I mean like--cause when I was a senior, I was a stabilizing--stabilizer on the team and the coach played me the whole game.  It was like--and they thought--they kind of like grinned and laughed and said "Oh, Jackson, I don't think you have to worry about that."  Well, needless that I know that what they thought was that first of all, I was gonna have a difficult time making the team, okay, and staying up with the academics, you know, making the grades.  So they said, "Oh, I'm sure you won't have to worry about that Jackson."  So that was--but it was my friend, it was Jim Pitts and we roomed together our first year and I'm really just so grateful for what he did.  I mean this was a young kid at the time for him to, you know, know that he could use his leverage to say to them, I'll come if you give, you know, if you consider giving a scholarship, you know, it wasn't any pay or any bribe or anything like that, it was very legitimate, you know my scores were legitimate to get in to Northwestern.  But at that time, it was like I was on the borderline.  So they didn't think, Northwestern didn't think that, you know, I mean that they--it was much of an investment.  It was, you know, maybe a one-year investment and he's gone, but they would still have Jim Pitts.
Story_ID: 54185
Speaker 1: So I came in [to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois] and we played freshman ball at the time, and we did well.  And I stayed, my grades got much better and my--by the end of my sophomore year, I was starting on that team.  And--but at the end of that sophomore year, Jim Pitts, going into our junior year, Jim got hurt.  He blew out his knee.  So he had to sit out the rest of the sophomore--sophomore season and also our junior--my junior year.  I was the only black on the team and that's when the racism set in again.  I mean we would go to--we played University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky]--University of Kentucky.  And that was when they had a great team with this coach, Adolph Rupp, who was just a legend.  And the coach, when we were going to the stadium, came over to me and he said, "Jackson, he says, I'm going to have a different line-up tonight, I'm not going to, you know, you're not going to start tonight."  And I said "Hm."  He says, "Yeah, we're going to do a different strategy," and I said, "What's this about?"  I said, okay, okay, coach, you know.  Now this is Kentucky, had [Charles Francis] "Cotton" Nash at the time, Adolph Rupp, so we're playing and he doesn't start me.  So then they were beating the heck out of us, I mean beating the hell out of us.  And so he had to put me in, so he kind of looks down at the bench, he says, "Jackson, get in there."  So they were--Kentucky, this was the University of Kentucky, they were shooting a free throw.  So they had the ball.  So it was a tie, the score buzzed me in and as he buzzed me in, I walk out on the court, now they're shooting the free-throw and I hear all these boos, so you know, I'm walking out on the court and I'm saying, what's going on here.  So I looked around and looked at all the other players sitting down.  Before it had never bothered me that I was the only black on that team, cause I made my own world.  I mean when I walked into the hotel, I'd find out where we ate, where the brothers were, so that many of my white teammates went with me, cause I would find out where things were going on.  But when I walked on that floor, I was the only black on the floor.  And then I looked up in the crowd and no blacks in the crowd.  And I said "oh, my God" they're booing at me.  And I said this is unbelievable.  And then Adolph Rupp got up, waved his hands, like "Hey, uh, you know, quiet down, quiet down."  And it was okay, but I was shell shocked, I mean my game was gone then.  I didn't know what, I mean   every time I heard a little crackle, I went (unclear).  So my nerves were gone.  So after the game, Adolph Rupp came up to me and he said, "Son, he says don't worry about this, I'm a have a lot more boys like you up here real soon."  And of course now the whole team is black today.  But that was on that level when I experienced that racism back--back then and then going to certain restaurants, they said, you know, they didn't serve--you know we'd walk in with my teammates and they would say, well you know, we'll serve you, but we don't serve blacks.  And my teammates would want to go off at the time and I says "No, let's get out of here," and that's when I did experience it.

Speaker 1: But then when we [the basketball team for Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois] went to other towns like Los Angeles [California] and, you know, I made my own friends there and we, as I said, my teammates went with me, but I always knew that it was tough back then what we experienced.  And at that time the university and the coaches didn't really know how to handle it, and didn't really prepare me for it.  And fortunately I was mature enough to be able to handle that situation, but, I mean, they would--like my coaches at that time, they would go through some etiquette lessons what I called like Jack do you--and this was very early on when I became a sophomore and we would begin to travel, you know, you know "what fork to use" and I would just kind of like hold--hold it in and not say anything.  And then I was in the school of speech, so when I was walking on the campus you know all my schoolmates back then, cause in my class there were only four blacks.  I would be walking with blonds, I mean they--we'd be coming from class and you know, I was in one of the theater productions up there "Waa-Mu" and I was the only black in the "Waa-Mu" show at the time.  So, I mean, but I got to practice one day and the frosh-soph coach, they had Brad Snyder, he had come up to me and says, Jack, and he was giving me this lecture about interracial dating and you know, "some of the football players, they've done it.  They've really gotten into big trouble."  I says, "Yeah, I know that, but Coach, why are you talking to me about," you know, I mean, I'm not--he says, well, some of our trustees were walking--saw you walking on Sheridan Road and you know with a group of white girls and you know that's how it got back to me.  And I says those are--those are my classmates, Coach, what's going on?  Those are my classmates, you know.  So, it's interesting because I'm a trustee today at Northwestern.  But that's how the news had gotten back, and that's, you know, again, some of the--some of the players, especially football players didn't care, you know, about interracial dating and they did a lot of that, but I, you know, I--just the threat of losing my scholarship, being kicked off the team kept me from--from--from doing any of that.
Story_ID: 54187
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any idea at that time that you wanted to go into broadcasting at all?
Speaker 2: No.  When I was in school [Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois] and my major was radio, TV and film, I just, at that time, I liked very much the stage, I liked theater, I liked being in production, I liked writing.  We had this one instructor who would make us write forty commercials a week, and they were one minute, back then it was one-minute commercials, it was 30 seconds today.  But they wanted to really make sure that we could write concisely, and it was the best thing that ever--ever could have happened and--so I got a real good sense, but because I was on the basketball team, I couldn't--some of the stage craft classes would be like four hours in the evening and they--and I couldn't take em.  And I couldn't stay in the editing room and I couldn't stay in the production room.  But one summer [1964] before I graduated, this was my senior year, the head of the School of [Communications]-- Speech Department, again said--he wasn't very honest and he said, "Jackson, would you be interested in an internship and we want to send a message."  He wanted to send a message.  "You would be our first black intern to work for a television station downtown."  And I said, I said, "Okay, what's that about."  He says, "Well, what it means is that you would get eight full hours of, was it eight, yeah, eight hours of credit, no pay, but eight hours of "B" credit," and I jumped at that cause it would cut my class load down my senior year.  So I agreed.  I was the first black intern there.  Walked into the station and no blacks, again another situation where I'm the only black.  No blacks, and I said, "Okay, I can deal with this."
Story_ID: 54188
Speaker 1: What station was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was WBBM TV, Channel 2.  And at that time Chanel 2, here in Chicago, was the number one station.  They had Lee Phillip [Lee Philip Bell], the Lee Phillip Show, they had Walter Jacobson, they had John Drury, and I was in the production department and they had me doing teleprompter, clearing music rights, some boring stuff, and all of the production people.  That's why today I got a big thing about the crews that I use because the production people there, all of the crews, were the most prejudice white folks that I'd ever come across.  I mean they were just like hard core.  I'd walk in, they wouldn't even recognize that I existed, you know.  Until one of the newsmen, who--John Coughlin, who has since passed away, was a news--a news--was a weatherman and also did a half hour comedy show there, clown show.  It wasn't Bozo but John was just extremely popular and--cause of his ratings.  And John took me under his wings. And when he took me under his wings, he'd take me out in the field with him and so forth, everything loosened up, everything.  I mean they--they, they treated me respectfully, and then I got to know the general manager, who was a guy name Clark George, who was an athlete, and would have, you know, me meet him on Sunday and play touch football and I was an athlete.  So after the internship, he said now, "Jackson, he says now when you graduate from Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois], you got a job here and you--when you come back and you have a position here that I want you to take advantage of.  So I'm gonna let the production people downstairs know that."  Well what happened was when I graduated he sent the message to this guy name Chuck Hines, who was the program manager at the time.  And again, this was when [W]BBM-TV was number one.  Clark George then was promoted to run in New York, where he ran the network in New York on the radio side.  So when I got there, Chuck Hines had been given this dictate to hire me, didn't have a choice, you know.  So I walk in and he says, "Jackson, he says now, we all started at the bottom in this business, and I don't care what your relationship was with Mr. George or your basketball, you know, here is how you're gonna start."  And I just saw racism written all over that.  And I said--so he went through this medley, because at the time, that was a very, you know, to be offered a position with a major station like that was a coup and I--at the end of the interview I smiled and I said, "Mr. Hines, I said, thank you very, very much, but no thank you.  I am not coming into a situation like this."  He was absolutely shocked.  And he says, "Well, if that's your prerogative, blah, blah, blah, blah."  I says, "No, I said it's nothing against you, I said I just don't want to come into a situation like that."  And he says, "Okay, young man, like get the hell out of here."  And I went off and got into sales you know and got into radio sales and it's uncanny because you know, things come back at you eventually.
Story_ID: 54189
Speaker 1: I got into radio sales with the number one radio station here [Chicago, Illinois], WVON Radio, which was at the time you know [HM] Herb Kent, and they were called the "Good Guys" and they set the pace for what, at that time, black radio was about in the country.  They were so huge.  And so I got experience on the sales side and never sold anything before, but did extremely well on the sales side.  And understood advertisers, understood sales, understood--cause I could write and I could put proposals together very, very quickly and research and did all of that and had a great, great experience at WVON Radio and eventually, I left WVON Radio because I saw at that time, they had this, it was like a plantation.  Again, when I came into the sales staff, I was the first black sales manager that they had.
Speaker 2: At WVON?
Speaker 1: At WVON, oh yeah. Sales is where the money was.
Speaker 2: This is 1965, just for the record, you came out of Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] in '64' (1964)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In '65' (1965) and then I went to R.R.  Donnelley-R.H. Donnelley [Inc.], the yellow pages, to understand sales.  I spent about six months at WBEE [Radio].  So I came to WVON in, I think was 1967, and the general manager or the owner, Leonard Chess, felt really good about having a Northwestern grad on his--on his team.  The sales man--the general sales manager at the time, a guy name Bob Beltrano (ph), felt a little bit intimidated initially, cause he didn't know where I was coming from.  And I would stay there to get my sales charts together and to try to work with these older sales people who they had there.  And he would always say, "Jackson, you don't need to do that, you know, just tell them what you want to do and so forth."  But I insisted on preparing myself for all of that.  And I'll never forget the--and this is one of the incidents that made me leave WVON.  WVON, in 1968, had become the number one radio station in Chicago [Illinois], not black, but over WGN.  And I was looking at the numbers and I went to the general manager and I--the sales manager at the time, I says, Bob, you need to--we need to run an ad, which we did, (unclear), cause this is historic.  And then in one of the meetings we had, we would always have these meetings with Leonard Chess, the owner, and Bob Bell and the general manager and Bernadine C. Washington, who was community affairs vice president and [HM] Lucky Cordell and E. Rodney Jones.  So in the meeting, I said--I said "Leonard, before we start off, I just want a congratulate these guys because we're number one in the market place and I just want to give them a hand," and I started to applauding.  Leonard Chess did not applaud, Bob Bell did not applaud, just had this stoic look on his face.  And they said, "Oh, thank you, Don, we didn't know that, we didn't know that."  And so after the meeting, Leonard Chess came to me and he says, "Don," I said yes, he says, "Now this is just a lesson for you, we never tell them how well they're doing.  Never tell them how well they're doing because if you do that, they will want more."  And I looked at him straight in the face and I said, "Oh, I understand."  I said to myself, you got to be out of your fricken mind if you think I'm gonna go along with this."  Now here I am, I'm very vocal, you know what I mean.  I've been through all this racism in the past.  So what I did, when I went to Bernadine, I says Bernadine, now look, here's what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna have--I had secret meetings in her office with all the jocks where I would explain the ratings to them.  And I said if one of you squeals on me and tells Mr. Chess, you know, I'm gone.  But they didn't so I would have these secret meetings.
Story_ID: 54190
Speaker 1: But I felt back then that they never really, you know, and that's what's, in my opinion today is that black radio evolved out of--it was programmed by whites.  Black radio was not programmed by blacks.  I mean if you're a black person and all you--you know, you would feel guilty if all you did was put music--music on all the back to back, no news, no community talk, which is the way that most of the stations do that today.  I mean, you would feel guilty, but whites who were in there, you know, they didn't want to let go of the precious time they felt that--and they would say, "The research we got is that the black audience just wants music, music, music."  And I said, "Well where is that research?"  "Oh, well, it's around."  No, well, where is it that says that all they want is music, music, music, cause we're not serving the needs of the community like this if we're just--and it's not a black-owned station and you know, and they would--so it's rip and read at the time, rip and read.  And at that time a guy name Roy Wood--the new people would come to me and say--and they'd complain and then Don Cornelius of Soul Train was at the station at the time and he would--he was in news and he would come to me and complain at the time.  And it was--it was that frustration, although I did very, very well, I mean they took care of me when my wife [Rosemary Jackson] had our first child and when I went to the National Guard, they paid me and all of that where I decided that I was gonna leave and start my own business.  And I started to leave five times.  Every time I'd come back, they'd say, "Well, Don, look why don't you just go ahead and start your own business and you know, we'll look the other way and you continue to run our sales force" because at that time the general manager, he had turned everything over to me.  I had brought in new sales people.  We were doing better than we ever had.  And then Leonard Chess died.  He died of a heart attack driving his car.  Bernadine C. Washington was in the car as a matter of fact.  And the [Harlem] Globe Trotters were getting ready to buy the station.  The Globe Trotter organization back then which was white-owned.  And I'll never forget what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (unclear) Abe Saperstein?
Speaker 1: --Abe Saperstein, right.
Story_ID: 54191
Speaker 1: I think I was talking about WVON [Radio in Chicago, Illinois], which was an interesting experience.  And at that time under Leonard Chess, so much was going on cause he had a record company [Chess Records], and payola was big at the time.  And I would go with them, some of the disc jockeys, and they'd go in some of the record companies and they'd come out with these paper bags full of $100 bills and they'd give me--try to give me a $100 bill, I says, no, no, I don't see it, I don't want it, I'm not a witness to this, it's your business, and I would completely walk away from it.  Now eventually many of them paid the price for that because, you know, payola blew up back then in that day.  But they tried to get me to stay and when a [Harlem] Globe Trotter bought them, George Gillett, was the name of the guy, who eventually--now they have a number of stations under his company.  He said to me, "Don, you can help us make millions."  And then that's when I said to myself, "help you make millions, what about me?"  And because of the frustration that I had that they were not really programming--doing their best to program to the black community, in terms of community service, I decided to leave.  And I tried to leave five times, and my wife [Rosemary Jackson] was pregnant with our second child. And finally I walked in and I said to general manager, this guy, Bob (unclear).  I says look Bob, I says "Look, I am leaving.  All I want you to do is take care of the maternity benefits, if you can, for my kid, for my wife and for us," and he smiled and he says, you really want to get out of her, don't you?  I says, I really do.  And I left in, that was 1970.
Story_ID: 54192
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1970--1970, 1971 and started the business of marketing consulting on talking to advertisers, corporations on how to reach the black consumer market and I, you know, God has been wonderful because many of the clients that I had at WVON, particularly Jewel Food Stores, I became their black everything.  I became their black agency.  I wasn't a black agency, I was a consultant, but they had me doing radio commercials, TV commercials, newspaper commercials.  I put my wife, to this day, and our friends are in a lot of ads, you know, picnic ads and everything.  But they were instrumental because they had suppliers trying to get into their stores, so they recommended me to Quaker Oats.  I got Quaker Oats, Johnson and Johnson, I got Johnson and Johnson, the baby products company, El Producto Cigars, Riceland Foods, and I became more than just a marketing consultant, I became a merchandiser, meaning that many of the products that are sold in inner city, even to this day, sales people don't service the inner city, they go down into the inner city because of a number of reasons, you know, threat of violence, being ripped off.  So Jewel said to many of these suppliers, "Why don't you hire Don Jackson."  So we, at that time, became Central City Marketing, we were Central City Marketing.  And I had a staff--a crew of about nine or ten sales people in the field and we were--they had cars, and we were at that time, located at 1716 South Michigan, and I mean it was--it wasn't in the business of broadcasting or promotions.  It was really--well it was promotions, but it wasn't in broadcasting, it was merchandising, merchandising and promotions.  And something that I--I--and I really wanted to get back into broadcasting.  I'd sort of fell into the opportunity of merchandising because of Jewel.
Story_ID: 54193
Speaker 1: So finally I went to--well I did--we [Central City Marketing] had all of our clients in the Bud Billiken Day Parade.  Now, this was some 24 years ago--25 years ago today.  And the parade was huge, and I had our client, G.W. Sugar out of Denver [Colorado], they were in the--let me take a break here (pause).  It was G.W.--the client I had was G.W. Sugar out of Denver.  And we were doing promotions in the community to promote what they were doing.  And I had them in the Bud Billiken Day Parade.   And I was driving this van and we were making cotton candy, passing it out to the people along the route.  And you know the parade, the Bud Billiken Day Parade, starts and stops, starts and stops.  About a--at that time, it was a four to six hour parade.  I was in back of this group called the Twirling Illaners (ph).  Now this was some 25 years ago.  And they were a young group, twirling and you know I'm driving and in one instance, I'm in--cause you couldn't go anywhere.  And I'm saying, "Boy, they are really good."  And then I look at the crowd and the crowd is really great, and I'm saying to myself, you know, they have a lot of parades on television.  They got a pep parade on, they got the Hispanic parade on and they got--and St. Patrick's parade on the air.  I says, "I wonder why they don't have this parade--I wonder why they don't have this parade on television?"  So then we travel another ten minutes and then I said, you know this parade--I look at the crowd and no violence, colorful, music, people barbecuing.  I said, "You know this parade really should be on television."  So then I'd go about another half hour waiting for the parade to move, I says, "Boy is this colorful."  I said, "This parade really should be on television."  And by three quarters of the parade, another half hour go by, I says, "You know, I wonder what it would take to put this parade on television?"  And then another thirty minutes I said, close to the end of the parade, I said, "I'm gonna put this parade on television."  I mean I--I had come from, "I wonder why this parade isn't on television to," "I'm a put this parade on television, you know, I'm a do this."  So I start talking to my people that work, for me, and they says, well "Don, you don't know anything about television."  I said, I'm a put this parade on television.  So the next week I called WGN and, initially I called the program department, they gave me the sales department.  So this guy, Jake Finley (ph.) answers, you know phone, says, yeah.  I says, "I'm Don Jackson, Central"--he says "I know who you are."  I said, "you do?"  He says, "yeah, you played ball for Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois]," he says "I'm a former ball player myself.  I played a lot earlier than you did, but I'm a former Wildcat myself.  What can I do for you?"  I said, "Oh, Jake, I said, okay, I said I want to know why you guys have been--and I really came down, I want to know why you guys put all the other parades on the air, but you don't put the Bud Billiken Day Parade on, and that is racist, you know, I got a problem."  He says, "Okay."  He says, "What do you want to do about it?"  I says, "I want to meet with your program director who makes those decisions."  He says, "Okay.  How bout lunch?"  We set up lunch at the Drake Hotel.  They're paying for the lunch.  I'm coming down, had a little note card where I'm gonna lay into em, I mean I had my--I'm gonna--so when we started out you know very cordial, program director, guy's name Jake Jacobson.  And tough guy, tough Jewish guy, and I let into him.  I says "You know what, I says your industry is so racist, you can put all of the parades on the air, but you can't put this parade on the--it's the longest, you know, at that time, it was like 50 years--50 years old  and--and, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," and he says "Yeah, Don, you're right."  And then I said, "and you know they're putting the pet parade on and they're not putting-" he says "you're right."  And everything I said, I mean, he just said you're right.  He didn't argue with me.
Story_ID: 54194
Speaker 1: And then he [Jake Jacobson]--after I got--he says, are you finish?  I says, well, yeah, cause I was still--he said, let me tell you why we don't do that parade, and I'm a be honest with you because you're a friend of Jake Finley and Jake really likes you cause I--you know Jake Finley, I had not known until I called and you know Jake was a--was a--was a fan of mine you know cause he played ball there [at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois].  He says several reasons, he says "Number one it is the only parade of its size that goes through a community.  All the other parades are downtown, Don.  So your parade, the Bud Billiken Parade is on the South Side in the smack, dab, black community, right there in the black community, down Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive."  I says, "Well, what does that have to do with it?"  He says "Well, I'll tell you, secondly, my crew, my production crew is mostly whites.  So I got a feeling that if I put my crew down there, I don't-- you know, I mean, how is it gonna look, an all white crew?"  I says "Well, it still would be televised."  "I mean they would be--no, no, no I--I--I, I got a concern about that."  Then he says to me who--I mean you know "This is a lot of money to sponsor this stuff and how are--how are you gonna get, you know, how am I gonna get it sponsored, I mean, we--we--I wouldn't know who to go to.  So you know we would have to, you know, underwrite it and subsidize it and I'm not in a position to do that.  I'm in a position to make money."  So he says "Now if you can come up with a solution to those factors maybe I'll consider it."  So I looked at him and I said, "Mr. Jacobson, I'll tell you what.  I'll produce the parade, okay.  I'll hire the production crew, I'll get the black production crew, and I'll get the sponsors."  And he looked over at me and he said, put his hand up and he says, "You got a deal."  And I put my hand out and says, "Okay."
Story_ID: 54195
Speaker 1: And then after I did that I says "Now wait a minute, what's the deal?"  I said "What's the deal?"  I said, "I want to do this, but, how do I make money on this thing?"  And he [Jake Jacobson] says, "I'll tell you, it's very simple.  He says, now you got to put up all the money," I said okay, and he says "now, so you put up money for the production and if the production costs you $15,000, that's when-" and at that time that was what it cost.  "For me to bring my truck out here, you hire the crew, now, you get me, you know, the crew" and I said, "I'll get em."  "And if that's $15,000 and I'll cover it with five cameras and a truck and it'll be live, so we got no editing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And you get the writers and you get the director and you do all of that."  I says, "right."  And he says, "now that's the part--that's--that's the physical part of it, okay, you gotta take care of that.  You gotta take--and say if that's $15,000, now you gotta pay me for the air time."  I says "the air time?"  He says "yeah for this two hour--at that time it was two hours.  Two hours. And I'm a charge you $10,000 for that, $5,000 an hour."  I said, "okay," so that's twenty-five thou--I says "that's $25,000."  He says yes.  So he says "now you gotta go and you said you can get the sponsors" cause I had Riceland Rice, I had Quaker, I had Jewel, I had Johnson and Johnson, so I figure I could get, you know, the sponsor.  So he says "now you gotta go get the sponsors."  So he says "now the ideal thing for you to do is that if it costs you $25,000, you would go to the sponsors and you would charge them $50,000.  You keep $25,000 and the other $25,000 goes for the production cost of it."  And he says "generally on television that's how we kind of look at it, you know, we want to make-" I said "that's 100 percent profit."  He says, "yeah, that's generally what--that's what we want to do."  I says "you got a deal," and he says, "okay."  So, now this was--we had all the time to plan so I put together this package to take to the advertisers and talk to them about the Bud Billiken Day Parade and they believed in what we were doing and this--we had--I had never produced anything at all in television, but see, they weren't gonna put it on because they didn't know where to get the advertisers.  So I had all the commercial time in the show to sell.  So I went to these ad--advertisers, Jewel, Quaker, Coca Cola, and they said, yeah, this is big, you know.  And I didn't get, at that time, I didn't get $50,000, but I got like $40,000.  So I made--I made, what was that $15,000 on that thing, and that was pretty good.  And then the people started calling from all over, cause [W]GM was--was all over the country.  And they would say "who is this Bud Billiken?  That's the best parade we've ever seen."  WGN was so--they liked what was going on, they said to me, "Don, you got any more ideas?"  And then that's when we started the "Know Your Heritage" series that's been on for some 23 years and I did the same thing, went to the advertisers and they supported it.  And then after that, what was more important, I saw the power of television.  And I saw the impact that I could make and the void, cause they had no one--none of the stations had anybody on their production staff who could do what we could do.

Speaker 1: So I went to my--my employees and said, hey, we're gonna get out of this business of merchandising.  We're gonna do broadcasting, we're gonna do television and they were very, very upset, cause they were making a good--good living.  And I'll never forget Quaker Oats Company, I went to them and I told them, I says "look, you know we're--I'm gonna cancel our contract cause you know I'm gonna do television."  And they said to me, "Don, this is--well look this transition that you're gonna have, it's gonna take you some time, so why don't go ahead and do your television, but you stay on as a merchandising consultant for us and we'll continue to pay you for a year."  And I says, "well, okay if you want to do that, but I really don't need it."  Well, I want to tell you, I really needed that, I really needed that.  And--cause when we changed over the cash flow and--and to get these advertisers up to speed, but that is what got me into the business of television, and it was, you know, I mean for me very spiritual because at every turn, the contacts that I needed were there, God was, I mean, I didn't know that this Jake Finley, I didn't know who he was, you know, but he had--he was a Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] grad.  And then after that I got involved, because I was doing so much stuff with WGN, to show you how things turn around, they noticed what we were doing and they had bought stations in New York [New York City, New York] and Los Angeles [California] and Atlanta [Georgia] and New Orleans [Louisiana] and felt that this programming could be good for them.  So they came to me and said how would you like a joint venture to help syndicate your programs nationally?  And I said, "oh, great idea."  And we started Tribune Central City Productions.
Story_ID: 54197
Speaker 1: And it was at that time that I got involved with--they [Tribune Central City Productions] said well can you go out and get "Soul Train," cause "Soul Train" had been on the air for, at that time, 14, 15 years, and it was just beginning to wane because they couldn't get time periods and they couldn't, you know, I mean, it was starting to lose its flavor by that time.  So in understanding I had worked with Don Cornelius at WVON [Radio in Chicago, Illinois].  And we left at the same time.  And Don Cornelius had said to me, because I was sales, he said, how would you like to partner up with me, work with me on my dance show, "Soul Train?"  I says, "All Man, I don't want to do no dance show."  And this was back then.  I says "naw, I'm gonna go do something else that's more interesting" than--so I turned him down back then.  So then the Tribune [Central City Productions] says, well, can you get Soul Train?  We can make a lot of money on the commissions of syndicating and selling Soul Train.  So I says, yeah, I can do that.  So I called Don Cornelius and--and he knew who I was and he says, "yeah, my brother, where you been?"  I says, well you know I'm in television now.  He says, what are you playing in television, you know what you're doing?  I says, well I like to come out and talk to you about Tribune repre--he says you in bed with Tribune?  I says, "yes, I am."  He says, "What can you do for me, Man?"  I said, "I've been in this business for 15 years, I know what I'm doing."  So I says, well at least let me come out and talk to you.  So he says, "oh, well, you can come out, but it ain't gon do on good."  So I says, "okay."  So I came out to LA [Los Angeles, California] and I drove up to--he had me meet him at his house, not his office.  So I called him when I got to the airport and says "I'm on the way."  So I get to his house and he has the gate closed.  So I'm saying what is this, he knew--he knows I'm coming.  So I pressed the button, he said, "hello."  I said, "Man, open the gate."  So he opens the gate and he--he has this sunken dining room--he's since moved--he has this sunken living room, rather, and a pool in the back, and he comes out in this damn robe.  I says, "Man, what is this?"  So he says, "Hey, Jackson, what can you do for me, Man?"  Well, I had done all my research.  So I started laughing and I said, "My Brother, why don't you sit down.  Let me tell you what I can do for you.  First of all your show is barely alive, you're not in New York City, you don't know what time you're coming on in LA  I just ran down all of the clearances, which through Tribune's research, I was able to get.  I knew what--I says, you're selling your spots for $3,000 a spot when you should be getting eight to $10,000 a spot.  You're losing a lot of money now, and what I can do is get you carriage, I can get you distribution, I can get you on the Tribune stations in these markets, plus I can more than double your rate.  Are you interested in that?"  He quietly sat down and he said, "oh, you've done some homework."  I said, "yes, my brother."  So I said (unclear) and then he--cause initially when he--when he said for me, he says, what can you do for me?  And I smiled and I started laughing and I says, "Man, you ain't nothing but nigga-rich" (unclear) and he laughed and I said, "now let me tell you what I can do for you."
Story_ID: 54198
Speaker 1: So make a long story short, he said, "well what's the next step," you know.  I said "next step is for you now to come to Chicago."  And I said, "now, when you come to Chicago, I'm gon be doing the negotiating."   So I had had it worked out in terms of--see the Tribune you know they charge you a percent for representing you--syndicating themselves.  And normally for a new show, it's like 35 percent.  But because his show had been on for a long time, we had decided that we would--we would accept, I think, 23 percent, but we would start at 30 percent.  And Cornelius wanted to start at 15 percent you know.  So we wanted to--we wanted to start at 30 percent, he wanted to start at 15 percent.  We had agreed that we would accept 23 percent.  So I had told him, because we were friends, in advance, I had told him what the number was.  And I said "we're gonna negotiate and when we get to 23 percent, we're not going any lower."  So, you know, and he said he was okay with that.  So we're in the meeting with our lawyers and folks and I'm the one who's doing--and he has his lawyer.  I'm the one doing the negotiating.  And--and--and we get to the point where he has come up from 15 percent to 20 percent and in his mind, he said that's where I'm gonna stop.  And I looked at him like this (indicating) and knowing that he and I had agreed to 23 percent.  So at that point, I said, Don, I closed my book, I said "that's a deal breaker, my Brother.  Want to remain friends with you, your show is great, we still have faith in you, but that's--20 percent is a deal breaker, we need to be at 23 percent, that's a deal breaker."  And he--the Tribune people kind of like looked at me, cause they're taking their lead from me, and Cornelius kind of looked at me like he says, okay.  I said wait a minute, why don't we take a break.  Why don't we take a--I need to go to the washroom.  I said fine, let's do that, cause I had closed the book.  So he went to the washroom and then I went outside, I went to the washroom, same washroom he was in.  I looked under the toilets and so forth to make sure no one else was there.  So I said, "Man, what the hell are you doing?"  I said "I told you what the number is."  Says, "yeah, Man, I know what you said it was but I thought we could, you know, stop at 20."  I says "23 is the number, now what's it gonna be?"  He says, "yeah, I see where you coming from.  Man, you doing it, 23 is the number."  I said, "okay."  So we went back into the room and I says now, Don, I said, what's the deal, I mean you got--he says, well, "open your book back up," he says, you know, you guys are killing me, but you know I really think that we can do something and let's do it at the 23 percent.  And that's what it--that's what we--that's what it was done for.
Story_ID: 54199
Speaker 1: And so, you know, we [Tribune Central City Productions], together we, you know I helped him [Don Cornelius].  He's one of the best creative geniuses, I think, in the industry.  I think he could--he--there was a show, the "Soul Train Music Awards".  He wanted to do the "Soul Train Music Awards".  And the Tribune felt that they needed to bring in a producer to do it for him.  And we're fighting him tooth and nails.  And finally I went back to the chairman, and I says look, I says you can't have a white producer come in here, producing "Soul Train Music Awards" for a man who has been in the industry for 15 years.  It just doesn't make any sense, and I won't do it.  And he says, well, Don, you call it, your shot.  You call the shots.  And I went back and I says, Don, it's yours, cause they were gonna also bring in Suzanne de Passe and Cornelius initially liked the idea, but then he decided he wanted to do it himself.  And so with that and then my support on the advertiser side, you know, he was able to do the "Soul Train Music Awards" and then, you know, it's history from that.  He's done that now for, oh, God, that's been now like 15 years that he's been able to do that and he's did very well.  But our paths came back together on that, when we--when we did that.  And then on the same--what also came around full circle was some years later, Tribune brought me into a room to introduce me to this Guy name Chuck Hines, who I had interviewed for a job some 20 something years ago at [W]BBM and Chuck had gone through some changes in his life, you know, where he was up here and then he (indicating down), and I--when he introduced me, he looked familiar, but he had really gone through some changes and he said, I know who you are, and I said, you do, and he says, yeah, WBBM TV, and I said, "ohhh."  He says, "yeah, you're the one who turned me down, remember?"  I said, "ohhh," and they moved him out to the west coast.  We became the best of friends.  He helped me in many, many ways for productions that I had done.  But now he had--he had come through and you know and learned a lot in life, was no--back then I thought he was a racist, but he really wasn't, he just acted like one.  But our paths came back around and he really helped me with the studios out there that he had--he had run out there.
Story_ID: 54200
Speaker 1: So after the stint with the people at the Tribune [Tribune Central City Productions], they had some, you know, we were doing well with our, what we call Central Productions, it was targeted television programs.  We did the "Stellar Gospel Music Awards," we did "Martin the Emancipator", we did all of [Don] Cornelius' productions, we did "Living the Dream" which was a real wonderful special, we did the "March on Washington Remembered", we did a program called "Celebrate the Soul of American Music", which was honoring legends in black music, Dizzy Gillespie, Cab Calloway, Charlie Pride, in all of different art forms, [HM Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine] Little Anthony and the Imperials, [HM] Berry Gordy, oh, the Pointer Sisters, Don Cornelius and where we would bring some of the contemporary artists together to perform with a live band, some of their numbers and the O'Jays.  I mean, we did about four annual shows of that, just wonderful, wonderful shows, high ratings.  And then we did a program for four years called a "Family Night," where we--Gladys Knight hosted the show and then [HM] Nancy Wilson came after her and really some great, great programming things we did, and they provided the station clearances, I provided all the production and also I sold the advertisers.  And then one day when they had elevated this young man who was an executive vice president to president of Tribune of the broadcast division, came to me and said that he wanted to have their own salesman going into the advertising agencies who were selling at that time Joan Rivers, they had Geraldo [Rivera] and they felt that they wanted to use the white salesman, and at that time they had no black sales people to go into the agencies, and I said "What kind of sense does that make and this-" into the black agencies and advertisers.  And they said, "Well Don, we'll--you know we'll still pay you a percent to be around to consult, but we--we really feel that it's, you know," and again some--I felt some racism coming into the play.  And I said well, I think it's about time for us to go our separate ways.  We've learned from one another, you guys have been great to me and--but it's really time for us to go our separate ways.  And they felt--they didn't want to end it, but--but I did.  And that's when we started doing all of our stuff by ourselves, independent of Tribune.  We were doing--and we kept our "Stellar Award" show going, "Celebrate the Soul Family Night," our "Minority Business Report Show" that we have running right now, Bud Billiken Day Parade, "Know Your Heritage," we started doing all of those.  We still have the advertisers' support.
Story_ID: 54201
Speaker 1: I was talking about the Tribune [Tribune Central City Productions] situation.  And what was interesting was when I left the Tribune and when we ended our joint venture Tribune Central City Productions, I'll never forget I was on Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], and Don Cornelius said to me, "Well, Jack, I understand why you have, you know, it's time for you to leave but Tribune has been good to me and I'm gonna stay with em."  And he got into his limo, and I smiled and I said, "Well, my brother, you know I'll always love you, I think you great and I understand."  So it was two years after that he called me and he said, "How would you like to come back and work on--with me" and I says "With the Tribune?" I says "absolutely not."  He says "Well what if you worked independent, if you took care of all the advertiser sales and they took--took care of the station sales," and I said, "Oh, they'll never agree to that."  He says, "Oh, I think they will."  And that's exactly what happened.  So I did come back for a time and work with him.  We did at that time the 25th Anniversary of "Soul Train," together, and so it's been really a fun experience having worked with him.
Story_ID: 54202
Speaker 1: And you know after all of the experience of doing all of our shows for, you know, close to 30 years and seeing the affect that it has had, what the industry still has not been able to do with us, giving us programming time on television.  You know it used to be, years ago, that programming was king, that if you had the right creative, if you had the right stars, you can get anything on television.  Today, because of the consolidation for many syndicators and independent producers, I often say, you could bring a Michael Jackson with an Eddie Murphy and some of the greatest sports stars together in a show or a series and it still wouldn't get on because of the obligations that these stations like ABC, in particular, they have obligations now to Disney, who owns them.  And Disney has their own programs that they want on ABC.  So if it interferes with what they have going on with--with Disney ABC, you can have the greatest lineup of talent there, even crossover talent and that show won't get on the air.  So today, to me, it's not programming as much as programming is king, it's distribution is king.  In other words the ability to get a time-slot to get on.  So what my focus is today, cause I want to do more programming, I want to do more shows that reflect what we're about, I mean, they're still no black soaps on the air, they're no black dramas on the air, they're no black game shows, quiz shows on the air other than our local "Know Your Heritage" series, and I can go on, I mean that reflect what we truly are about.  And so what I've seen with the WB [Warner Brothers] network and UPN [United Paramount Network] network is they started with one night a week two hours--for two hours of programming that they provided and WB started with a group of the--a group of the Tribune [Tribune Central City Productions] stations and a deal that they had there, and for some Tribune, they were pre-empting some of the [Chicago] Cubs games, which was like "Whoa, what are you doing?"  But they were a network, and then they expanded from one night to five nights of two hours a week and they're now locked in and UPN did the same thing.  And it was said when they started some four, five, six years ago that those--that you couldn't have two independent networks, who could make it, and that one of them would have to fail.  Well, both of them made it.
Story_ID: 54203
Speaker 1: So what I'm looking at, initially, I was looking at stating another black cable network and I was calling it "Black Family Television Network"--"The Black Family Television Network".  And we got off on trying to look at doing a studio on the West Side so we could produce our own shows more efficiently.  Well, it was sort of--it sort of side-tracked me from the mission of developing a black network, okay, which was truly my goal of developing another black network where we can original programming.  Now, the problem with, at least today, and Bob Johnson has said this, who is chairman of BET [Black Entertainment Television], is that it's difficult to get broadcast rates for a cable network that would permit you to do original first run programming because so many people had talked about the low level of programming, a lot of the music videos that they do, but it is the truth, you can't get--he cannot, although he does get subscription rates, he cannot get the amount of dollars from the broadcast community to do original programming, because he has to charge cable rates, which means that, where as we can get $50,000 a spot, he can get $1500 a spot, you see.  So the dollars and cents holds him back from doing first run original programming.
Speaker 2: So there's a ceiling on cable?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes it is, it's distribution, it's coverage, you know, that cable doesn't--hasn't penetrated to the level that broadcast, so there's a difference, there's broadcast, which is free television, and there's cable which is paid, you have to pay cable.  Now, we've had BET [Black Entertainment Television]--we have BET, regardless of whether it's, you know, owned by Viacom or Bob Johnson, it's still black oriented.  We have MBC [MBC Network, later Black Family Channel], which is a black cable network out of Atlanta [Georgia].  They're having problems getting distribution.  We've had NUE [New Urban Entertainment Television] out of Baltimore [Maryland], which is cable.  And what came to me was a light bulb went on and said well, you know, we don't have a, and we've never had, a black broadcast network, okay.  Hispanics have two, they have Univision and they have Telemundo and their networks and they have about four or five cable Spanish networks, okay.  And those two broadcast networks do extremely well in terms of ad revenues.  We've never had a black broadcast network, ever, okay.  So I took a look at some research and what it shows was that we black--black America our viewing patterns at late night are extremely high, and that our, what we call "HUT levels," Homes Using Television, are extremely high.   If you watch "Showtime at the Apollo" comes on late night but still gets a huge rating.  And when Arsenio [The Arsenio Hall Show] was on, he got a huge black rating.  So that I'm embarking on, first of all, launching a broadcast, a black broadcast network, but launching it as a late night network.  So that what I'm competing against now are movies, I'm not competing against primetime.  I know my audience is there, late night, and I think it's about time that the industry considers giving us a broadcast network.
Story_ID: 54204
Speaker 1: But it is--it's tougher, it's about getting distribution, it's about, I think, for the broadcast rates that I can get with a broadcast network will afford me to do original programming, entertaining programing.  The opportunity to do something with putting a "Tom Joyner Sky Show" on television, or bringing Arsenio Hall back, or doing an Ebony/Jet showcase, entertainment showcase.  You know they're doing something with Essence [Magazine], I mean, these are the icons in our community that would be natural for a late night broadcast network, starting with one night a week.  And that's where I am focusing, and I'm looking to get some--some broadcast partners in the way  of--or some partners, they don't necessarily have to be broadcast partners, but some partners like a Steve Harvey, for instance, who has done so much for syndicated--syndication.  But after a period of time, after the sizzle is off, and he's no longer out there, Steve Harvey's just going to be a name like [HM] Marla Gibbs was when she was with The Jeffersons, and now, you know, it tough for her to get on television.  So if some of these stars can use their leverage today to help launch a broadcast network, it can mean a lot for them to have a place to perform, to have a place to--to have a show, if they take this initial investment of being involved and launching it.  So a lot, you know, a lot of work is involved, a lot of planning, a lot of dollars is going to be involved, but that is our--my focus, because I think that we deserve our own network.  I think we have to work for it, and it would mean going into individual markets to convince independent stations to give us two or three hours a night, initially one night, from 11:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m.  And there's some other strategies that we're gonna use to help these stations cause it's all about the dollars.  Our strategy is to show these stations that we can make, from them carrying our network of two the three hours, we can make more money for them than they can putting on a movie, okay, or putting on other shows, so that we can justify our existence.  Don't put us on just because we're black, put us on because of economic and economic opportunity for them.  So that's what we're building a case for to do, and it would be the first black broadcast network ever.  So, you know, right now from a dollar point of view, see we participate--we get local advertising dollars and we get syndication dollars and we get some network dollars--we get some network spot dollars.  We don't get network dollars, and that's the biggest pool.  That pool of network dollars is 35 to 40 billion dollars.  The next pool of dollars is national network spot where they can select what markets they want to go in, and that's about 20 billion dollars.  And then the next pool is local television and that pool is about 15 billion.  The next pool is 10 million, that's syndication.  So that's the game that--that's where we get our revenues.  So, you know, we never participated in network broadcast advertising, what they call the up-fronts which permits you to charge broadcast rates to produce original first-run programming.  You see what I'm saying?  So that is--it's new, I think it's innovative.  A lot of folks say, well, you can't do that today.  Well, I think with bringing all of the elements together, the right investors, some pressures from the community, the right group of advertisers so that there's an economic advantage for doing that, and original first-run entertaining programming is what can make that a reality.
Story_ID: 54205
Speaker 1: So that is the task, you know, we're doing our, you know, our shows, "Stellar Awards," "Minority Business Report," "Know Your Heritage," "Bud Billiken Day Parade," (Axel?) Awards, we're still doing those shows.  But where, in terms of long term, if I can leave something behind, if I can start something that can have an impact on our community, it is creating for the first time ever a broad--a black broadcast network, which would be called "Late Night Television Network" LTN, and versus a black late night, because the--anybody can watch, Arsenio's audience as well as Steve Harvey's audience.  You know I mean black people set the trends, set the pace, in terms of music and entertainment.  So it's not a restrictive network, you know, so it wouldn't the "Black Broadcast Late Night Network," it would just be called the Late Night--Late Night Television--Late Night Television Network--The Late Night Television Network.  And that's where my focus energy, I mean it's like a--it's a new incentive for me to have an opportunity to launch something like this.  Now the studio that was initially an idea that I started with the City of Chicago, is still moving forward with a developer, [HM] Peter Bynoe.  And I'm still supportive of that project, I'm still involved with it, but for the first time, we have someone who has developed a building, a studio like that, and that's, you know, Peter Bynoe did the United Center [Chicago, Illinois] and Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois], and I was becoming a developer versus launching a network, and that's where--that project is still moving on, it's a big project, but the focus of my attention is in launching the first black broadcast late night network versus going--I'm not going the cable route and you know Don Cornelius is looking to do a "Soul Train" channel, and I'm blessing that and helping him however I can, but I think I want to fight for a black broadcast network and then, you see, we can within, you know, if we have two to three hours a night, we can put whatever we want on there, as long as it's entertaining and it makes money.  But it would be original programming, it wouldn't be music videos and it wouldn't just be you know reruns, which is what, unfortunately, many of the cable networks have to do to survive.  They have to have a high degree of reruns to support you know what they're doing cause they're not getting a lot of the advertising revenues that the broadcast stations are getting.  So, that today is my vision and where we're looking to go to put together the experiences that I've had in the industry as it relates to production, as it relates to launching new shows, as it relates to distribution and syndication, as it relates to advertising, the ability to talk to corporate community about making an investment.  I think our potential is to build with what just the two to three hours a night can build a three to four billion dollar broadcast network.
Story_ID: 54206
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems clear to me that this if done it's going to be you big legacy that you're going to leave for the black community?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah that's--you know when you talk about, you know, what do we leave behind, I think that if we can--if we can leave behind a vehicle, a distribution vehicle where the black talent that we have, the creative writers, the directors where they can create and have some place to put these shows on the air.  I mean people come to me with great ideas, but I know that again, as I said programming today in broadcast, to me, now this is my opinion, is not king, you know, I mean, you could have back in the day, Frank Sinatra; Sammy Davis, Jr.; you got all of the great stars, that would dictate getting on, you know, that's--it's not enough to have a great script and great stars and a great idea, you--distribution, if you don't have the distribution, you're not gonna get on.  So we've got to start there, we've gotta start on broadcast, we can't give up.  I'm not--I don't want to give up on broadcast, you know, I mean, they--we black viewers watch more television, 40, 50 percent than any other ethnic group.  We have been, in my opinion, my opinion, the backbone of the broadcast television industry to keep their ratings where they are, cause we're watching more hours, more days, we have more people in the family watching and that industry hasn't given much back to us.  When you look at today, on all of the networks there, I think ABC and FOX with Bernie Mac Show and with Damon Wayans' Show--Damon Wayans Show on ABC, those are the only two, and they're sitcoms, still no dramas, still no quiz shows, still no sitcoms, I mean, when you see how much our audiences watches of sitcoms, so to me that is what I think the opportunity is there for us to do and that's--that's the legacy that I want to leave behind so that once it's set up, you know, we have a network and then you can put whatever you want to put on there.

Speaker 1: All right, so your father [John Wesley Jackson] had a chance and your mother [Lillian Peachy Jackson] too, to some extent, had a chance to see you achieve a high level of success.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  That was the great thing, especially, I would be able to bring mother out to my shows, the Bud Billiken Day Parade and she would sit and watch and see our name on the screen, and my father would, you know, some of the press would save all of the clippings and you know tell all his friends.  So I mean, yeah, they were able to really enjoy some of that early success.  But now, you know, after a while you let the ego go and you want to do something of substance, you know what I'm saying?  I'm not looking--some of my friends are looking to retire.  They've reached, you know, retiring.  They've reached a point--they don't--I mean to me I feel more livelier as I did when I--when I said I'm gonna to put the Bud Billiken Day Parade on, and that's been what I've been successful in doing, when I say I want to do something, I generally do it.  I feel the same way that, I'm gonna start this broadcast network, regardless of the--all of my friends think that it's going to be a tough up-hill battle, but I'm not going along the same route, you know.  This is at least, I don't know of anyone else who is thinking along the lines that I'm think along--along the lines of.
Story_ID: 54208
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  You're still young, you're still working on this stuff, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked to be remembered as an innovator, as an initiator who, not only launched new programming for African Americans, but someone who created a vehicle and paths for African Americans to come behind me.  And that has happened.  Many of the camera men who work on Oprah's [Oprah Winfrey] show, I mean, we gave them a start, and some of the writers and directors, some of the stage hands in Hollywood [California], some of the writers who work on our show work on the Grammys [Awards] and they're able to say, they--you know Central City Productions we work--and they put that down so--and we need more of that.  And I've been you know conscious of who I've hired on my productions to give them a start even though some of them didn't work out quite well, they had to grow.  So I'd like to be remembered as being a facilitator in providing a vehicle for African Americans to follow, to keep things going like the Bud Billiken Day Parade, for instance, even while I'm gone, as long as it stays in Central City [Productions], it should be able to just go on and on and on, you know, cause you know of the success that it's had.  But the network concept you know starting that it's like you know, I'm chairman of the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] and my mission there is to build a new facility that all of our children, black and white, can enjoy, in terms of seeing that facility grow, and that's what I'm--that's what I'm about, and innovator, a facilitator, a starter, starting things that, not only I can enjoy.  So, you know, I'm not looking to get a place in Miami [Florida] and retire and come back you know here.  I mean, I want to stay active, I'm in great shape, I feel better now at age, I'll be 59 this year, than I did when you know I was not in--you know when I was in my 30s, when I was you know kind of enjoying the fruits of being successful.  I mean I feel much better now.  And I think I have more--I've learned a lot.  I have more of a mission purpose than just a survival purpose.
