Joey Fink: It&#8217;s August 10, 2010. I am in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, with Joan Boyd Short. Joan, I would like to start just by asking you to tell me a little bit about where you are from, what your childhood was like, what brought you into this part of the country.  Joan Boyd Short: Sure. I was born in Alabama because my dad was working for TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] and we were there just for three years but I happened to come along at that time.  JF: What year were you born?  JBS: In 1945, so I am about to be sixty-five years old. We moved back to Chattanooga when I was three, so I don&#8217;t have many memories of Alabama, but I was raised outside Chattanooga in an area that has now grown up into the Hamilton Place area. At that time it was an isolated, rural area and it was sort of a post-war-obviously, World War Two [laughter]- suburban sort of community. We were what would be considered a middle-class family at that time. My dad worked for the TVA and for Provident Life and Accident Insurance. I had one brother, David. My mother was an in-home mom until we were older. David was five years older than I am, so just sort of that typical little nuclear family. I went to a school there in that community that was grades one through nine. I went into Chattanooga, which was about eight miles away, for high school, and also went to college in Chattanooga. So I would say that I had a very comfortable middle-class upbringing. My father&#8217;s people were from the Sequatchie Valley. My grandfather was a coal miner there in the Whitwell mines and died of black lung, actually, although they didn&#8217;t call it that at that time. My mother&#8217;s people were from the Sweetwater area of East Tennessee. My grandmother was born in Philadelphia. So, rural roots in all the generations right before the one that I was raised in. Do you want me to go on with what happened then? After I went to college, I was an English major--.  JF: Where did you go to college?  JBS: I went to the University of Chattanooga. That was before it became part of the UT [University of Tennessee] system.  [After that,] I went to Nashville.  JF: Did your parents want you to go to college? Was this sort of a track they had you on, or was this something that you desired?  JBS: I think yes, I think they did want me to go to college. I think Dad probably thought I would get married because that had been his experience with women at that time. They tended to get married and their husbands worked and the women stayed home and took care of the family. Of course, things were changing a lot because that was the--. I graduated from high school in &#8217;63 and from college in &#8217;67. So there were lots of things going on, especially in the Jim Crow South, and Chattanooga was one of the great bastions of racism.   JF: Had Chattanooga integrated when you were there?  JBS: No. I did not go to school with an African American until my senior year in college. There was one African American at that college. Although my high school was located in a geographic area where there were a lot of African American families who went to their own high schools, so integration was still happily embedded in the South at that time. However, I will say that right after I graduated from high school, the high school building itself closed down and a new one was built across the river in North Chattanooga, and that was an integrated high school. They also built a new high school out in the Brainerd area which was closer to where I had been raised, and that high school was almost completely black at this point because there was an outmigration from those downtown areas where African Americans were almost sealed in, sort of in the middle of town there.   I did a lot of bus riding to town and back from my community and I often rode with my mother downtown when I was a little girl. One of my first memories was that the black people got on the bus through the back door set back there, and that there was that sort of informal demarcation line. There was always a little bit of nervousness about how far back does a white person sit. How far forward, if there is a seat, could a black person come? I was raised in a little Methodist church and what I saw around me conflicted with what I thought I was being taught was right.  So I certainly remember that conflict and my parents telling me that it was the law, but it must be very hard for our black friends that we knew at church, although we did not have close relationships. We had a black couple who worked at the church and got to be friends with my mother. My parents were, I would not call them racist, I would call them nervous. They had worked so hard to get property rights and that kind of thing, to have their own property and their own home, and the idea that the value of the property might go down if black families moved in was a concern of theirs. But I was never taught to hate, as a matter of fact I was taught not to, because someone&#8217;s skin was different. But I kept being told, &#8220;We have to obey the law. We have to obey the law.&#8221;  I went on to Nashville, which was also a place where there was a lot of civil rights activity going on. I went there in 1967 and I worked for WSM Television, which is the Grand Ole Opry station. I had been a folk singer in my high school years and always loved to sing in the church choir, and was very fortunate to have as a guitar teacher Norman Blake, who is a well-known guitar and fiddle player. He certainly can play bluegrass but he is one of the best traditional guitar players around. He was in &#8220;O Brother Where Art Thou?&#8221; and he played for Johnny Cash as his acoustic accompanist. He knew Mother Maybelle [Carter], played with her a lot, introduced me to the Carter Family because I loved the Carter Family music. My mother loved it also. So my guitar lessons became, &#8220;Here is a new Carter Family song. After you learn it, then we will move on to another Carter Family song, but you have to learn to play it the way Maybelle would have played it.&#8221;  I almost hate to put this down for the future because it certainly would not help Norman&#8217;s reputation to be known as my guitar teacher [laughter] because I didn&#8217;t follow up as he would have wanted me to. He and his wife at that time, first wife, and child, Lee, moved to Nashville almost the same time I did, so we were friends there. Between my job as a public relations person at WSM and with Norman&#8217;s contacts, I got to be around a lot of Nashville musicians and Grand Ole Opry. Then I went to thinking that I might get a graduate degree. I was an editor for Vanderbilt University for a while and their press and publications, and sort of decided that the only thing that would do me less good than a BA in English would be a Master&#8217;s in English, so I decided against that. But by that time there were a lot of things happening in the civil rights movement as well as people using music to try to say something about social justice, social situation. So I got caught up in that, met friends who were using music for that, began to write some songs of my own. I loved traditional music as opposed to country music. I met Jean Ritchie and got to know her and brought her to Vanderbilt to do a concert, and we got to be friends.    Billy Edd Wheeler was another person I met who is a very well-known songwriter. A lot of people don&#8217;t know his name, but they know his songs. He has a couple of songs on Johnny Cash&#8217;s, well, on a lot of Johnny Cash&#8217;s albums. He wrote &#8220;Jackson&#8221; that Johnny and June recorded. Anyway, he was very encouraging of my songwriting and music. All of those things were sort of happening at once. Jack Daniels, through a sort of fluke of incidence, asked me if I would come do public relations for them, that was their corporate offices in Nashville, not the distillery itself, although I did work there with retirees from the distillery. They had quilting cooperatives and that kind of thing for their retirees. So I did spend some time near the distillery but mostly I was in Nashville at corporate offices. That is the same time that I got much more politically involved in the civil rights movement and what was going on in the Nashville area. I moved into the house on Twenty-Second Street.  JF: Can you describe the house a little bit?  JBS: Oh yeah, I am sorry--.  JF: When you got there, was--.  JBS: We talked about that earlier--.  JF: Was it already, were there people already living there or did you join with some other folks to pick a place?  JBS: No, they had been living there. There were four or five people who were living there at the time. That would be Ed Hamlet, Brenda Bell, Fran Ansley and Jim Sessions, who came in right after I left, George and Connie Brosi who had been living there and they left, and that is when a room became available for me to move in, and Rich Hannigan and Lucy Barker were all living there. It became a sort of political hub for a lot of what we call, &#8220;movement people&#8221; at the time. People came in and out of town. All of the people in the house were very involved in the politics of that time.   JF: How did you find out about the house? Did you just know some folks who said, &#8220;There is a room opening up,&#8221; and--.  JBS: I guess I met them singing, at a festival. I am trying to remember now how I did come across them, but I think that is how. I was just talking to them and someone mentioned that there would be a room available and so I moved in with them. I spent a lot of time changing clothes. I was still working for Jack Daniels in the corporate office, and they, of course, did not allow women into the, quote, &#8220;bar.&#8221; I was the first woman that had been hired on a professional level as opposed to secretarial hourly worker, and the same thing had been true at WSM, by the way. I was the first woman with a college degree to be hired at WSM to do public relations.  JF: What do you think motivated Jack Daniels to hire a woman? Was it pressure from interest groups that they diversify their professional staff?  JBS: I doubt it.  JF: Or was there a more progressive person in charge of hiring that just decided &#8220;This is ridiculous, she is qualified&#8221;?  JBS: I have never really thought about that. Actually I got to know about the job through someone I met in my music connections and they knew I had public relations background, and they needed someone who had public relations. I am not sure that they had specifically thought male or female. It was just mostly a male world at that time. I showed up and they liked the experience that I had and so they hired me. I am not sure what kind of conversation went on among them as to whether this was a major thing, it was just that I noticed after they hired me that I was the only woman on that kind of level that had a college degree and had been hired at a salary instead of an hourly wage. I have never really given that a whole lot of thought. They didn&#8217;t want me to wear pants to work, I remember that. That was about the time that pantsuits for women arrived on the scene, so I wore mostly skirts and blouses and put my hair up instead of braiding it.   I had two or three people under my supervision who were hourly workers. One was an African American, who was the only African American working for them at the time, who ran their press, their print shop, and printed things for them.  He had to wear a tie, a bowtie, and a white shirt, and it was heavy, it was hot in the print shop. But they insisted. One day I saw him and he was really nervous and he said, &#8220;I am going to be late for work, I forgot my tie.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I think it will be OK for one day. Please come on in.&#8221; But he wouldn&#8217;t. He was really concerned about it. He said no, because they would send him on errands to the bank or something, and they wanted him clearly identified in a certain way. So I did go to my boss and say-they all wore blazers with the Jack Daniels emblem on it-and I said, is there any reason why he couldn&#8217;t also have a blazer with a Jack Daniels emblem on it and wear a shirt that was comfortable to wear in the print shop, and then he could put his blazer on if he needed to run errands. They did agree to that.    I know that is not a huge step for civil rights, but I guess I always have thought of myself as a one-on-one kind of person, and look for opportunities where I can make a one-on-one difference in someone&#8217;s life instead of this huge difference as a community organizer. I don&#8217;t think I have gifts that way.  But that felt just so obvious to me, and I couldn&#8217;t believe how grateful he was to be out of that white waiter-looking shirt. I know that is just a really simple story, but things were just so ingrained that very often when people just thought and looked at it from a pragmatic point of view, or when someone got in their way and forced them to do that, things could change.  His brother came to work and they did the same thing for his brother, so you make tiny little steps where you can.  I was also involved in The People&#8217;s House in Clarksville, which was an Air Force base where a lot of Vietnam vets were returning, and certainly walked on several picket lines. But my daily life was not filled with anything but just trying to always express my feelings about things to the people that I worked with. [Pause] So, I remember when Martin Luther King was killed in 1968, being in Nashville. There was a woman who had worked at WSM who had taught me a lot about cooking since I was on my own for the first time. She was a black woman, Sarah Williams was her name. Her brother had died and I had agreed to go over to her house and sit and be there to accept food, because neighbors were bringing in food, while she and her husband went to the funeral home and made arrangements and that kind of thing. So I was going over for a couple of hours to stay at her house to greet people, and that was the day King was killed. She called and said, &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t try to come, I don&#8217;t think they will let you in.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Who won&#8217;t let me in?&#8221; She said, &#8220;To the neighborhood.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, who is there that would not let me in?&#8221; and she said, &#8220;There is a tank in front of my house.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t believe it, because in my part of Nashville there were certainly no tanks and not even a police presence. There were more policemen sort of on the streets that afternoon, I did notice that. But they were not letting people leave that neighborhood or letting people in, so I didn&#8217;t get to--. She had asked them, and they said, no, I probably would not be allowed in, that a white person coming into a black neighborhood would be seen as possibly--. I don&#8217;t know how the Nashville Police saw things; we never did figure it out.  But I do have that clear memory of not being able to do that, and that was before I moved into the house that that took place.  We had a lot of people come by the house. The thing about the movement at that time was that people came from all, hitchhiked, from all over the United States. There was a community among young people that was just sort of unspoken but it was there. I laugh today; I look at Tea Party signs and I think, we carried signs that said similar things about overthrowing the government or whatever, but it was more for an establishment of a democratic community as opposed to me and what my rights are.  So it interests me that some of the rhetoric I see on the signs is the same rhetoric but the intention is so different that--. I became more and more involved then in songwriting and interested in political movement, so I took a job at the Epworth [Jubilee Community] Center in Knoxville and I did a lot of traveling in the mountains singing songs in different places where communities were organizing against strip mining. I worked there with Epworth with returning veterans, students-because we were just a couple of blocks away from UT and there was a student movement at UT, so I worked some with that-and with afterschool children in our community, in the neighborhood, latchkey kids. Then also during that time at Epworth I spent a lot of time out at the Highlander Center. We did a lot of coordinated workshops and festivals and got to know Guy and Candie Carawan really well. We sang a lot with them and they encouraged my singing, my songwriting.   Then I went back to Nashville for a summer to work for Jack Daniels, they wanted me to come back just to work on a special project, and so I did go back. I was in a relationship that, we just couldn&#8217;t be on the same track at the same time, and I had heard from my friends Rich and Lucy in the house that they were getting ready to move to southwest Virginia.  Rich wanted to go to nursing school up here and he already had a nursing degree but he was going to come up to the Redbird Center to do further work, and Lucy was going to work for a new childhood development program that was part of an educational cooperative here in southwest Virginia. She was going to be a home visitor working with mothers of preschool children, actually birth to three and four, just to help with some developmental games and things that the Head Start program was just getting underway. This was a program in the home to show some mothers, if they were interested, how to play games with their kids that could help develop their coordination and so forth.   So they told me that a public relations position was open in that program, and did I want to come to the mountains. I had already been in this area singing and knew a lot of people here, and of course, knew them, so I decided I would come up and interview for the job. If I got it, that would be the signal that I needed to get out of Nashville and out of that relationship, and if I didn&#8217;t, then I needed to work harder on that relationship. I got the job, so I packed my car, came to southwest Virginia, and met the person who is now my husband on the first day of work. So it was serendipitous to say the least. That is how I got here to southwest Virginia, and that was in 1972.   I was still very involved with Highlander [Center], still going back to the Jubilee Center. A group of women had a women&#8217;s singing group that we called, I guess we called it &#8220;the women&#8217;s group.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I always called it. Some may have referred to it as a choir, but it was just a few of us who liked to sing, and when I was in Knoxville we would get together and have potluck suppers and sing and talk. Everybody would bring songs that they liked. Some were union songs, some were songs we had written, different people might have written some, or old ballads, sort of anything went if you liked the song. We sang a lot of Loretta Lynn&#8217;s songs, but most of them were songs written by or about women. We sang a lot of Jean Richie songs, sang anti-war songs, women&#8217;s songs, and really enjoyed that. I have a picture I can show you of that group, if you'd like to see it.   JF: What were some of the topics that surfaced, the biggest concerns or problems or issues that would come up among the women that got together?  JBS: In that group? You know, truthfully, those women were so involved in the women&#8217;s movement, in different programs around the Knoxville area, law school and there was so much going on, that that was almost a time off [laughter]. We talked about things that women tend to talk about, or certainly at that time. Women&#8217;s health issues, we talked a lot to each other about that. We talked about challenges of work or law school, or people would come and blow off steam about particular jobs or incidents that they knew about, concerns about people we knew who might be struggling with health problems. So it was sort of a more personal exchange than it was a political conversation, but it almost always led to some sort of discussion. At that time, it was the life you lived, it wasn&#8217;t like let&#8217;s get together and talk about this; it was all you talked about. No matter if you were visiting two people, one person met each other on the sidewalk, usually the conversation would turn to topics that people were very concerned about. That would be, of course, the war, the student movement on campus, or--.   We also, at Epworth, had an attempt at a drug rehabilitation center. It was not a formal thing but we tried to get people to places where they needed to go. Same thing with counseling for returning vets. So it was--. I was very fortunate to have associates who were not just people who wanted the world to be better but were willing to dedicate their whole lives to trying to make it better. I was sort of with them in that period when they were figuring out how to do that, and they have certainly gone on to make a huge difference in adult education and--. [Phone ringing] Sorry. [Recorder is turned off and then back on].  JF: I&#8217;ll make sure the sound is still good.   JBS: I&#8217;ll try to figure out where I was [laughter].  JF: I was thinking I wanted to ask you, the way you describe the way you moved through Chattanooga to Nashville to Knoxville back to Nashville--.  JBS: It was a network.  JF: Yeah, and you say &#8220;the movement&#8221; and that comes up a lot in interviews, people just say &#8220;the movement.&#8221; It is not any particular one, it is just the movement. What do you think were the strengths and challenges of that very nebulous broad spectrum of people with this commitment to changing the world and in a whole bunch of different ways going about doing it and a whole bunch of different networks through which to work? Some of the benefits of that kind of holistic approach and some of the challenges for you personally, or that you saw with people that you were close with?  JBS: I think certainly some of the challenges but also the strengths were that you were constantly in touch with people that you had not been in touch with before. You heard their stories and they had their strengths. I taught high school for thirty-two years, and if you mention the 60s or 70s you immediately get the flower children, drug culture, Woodstock thing. While all of that went on-and I knew people who went to Woodstock, I didn&#8217;t go, I couldn&#8217;t afford to go to New York-I think that immediate sense of recognition from which community is eventually formed--. There were a few people who came through when I lived in Nashville and we were in the house that we actually ended up being nervous about, like we didn&#8217;t know them and we were very welcoming to strangers, people we didn&#8217;t know. I guess I forgot to mention that our house was in a black neighborhood, which certainly set off the Nashville police even more [laughter]. We had friends of all races coming and staying with us, and I think one challenge was that it made us a little vulnerable. There was a possibility that you could get hurt if you weren&#8217;t careful, but I think that was the exception more than the rule, and living in a house where you had a lot of people looking out for each other made it a lot easier.   You also had people who had their own ideas, it&#8217;s like deciding that everyone of the Muslim faith would be terrorists, or everyone who would claim Christianity as their faith would also embrace the philosophy of the [Ku Klux] Klan, those kinds of-. I know those are clich&#233;s but that is actually the way people looked at, quote, &#8220;movement people.&#8221; I would say that movement people were people who really did want to see a change in the world and weren&#8217;t sure how to do that. We found out with George McGovern that there weren&#8217;t as many of us as we thought [laughter]. When you only associate with people that you agree with, and this is true I am sure whether you are talking about the Klan or terrorism or whatever, you tend to think that the whole world is with you, and that certainly wasn&#8217;t true and we were not as strong as we had hoped we were. We did not get to make a big change there and stop the war earlier. I mean it was clearly going to stop when it was going to stop. That was also contingent, I think it took a while for people to realize that we were not mad at soldiers, we were mad at the people who sent the soldiers up one hill one day and back the next. Those lives were just statistics, they were not lives. So there was this feeling of assault on that age group, I think, that generation, and that other people were fellow victims in that.   You had so many movements at that time. You had the American Indian movement, which was very, very active at that time. You had people who were much more militant and less militant groups, and you weren&#8217;t always sure, you had to constantly ask yourself where your boundaries were and constantly ask yourself if you had judged correctly about where someone else&#8217;s boundaries were. So it was just a time of upheaval, but a time of so much hope that things could be different and that we could make them different. I think [pause] of course we made a lot of mistakes by separating ourselves from the mainstream, I think, because it is hard to work on the mainstream if you don't have connections in the mainstream. I ended up being someone, for good or bad reasons--. Maybe it was my public relations thing, maybe it was my struggle with faith, with religion. We had lots of discussions about religion at that time.  I know you have spoken with Jim Sessions and Bill Troy who are ministers. I think we just all got hit at that same period in our lives where we had to question things that we had not questioned before. We were all together in that big questioning phase and we were all going in different directions with that.   So I think over-estimating our power, because we convinced each other we were powerful people; we weren&#8217;t. I do think we made a difference in terms of bringing issues to people&#8217;s attention, I think we couldn&#8217;t be ignored. I think movements take a long time, and we wanted it done next spring [laughter]. Movements, social and political movements do come and go, I mean they are fluid. It is a journey. It&#8217;s not just a period of time where there is a demarcation for the beginning and one for the end. It&#8217;s like watching a river move and it goes off into different tributaries. It&#8217;s very interesting to talk to each other now; I always learn so much.   I always-for reasons I don&#8217;t understand completely, and maybe it had to do with music as a different approach to people-ended up as a bridge person. Maybe it was just because I still owned a pair of pantyhose, I don&#8217;t know, or because I had a Sunday dress. But I was willing to go out to church groups, main line churches, and try to talk about what was happening in the world. This was also Watergate, and there were just so many things over those two decades that were going on. The late 60s flowed into early 70s and decades just don&#8217;t work there, when you are talking about movement. It was individual movements and then how that tied into a larger movement. But I would go, I was the one that was willing to try to go to a church group that looked like the church I had grown up in, and explain what my concerns were, what my issues were. I was sure, of course, that Jesus was as radical as I thought I was, and believed in what I was doing [laughter]. Maybe he was even a Christian socialist, who knows [laughter]. There are still people today arguing today over whether Jesus is a Democrat or a Republican, so we haven&#8217;t gotten very far in that context.  I offended a lot of people, I am sure, in those situations, and I had to take some abuse. A lot of questioning about why--. Oh, I sang hymns always, I think gospel hymns have always been a kind of music that is a bridge for people, so I would sing songs.   I remember talking about rhetoric to one very large church group one time and how we use terms without really thinking what those terms mean, it is just bumper-sticker terms: anti-establishment, long-haired freak, that kind of thing. So I took some of those terms and took them apart and talked about what they thought when they used that, or what I might have thought that would be different from what they thought, so I said that I wanted to sing a song about one of my favorite long-haired freaks, and of course I meant Jesus. This one woman almost had a heart attack and they had to fan her and hope she wouldn&#8217;t faint. &#8220;My Jesus is not a long-haired freak.&#8221; But at least the discussion was going on, and out of that the women in the group had to decide whether they sided with her or sided with me. So in some ways it was good to be questioned because people couldn&#8217;t just listen and drink their tea and go home. She created a conflict there, and people had to then take a side. A lot of them, of course, were uncomfortable with that, but quite a few came up, and I heard from others later, who wanted to talk to me who had children they didn&#8217;t understand, children my age. What were they trying to do?  I remember one woman&#8217;s son had married an African American woman and they had two children, and how hard it was for her to accept that in her family. We talked through her struggle. I was raised a Methodist and was confirmed in the Episcopal Church when I was in college, and I actually had intentions of going into the priesthood or into the deaconate, but the church wasn&#8217;t ordaining women at the time so that was just a whole other struggle.  The Presbyterian Church invited me to a conference and I went and sang and talked about women in general, women my age. So they gave me a name. They called me their &#8220;new lifestyles&#8221; person and invited me to the national Presbyterian conference [laughter]. I had no idea what that meant, but they seemed to want me in long skirts, braids, my tire tread sandals, my guitar.  I remember when I wasn&#8217;t in sessions singing Appalachian songs or political songs and they were asking me why I thought the way I did, I was watching Watergate hearings in the student center. But I never did exactly understand what a &#8220;new lifestyles&#8221; person was. Somehow I represented it to people, I guess I wasn&#8217;t quite as in-your-face or confrontational as other people were because I was still struggling with my own faith. Maybe I just hadn&#8217;t gotten angry enough; I was angry, but again it was sort of that one-on-one kind of attitude that I have had. If I can make a difference at all, it is probably going to be in small ways. Hopefully lots of small ways. So, I am going off a lot of tributaries here. I don&#8217;t know if that answered your question at all about the movement.  JF: It did, it did. You have mentioned a couple of times wearing an appearance, putting on clothes or taking them off, or the church wanting you to look a certain way depending on what they wanted you to represent. Do you feel like that was something women had to deal a lot with in the movement, the appearance or the identity they assumed or put forward, all the meanings that would carry and how women dealt with that in their own personal relationships and then in their work and their activism?  JBS: Women have always dealt with that. Society expects this appearance, and I think women at that time were bad about expecting it of themselves. Probably one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life was joining a sorority when I was a freshman in college. I think I was the shortest-lived member of Pi Beta Phi sorority of anybody in the world; I think I lasted maybe a semester, I can&#8217;t remember for sure. [Doorbell ringing] Is that? I&#8217;m sorry. [Recorder is turned off, then back on].  JF: [&#8230;] decide what their appearance is going to convey or what role they are going to play, negotiating that?  JBS: I think that, and I had said, of course, that I think that has always been the case. When I was in the sorority that I mentioned earlier, they wanted you to wear a jumper and shirt or something, I can&#8217;t remember, it was awful. It was back during Jackie Kennedy A-line dress time, and it was the sorority&#8217;s colors, and you wore your little arrow. When you went to the student center you sat with your sorority sisters, you didn&#8217;t sit with your dorm-mates who weren&#8217;t in a sorority. There was no way I could live my life like that. I like costumes but I hate uniforms. Costumes I get to design [laughter] and uniforms someone else designs, so I guess it is just a basic authority issue.    I am a historical re-enactor and we re-enact primarily 1775, pre-revolutionary times in this area. When we decided to do the re-enacting and I started looking at what women had to wear, there are all these very firm opinions about what women would have worn at that time. My opinion is that they would have worn what they wanted to under the circumstances. If they were in Williamsburg, I am sure, they wore certain kinds of tops and petticoats and so forth. If they were on the frontier, working in a garden or pulling flags, they are going to be in whatever works for that. It might be their husband&#8217;s old hunting shirt, or it might be they wore a linen shift, sort of like a granny gown, it is a little tied peasant top, that comes down to below your knees and is made out of lightweight linen. That was your undergarment. Women didn&#8217;t tend to wear much in the way of underwear. They put petticoats over that, we would call them skirts today but they were called petticoats, and these &#8220;short gowns&#8221; as they called them, which were jackets that came down around your hip. I am sure those short gowns came off when they were headed out to the garden and there was only family around. The idea that women would never have worn this but would have worn that I just think is a lot of bologna. They would have worn what worked.   There were constant issues over that. Jack Daniels, I couldn&#8217;t have worked there. They would have just said, you wear a skirt or you don&#8217;t have a job. They didn&#8217;t say anything to me. They could wear pretty much what they wanted to. Then I went to a couple meetings of a women&#8217;s group in Knoxville. I sort of alluded to this earlier, but I have a lot of body hair, I always have, and I didn&#8217;t let the hair grow on my legs. I didn&#8217;t find that comfortable. So I continued to shave my legs, and there were people who questioned my feminist attitudes if I didn&#8217;t shave my legs. I said, &#8220;How is this different from the sorority that told me to wear my jumper?&#8221; If we are talking about women&#8217;s freedom then I ought to be free to do what works for me. So I have never had patience with that sort of thing. I have always dressed very informally, even as a schoolteacher I did, but there were certain really comfortable clothes that a lot of people in the women&#8217;s movement wore, a lot of long skirts and peasant blouses.  That was just comfortable, it was OK with me. I just think women have been fighting that battle since there have been women.   It is a superficial battle, but still there is the whole thing about dressing professionally, and if you choose a profession that requires a dress code, then you have to make the choice of how important that profession is to you. Certainly I have made that choice on many occasions. When I taught, I had certain expectations, and although I dressed more informally than most women, I knew there was only so far I could go with that issue. It was a lot more important to me to be in a classroom with the kids than it was what I had on when I was in the classroom with the kids. So that wasn&#8217;t the battle I wanted to fight, that wasn&#8217;t the ditch I wanted to die in.   But it has certainly been a ridiculous struggle for women, and now it is body type. I am really worried about how thin-. I know we have an obesity problem which is a huge health issue, but I think after teaching high school girls as long as I did that we also have the opposite problem with how we look, what our appearance is. There are simply some girls who are not healthy because they want to look a certain way. I was looking at a pair of jeans in an L.L. Bean catalogue and it said &#8220;Original&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;Original what?&#8221; The legs were like this big in that pair of jeans. I couldn&#8217;t imagine that had been some kind of original style. Then I wondered what the &#8220;Slim&#8221; would look like in that same jeans. That is all fleeting stuff. It is superficial but it is a huge thing for some people, and it is a standard by which people judge other people very frequently, and particularly women.  JF: Were there similar discussion among women, in the women&#8217;s group or otherwise, about the roles women would adopt? Whether you would get married, whether you would be a mother, what that would mean if you did?  JBS: Again, if you were in a women&#8217;s group, it was probably people you knew very well, so it was probably--. There were women&#8217;s forums where you might talk with strangers about things like that and at every festival there was usually a women&#8217;s health workshop and women&#8217;s issues. But just in your everyday life, you mainly talked to women just the way you do today. You were friends, personal things came up about relationships, divorces, sex, gender issues of all sorts, homosexuality, but it was usually being discussed on a personal level. So I don&#8217;t remember a lot of talk in general about birth control, or--. What I do remember very vividly, it was one of the scariest days of my life, was going to a public hearing and Ned McWherter was there, he was the governor of Tennessee. It was a public hearing about the sterilization of welfare women, and there was actually a discussion about whether women who were on public assistance should be sterilized.  JF: About what year was this, do you remember?  JBS: I was living in Nashville at the time, so it must have been the late [19]60s. I was in shock that that discussion could even be held. No discussion of the fact that one man could father how many kids in one night if he wanted to, but there was certainly no discussion of sterilizing men, but sterilizing women. If they were going to continue to be on public assistance, should they agree to be sterilized or should they have their assistance taken away if they weren&#8217;t. It was terrifying. I mean I just felt like I was truly in a novel. It was [pause]--. It said all it needed to say about attitudes towards women in general. Of course, they were primarily discussing poor white and black women as if they were not human beings. I felt like I was listening to a slavery discussion or something. But it was terrifying that I was actually sitting in the state capitol in an assembly room, listening to this discussion going on.  JF: Were you there with a specific group or group of people, or do you remember if there were--.  JBS: I remember that several of us went. Now when I say of us, I could no more tell you who the &#8220;of us&#8221; were. It may have been some of the women you have talked to already, I will have to ask them if they remember that, Fran and Brenda. I mean it may have been. Sue Thrasher, certainly. I just can&#8217;t remember who it was right now.   JF: Were there any groups speaking out in opposition?  JBS: Oh yes. Lots [laughter]. Mostly women, oddly enough. Planned Parenthood was certainly there. What a brave group that has been over the years. Individual women. Very few women in government were speaking, but there were very few women in government at that time. NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and church women. There were church groups that were speaking out against it. I can&#8217;t remember now who I went with, I just remember, it is almost like I was by myself in this room. It was just so unbelievable, it was like a dream. Sometimes I actually wonder later if I dreamed it, but I didn&#8217;t, I know I didn&#8217;t. If I even hear the McWherter name, that is the first thing that comes to my mind, listening to what he thought was a reasonable argument for that, speaking for that. I think appearance is something women are always going to have to struggle with and some of the pressure comes from men and a lot of it comes from other women. That is certainly true in school. It is other girls who put the pressure on girls about what to wear. It is not boys. It&#8217;s other girls and meeting that standard.   JF: So your travels and singing and work took you to southwestern Virginia in 1972?  JBS: Yes, I moved here. I was hired for that job at (1:05:14) and I became the information disseminator for the early childhood program here. My husband, who was not my husband at that time, was my regional supervisor, and he walked in in a suit with his director, who was also in a suit. They worked for the Appalachian Regional Commission who had funded this early childhood program. One of his friends had applied for my job. I am not sure why I was hired, I shouldn&#8217;t have been, it should have gone to someone who lived in this area. The only thing I could figure is because I had hit that crossroads in my life where if I got hired I would come here, and if I didn&#8217;t, you know, that I was probably just incredibly confident because I didn&#8217;t care. I wasn&#8217;t trying to affect an outcome, I was just curious about what it would be. I guess that must have given me a sort of confident edge. And I had had a lot of experience with some large places like Vanderbilt and WSM and Jack Daniels with public relations. So they hired me.   So he wasn&#8217;t very happy that his friend hadn&#8217;t gotten the job, that someone from outside the region was hired. Then I realized that we had met each other the first time I came to southwest Virginia, which would have been the summer before, or the fall before, when they had a festival up on High Knob, which is the big mountain up here, Norton. I came for the music festival and I was singing with all my friends that I had met from here who were musicians and other people that were &#8220;movement singers,&#8221; and we were off singing in a corner somewhere up on the side of this mountain in a big field, and there was someone with an electric guitar and bass playing blues. They were about to perform. I was not happy that they had electrical equipment because I was a purist and thought you ought to use just acoustic instruments. They turned on the mic and they were doing a sound check, so I just marched up to this guy and said, &#8220;Could you turn that down just a little? There are some of us over here who are trying to sing.&#8221; He just sort of looked at me and laughed, and that was my husband. That is the first thing I ever said to my husband, was &#8220;Could you turn that down just a little? You are making too much noise.&#8221; [Laughter]. Then he turned out to be the guy in the suit who was working for the Regional Commission, and we worked together and got to know each other.   He was hired to run his own early childhood [program] and be an administrator for the one in east Tennessee that took in all the east Tennessee counties from Knoxville up to the Kentucky line and all the way back to southwest Virginia. He didn&#8217;t have a place to live down here, he didn&#8217;t know people in this area. So I called Highlander and they let him live in a trailer they had on the grounds at that time, so he got to know the folks at Highlander. They ended up luring him away from the early childhood program to be the administrator at Highlander. That was over a three-year period, and I started coming back and forth, and we ended up marrying in 1975 and living there at Highlander. I went into Knoxville and worked as an editor for Knoxville Press, UT Press and Publications. So that was the second university I had worked for.  JF: So you were back in Knoxville around [19]75?  JBS: Yes. Actually I guess [19]74. I had moved back by [19]74. We got married in [19]75.   JF: How had Knoxville changed since you had been gone?  JBS: Not very much because it was just a few years. Of course, Guy and Candie [Carawan] were there, the Jubilee Center was still there, Epworth [Jubilee Community Center]. Some of the people had left Epworth, I am trying to remember if Marge [Margaret] Gregg, who I mentioned to you, had left by then. She was one of the FOCIS [Federation of Communities in Service] and boy, that is a whole &#8216;nother story that you certainly need to get from her. That whole sisterhood left the Catholic church to work in the mountains. She is the one who is in Abingdon [Virginia] now.   JF: I am going to speak with her later today.  JBS: Oh good, you did get in touch with her then, that&#8217;s great.  JF: She&#8217;s wonderful.   JBS: Yeah, and her work is incredible. It was almost like a symbol of Appalachian, sort of the Appalachian-related movement. Anywhere you saw a gathering or a festival of people who were involved politically or culturally or both in social change, Marge&#8217;s quilt would be there, or a set of posters, or a T-shirt. She would make the T-shirts for the festival. She still is a wonderful artist. She made the altar hangings for our church that are on the altar right now. I love seeing them and thinking about her at that time and in that role. I think you will really enjoy her. [Pause]. I lost the train again. I keep getting off and on all these trains.   JF: This is perfect. We were back in Knoxville in [19]74.  JBS: Yeah, a lot going on at Highlander, very involved there. It is incredible to live in a place where some of the most interesting people involved in social change in the whole world show up at your house and eat dinner. It was just, because there were so many workshops that attracted--. Highlander itself and its labor work and its civil rights work had attracted so many people and so much attention that people came from all over the world.  It was a fascinating place to be part of.   We had a lot of music workshops there, a lot of cultural workshops, but there were also other kinds of workshops going on, and since we lived there, [there were] at least eight of us with workshop participants, and it was just fascinating to have that happen. All of that is part of that journey I mentioned earlier that we were all trying to answer our own biggest questions, and that was a place where a lot of that--. It didn&#8217;t take me long to find out that better questions are a lot more important than an answer, short-term. But a better question is what I think people were really after. Living at Highlander constantly put the better questions in front of you.   Myles [Horton, of Highlander] and I got to be close friends. I had lost my father, and he kind of became a father figure in my life. Also became good friends with his daughter, Charis. So we spent a lot of down time together. Highlander is not always all those exciting workshops [laughter], it could be a pretty quiet place. We ate dinner together a lot and were part of each others&#8217; daily lives, that little community with Guy and Candie just off the edge there, and Sue Thrasher was living there at the time. So it was certainly a pivotal point in my thinking, part of that process that brought us back here. Ron [Short, Joan&#8217;s husband] got sick and he was working with Helen Lewis on health clinics. Ron is also a Vietnam veteran and he had been a medic in the war, and he flew Medevac, so he flew intensive care wounded. You would have to interview him, but I think that he would say that being a medic was his way of not fighting the war, but trying to help, because there were no choices but to go. That was his way of going under his own circumstance and what he chose to do was try to help people who were fighting the war, as opposed to wielding a gun himself. That was the way he was able to work it out.  He and Helen got interested in trying to help small health clinics all over the mountains get funded and get started, so we moved back up here. But he was pretty ill, he had a couple of bad allergic reactions to a medication, so he was pretty ill for about six months and really couldn&#8217;t work very much. I started working for Marilyn, my friend Marilyn Pace Maxwell, for Mountain Empire Older Citizens [Inc.] that she had established. I was doing public relations and community work with her. We established the ID discount program for older people, gave them identification cards. A lot of people didn&#8217;t have picture IDs, and folks wanted identification cards, so we created this program and gave them a little ID with their picture on it that folks would accept as an ID card. Went all over the area doing that. Then Ron started working for her also and was an administrator for the nutrition program, and set up the nutrition sites in the four counties in this area.   But it wasn&#8217;t long until I did that Foxfire unit with oral history in the high schools, and I was just supposed to do one class five days a week at [J.I.] Burton High School in Norton, [Virginia] and I ended up doing five classes a day by the end of the semester. I had also decided by the end of the semester that I was a teacher. That was what I was supposed to do. And that was the answer to my church struggle, too. So I went back, got some retroactive student teaching credit for the work I had done for Marilyn in the classroom, the Foxfire, where they went and interviewed their grandparents or elderly neighbors sort of what we are doing here [laughter] on a much simpler level. I managed to get my certification by-because I had not taken education courses in college-I managed to get my certification by that next fall. There was an opening at Powell Valley and I got a job, and that is where I stayed the next thirty two years.  Again, I always felt that I wasn&#8217;t what I think you called &#8220;the heavyweights&#8221; before. I knew I wasn&#8217;t that, that I didn&#8217;t have those kinds of gifts to do organizing. I couldn&#8217;t do union organizing. My family had been in unions but that wasn&#8217;t my experience or my background. In all my questioning and trying to look for what gifts I had, if any, I realized that I kept having success as a kind of one-on-one person. The public school system was pretty much a wasteland, still can be in many ways. I remember attacking it like crazy when I was in my dropout years at Epworth, but there were some very wise older women who came to Laurel Church, and it was still a church when I was there. We had Sunday morning services together. It had been their little church. They were so flexible and so open to those of us who thought we were open, but the truth is, we were the inflexible ones, because we had our hard line.  This one, I said something about schoolteachers, or maybe I wrote a song that had a verse in it about teachers, I honestly can&#8217;t remember, I just remember how she brought me up short. She said, &#8220;I spent my life in the classroom and I have impacted more lives than you are going to with your songs.&#8221; And that made a real impression on me, and she was right. Couldn&#8217;t have been righter. Wish I could tell her.   Myles, it was hard for me to tell him that I was going into the public school system. Elliott Wiggington was on Highlander&#8217;s board, he may have been president at that time, and he had found that alternative way, with his Foxfire courses, of dealing with the school system. Although when you visited him there, he still had the same headaches, the bus duty and everything else that schoolteachers have.  But he was able to chart his own course because of his success with those oral histories. I didn&#8217;t have a way or the power to make that happen here, but from the time I walked in, my goal was to use English, which was, of course, my background. You didn&#8217;t have journalism majors when I went to college; everybody was an English major. If you wanted to be a writer, an editor, or public relations, you were an English major because you had to use language to communicate. So there wasn&#8217;t a school of communications or anything, you were just an English major.   My focus after working the fall, I mean the winter, before with the kids at [J.I. Burton [High School] was to find ways to use the English classroom to teach kids about the place they were from and how important it was. I always worked Appalachian studies into my curriculum and I started a little club-well, it ended up being a big club, it had about two hundred and fifty kids in it-called the Apple Butter Gang. I had a lot of street kids, what a lot of people would call street kids, in my Apple Butter Gang, and I was sure they turned a lot of apple cider into hard cider when we were pressing apples out there, but we had a great time. They finally allowed me to have a class of Appalachian studies, and it was the first one in this area, I guess. We just made it an extension of English, called it Appalachian Literature and Language. So I guess you can get around anything.   It was hard to tell Myles that I was going to go into the public school system. He said, &#8220;Why? It is so corrupt.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Because that is where the children are, and I don&#8217;t know how else to get to them.&#8221; I really think that that was the most radical decision I ever made, was to go into the public school system, because you do have that chance every day, and I guess if people had really known what my agenda was, that I would not have gotten the job. I managed to get along fairly well with my students and their parents, and in six weeks, I had more contacts in this community than I would have had as a community organizer. And I understood family relationships, understood who was and who wasn&#8217;t going to agree with political situations, what their attitudes towards race and social change were. I was working with those kids who could still be influenced. I felt my job all along was the same thing that I wanted, that Highlander&#8217;s job was for me, which was to try to keep better questions in front of them all the time, and not let them settle for simple answers.   JF: What year did you start working at, is it Powell, P-o-w-e-l-l?  JBS: Mm hmm I know it sounds like P-a-l when I say it.  JF: I got it right!  JBS: Powell, &#8217;78.  JF: Can you tell me a little bit about some of the issues of gender and race that you saw people dealing with, or that you may have personally come up with, as a teacher and as a member of the community?  JBS: Certainly in terms of literature, I purposefully looked for stories that had women as the heroines of the stories. Teaching eleventh grade meant that I was teaching American lit, which meant that I was teaching American history, so I always tried to get extra information and keep women in front of my kids. I led classroom discussions in that direction when I could. I used women writers, women poets, a lot, but certainly also used other minority voices, Native American and Hispanic and certainly African American, when I chose. In Virginia, we have these standards of learning that put before us the goal of mediocrity, as far as I am concerned. It wants everybody to be alike and look alike and know the same set of facts. Learning isn&#8217;t about facts, it is about thinking about those facts. In history there are certain things you have to cover and you just have to get them covered, although I have known some incredibly creative history teachers who teach history as a story and they start their class, one particular friend of mine starts his class by saying, &#8220;I am going to tell you a story, and we are going to work on this story together.&#8221; And that is how he starts his American history class. I try to start my literature classes with basically the same idea.   Then of course there are specific things that come up because a classroom becomes a family. Now on block scheduling, less so, because you don&#8217;t have your kids as long, but for the first eighteen years I had my kids all year, and we got to know each other and a lot of issues came up. Especially in high school, male-female relationships. I did a lot of talking to a lot of young women. Some heard me. Some didn&#8217;t, I am sure. I didn&#8217;t have all the answers for them, but again, I tried to listen to what they had to say. I tried to make myself available. If someone was gay, that was an issue, you didn&#8217;t even discuss it, you still don&#8217;t at Powell Valley High School.  I mean, you might be able to go to a guidance counselor and say, &#8220;I am gay,&#8221; and the best advice you would get is, &#8220;Well, you should probably keep that to yourself.&#8221;  And so I tried to make myself available and trustworthy as a person that could be talked to.   I didn&#8217;t want to be a guidance counselor because kids have to get up the courage to go in to a guidance [counselor&#8217;s office], to somebody they don&#8217;t know. I was someone they dealt with every day, so they had a sense of who I was and what my values were, and whether they could talk to me or not. Some did, and some didn&#8217;t, there are some kids who will relate to me and not relate to the next teacher, and vice versa. But I did try to let it be known that I was open to all sorts and conditions of people, as we say in our prayer in the Episcopal  Church. So I did have kids come to me to talk about being gay, or to talk about race, and that [pause]--. I am not sure I made a difference, but I at least tried to be a person beyond the family, an older person that they could trust, and I have never regretted that. I have always been a kind of fierce defender of the underdog and I have gotten myself in trouble a lot doing that, but I do it anyway. I think kids knew that I would take their part, or that they could just come hide for a little while if they needed to step out of the craziness of high school hallway for a while, I&#8217;d hide them for a little while.   I guess it ended up being a sort of combination for me of the church work I at one time hoped I could do and social change. I also had students of various faiths and I always tried to, I certainly was not a proselytizer for Christianity. On the other hand, if people asked me specific questions about God or not feeling there was a God, or did I believe there was a God, I would always say, &#8220;This has been my journey and this is the best path for me that I have found,&#8221; but the older I get, the more universal I get, and I think that has been true of me from the first point on. I am a lay minister at the church where I go, and in some ways that gets harder and harder, because I do have such broad feelings. But Episcopalians aren&#8217;t known for teaching doctrine anyway [laughter]. So, as one guy said, &#8220;I love the Episcopal Church. You can believe anything being Episcopalian [laughter].&#8221; Maybe in some ways that is true. My husband was raised as a regular Baptist and it is our church family, we call it our faith family or our church family, and there is nothing required of us in terms of doctrine. Because of the way my husband was raised, he chooses not to be baptized-he may or may not change his mind about that-but he chooses not to be baptized. He described himself to our bishop as an &#8220;un-baptized Christian.&#8221; But again I think both of us are still seekers and will be forever.   For me, working in a single community, getting to know the families as well as I possibly could in that community and in that school, was the field where I labored. I couldn&#8217;t have gone to North Carolina and organized a union. I couldn&#8217;t have led a strike. Although I came close with teachers a few times [laughter]. Those are not my gifts. But I do feel that the one-on-one relationships that you have with your kids in school has been where I was led. Certainly, in the beginning, I used a lot of music with that. I don&#8217;t do that so much now because school took me away from that and Ron is a professional musician, so there is a lot of music in the house. I miss it sometimes. I haven&#8217;t written much in the way of songs, but I have found other ways to write that I enjoy.   I had a little blessing that I said over my kids every Friday. Of course I didn&#8217;t call it a prayer or a blessing; they called it &#8220;The Friday,&#8221; and they said, &#8220;You haven&#8217;t said The Friday yet.&#8221; It was very simple. I started saying it right after one of our students was killed in a car crash. There is nothing that affects you like the death of a young person, and certainly a sudden death like that. And everybody was feeling so vulnerable, so I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Friday,&#8221; and obviously the weekend was coming and they had found some comfort in being with each other all week. I said, &#8220;It is Friday. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Please remember that the world is a sudden place,&#8221;-which is a line from Carson McCullers&#8217; novel-&#8220;Take care of yourselves, take care of each other, take care of your hearts,&#8221;-because they were always in some kind of relationship that was driving them crazy-&#8220;make good decisions, and come back safely to us on Monday, because you are loved in this place.&#8221; OK, I said that to every class on Friday for years.   When the first class went off to college that I had said that to, they said, &#8220;Who is going to say The Friday to us?&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Well if you want to hear The Friday, you send me your email when you get to college and I will send it to you. I will put a group mail together.&#8221; So I started writing my former students and I ended it with The Friday. I would just send an email that would say what had happened at school that week, or what was going on in Big Stone, or something funny that I had run into, and then I would put The Friday at the bottom. I guess I did that for about ten years. And then they were graduating and getting married and having children and I was still sending the Friday out to them. So I said the last Friday the night I retired, it was a Friday night, and I said it over the graduating class, and I stopped writing those. I just felt like I needed to move on to some other things, and I am sure they were getting tired of getting those all the time. Anyway, I might go back to some sort of message, I still get requests over the years.
I guess that is the kind of work that I have tried to do. Always Highlander was in my heart, and I tried to make my classroom a place where kids could educate themselves and learn to have confidence in the fact that they didn&#8217;t have to have a teacher. I failed miserably at that on many, many days, but I tried to keep that focus in front of me. Highlander and the church, my long experience with the church, created what social change and social justice I was able to impart to kids. I tried every day to get them to look at justice and that they lived in a community. The school was a community and the classroom was a community, and they were not by themselves, and it was not about them. It was about their part in a community. That is the way that I looked at what democracy was.
JF: When you began teaching, did you find any unexpected allies, maybe among your colleagues or coming out of the community, that were not &#8220;movement people,&#8221; but helped you in your long journey? Or helped you to make that classroom space the way you wanted it?
JBS: When I said the school was a community, I really meant that. I am an abstract, random, person in a concrete, sequential world. And most of my colleagues were concrete sequential, but great friendships were forged and all of that. I was, I am sure, the most left-wing person in the school and I was known as that person, and I think it was in some ways a comfort to people knowing that I had that voice covered and that I would always have probably a different view of things. Most of my colleagues were moderate. As one said, a &#8220;raging moderate,&#8221; that&#8217;s how he described himself. He&#8217;s the wonderful American history teacher that teaches it as a story and he uses culture and blues singers, uses music all the way through his American history course to illustrate different periods in American history.
Many of my best friends on the faculty were people who were total opposites, so it taught me a lot about tolerance and patience. I was always preaching to other people about tolerance, but the truth is I also had to learn a lot of tolerance. Most of my students&#8217; families were probably much more conservative. I did not have any run-ins over anything I said in the classroom. It was not until two years before I retired that I had a parent conference where a parent was upset with me over the way I treated her child, so I was very lucky not to have those kinds of issues. I think I did reach out to a lot of kids that other teachers were nervous about, the same way my family was nervous in the Jim Crow south; not racist, but nervous.   I think I did manage to reach out and have some impact that way, and I think that there are lots of other faculty members, and I would go so far as to say every single one, who have the same impact. I am not saying I was the only one that did that. I was probably the only one with a social justice agenda. But they made impacts in their own ways with kids that I probably made nervous. They were nervous around me and more comfortable with someone else, and that is the nice thing about a school is that it is a community, you can usually find some corner, a niche, a place where you are comfortable. I think that that is what teaching is about, really, and only a couple of exceptions would come to my mind when I think about my colleagues over the years, because I learned so much about what it took to get through a day in a high school classroom. I am convinced that the people who were there cared deeply about their children, about the kids that were put in there. Cared, and really wanted to be the best teacher they could be for those kids.   When you are a young teacher, you always get into that friend, buddy business, and that can be a problem where you can be a friend but you can&#8217;t be a buddy to your students. You get into some dangerous territory there. Those are all things everybody has to learn. Then I reached a point where I was the old fart on the faculty.  I think when you work as a community and as a family, there are a lot of times when it is totally dysfunctional and a lot of times when it is not. People sort of knew what to expect from me if there was a certain issue being raised at school, they would know what my position would be, but that was OK, we got all the positions out there.  I have very little patience with institutions, so the hardest thing for me was dealing with the institution of education. Classroom is wonderful; same with the church. I have a hard time dealing with the institution of the church.  JF: Do you think there are specific difficulties that women face when working with an institution like the school?  JBS: Oh sure. Particularly, it is brought up all the time and schools are always doing these special workshops and projects about women&#8217;s roles in the school. But women are very rarely asked to--. You know, if the principals have to be gone, I&#8217;d had the most experience of a lot of people there but I was never asked to sit in for a vice-principal for a day or whatever. Some of that is education, they want you to have an administrative master&#8217;s or be working on one or something. But there was a time before that when it was the coach who helped run the school for the day. You have all of those traditional things. I coached tennis for five years, girls tennis. We had to beg or have bake sales to buy new T-shirts. They wanted them to wear old shirts that have been worn by other tennis players that were sweat-stained, and yet the football players got underwear. I mean, they got everything, because it brought in the money. So it is just a microcosm of society, the way the school system works. And we, unfortunately, have an incredibly dysfunctional school system in Wise County right now because the school board is completely dysfunctional. They&#8217;ve been dealing with the question of consolidation for ten years and they still don&#8217;t have an answer or a better question. So it is very disheartening to see how little we have learned, and yet it is the same people who tend to be in the middle of things. There are only two women on the school board; one just resigned. So it is still hard to get those women&#8217;s voices out there. There is a woman who is now principal at Powell Valley, she and I are polar opposites in terms of the way we perceive the world around us. She has worked so hard as an assistant principal and really basically did the principal&#8217;s job for years, and that was not recognized. If there is consolidation, I wonder what will happen to her.   A history teacher and a coach can go down into Middlesboro [Kentucky] and get a master&#8217;s in administration and come back and get a job the next year. If you&#8217;re a coach, your job is not in jeopardy. It&#8217;s what they call &#8220;essential personnel.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re not a coach, your job is in jeopardy, because if they had to do a reduction in force, a RIF they call it, those coaches are going to be protected, and it is the community that demands that. But women coaches are not necessarily protected and they are often not treated well in the PE system. So you can have a history teacher that has been there twenty years that can be transferred if what they really needed was a history teacher who is also a coach. Obviously, most of the coaches are men, certainly not all of them, but most of them are, and the &#8220;good old boy&#8221; network is alive and well.  JF: Have you seen any, since &#8216;78 when you have been teaching, have you seen a difference in the way women&#8217;s athletics is perceived by the community, dealt with by the school board--.  JBS: Truthfully, very little.  JF: Among the students?  JBS: Very little. You have your parents who come out and really support their daughters, their nieces, their grandchildren in the women&#8217;s athletic program, but you are not going to get the same kind of crowd to a girls&#8217; basketball game, a girls&#8217; volleyball game. It was only five, six, maybe a little longer than that now, close to ten years that girls and boys play basketball on the same night --. [Recorder is turned off, then back on] It is just the way it is. Even if they try not to, that is the way it is.   JF: What about scholarships, does that come into play? The chance for a low-income student to get to go to college if they get an athletic scholarship, does this get played more to the boys than the girls?  JBS: You&#8217;d have to ask the guidance counselor for statistics here, but I can think of almost as many girls who have had scholarship opportunities-now I am not talking about athletics, but I am talking about academics-as boys here. We have had some excellent students, both genders, who have gone to UVA, or--. We&#8217;re very lucky in Virginia to have such wonderful state schools, I mean UVA is one of the top universities in the country and it is in-school tuition for kids in Virginia, and that is just amazing. But you still have to meet the guidelines. I taught two guys, actually I taught the whole family, the Jones family, they were outstanding athletes and there were two boys in their family. There were seven in all and I taught all seven kids. Thomas Jones is running back, and has been, well he set the record at UVA, but he broke Tiki Barber&#8217;s record there. He has been playing for ten years now in the major leagues, he played for the Jets most recently, but this year he&#8217;s going, let&#8217;s see, where is Thomas going, I want to say Kansas City, he may be going to Kansas City. He has been very successful and his brother Julius has been maybe not quite as successful, but they have both been in the major leagues and made a lot of money doing that. Thomas created a scholarship for kids from southwest Virginia who can make the UVA grade, who can be accepted to UVA, and he gives them I think it is two thousand dollars a year while they are there to help, gives it directly to them, not for tuition, because it costs so much to just live. So he has been very generous with kids from there. You want to just stop a second and I will bring--. [Recorder is turned off, then back on].   JF: So I wanted to ask you the broad, general question, how have your ideas about feminism changed over time?  JBS: I guess during that earlier period of the [19]60s and [19]70s and early [19]80s, I had a lot of hope that there would be more change than there has been. I think there has been change, obviously women are able to work in jobs--. I don&#8217;t believe pay is always equal. I think many women are, even when they have these sort of equal jobs, they are expected to act like women. If a woman says something and man says something, it can be taken very well from the man and people are really offended if a woman says the same thing, even if they are in equal positions. I have a friend who is in college administration and she fights this battle a lot. I think she is a very strong woman, very bright woman, she is very good at what she does. It is almost like she is not, she is still expected to function as what most of the men around her would expect from her. Does that make any sense? As opposed to, if she says something and then two other men who are in similar positions would offer an opinion, people either think she is being strident or too strong, or--. There is this constant balance, it seems to me, that women look for. I think that certainly women&#8217;s roles as schoolteachers, that women are mostly patronized, that women give many, many, many more hours to their job without pay, than men do. I think men step up and say, &#8220;If you want me to do that, you are going to have to pay me,&#8221; and it is not heard the same from women. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be in teaching if you don&#8217;t want to--.&#8221;   I am trying to think of an example of that. Oh, I was assigned to be a cheerleader sponsor. Not my favorite thing to deal with. But I was assigned to be a cheerleader sponsor and I didn&#8217;t get paid for that, and yet I had to be at practice every day after school, every day. I had to arrange transportation for all the away games, and I had to go to all the away games and all the home games. I did not get a, quote, &#8220;coaching supplement&#8221; for that at all. Yet a colleague of mine, who just loved to come to the games, was getting fifteen dollars a game, just to watch the door, not take up money, but just to make sure nobody came in a door. They would say things like, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t ask him to give his time to do that,&#8221; and yet I received no pay. People, when you are interested in the arts, it is especially hard in school. Coaches are paid for their time, but choir directors are not paid for extra time, band leaders who are mostly men, are paid usually an extra month&#8217;s salary; they have a ten-month contract or an eleven-month contract. But a choir director is not. If you do a musical and you are there for rehearsals night after night after night, you are not paid.   It was only very recently that forensics coaches, which are mostly women, would coach forensics teams without being paid. Forensics is a VHSL, Virginia State High School League activity, it is in the handbook with football, basketball, everything else, with all the rules, and yet you were expected to coach a team, go to district, if you won there, go to regionals, if you won there, to go to state, which is eight hours from here, in Richmond.  I didn&#8217;t do it very long, but I have friends who did it for several years with no extra pay in addition to their teacher salary. If you complain, then they say you are not really dedicated to teaching, but they would never say that to a man, ever. It is just the way it is.   So those same battles are still being fought over and over again. I know that it differs from job to job, institution to institution, but I think that we have not, as a matter of fact, I think we are going backwards at a huge rate. I think young women are not being brought up to have a sense of personal dignity about what it means to be a woman. I saw an article this morning that said girls are reaching puberty so much earlier and that puts them at risk for behavior that they are not prepared for, sexual behavior probably, and puts them into that need to please the other gender and the expectation from the boys is pretty high. This may sound silly to you, because I truly believe in freedom of speech, but I got upset-you are not supposed to wear shirts to school that have beer bottles or alcohol-related ads on them, Budweiser shirts or that sort of thing, and there are some people who spend their whole day just trying to read kids&#8217; shirts to see if the message is appropriate-but I would not allow Hooters shirts in my room, because I didn&#8217;t feel that it was respectful to women, and especially at high school level and all that. Of course the girls wanted to wear them as well as the boys did. I just said, the way I read, it says that you are not supposed to wear shirts that refer to gender, exploit gender, and they said, &#8220;Well that is the name of a restaurant,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, right.&#8221; It was unbelievable how many men I had to fight that battle with. &#8220;Now tell me again what is wrong with Hooters shirts?&#8221; I said, if people were wearing &#8220;Big Dick&#8221; shirts, you would be so offended. It&#8217;s this idea to get women to look at themselves in a different light from just the way they look, or their physical appearance, and that is hard enough when you are a teenager and you have got all the peer pressure. So people just thought I was really pretty foolish about that, and that I shouldn&#8217;t have pressed that. They said, &#8220;Oh, Miss Free Speech,&#8221; and I said it&#8217;s a totally different way of interpreting what the dress policy is, the dress code policy. I don&#8217;t even like dress codes, but we do have policy, and I could care less if somebody wears a Hooters shirt wherever they want to wear it. I don&#8217;t like it particularly. But those kinds of things&#8230; there used to be a lot of attention paid to the exploitation of women that I got used to in the 60s and 70s. There is just no attention being paid to that, that I can tell, right now. When you look at television, we are sort of right back to where we were. I guess the thing that I worry about is that there is not anything to balance that. There are not women&#8217;s courses in school that both men and women can take, girls and boys. I think probably traditional roles are still encouraged. There is a woman who teaches family life science, and she used to do a fashion show. Now she says that she is not comfortable because she-and she is very fundamental in her faith-she said she found out from someone, a good source, that one of her girls was gay, and she didn&#8217;t feel that she could ask them to all change clothes in the same room together.  JF: Oh my.   JBS: Now that was this year that she said that to me. So that perspective on what it means to be gay and female, is just decades old. I was just so shocked, I just stood there with my mouth open. She said, &#8220;So we just had to cancel the fashion show, because I couldn&#8217;t have those girls,&#8221;--. And I finally said, &#8220;What do you think has been going on in locker rooms and do you really believe there has never been a gay football player at Powell Valley High School?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well, not that I know of.&#8221;   JF: Exactly.  JBS: So it is just a real long way from where we need to be. Sometimes political correctness gets in our way of just saying what we need to say. But I do think that we haven&#8217;t made the inroads that we need to make, and I think that for some women, the idea of being a successful woman is to emulate what it means to be a successful man in a particular job.   JF: What do you think, living and working in southern Appalachia in the [19]70s and [19]80s, was the impact of women&#8217;s efforts around issues of gender equality and their efforts to bring issues of gay and non-traditional female roles to the front?  JBS: I think gay is still almost an impossibility to talk about publicly. I have had many gay students, obviously, and I have talked to many of them after high school, and they felt more comfortable about discussing it. I have former gay students, both male and female, who would find it incredibly difficult to come back here and be out of the closet. I do have one or two that is not true of, but there are so many more. I have a friend whose sister I also taught, brilliant gal, is gay, and she and her partner have had a child together and I think they are about to have another one, actually, using donated sperm. It is always an issue in that family because they are very fundamental in their religious faith.   I think that southern Appalachia is a place that can be incredibly provincial in attitudes toward gender and women, and that a lot of women themselves play into that. But also there aren&#8217;t the kinds of job opportunities here. Men and women work either at hourly wage jobs and therefore learn to work together. I don&#8217;t know what they would say about that, like if you interviewed Hardee&#8217;s people. I do think just having the issue more at the forefront in the 70s and 80s did make some impact in the communities, and certainly there is a lot of workforce training that comes out of the colleges that would be gender-sensitive training, supposedly.   But how you really do affect people in their own personal lives and the community in general, it probably had very little impact because the culture is the culture. Of course, it is also a culture where extended families are still very important, and grandmothers are carefully listened to and appreciated. So when grandma speaks, there are a lot of people listening to that, but I&#8217;m not sure what grandma is going to say about--. Most people have a very stereotypical idea of what it means to be a feminist or be concerned about women&#8217;s issues, and I think most people--. I just was in education, so that was the community I saw. I wasn&#8217;t out in the large community. You do hear talk about it there just because of the inequality of what is expected from women and what is expected from men in that workforce. But I am not very encouraged by what I see in the world, but I am not very encouraged by [laughter] what I see in the world on a lot of fronts. I taught long enough to teach the children of my children. I had grand-students, and their attitudes were so different from their parents&#8217; attitudes, and I am amazed. They are so much more conservative, in all ways, than their parents were.   JF: That is somewhat surprising. Usually you think of each generation getting a little more progressive. Leaving behind--.  JBS: Yeah, but in a place like this that doesn&#8217;t happen very much if they stay here. Now, kids who go to other places are absolutely, it is such a shock when they find out what the world looks like, and it is not all white and conservative Protestant. Even going away to college changes a lot of people&#8217;s ideas about that. I know that we had a bad situation at school one time where we had a young African American student, I guess he was sixteen, who had been raised in an urban environment. He was not used to living in a small town. This racism, I don&#8217;t care what anybody says, it is still a major problem, it is just beneath the surface. We don&#8217;t have obvious issues with it and the kids have grown up together, spent the night with each other, been friends, but I have had many former black students tell me that it was always just beneath the surface and they were always nervous.   But we had a fight in the hallway because there was a kid--they weren&#8217;t supposed to wear rebel flags to school--but this kid had on a jacket that was made out of a rebel flag. I am still not sure what he said to this young, black urban student, but he certainly said something, and the student just turned around and hit him so hard that it sent him through the glass of the art room, a display case. It was up the hall from my room, so I ran up there, and one thing I found is that I will not interrupt two women who are fighting, because they will kill you. But two guys? If a woman, especially an older woman, steps in between them, they will hesitate in most cases, no matter how angry they are. So I was headed down the hall and I was trying to get the kids to-this was several years ago-I was trying to get the kids away and to go back. I turned around and looked down the hall toward my room, two men had already separated the fighters. I just said, &#8220;Look at you.&#8221; I just couldn&#8217;t, I said, &#8220;I want you to look.&#8221; The white students had lined up on this side of the hall and the black students had lined up on that side of the hall, just like that. Just because of that one punch. And you could have said there were no problems with racism at our school and two guys running their mouths, but there it was. Grown up together, spent the night with each other, played ball with each other from the word go, and that is all it took to separate them.  So it is discouraging, especially after growing up the way I did in the Jim Crow South, it is really--. So I just think that we are still a long way from where we want to be in terms of gender equality and also equality of races. Of course, the new immigration standoffs I think can only lead to violence. It is still an issue that America hasn&#8217;t worked out yet, from the time they took that clause out of the Declaration of Independence so the South wouldn&#8217;t fight with them, we haven&#8217;t gotten very far. Of course there are a lot of mixed signals about what was going on then, too.   So I do feel discouraged. Even though the window dressing looks good, or the superficial things look good, there is still not a total integration of our society. But there are many more mixed-race children than there were, and that will have an impact eventually, too. Does that ramble answer, come anywhere close to answering your--.  JF: Yes, absolutely. Well then, one last question for you. Do you have any, is there anything you thought I would ask that I didn&#8217;t? Or do you have anything you would like to add that didn&#8217;t come up?  JBS: Well, when you are doing life review and I will think of a hundred things that--. Because every time you think back at the touchstones, the stepping stones, you often see them in a different order, or you see what led to this as a different thing. My stepping stones line up differently all the time. We didn&#8217;t talk a lot about the war, I mean we talked about civil rights and gender, but the war had a great impact on us, and the fact that people really were willing-and still are, obviously-to kill a generation of young people and not to take responsibility for lives that are ruined when they come home. I mean, the situation with the medical care for returning veterans is just awful. And war impacts the generation that fights it. If you look at all that has been written now about World War Two, we see it through a little bit more of a zoom-out lens than we did for the past two or three decades. I think we are going to look at Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan, Desert Storm, in those same kinds of ways. Vietnam was my war. That was the war that took my friends, and if it didn&#8217;t kill them, changed them. Changed their lives.   I did have an experience that I have come to see as a kind of gender-related experience. This was 1968 that I went canoeing on a river with some friends, and other people left and I was waiting on a couple of people to come back with a canoe, and we didn&#8217;t really know where we were. But I met a family there and the man was being abusive to his three-year-old daughter, and I am sure it was clear on my face that I didn&#8217;t approve. She had hit him, and he had hit her, and then she had hit him. But he was hitting her until she had red splotches all over, and he had been drinking, and I could tell the mother was really upset. We were in a very remote picnic area. It was getting dark and the man offered to go up and let me look down and see if I could see my compatriots, and if I didn&#8217;t I was going to go back into - I was up near Cookville, Tennessee.   Anyway, without the gory details, he ended up beating me up and raping me, and I was twenty one at the time. But the thing that has ended up about that experience is that I had never had a violent experience before, never been in a violent situation. My parents were very gentle people. Most of the people I knew were gentle people, so I had never come up against violence in that way.  But what he kept saying-and he was almost in a trance-what he kept saying over and over again is that &#8220;I have killed women and children in Vietnam and I can crack your neck with one hand.&#8221; He just kept saying that over and over about Vietnam. He was a Vietnam vet. Later I commented to someone, they said, &#8220;Who raped you?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;The war.&#8221; Because I really came to see it that way. I didn&#8217;t prosecute because of my father&#8217;s health. I actually ended up knowing who he was because his wife had given me his business card, because she liked my dog, and she had no idea. I think she must have sensed that something happened, because I took him back and I was all beaten up, and I just let him out of the car and drove off. He had no idea that I had his business card in my pocket. I just could not do that to my parents. They would have never gotten a night&#8217;s rest about me. It was hard enough for them for me to be on my own. But that is what has haunted me about that period of time.   So I am very sensitive about violence towards women, sexual violence, but I am also sensitive about what wars do to people. I think if women made those decisions, as they do in some Native American cultures-in the Cherokee culture, it is the women who tell the men whether to go to war or not-I don&#8217;t think women would kill each other&#8217;s children quite so hastily. I just think that it is a sad situation that our world, and that our particular society in America, does not have as part of the tightest threads of its fabric the wisdom of women. That they don&#8217;t take it seriously. That&#8217;s why, and I think I said to you in an email that I get so frustrated reading history or reading the Bible, because I am just so aware of the voice that is missing. With the historical re-enacting, I am so aware of what we don&#8217;t know because women have not been allowed to speak and they have not been allowed to--.   I don&#8217;t know what kind of women he had in his life. I don&#8217;t know anything about him. My brother sort of stepped in, and he never met with him personally, but a couple of lawyers put pressure on him, met with him, and hopefully another woman wasn&#8217;t, that is the only thing about not reporting it is that hopefully another woman wasn&#8217;t hurt. I managed to talk him out of killing me. I mean he really was determined that that was his only choice, because he couldn&#8217;t let his wife know. He would have to say that I fell or whatever, he was going to push me off this mountain. But I managed somehow-and it was my bridge person again, my one-on-one person-to tell him it was okay and to talk him out of killing me. My dog, I had a huge German Shepherd, and that dog settled down. When the man first grabbed me, the dog, I thought he was going to come through the window of the car. But the man said, &#8220;If that dog makes a move I will shoot you and the dog.&#8221; He had a gun with him that I didn&#8217;t know he had. Somehow Israel, my dog, knew, and he just got down in the back seat, didn&#8217;t make a sound, and he had literally been tearing at the doors. So I don&#8217;t tell you that to sensationalize or anything, but I tell you that because it was a pivotal event for me, obviously, for me personally, but also when I think about women at that time period and I think about the war and what war does-of course there are lots of women that are now fighting in combat but also have these special issues that they have to deal with as well, the women in the military-and I hear that man&#8217;s voice, and I just think that that has become a symbol to me of what that time--. I mean a lot of good things came out of that time period, but I think we haven&#8217;t really truly evaluated what impact the war had on men&#8217;s attitudes towards women. That has always been true with war, women have always been victims of abuse. But at a time when there seemed to be so much movement--.   I think actually he saw me as a challenge. I think I was out there by myself with a big German Shepherd, I didn&#8217;t seem to be afraid. He and his wife obviously had a very different kind of relationship than that. I think I offended him, just sort of the idea that maybe I was in his world and he knew I didn&#8217;t approve of the way he was treating his daughter. I met some other returning vets that had really serious issues with sexual relationships when they returned and would talk a lot about that. And I would talk to them about what had happened, too. I do think that we haven&#8217;t reached a point where we have fully looked at how the war, Vietnam particularly, in conjunction with the movements at home, tipped a lot of attitudes in society about women.   JF: I like the way you put that, &#8220;tipped a lot of attitudes,&#8221; because it does--.  JBS: Well it was all--. People tend to take that period of time and look at the Native American movement or the Black Panthers or the women&#8217;s movement, general women&#8217;s movement. Now when I worked at UT they had a &#8220;women&#8217;s day&#8221; and they just thought they were doing this wonderful thing, and all the women employees got to come out and they fed them lunch and it was their recognition, but you know, the hourly workers couldn&#8217;t leave their desk. They weren&#8217;t allowed to come out. I was an editor, so I got to go out, and deans, and women who were in higher position with education. They were so proud of themselves for doing that. And I said, &#8220;Well, when the woman who is downstairs feeding the press can come out, then I will pat you on the back, but not before then.&#8221; So people will always set their own boundaries and say, &#8220;I can go this far, but I can&#8217;t go any further,&#8221; and those boundaries end up being what defines the particular movement. But it was not &#8220;this movement&#8221; &#8220;that movement,&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t civil rights and labor, it was all of those things together. I do think for one period of time, at least part of American society stopped and looked at the fabric that really was America. And then we have gone off raveling our own threads again. But there was that sense that there was a new world and there was hope for a new world, and I am really glad I got to be part of that sense of hope. I am not nearly as hopeful as I was, but I could not be happier that I came up at the time that I did and that I had the associations that I did, especially with Highlander, and had those encounters with people from all over the world. If everyone had those privileges, the world would be a different place, because you can&#8217;t have those experiences and not be impacted by them. So I was probably not a heavyweight, but I was sort of like Myles. He never lost his focus on nonviolent civil disobedience, and I tried not to lose that focus either, in my life and in my career. So probably that Highlander experience, and understanding what that idea was about had more influence on me than anything. And the Christ story, to me, seemed to fit into that. So that&#8217;s that.  JF: Thank you so much for sharing your time and your stories with me today.  JBS: As I said, I will think of a thousand more.  JF: We can do another talk. I would be happy to come up.  JBS: No, I am sure that you have lots more than you will ever need. It was a lot of fun to do that. What is your schedule? Do you--. Oh, I am sorry. [Recorder is turned off].
