MEG FOSTER: Okay so this is Meg Foster with the UNC Moxie project. I’m
interviewing Mary Braxton Joseph on Tuesday July 22“”1 in her house in Chapel Hill. So can you
start just by telling me a little bit about when you were born and where you grew up?

MARY JOSEPH: Okay. I was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, and should I give you the
date or not? No. I was born in 1950, March 4th, 1950 which used to be the day that our presidents
were inaugurated, but they changed it, I think maybe around FDR’s time, to January 20“. So just
a little piece of history. I wasn’t around when they changed the date. But I grew up in Plainfield,
New Jersey. It was a town of about 60 to 70,000 people, one high school. I lived there all my
life, and when I graduated from high school, I moved to Washington, DC. I attended American
University, and along the way I got involved in media, starting with my hometown newspaper. I
worked there for two summers, and then while I was in college, I competed for and landed a paid
intemship with a radio station. And that led me to a paid internship with the TV station once I
graduated from college. So I’m very grateful to that ﬁrst experience I had with my hometown
newspaper, which was a Gannett newspaper. It used to be the Plainﬁeld Courier-News. Now it’s
the Courier-News, and they have a much wider circulation, all over central Jersey.

MF: So did you write for it?

MJ: Yes, they started me on what they called the morgue, which is kind of gallows
humor. But the morgue was the library, and my job was to clip items on prominent people and
file them. There weren’t any computers in those days. This would’ve been in 1968. And I got the
job because I could type. I tell people “Learn to type.” Because they didn’t have computers or
anything, you had to have actual paper files on people. So the idea was if something happened to
that person, if they passed, if they were promoted, if they moved on to something bigger and
better, you would have all of the available information at your ﬁngertips. So they called it the
morgue, but it was actually the newspaper library.

MF: Cool. What did your parents do? Were there any media people in the family?

MJ: Oh my gosh. I’m from a blue collar family and proud of it. My dad was a mailman,
and my mom was a homemaker and then he died, tragically. He had a cerebral hemorrhage at the
age of thirty-siX, really sad chapter in our family history. But these things happen. I was the
eldest of three girls. Iwas seven. My sisters were two and one, still in diapers. So my mother did
everything. She did people’s laundry. She cleaned people’s houses. She worked in a factory. She
eventually became a private duty nurse. But she did everything to support us, and I’m happy to
say all three of us grew up reasonably normal. We all went to college. We all graduated. It’s a
real testimony to my mom. A real tribute.

MF: Wow. That’s great. So what did--, what was your experience after college? What
was your ﬁrst job?

MJ: Well, after college I was very lucky because of that radio internship I won while I
was in college. That led me to this gentleman, one of the people who interviewed me I guess

thought I had some potential. I was taking communications courses, and he told me when the

radio intemship was up to give him a call. He would see what he could do about getting me into
television internship, and that’s exactly what happened. So two months after I graduated from
college I started at the ABC affiliate in Washington, DC. It was then WMAL. Now it’s WJLA.
They changed call letters while I was there, back in the [19]70s.

MF: So what did you do for them? Were you an anchor or--?

M]: Eventually, not quite an anchor. I became the editorial director. But the idea was,
they called it a management training program. And it came about because the station was sued
because they were domiciled in a city that was predominantly black, and they had 200
employees, only two of whom were black and one was as janitor. So there was one professional
person. So this was late [19]6OS now. So African Americans got together and sued my station,
and women two years later sued the NBC station. So by the time I show up in 1972 it’s like,
“Come right on in. You’re a two-fer. A black woman, yay.”

So the idea was it was a management training program. And the idea was to expose
interns to several different departments. So I got to work in three or four different departments
before I was actually hired full-time and permanently. So I started at the bottom basically and
worked my way up. Now eventually I got into station management, and I had my own budget. I
did editorials on the air, and I did community relations or our version of corporate philanthropy
off the air. But it was a really great job. I would be there until this day, but circumstances
changed and industry changed a great deal. So I had to move on. But I was there for fourteen
great years and I still have a lot of great friends. People I’m still great friends with who worked

with me around that time, and we try to keep in touch.

It was a time of change. This would’ve been [19]72. One of the first things I did, after I
worked in several different departments, I was hired to be the number two person in the editorial
department. And one of the first issues I researched was whether or not to call for the resignation
of then President Richard Nixon. Pretty heavy stuff for somebody who’s twenty-four. I’m like
“Woo hoo! I have died and gone to heaven.” It was a time of change and growth in this country.
People were objecting to a lot of things and holding their institutions and their officials
accountable. So it was an exciting time.

MF: Cool. So you came in after there were lawsuits. What was the work environment
like for you as a woman?

MJ: Wow, okay. Well, for the most part people were pretty pleasant. I mean this was the
[19]70s. I graduated in [19]72 and in those days we wore bell-bottoms and platform shoes and
Afros. I mean they’re back now, but in those days you wore your hair out to here. So you’re
walking into a professional environment, and they’re not used to seeing people with Afros. I
think it took some adjusting. One thing was very striking to me. Because I worked there for
fourteen years I went through many iterations in terms of clothing styles and hair. And I
remember I started with a really large Afro, and then I cut it down, and then when the
opportunity came for me to do some on the air work, I figured it was probably smarter to
straighten my hair. And I have to tell you the day that I straightened my hair, I went to work and
everyone spoke to me. Everyone. Not that people didn’t speak to me before, but I noticed this
change. And it was all about the hair. Some people were afraid of the hair do.

MF: With it straightened?

MJ: Well, it was straightened. But what I’m saying is I got a totally different reaction
when I straightened it than when I was wearing the Afro. And what that told me was that a lot of
times it’s about cosmetics. Think now about guys that wear the baggy droopy pants, the
oversized shirts, all the jewelry. Think about people who braid their hair. Well, in those days it
was the Afro. So I was astounded. People that I'd been speaking to all along, because I was
always pretty friendly. I mean I was happy to be in television. I didn’t care what I did. I was
happy to be there. It was really because I was learning and I was growing. I just I was amazed at
who spoke to me once I straightened my hair. It was almost like a barrier coming down. So it
seemed like a small thing, and it made sense for me to do it. I did it willing because I was going
to go on the air, and I wanted to look a little bit more traditional. But it was a real learning
experience for me. You just, you never can tell what touches people. It’s like walking in to a
room frowning like walking into a room smiling. I just, people just react differently. So it was a
real lesson.

MF: That’s interesting. So did you keep it straight from then on out?

MJ: Yeah, well on the air, and when you’re if you, if you wear a ‘fro--and I love the
ladies who are doing it now because I think they are beautiful--but you have to maintain it. So
it’s not like you can wash and go. The big one took a lot of maintenance. The shorter one, the
shorter ‘fro not quite as much, but you still have to keep it trimmed. You’ve got to oil, I mean
it’s your hair. So straightening my hair was easier to maintain. I had very soft, very curly kind of
tight hair. And so straightening it was just easier to maintain. It was just more manageable. So it
was easier for me with the schedule I had to keep up. So to this day I go to the beauty parlor once

a week. [Laughs] Hair and nails, I get them done because it’s all about grooming and once you

start down that road--. Once you go on the air, you’re going to be compared to people who make
a whole lot more money than you do. So you really got to look as professional as possible. So a
lesson in life I tell, I had along the way when I was in television, I used to have people come to
me. They’d send their sons or daughters to me for advice and I remember talking to this one
young man who was brilliant, happened to be African American. He had his hair in twists. Very
becoming but I said, “If you want to make it in this business, you’re probably going to have to
change your hair do.” Ifyou’re in the record industry or some other creative artistic endeavor,
probably. Now I think people have a lot more freedom to wear what they want to wear and to
style their hair the way they want to. I love that Melissa Harris Perry has all the braids. At one
point in Washington, DC a lady who wore braids was actually ﬁred from I think it was the
Marriot Hotel. This was back in the [l9]805 because people weren’t used to seeing it, and they
didn’t think--, they were afraid of it. They didn’t think, and so this lady sued and she won. And
so after that I think employers were a lot more willing to let people--. I mean you can’t, it can’t
be all over your head, but if it’s neat, it’s stylish, that’s how, I can imagine Melissa Harris Perry
saves a lot of time in the morning not having to do her hair. She has to do something to it but not
as much as you might. So things change and evolve. It’s about what you get used to. It’s like
having a black president. Forty years ago that would’ve been totally unheard of it, and now it’s
like, “What’s the big deal?” For some people. [Laughing]

MF: For some people. Well, I was about to ask if that standard only applied to women,
but I guess it was the same for men too.

M]: No, it was the same. Well, we used to wear pant suits and we used to have to look

more like the guys, and now I think we have a lot more freedom of expression. I think people are

Braxton-Joseph 10

coloring their hair and wearing ear cuffs now. I mean, I think we have a lot more, we are a lot
more accepting of people and their creative expression. So I think for women, for women in
broadcasting, we’re still trying to break through that glass ceiling. I was really sorry that Diane
Sawyer’s leaving ABC News because that was a real breakthrough. But Barbara Walters just
retired from The View. When she started, I was--, that would’ve been in the mid-[l9]70s. I was
probably, I had probably been working for a couple of years. She was a real beacon of light. But
she caught trouble, you know what, being the first woman to co-anchor. Her anchor didn’t want
her. They thought that she was overpaid. I mean women—-, a woman had never co-anchored a
major news cast. And then she ended up--, it didn’t work out because the chemistry wasn’t there
between her and Harry Reasoner. And that happened to be my network. I work for the ABC
affiliate in Washington DC; so it didn’t work. The duo didn’t work, and so she ended up going
off and doing specials, and her fascinating people thing became a main staple. She got all these
really great interviews like one with Castro and one with--she did several high profile people.
More recently one with Hillary. She did, and so because of her path we now View women
differently in the media, and we now celebrity culture as, where would we be without someone
like Barbara Walters interviewing personalities. I mean we’ve got a whole entertainment channel
now, E TV. So people want to know about fascinating people. And she made it possible and
created The View, the talk show. So Ithink a lot of good has come of it. But she caught hell. In
those early days she caught hell.

MF: So did women like Barbara Walters have an inﬂuence on you going into media and-

-?

MJ: Oh yeah. Yes, well, I was already in by the time she became a news anchor, but I
didn’t realize all that she had gone through. She started as a writer on the Today Show. And then
they let her do--, somebody got sick one day and she started doing little segments, and then they
let her travel a little bit. And she basically built it up. So by the time she was tapped to move to
ABC, people knew her or recogmzed her. But she definitely, she definitely blazed a trail. She
was a source of inspiration. There weren’t that many women. I think in the training program that
I was part of, golly, I think they were really looking for minorities and women, which is why
they were so happy with me. But I think they were probably about fifty-fifty. I think we probably
had maybe four women, two of whom were African American. So they were really trying to
broaden the employee pool, if you will. Because up to then it basically had been white guys,
nothing wrong with that. But you got to share, guys. We got to have different perspectives at the
table.

MF: So after DC, is that when you went to South Africa?

MJ : Yes, and I was in broadcasting for fourteen years. They stopped doing editorials,
which is why I left because I was doing editorials on the air, but they stopped doing it when they
began to expand the newscast. I was not a profit center. You’ll find if you work for a company
and you generate revenue, you’re probably good to go. If you don’t, not so much. So Iwas not
revenue generating. So they basically took away my production time because they wanted to
expand the newscast. You probably, when you watch the news now, you probably notice the
commercials. Well the commercials, if you can produce a show, a new show with little overhead
and sell the commercial time because you know people will want to know what’s going on when

they get home from work, you make a boatload of money. That’s how stations generate revenue.

Braxton-Joseph 12

So when they wanted to expand, we first were going from six to siX-thirty with news. And then
we went from six to seven, and then we went from five-thirty to seven, then five, then four, and
the longer block of time that was relegated for news, the less time those of whom didn’t generate
revenue had for production purposes. So when that happened I could pretty much see the
handwriting on the wall.

So I left. I got an agent. I worked a political campaign. I ended up in business for myself.
I used to do commercials for cable. I did the first commercials for cable TV in Washington, DC.
I did press conferences for folks. In those days there was this one organization, the Criminal
Justice Policy Foundation, they really wanted to reform drug laws in the United States. So every
time Bill Bennett, who was then the drug czar for I guess the first Bush administration--, no for
the Reagan administration. Ibe g your pardon. Every time they’d hold a press conference, he’d
hire me to hold a counter press conference to talk about why Bill Bennett was wrong. So I did
that for a while. And I kept up my community contacts because I really like helping people. I
liked doing that kind of work and it eventually led me to a friend of mine who asked if, knowing
that I was in business for myself and knowing you always have to make--, you have to always be
looking for new clients asked me if I’d ever, if I would ever consider a short-term contract. And
I’m like, “Yes. Absolutely.” So she put me in touch with the Council on Foundations, and I
ended up basically helping them with a media program, and they asked me if I would come on as
a special adviser and make them my only client. And I’m like yes, absolutely. Absolutely. So
broadcasting, I went and worked on a political campaign. After that I did, I worked for actually
two public affairs firms and ended up with my own business and then ended up in philanthropy.

So yes, I tell people--.

MF: ( )

MJ : I would never have scripted it that way, but it was a natural progression. I learned
that, well you learn to economize. You learn who you can rely on. You learn to hire people as
you need them. You don’t have to take long. But a bunch a folks with salaries if you really can
afford it. Know who you can borrow money from. I think I only called my mother once and said,
“Mom can you ﬂoat me a loan?” But it was a great experience, and I tell people just remember
you meet the same people going down that you meet going up. So treat everybody with respect
because you never know where you’re going to end up or who you’re going to be working with.
So if you keep that in mind, you’ll overcome it. I think, it was a great ride.

So I got into philanthropy, which is where I actually met my future husband. And I
worked there for five years and then we started dating very quietly. And he got the nod to go to
be ambassador to South Africa so we literally got married one day; he got sworn in the next day;
and the next week we were on a plane to South Africa. So I couldn’t have scripted it. I mean I
would never have, I would have never guessed in a million years that’s where I would end up.
But at that time Mr. Mandela was president, and it was absolutely a fascinating time to be there,
to see a new democracy with probably the best constitution of any country in the world because
everybody’s included. It was just, it was a thrill of a lifetime.

And I got to do a little work while I was over there, working on two documentaries. And
the first one was a discovery documentary called Apartheid ’s Last Stand and I was working with
a group of people, and basically we were told if we could get an interview with Mr. Mandela,
they would fund the project. So bless my husband’s heart. He knew someone to call to try to

make the arrangement and again because he was a long time anti-Apartheid activist before he

became ambassador and he knew a lot of people who were in South Africa. Anyway he made a
call for me, and I had to wait a little while, but I got the interview with Mr. Mandela, which was
the thrill of a lifetime.

MF: So you personally did that interview? Wow.

MI: I, personally. Now they ended up not using it. It ended up on the cutting room ﬂoor,
but we crossed the first hurdle by getting that interview. And because we got that interview, they
were able to do the rest of the documentary. So I felt like I had fulfllled my mission. I had got
this interview with Mr. Mandela. He was a great. He was everything you heard of and more.
Really, just a wonderful human being who invited his jailers to his inauguration. I mean talk
about transformation, yeah. Yeah. He really stressed when you think of reconciliation and you
think of basic humanity, people’s basic dignity, decency. I mean he was quite an extraordinary
guy. Anyway, so we lived there full-time for, we were only supposed to go for three years, but he
ended up being ambassador for four years because of the election cycle in South Africa. So I had
a four year honeymoon. People say you didn’t have to do any dishes. You didn’t have to clean
the house. I said, “No, but we had a house staff,” but we also did a lot of entertaining. So Iused
to meet with the staff because it was like rumIing a small business. It was like I was back in
Washington, DC rumIing my own business. So yeah, we did. We had so many people to come
from the United States. And everybody wanted a photo op with Mr. Mandela. But we had state
delegations to come. We had city delegations to come. We had congressional delegations to
come. I mean everybody came. Cabinet off1cers came. It was a steady stream of people because

President Clinton wanted us to do whatever we could to help Mr. Mandela and the new

democracy. So it was a fascinating—I have to pinch myself sometimes. Was I really there? It
was a fascinating time to be there, absolutely fascinating.

So when it came, was time for us to come back we really struggled with how can we, oh
what can we do? We want to stay engaged with South Africa. We made a lot of friends while we
were there. So my husband had this bright idea to start a leadership program for mid-career
leaders. He kept asking people, “How can we make a contribution? How, beyond the
ambassadorship?” And they said, “Leadership. We really need more leadership training.” So he
and some colleagues got to gether and put to gether this wonderful leadership program for
emerging leaders, for people who were mid-career. And there were several different components.
I helped with the communications component. But it was a yearlong program that started with a
retreat in Capetown and ended with a retreat in Capetown, and in the middle people were given
an executive coach and there were assignments every month. So anyway, it went beautifully. It
was a partnership between Duke University and the University of Capetown in Capetown, South
Africa.

So every year we would go, we’d live half the year in Capetown, and the other half
would be here in North Carolina. Not too shabby. So we did that for six years. And then when
Katrina happened, he began to see that there was a real leadership vacuum in the state of
Louisiana. So he tailored the program for Louisiana, mid-career leaders, and for three years they
went to South African for their concluding retreat. They basically were based on Louisiana, met
monthly. Had an opening retreat and middle retreat, and the final retreat was held in Capetown.

So they had the international experience. But yeah, it was great.

Braxton-Joseph 16

So that basically pretty much what I was doing. I was helping my husband with the
program and along the way Ibecame involved in Flamed Parenthood, and I was invited to join
the board. I didn’t mention this, but when I was in television, I did a lot of editorializing, first as
a researcher and then as on air. So I did, ( ) came out in favor of equal pay for equal work,
Equal Rights Amendment, anything to do with equity for women, Medicaid abortions, abortion
rights. I was very lucky to at that time to be in a position to help the guys think more broadly
about women and women’s issues. And so I was really happy to be able to do that. So becoming
involved in Flamed Parenthood was a natural progression. I had been very involved in Business
and Professional Women’s Clubs, BPW-USA. It’s now BPW Foundation, but I was a Young
Career Woman of the Year back in the late [19]70s. And I was very fortunate that these very
talented women invited me to join BPW, and it was there that I learned leadership basically.
They taught me parliamentary procedure. I actually had to take a course on it. So I know how to
run a meeting. We dealt with a lot of issues. Because of BPW I was able to lobby on behalf on
the Family and Medical Leave Act. Before President Clinton signed an executive order creating
it, it was a bill in the House of Representatives during the ﬁrst Bush administration. And I can
remember because I came up through the ranks of BPW, I was national legislation chair I think
[19]90-[19]91. I can remember going to, lobbying the entire first ﬂoor of the Rayburn House
Office Building, just knocking on doors with other colleagues saying, “We really want your
representative to think seriously about family and medical leave.” You shouldn’t have to deal
with an illness in the family or family emergency and have to worry about your job. And by the
way, you ought to pay for it. So family and medical leave did become a reality, but unfortunately

we’re one of just a handful of countries that don’t pay people while they’re gone. So they can’t

Interview number U-lOSO from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern
Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

Braxton-Joseph 17

take your job away while you’re gone to deal with a parent or child or what have you, but you’re
not getting paid. So that’s the next hurdle for us. I don’t know why we’re so cheap. It just seems,
it seems to me if an employee has piece of mind, then you’ve got some loyalty. You’ve got
somebody that’s going to go to the nth degree to make the company better. So it doesn’t make
sense. That’s why we need more women at the table. It does not compute. You have to think, is it

smart? Is it a smart thing to do? And we’re the ones that end up being the caregivers. So anyway-

So becoming involved in Flamed Parenthood was a natural progression for me. So when
I moved here, I was invited to join the board, and then they gently twisted my arm to become
chair. I did that for two years. I really enjoyed it. It’s a very well run organization here in North
Carolina. But I also got involved in WUNC radio. And I was on the board of Bennett College for
Women. I was invited--because of my news media background, I was invited to join the board of
Bennett. That was a fascinating experience. Bennett Belles, they are true bred. I was very
impressed with the campus and the students. It was cool. I wasn’t sure about moving to North
Carolina because I’m from New Jersey, and I grew up watching the ciVil rights movement
unfold. A lot of the ugliness was not here in North Carolina. It was further south, but I was like,
“I don’t know if I want to live down South.” Washington DC was as far south as I was living, but
I used to spend summers in downstate Virginia. I have relatives in MiddleseX County, Virginia,
which is the tidewater area. And I can remember some of the troubles that they had there. So I
wasn’t sure about coming to North Carolina. But I tell people after you live in South Africa,
which is way south, everything else is north. So I’m real happy to be here in North Carolina

where I've been very pleasantly surprised. I know this area, the Triangle is not the rest of the

state isn’t like this all over. Let me put it that way. You have many different attitudes, but I’m
reminded of a joke someone told me that North Carolina is the last stop on the New Jersey
turnpike. So many people have moved here, that so many people are coming in that it’s
becoming a different place.

MF: That’s true.

MJ: Anyway, I’m not answering your question. I’m sorry. I get off on these tangents.

MF: It’s interesting.

M]: We are talking about women.

MF: Yes.

MF: So I want to be sure that you know that I grew up in a house full of women. I think
women are much more likely to listen. I think we’re better listeners. I think we certainly are
more detail oriented. I think it’s in our DNA to be a little bit more sensitive to our surroundings
and to be consensus builders. I think we bring so many skills to the table that I wish there were
more women in many different arenas. I think we will have a woman president. I’m not sure
what her initials are going to be. But I could make an educated guess. I think it’s time. Ithink it’s
time because everybody brings something to the table. I think a female perspective is helpful
especially if you’ve got to be involved in raising a family or figuring out how to make ends meet.
I think we have a lot of transferrable skills, which is why I’m so happy to be with Lillian’s List
because I don’t think we give ourselves credit, or enough credit. I think we have a truckload of
common sense and intuition, and if given the opportunity, I think could definitely make much
larger contributions than we’re making now. I’m real happy to be part of Lillian’s List because I

remember when Emily’s List was just being formed.

Braxton-Joseph 19

MF: Oh interesting.

MI: I was in Washington, DC and when they started Emily’s list, I think there were just
a handful of women in congress period. And now you’ve got what, twenty senators and a
truckload of representatives. And that might not have happened if somebody hadn’t have stepped
up and said, “I think I can do this.” So that last budget dust up we had, I think there were a group
of women senators that got together, Republicans and Democrats, and figured out how to how to
navigate around it so people would not be without paychecks. Anyway, I’m real happy.

MF: So how did you come to Lillian’s List? Was it because of Emily’s List?

MJ: Well actually my friends at Flamed Parenthood, one friend in particular, Betty
Craven--. I had rotated off of the Plarmed Parenthood board, and she called me one day. And she
said, “Would you consider being on the Lillian’s List board?” And Betty, what can I say about
Betty Craven? She is one of the most decent people I think I've ever known. She and her husband
made the initial gift to build the Plarmed Parenthood clinic in Fayetteville. And had they not
done that, that clinic might not have been built. So I was laughing with her the other day. I said,
“You know, I’m going to be your friend for life. Ifyou had not done that, we might not have a
clinic.” It was a substantial amount of money, and of course I was on the board then. Anyway, so
Betty’s the type of person because of her values and because of her heart, you want to do
whatever you can when she asks. I’m like sure, I don’t mind being on the board of--. I figured, I
said, “How many meetings do you have a year and you know I travel so I might not always be
around.” She said, “Not a problem. You’ve got to make X number of meetings a year and what
have you.” I said, “Sure.” So that’s how it started. I actually was out of town. I was in Florida.

We were looking for property in Florida that year. And I was in Florida and said, “Sure.” And

she said, “Send me your bio,” which I did. And that’s how it started. So I was elected to the
board of Lillian’s List, wow, three or four years ago. I’m trying to remember. It’s been a little
while. And I got involved and agreed to be on the board of both the PAC and the Action Fund
and went to one of the trainings of the action fund and was just blown away. And I said “Wow.
This is the next step for me.” I don’t know that I would ever run. I don’t know that I’m thick-
skinned enough to run. But for the ladies who want to step up, I want to raise as much money as
I can. I’m going to do everything I can so resources won’t be an issue. And so that’s how I got
involved in Lillian’s List. So Ifeel like in many respects my whole life has been leading to me
Lillian’s List because it’s providing me with a way, with a constructive way to redirect my rage.
I’m not happy with things here in North Carolina. I think guys are trying to, and it’s mainly men-
-. I think about the Supreme Court and that recent Hobby Lobby decision, and I think like it was
very paternalistic put down to women. Your boss should never have say over your reproductive
health rights. It should never. The law of the land is the law of the land. But people want to keep
undermining it. But I was very angry at first, and then I said, “You know what, they just might
be setting the table for a lady president.” So we’ll see. We’ll see.

MF: Yeah, that’s true. So what work in your field do you look forward to doing in the
future?

MJ: Whoo, good question. Well, as you know I’m chair-elect of Lillian’s List come
January 13‘. We’ll have a different configuration, but I’ll be chair. And I decided I’m going to--,
part of the role of chair of the board is to set policy and raise money, and I’m going to be out
there beating the bushes raising as much money as I can. I want to make sure that our candidates

are well trained and well resourced. And I’m going to try to persuade as many people as possible

to contribute because you don’t have to sit back and just be mad. You can sit up, you can lean in
and be constructive.

So in terms of media, I think I always use the media skills that I've learned over the years
in whatever I do. And the issues training that I’m going to do this weekend is a good illustration.
I’m going to be team—teaching so to speak with Will Cubbison, a session on media, the nuts and
bolts of it basically. A lot of our candidates will already know some of the information, but many
may not know all of it. So we want to try to give them the quickie course like “Remember when
a reporter calls you, you don’t have to respond. But if you’re going to respond, you need to meet
his or her deadlines.”--so those kinds of things. Because we’re in a celebrity culture now we have
to be very careful about how we look. So your makeup has got to be right, and your wardrobe
has got to be appealing. You can’t be doing crazy prints and ﬂorals and all that jazz and no. So
basic kinds of things that you might not think about because you’re so busy focusing on issues.
So I feel ultimately that I’ll use my media training to help others. I think that would be the
bottom line. One of these days I'd like to create a good news network because I think there’s
more good news out there than bad news.

MF: Yeah, that would be great.

MJ: But they tell me that good news doesn’t make money. I’m like, “Well, it doesn’t
have to be pabulum. I mean it could be silver linings. It could be people overcoming obstacles.”
That’s still in the back of my mind. So when you hear about it, you’ll say I talked to her that day.
No, I think I probably have to hit the lottery to be able to do that, but it’s still maybe it’s the good
news about women that I’ll do.

MF: Yeah. I’d watch it.

MJ: But I think there really is more good news out there than bad news. I can remember
when people had back alley abortions. I can remember when I had a lady tell me that she had a
back alley abortion and she would never do it again because she almost died. And that was not
that long ago. That would’ve been in the [l9]6OS because the pill and abortion didn’t really
happen for us until like [19]72, [19]7 3. So all the women before that really suffered because they
had no control and they had no options. That’s what makes me so angry about closing down
women’s health centers, women’s health clinics, Plarmed Parenthood. That’s not only abortion
services. It’s just a whole range of medical care. It’s contraception. It’s family plam1ing. I mean,
if you don’t control your body, you don’t control your life. And so I feel in many ways we’re
beyond that, and yet in some ways we’re not. People who have a different point of View are
pulling the strings now and it’s not fair. It really is not fair. And we can’t let it continue. We
can’t let them try to turn the clock back. We’re not going back. We can’t. We can’t. And I’m
very happy that we’ve had this debate about abortion for a long time, but I think people are
seeing the real motivation was always contraception. Some people didn’t want anybody to have
contraception. Excuse me, my body, my choice. I’ll make that decision. I wouldn’t presume to
make a decision for somebody else. I don’t know that person’s circumstances. I think it’s just
very paternalistic. I think it’s extremely unfair. And we can’t let them get away with it. We’ve
got to stand up and be counted. I’m mad at the Supreme Court this Hobby Lobby thing, but they
may be handing us--. They may have done us a big favor.

MF: Yeah. That’s true.

MJ: Just like the women in Mississippi. Mississippi they tried to outlaw contraception,

and women came to gether and said, “Oh no, are you crazy?” So we’re going to win in the end,

but I think that when we win, all people win because you have to be in control of your life.
Somebody can’t make health care decisions for you. It’s not right. It’s not fair. It’s not smart.

MF: Yeah. Well, is there anything I've left out that you’d like to talk about?

MJ: Oh no. I’ll probably look at this—do we get to do a round two when I see the
transcript? I’ll probably say, “I should’ve said this. I should’ve said that.” How many of these
interviews will you be conducting?

MF: Well, we’re each supposed to do two. I’m actually doing three.

MJ: All right. That’s great. That’s great. How long from now will I get the transcript?

MF: It will probably be around a month, or, yeah.

M]: A month. Now will you still be at UNC?

MF: Yes, I’m there for another year.

MJ: Okay, well great. Well, promise me if I get the transcript and I see that I've forgotten
something, will you come back and talk to me?

MF: Yes, of course. I'd love to. I can always do more interviews.

MJ: Great, great, great. Okay, well, that’s fine. This is sort of top of mind and you can
hear I’m dealing with allergies today. It’s sort of top of mind, but I will be thinking if there’s
anything else.

MF: Okay.

MJ: And now you said this is going to be online and the printed version is going to be
available and the audio is going to be available?

MF: Yeah, so what it looks like is you’ll go to the SOHP website and you can just

search--

MJ: Go to the--?

MF: --the Southern Oral History Program website, and you can basically just search
through all the interviews that are in the archives, and then when you click on one, when it
comes up, the audio will be at the top, and then there will be an abstract describing the interview
and then the transcript and then field notes.

MJ: Field notes. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. All righty, so I might get a second interview.
Is that what you’re telling me?

MF: I would love to do that, yeah.

MJ: Okay. Well, I’ll tell you. I’ll take a look at the--, for you Meg anything. I’ll take a
look at the transcript and if there’s anything I think I've left out, I’ll call you and we’ll figure out
if, how to get it in.

MF: That will be great.
