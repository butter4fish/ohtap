 Ahrberg, and today is October 16, 2009. I am visiting  with Bill Thompson in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE  Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Bill, welcome to OSU for your   is this your fiftieth class  reunion?  It is. Thanks, Janet.  Can you tell us why you decided to participate?  Jerry Gill called me and said,    We want to interview you.    So, I said,     Sure, I   d be glad to do that.     Can you tell us where you grew up and a little bit about your early life?  Oh, my goodness. Well, I was born in Oklahoma City. Actually, lived in  Edmond until I was nine years old, and we moved to Stillwater in the  third grade. So, then I went all through Stillwater public schools and  graduated in 1955. After that, we stayed and went to Oklahoma State  University. Of course, it was A M at that time in 1955, and really,  growing up in Stillwater, you didn   t think about going to any other  school besides Oklahoma A M or OSU. I went for two years, and  during that first two years of school I became a member of Beta Theta Pi  and had kind of a barbershop quartet, but we did other kinds of music,  too. We kind of mixed it in, but it was mostly a cappella. We worked for  the Student Entertainers during those first two years. Ashley Alexander  was the director of Student Entertainers at the time. I loved Ashley and  his whole family, really. But we sang. We were out three or four nights a  week singing for some group around the state of Oklahoma. We sang on  a television show every Friday, the Tom Paxton Show and WKY   was  it W or K? I can   t remember. I think it was channel 4. Anyway, we sang  every Friday. Had to cut some classes to do that but we thought that was  5  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  really important for our career. So, we sang a lot, and after the first two  years we decided we were either going to have to sing or go to school  because the two weren   t mixing very well. (Laughs) There was an  opportunity with the U.S. Army Field Band to go in and sing with them  and tour the world, so we did for three years and then came back to  Stillwater afterwards and finished school. So, that was kind of the story  in a nutshell.  Well, you said you moved back to Stillwater. Can you tell us a little bit  about what your parents did and what activities you were involved with  in the high school while you were here?  Okay. Oh, that   s a big story. (Laughter) If I can remember   that was a  long time ago, Janet. We   re talking over fifty years for that. My father  worked for the post office in Edmond and finally retired at fifty-five, and  then he became director of admissions at Central State University in  Edmond for the next ten years. So, my parents were divorced when I  was nine, and that was the reason for the move to Stillwater. Mother had  three children and started back to school, got her degree. She had about  two years before she came back. She got her bachelor   s degree and then  her master   s and taught Oklahoma History while she was going to  school, and was working on her doctorate when she met another man.  They married and put in a restaurant in Stillwater called The Chicken  House. So, I grew up working in The Chicken House a lot.  Where was it located?  It was near Fifth and Main Street, right across the street from the  Leachman Theater, or close by. So, all my spare time was spent there.  As far as high school goes, I was pretty active in a lot of things, mostly  music, even though I didn   t major in music. I was in the glee club, the  boys    glee club, the mixed chorus and all that, and the boys    quartet for  three years. I was also in the band, and I was drum major of the band at  Stillwater High School. And you know it was kind of interesting, this  story. When I moved back to Stillwater after I retired from my  employment, there were still a lot of people in Stillwater that knew me,  and they remembered me being the drum major of the band. But what I  thought was a lot more important was I was state president of the  Oklahoma High School Student Councils. I thought being that was a lot  more important than being the drum major, but nobody even knew about  that. (Laughter) So, I kind of forgot about that and went on. High school  was fun. I enjoyed every bit of it, and we   ve had several reunions since  that time.  Was it called C.E. Donart?  6  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  No, it was Stillwater High School. I don   t even know what year they  changed to the other name and used that for probably ten years, I   m  guessing. I don   t really know, and then they switched back to Stillwater  High School.  Can you tell us where you are living now?  I live here in Stillwater. After I retired and moved back, I guess eleven  years ago, we built a house kind of in the southwest part of town and  have enjoyed being back in Stillwater. It   s always been home no matter  where we traveled and no matter where we lived. We always thought of  Stillwater as home. My wife and I met in our freshman year at A M and  have been together ever since. So, this July we celebrated our fifty-first  wedding anniversary.  That   s wonderful. That is really wonderful. So, you think because you  actually lived in Stillwater, that   s what influenced you to come here?  Well, I think so. Growing up in Stillwater, the natural thing about  college   and we all knew growing up that we were going to go to  college. That was a foregone conclusion. Stillwater was here, and we  had lived it and breathed it for so many years, it was just the natural  thing to do. My grandfather was the business manager of Oklahoma  A M back in 1939,    40,    41, back in the pre-war era. He and Dr.  Bennett had come from the same area of the state, around Hugo, and had  been good friends for a long time. So, when he applied for the job, he  got it, and that was what he did for, I think it was, three or four years. He  was in the state legislature for awhile and then became business manager  here. But this was always a special place for all of us, so that   s why I  ended up going to school here.  So, you really have some strong roots coming from OSU and Stillwater.  I do.  That   s really neat. During your time on the campus of Oklahoma A M  College, they changed their name to Oklahoma State University and  joined the Big 8 Conference and became the Cowboys. Do you recall  how the student population generally reacted to that change?  Janet, I was gone when that happened. (Laughter) I had, as I said before,  gone in the Army after the first two years of school, into the special  services. So, actually, when the name changed we were probably in  Japan or Korea or someplace else singing when it actually happened.  But my wife was still here. We were engaged at that time but not  married, and she was a cheerleader at OSU. So, she was very active on  7  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  the campus. I   ve heard her tell some stories about it. It was a special  thing, I remember, and there was a lot of conversation, but I wasn   t here  to really experience it. So, I wouldn   t be a very good resource on that  subject.  Do you remember the Pistol Pete mascot?  Well, of course. Everybody knows Pistol Pete. (Laughter)  Did he shoot his gun off then as much as he does now?  I don   t think so. You know, in fact, do you remember the first year that  we had Pistol Pete as a mascot?  I do not.  I don   t either. It   s a fairly recent thing. We didn   t have him when I was  going to school. I mean, he was the mascot and, of course, Frank Eaton  would come to campus and talk to classes from various times, especially  the Oklahoma History class. B.B. Chapman was the Oklahoma History  professor. Wild man. But Dr. Chapman would have Frank Eaton come  up and speak to the classes quite often. I think he did some other things  around, too. So, that was the big thing. And I think the character that we  know today as Pistol Pete came along a little bit later. I can   t tell you  what year. I   ve known some of the Pistol Petes and they   ve told me  when it all started, but I can   t right at this moment remember exactly  what year it was.  Did they have the horse named Bullet?  No. We didn   t have any Bullet.  No horse, no Bullet.  No Bullet, no Pistol Pete.  What was your major?  My first two years I was in pre-law, and that   s the direction I intended to  go with my college. So, I was in the school of arts and sciences. When I  got out of the Army and came back to school, Catherine and I were  married and we had one child and one on the way. And I said,    I don   t  really have time to go through all this schooling. (Laughs) I need to get a  degree and get on with a career.    So, I switched to the school of business  and majored in personnel management with a minor in economics. So,  that   s the school I went through. And funny thing, my jobs that I had had  8  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  nothing to do with personnel management until later in my career when  things became more administrative, and then I really used that degree.  You keep bringing your wife   s name up. Why don   t you tell us what her  full name is so we can get that on the record.  Okay. Her maiden name was Catherine Ann Wills and she   funny story  about Catherine Wills. She was a cheerleader at OSU, and, actually,  Lawrence Herkimer was kind of the father of cheerleading in Oklahoma.  He started workshops and classes around Oklahoma and Texas, and she  was one of his first instructors and traveled over Texas and Oklahoma.  So, she was really into cheerleading. She grew up in Tulsa, and we met  when we were freshmen at OSU. She pledged the Pi Beta Phi sorority,  and I pledged Beta Theta Pi. And during those years we always had a  dance hour every Wednesday night. The fraternity that had made  arrangements with the sorority to go there for that one-hour dance hour  would go, and you just kind of ended up with whoever you ended up  with, I guess. I don   t know how it worked, but one of the girls that I  went to high school with had pledged Pi Phi. And I said,    Shirley, just  get me a date with the sharpest girl over there.    So, she did, and that   s  how Catherine and I met that night.  And history ever since.  And it   s just all been together ever since.  That   s really neat. Are there some classes that you especially remember  taking?  Oh, gosh. There are only one or two that I didn   t enjoy, and I guess the  reason I didn   t, those were classes where we had 120 or 130 people in a  big auditorium, and I felt very disconnected. As far as the classes I  enjoyed, most everything I did. I know I struggled with econ in the first  two classes, the first two levels, and after I got past that it was my  favorite subject. But there was something about that basic economics  that just had trouble sinking in. I remember especially one of the classes  I really enjoyed as I think about it now was business statistics. Eugene  Swearingen was the dean of the school of business, and he taught the  class. And I struggled with that. They had terminology I   d never heard  before. And about the first four or five weeks of that class, I thought,     Why am I here, because I don   t understand anything they   re talking  about?    And all of a sudden a light bulb came on. They had some labs,  and it was like one day I didn   t know it and the next day it all made  sense, and from then on I really enjoyed the class and have used it over  my career a lot. That   s an interesting class.  9  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  That   s really nice to hear, getting your money   s worth for your college  degree. (Laughter) Was there a particular faculty member that you  remember that influenced you the most? And it doesn   t have to be one.  Were there several faculty members that you recall that really stood out  in your mind?  Well, Dr. Swearingen was one of the ones that influenced me a great  deal. There was a professor in the school of business who taught  economics and business management classes. His name just happened to  be William Thompson, and it wasn   t me. But I thought he was an  outstanding instructor. And then I had an accounting instructor, and I  can   t remember his name exactly. I   ve tried to think of it a few times  over the years, but he would teach at Oklahoma State for one or two  years and then he   d go back into private industry for a couple of years.  And he said,    This way, I really keep up to date on what   s going on in  the accounting world outside of academia.    So, I thought he was just an  outstanding instructor.  What buildings were your classes held in? Do you remember?  Mostly the Classroom Building. Freshman year we had English in the  basement of Old Central. That was a ritual, and I   m so glad that I had  that experience. But most of the other classes were held at the Classroom  Building, which was new at that time. I don   t remember exactly the year  they built it, but it was fairly new.  Did you have any classes in the Quonset huts?  No. I never   well, I take that back. I think I had basic ROTC. Maybe we  went to a Quonset hut for some of that. Some, we met in Gallagher Hall,  which is now Gallagher-Iba. But we had some ROTC classes there, and  it seems like we did some things in Quonset huts, but I don   t remember  specifically.  Is there anything about the Quonset huts that stands out in your mind?  They were a real eyesore; I remember that. (Laughter) Otherwise, I just  don   t remember being in them all that much.  Since you were from Stillwater, did you live on campus or off campus?  No, I lived at home. I didn   t live on campus. And it was a little bit of a  disconnect as far as campus life and activities. My mother owned a  restaurant in town, so I spent most of my, what I thought should have  been, leisure hours   in fact, when Catherine, or, we call her Cat. When  Cat and I would go on a date, I always double-dated. Because if we   d go  10  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  to the movie, which was across the street from the restaurant, if the  restaurant got busy, Mother would send somebody over to the theater to  get me out, and then whoever I was double-dating with could take her  home. And that happened quite often.  Did you live in town? If you did, can you tell us where you lived?  We did. Actually, we lived right on Main Street, near Fifth and Main.  So, it was about half a block in distance from our house to the restaurant.  It just made it really easy. And that was only about three or four blocks  from the high school, because Stillwater High School used to be located  where the Community Center is now, right in the center of town. So, it  was very convenient. I had a bicycle. I had a car, but I didn   t have to use  it a whole lot.  Is the house still there today?  No, they moved it off. In fact, it   s kind of sad when I tell my  grandchildren about Stillwater and growing up here, and I go to   my  grade school was Eugene Field, and that   s where the Consumers IGA  grocery store is now. So, there   s no evidence that there was ever a grade  school there. And then my junior high is where the public library is.  Now, the building   s still there. It just got added onto, and it doesn   t look  anything like it did when we did that. And now the high school is the  Community Center, and our house is gone, and the other place we lived  for a short time before we moved to Main Street was in College Courts,  which is where the hospital is today. So, all that   s gone. It   s kind of hard  to trace my history in Stillwater by looking at the buildings. (Laughs)  Are there any things about what you talked about, your mother having  The Chicken House, are there some other places in Stillwater that you  remember growing up and visiting that are still here or that you just  really have good memories about?  Gosh, the town has changed so much. When we were in school here, of  course, you could go to Lake Carl Blackwell or Camp Redlands without  paying a fee.  That   s quite a ways out there.  Well, yes, it was. Because Western was about the end of town, and then  the highway was a dirt road after that for a long time. I noticed the silver  bridge that was over Stillwater Creek in the west side of town was put  there in 1936, which happened to be the year I was born. So, I felt a very  closeness to that silver bridge when they tore it down. And I thought,     Well, that   s me too, you know. We   re all crumbling a little bit.     11  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  (Laughter) But the bridge is gone. Places in town, so many have  changed. And the banks went up where there used to be   well, like at  Sixth and Main, there was a hotel there, a very nice place, and now it   s a  bank. It   s just, so many businesses have moved off of Main Street and  into other areas, so somebody that was here fifty years ago wouldn   t  recognize Stillwater today.  What about Swim   s Campus Shop?  Swim   s was here. I didn   t go in it very much, but it was there, and we  knew the Swim family. I just didn   t spend a lot of time doing things like  that. I was in school or singing someplace or working at the restaurant.  You mentioned you were a member of the Beta house. Can you tell us  about how many men lived in that house? I know you didn   t actually live  there, but how many men were in, let   s say, your pledge class?  Well, there were only twenty-one of us in the pledge class, and that was  probably an average-size fraternity or sorority pledge class in those  years. Nowadays, they go with forty and fifty pledges, so things have  changed a lot. As I recall, there must have been about seventy, seventy-five  guys in the fraternity house at that time. We had some interesting  experiences, and I   ll tell you about those if you   d like to hear, but I   ll  wait until you ask me. (Laughs)  Well, why don   t you share a couple of those experiences with us?  Well, okay, I could tell you one that I want you to know. I was not a part  of this, but some of the pledges when I was a pledge at the Beta house  decided that the canon that belonged to the ROTC organization would  look a lot better in front of the Kappa house. So, one night in the middle  of the night, they hooked it up to the back of a pickup and pulled it over  to the Kappa Kappa Gamma house, which was across the street from the  Beta house. They dug a hole and they put quick-dry cement in it and  chained it in there, so it was a little bit difficult to get out the next day.  But, like I say, I wasn   t a part of that. I just heard about it, and I did see  the evidence, so I know it happened.  One of the other things, Betas typically had what they call the Beta  Turkey Pull every year, and you   ve probably heard about that. They  would cook a lot of turkeys, and it would be a formal dinner dance thing,  and it was really a special event. But the ways the turkeys came about  was the members would arrange with one of the area farmers who raised  turkeys to put a certain number of turkeys in his pen that one particular  night. The pledges were then taken out into the country, told to leave  their billfolds, all forms of identification off, and they didn   t know that it  12  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  had been set up with the farmer, but they were to go in and steal those  turkeys so we   d have turkeys for the Beta Turkey Pull. And usually  they   d tell one of the pledges what was going on so it wouldn   t get too  far out of hand. Well, the one that they told, it wasn   t me, but the one  that they told decided not to share anything with us. So, we got in and  stole those turkeys. And the farmer came out, you know, he heard us out  there and he shot his shotgun in the air and everybody was scared to  death. We got the turkeys and got quite a few of them out. I don   t even  remember how many, but we didn   t think it would be enough to feed  everybody, so we decided to go south nine miles to the Oklahoma State  turkey farm down near Perkins and steal some more turkeys. So we did.  The next morning    (Laughter)  I   ve heard these turkey stories.  The next morning, the members saw that we had a lot more turkeys than  they had contracted for with that farmer. (Laughter) We got in a little  trouble over, that but we did have, actually, an extra turkey dinner out of  it for the pledges and dates. One of the local pledge   s mothers fixed  turkey, and we had a great dinner with those extra turkeys.  Can you tell us how the Betas participated in Homecoming?  We built floats. We had a float. In those years, you didn   t decorate the  house too much. It was very minor decorations on the houses, and all the  emphasis was put on the parade. Everybody built a float, and we   d  usually build a float in the yards of one of the local lumber companies.  They were so good to allow us to do that. And we   d set that thing up and  work on it all night long the night before the parade but several days in  advance. They were very elaborate floats. So, the parade was the big  thing. And then over the years, I think the parade   s still important, but  it   s gone a little more toward house decorations with all the automated  things and electronics they have. They   re fabulous.  Would one of those lumber companies have been Hoke Lumber?  Hoke Lumber, Donaldson, which became Donaldson-Manning. There  was a Round Tree Lumber Company. R.O. Fox had a lumber company.  There were several in town, and they all did just fine.  So, they were very accommodating to the Greeks?  All of them were. They were great.  Do you remember anything about the house mother?  13  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Mother Hall was our house mother, and she was so special to all of us.  Once Mother Hall was gone   and I don   t know how long she was the  house mother at the Beta house, but several years. She was so special.  She taught us manners. And, of course, as I said, I wasn   t living in the  house, so I didn   t get quite as much benefit from Mother Hall as  everybody else did. But it was always assigned, two of the pledges  would take her to church on Sunday morning at whatever church they  wanted to attend or she wanted to attend, and she was just very special to  all of us.  Do you maintain contact with any of your fraternity brothers?  I do. There are two fraternity brothers that are living in Stillwater that  moved here after they retired, as I did, and we stay together and do a lot  of things socially together with our wives and so on. So, it   s close. And  then there are several that live out of town that we stay in touch with but  don   t see very often.  That   s really neat. What activities and campus organizations were you  involved with?  Most of my time was spent with Student Entertainers during those first  two years because we were singing a lot. I was in a pre-law organization.  As a freshman at OSU, I ran for freshman class president and won that. I  was freshman class president, so I was somewhat active in politics on  the campus. One of the interesting stories about that was my fraternity  brother who also sang in my quartet was kind of my campaign manager,  and he decided we needed a sign on the island in Theta Pond. He swam  across and put the sign up. Well, Theta Pond in those days was pretty  dirty. It was not anything like it is today, and with all the ducks and their  leavings, it was a mess. And that was okay to get that sign out there,  because then everybody   s excited about the campaign and you   re really  doing a lot of things, and it   s fun to do. But after the campaign is over,  somebody had to go take the sign down. So, good old Brian   and it was  cold by that time. It was well into the fall, and it was cold. He swam out  and got that sign and took it off the island. And we have laughed so  many times about that. Our old quartet gets together once a year. He  lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and one   s in Tulsa, and one is in  Oklahoma City. So, three of us are close. But he always makes it back,  and we spend a day singing and reminiscing about those days.  That   s really neat.  I always laugh about his plight in Theta Pond. (Laughter)  Can you identify those other three gentlemen for us?  14  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Well, Bryan Duke was our bass, and he came from Duncan, Oklahoma.  And our original baritone was Larry Blake, and Larry was also from  Duncan. He sang with us for a year and then had other interests and  dropped out. So, our baritone became Glenn Phibbs, who I had known  from high school in Stillwater. The tenor was Bob Hill, who was a  Stillwater product, and he was a year ahead of us in school, but Bob and  I had sung together in high school and then both pledged Beta and  started singing together then. So, Bob Hill, Larry Blake, originally, and  then Glenn Phibbs, Bryan Duke and myself.  Can you recall some of the student traditions or activities of your era on  campus here?  Oh, my goodness. No. (Laughter) I don   t think it   s a lot different.  Do you remember Howdy Week, or did they have a Western Day?  No, we didn   t do that.  A Western Week or anything like that?  You know, I think there was a Howdy Dance. I remember something  about that. I didn   t get to go to it my freshman year. It was just mostly  for freshmen I think, incoming. I do remember one of the things we  always   we didn   t have ACT tests and all those things before you went  to college, but at the beginning of our freshman year, they put all the  freshmen in Gallagher Hall and gave us some kind of test. I don   t know  whether it was an aptitude test or personality or what, but we had to do  that. And that was the first time I   d seen Cat. I didn   t know who she  was, but I saw her and I thought,    I think maybe she   s kind of cute.     (Laughter)  What did you and Cat like to do on your dates? Did you go to dances  and where were those held? Or places to eat or     No, there weren   t very many places to eat. There were only two or three  restaurants in town at that time. We went to the movies a lot when we  did have a date. And once in a while we   d come to the Student Union  and dance, and even if we went to a movie we   d usually end up at the  Union up on the fourth or fifth floor, the Starlight Terrace, and we   d  dance and dance. So, those were about it. Once in a   well, I was going  to say we   d go to Oklahoma City, but I don   t think we ever did that. It  was mostly just the movies.  Did you attend sporting events while you were here?  15  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  As much as I could. With a restaurant, the busy days were on   like,  football days were just crazy, and there was no way we could go to  football games. So, I worked through that. We   d have the radio on in the  kitchen listening to the game, but that was about as close as we could get  to it. I went to all the wrestling matches. That was a time that I could go,  and some of the basketball games. But mostly for football there was just  no way we could go to the games.  Were you able to travel out of town to any of the out-of-town games?  No, not at all. I don   t think I ever went to an out-of-town game.  You mentioned you had a car. Was that a rarity for someone to have a  car on campus at that time or     Well, not so much. I don   t believe I drove the car to class very much. I   d  use the bicycle because it was so hard to find a place to park, just as it is  today. It   s hard to find a place to park on the campus.  Some things never change.  My first car was a 1949 Oldsmobile 88. It was all black, and it had been  an undertaker   s car. I bought it used, so it didn   t have whitewalls. Every  car had whitewalls in those days. I couldn   t afford to buy whitewall  tires, so I painted the whitewalls on with that rubberized white paint.  About two weeks is as, or maybe three weeks, you could get out of a tire  before it started looking pretty shabby. So, every week I   d re-paint two  of the tires, and then I   d just rotate. So, it was a labor of love for my  little black car. (Laughs)  The Student Union was new on campus.  Fairly new.  Fairly new. And also the library.  The library was very new. The Student Union   when I was in grade  school, I remember Washington Street used to go through. In about the  fourth or fifth grade, so I would have been ten or eleven, twelve years  old, they closed off Washington Street, and we thought the world had  ended. But it didn   t. Life continued. And they closed it off and finished  the Student Union, and it was a gorgeous building. Still is. And the  library is just awesome.  Did you ever study in the library?  16  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  No. I was supposed to, I   m sure. I didn   t spend a lot of time in the  library. It was a great place to go, and I think maybe somehow I avoided  that freshman requirement that you have to take library science because I  never did take it. Don   t know how I got out of it or why I didn   t. I wish I  had because it would   ve helped me a great deal. We were telling our  grandson about the library, and Cat was explaining what was there and  everything. She asked me what I thought about it and I said,    I don   t  know. I never was in it.    (Laughs) So, maybe once or twice I was there.  Well, you were being honest.  Yes. (Laughs)  Was there a key event or development at OSU during your time as a  student that you especially remember?  Well, I remember when we beat Kansas, when Wilt    the Stilt    was  playing for them.  Yes. Were you at the game?  No, I wasn   t. Actually, I was off singing with the Student Entertainers.  We listened to it on the radio coming home. Cat was there. She was a  cheerleader at the time, and she tells the story about standing on the  sidelines, and Wilt    the Stilt    came by or was close by her and she  looked up, probably three feet higher than her head, and told him that we  were going to beat him. And, sure enough, we did by one or two points.  Seems like it was 44-43 or something like that. It was a great thing. The  things I remember so much about those days was Allied Arts. Oklahoma  State brought in some great entertainment. Bob Hope was here. We had  the Four Lads, the Four Freshmen. There were just some wonderful acts  that came in for Allied Arts at that time.  Can you tell us how you feel that Oklahoma State sparks such loyalty in  their students and alumni? What is it about OSU that makes people feel  so connected to the university?  You know, I don   t know. I really like when they started going stronger  with the orange feeling. I think that   s something to grab hold of. Maybe  it   s because we   re in the shadow of Oklahoma University that we   I  think the tendency for people in America is to cheer for the underdog  and, boy, we   ve been the underdog for a lot of years in many areas. We  always think that next year we   re going to be a little better, and a lot of  times that   s happened, but a lot of times it hasn   t. So, we just keep  hoping. There must be something here. Maybe it   s in the water, Janet. I  don   t know what it is. But all of us around feel so strongly to support our  17  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  university, and we love it, and most people, especially the ones   there  are so many that move back to Stillwater to retire that went to school  here. With me growing up in Stillwater, it was natural, and my mother  was still here when we moved back or just before. So, it was natural for  me to come back, but for a lot of people it was only because they went to  school here, and they had that closeness with the university that you talk  about.  You mentioned you graduated and then you left. What is it when you left  OSU that you took with you the most? Was it the feeling of the people  that you met, or was it the education you got? Was it the fun you had  with your fraternity brothers? What stood out most in your mind when  you left?  I don   t think I could pick out one thing. When we finished our tour of  duty in the Army and came back to school, as I said, Cat and I were  married and we had one child and one on the way. And so most of my  time those last two years were spent working or in class or studying. I  didn   t have a lot of time to do much of anything else. I was happy to get  my degree and go on to a career and try to make a little bit of money.  But as far as what I left, it   s just been special. Being at OSU was  something that meant a lot to me and always has ever since. I can   t point  to any one thing that was more than some other. It was all good. Even  the struggles were good.  Tell us a little bit about your career after you left OSU.  Well, when I got out of school I wanted a job right away because we had  been living pretty close to the bone. So, I went to work for OG E in  Oklahoma City, and I did that for about two and a half years, and my  association with Judson Bryan, who was the Oldsmobile Cadillac dealer  in Stillwater   Judd had always encouraged me to go to work for  General Motors and Oldsmobile division. So, after a couple of years  with OG E, I felt like I needed a change and I interviewed with  Oldsmobile in Oklahoma City and was hired. That started the career  with General Motors. And then over the years   originally, it was  working with car dealers in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle, part of  Kansas. Then it just kind of grew from there. We moved around several  times. We went from Oklahoma City, actually, from Oklahoma City to  Enid and then back to Oklahoma City. And then we moved to St. Louis  and then to Lansing, Michigan. And then from there we went to Dallas,  Texas and then to Detroit. Then we went overseas to New Zealand and  Australia and spent three years in each of those countries before we  came back to Michigan again. So, we spent ten or eleven years, off and  on, in Michigan. We were there three different times. That   s another  reason we wanted to move south. We got enough cloudy weather and  18  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  cold and snow that it would last us the rest of our life. So, we wanted to  get back to Oklahoma.  My career   as I told you before, we started out working with dealers,  and it was a lot in advertising and marketing, just ways to help dealers  improve their operations. And the farther it went with my career, it  became more administrative with our own people. So, my last job in  Lansing, I had probably 250 or 300 people that were reporting directly  or indirectly to me, and so it became more administrative and personnel-focused.  While you were traveling the world and living in other states, were you  able to come back to OSU much and attend any of the activities, or just  come back to Stillwater in general?  Not too many activities. We got back occasionally for a football game or  a basketball game, but my mother was still here and that was the reason  for our visits. Even when we were overseas we   d always come back  once a year and spend a week in Stillwater. So, Stillwater never got out  of my blood, and the university is synonymous with Stillwater. It just all  goes together.  Can you describe what the campus was like physically? Do you  remember the architecture, the layout of the campus? When you think  about the physical layout of OSU, what is most in your mind?  Well, I think we   ve always had a beautiful campus. It   s so much larger  today than it was then, but, you know, growing up in Stillwater, your  focus is in high school or junior high, grade school. And even though  you visit the university area sometimes, you don   t think about that much  because you don   t have to walk to class. You don   t have to go any place  that you can   t pretty well drive to if you need to. So, it seemed like a  huge campus to me when I finally became a freshman at OSU. And by  today   s standards, it was pretty small, I guess. But the architecture was  always really outstanding. The grounds, the way the  physical plant   takes care of the grounds, they   ve always done a wonderful job. And, of  course, Dr. Bennett   s the one that brought the magnolia trees to the  Stillwater campus because he had been from southeastern Oklahoma  where they flourished, down around Durant and Hugo and all in there.  So, when he became president, he said,    We   re going to have magnolia  trees.    And there   s still a lot of evidence of magnolia trees in Stillwater  as well as on the campus. It   s just always been beautiful. The aroma  sometimes in the spring when the fertilizer was spread was     Did they have that back then?  19  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Yes, they sure did, (Laughter) and if you walked across the campus you  knew it. But those were great years. I cherish each time, each memory  that I have of those days.  Being from Stillwater, there was kind of a resort area north of town  called Yost     Oh, Yost Lake.  Did your family ever go out to Yost Lake?  Not as a family. I went out quite often. Yost Lake was a special place. I  had friends who had cabins there, their families did. We didn   t, but they  did, and they spent a lot of their summer out at Yost Lake. We went  because there was a place to swim. They had a little golf course there, a  little nine-hole golf course. I played it one time, I think, but they had  sand greens and it was kind of like a pasture that they just mowed in an  area. So, Lakeside was a lot better place to play golf. But we   d go out  and swim, and then they had the pavilion that stretched out over the edge  of the lake, and that   s where I learned to dance. And it was actually my  stepmother who went out there with us from time to time, and she said,     I   m going to teach you to dance.    And so she did. That was probably  seventh or eighth grade. I can   t remember.  And it was by a train, was there a train track back then?  There was a train track, and there used to be a train that would go out  there and make a stop because they had a water station right near Yost  Lake, and I guess the water came out of the lake. I never did ride the  train out there. In fact, I   m not even sure it was still running when we  were at that age. But it was a special, special place.  You mentioned you have children.  Yes, I have two.  Did any of those children attend OSU?  Our daughter attended two years at OSU. She was a Theta, and Cat  thought it was okay. You know, Pi Phis usually want to have a Pi Phi be  a Pi Phi. It   s very close, the loving arrows of Pi Phi. But she went two  years and decided that she wanted to go into a nursing program. So, she  transferred to Tulsa University and got her nursing degree there, and  she   s been working at Saint Francis in Tulsa for twenty-seven or twenty-eight  years in the heart unit in intensive care. So, she   s made a great  career out of it. And our son   we were living in Lansing, Michigan  20  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  Thompson  Ahrberg  when he was a freshman in college. He went to Michigan State for one  year and he said,    It   s too cold. I   m going to Oklahoma.    So, he  transferred to Tulsa University and got his degree there.  What advice would you give to OSU students today, about either coming  to the university or just something that you feel like would be very  important to someone that was thinking about coming to OSU?  Whoa. That   s a good question.  Just think of it, maybe, of your own children if you were trying to tell  them what you would, to guide them in coming to OSU. What advice  would you give them?  You know, it   d be hard to separate what I would tell an incoming  freshman as opposed to what I   d tell any child at that age. I think you   ve  got to be true to yourself and realize that you   re entering an adult phase  of your life, and the decisions you make are so important. And we   re  tempted so many times by things that get in the way of a route that  we   ve chosen for our life. I think so many times young people don   t  understand that those decisions can be life-long problems for them if  they make the wrong decisions. So, it   s important. I think they need to  understand that life is not always fair. I think they need to understand  that what they get out of life is going to be up to them, that nobody   s  going to give it to them. And they need to have a plan and a goal in mind  and work toward that. We   re all going to have fun, and we   re all going  to have a good time with various activities that we participate in, but it   s  so important to stay true to your ideals and your morals.  So, that would be for any student, not just a person coming to OSU?  Right.  That   s very well said. Well, we   re just about finished with the interview.  Is there anything that you would like to add that we didn   t cover? A  special memory that always stands out in your mind about OSU or  anything that you thought you would like to share with us in this  interview?  No, Janet, I think we   ve really covered the waterfront. It   s been great. I  enjoyed going through the interview process. I had no idea what you  were going to ask me today, so everything was kind of winging it. But  good questions, and I appreciate being able to do this.  Well, we appreciate you coming and spending some time with us and  sharing your memories. It   s been a real delight to meet with you and  21  Thompson  hear about the Beta house and your wife and your family and your  career. You   ve apparently done very well, and so it   s really nice to see  outstanding alumni come back and say    howdy    to us.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  -------  -------
