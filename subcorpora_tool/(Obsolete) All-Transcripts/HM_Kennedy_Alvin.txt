Speaker 1: And place of birth?
Speaker 2: Shreveport, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now how far can you go back on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: To, I guess that would be my grandparents and her family.
Speaker 1: Do you have a date that you can go back to thereabouts?
Speaker 2: You mean a date that I'm familiar with or that I know of?
Speaker 1: Their date of birth, if you know that.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I don't know the dates of birth.
Speaker 1: So, give me the full name of your great grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: That one I've forgotten, I'm losing right now.  (Whispering) I'm (dis?) remembering it right now, but I'm actually the log for the family, but I can't remember her name right now.
Speaker 1: What about your grandmother (buzzer)?
Speaker 2: I think that's gonna work too.  Wait, why am I drawing blanks all of a sudden?  Okay,--
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get back to that?
Speaker 2: Tessie.
Speaker 1: Okay. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: So, let's talk about the stories that are passed down on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 1: The types of stories, they're usually related to, well, for my great grandfather, there was a fairly large family.  And my grandmother was the, was one of three, one of three sisters in there and I think there were four brothers associated with it.  And they basically lived in (Natchitoches?), Louisiana, and they actually--I believe because of my great grandfather, they actually ended up with a fair amount of property available to them.  And so most of the stories are surrounding the life on that, in that area.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you know whether they were slave or free?
Speaker 1: Free, they were free.
Speaker 2: And can you relate any of those stories?  Do you remember any of them?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, well, I had a great uncle, I had--I remember two uncles.  One was Uncle Mike who we actually went to visit quite frequently.  And since my mother was an only child and her--and my grandmother passed at forty [years old], we went and visited that, them quite frequently, and as well as my other Aunt (Dora?) who actually was in California.  So they were quite a colorful group of people.  I had one uncle, I believe his name was Johnny, great Uncle Johnny, and he was known for his lack of industriousness (laughter).  And my mother keeps telling the story that he would actually--he was so lazy, he would break off pieces of his house to burn for firewood instead of going out to get firewood.  So there are, yeah, and there are quite a few colorful people like that.  But normally they were farming individuals for the most part.
Speaker 2: Do you remember your mother's father?
Speaker 1: Actually, no, I remember my mother's stepfather.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that they were actually in Shreveport, Louisiana, and he did a lot of piping work for the oil wells and stuff.
Speaker 2: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: Arlander.
Speaker 2: Could you spell that?
Speaker 1: A-R-L-A-N-D-E-R.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: His last name?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was Davis.
Speaker 2: Davis?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, right, so he--actually, he came and stayed with us for a while.  He got into some trouble himself with some piping stuff, and once he got out of jail, he came and stayed with us until he passed.
Story_ID: 30130
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what do you remember about your mother [Helen Augusta Kennedy]?
Speaker 2: Everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: She is a, she's clearly a very special person, and she's a person that doesn't have a problem speaking her mind and telling you what she thinks and how she feels about things.  She's a very caring person for the individuals that she's close to.  And she's very bright in terms of knowing what she wants to do. [buzzer]  I don't know if that's a test or not.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did because, as I said, her mother passed away when she was an early age.  So she actually lived with my Aunt (Doris?).  So she would tell stories about, well, the fact that she didn't cook and that, being an only child, her mother did a lot of cooking with her.  And she did spend a lot of time with my aunt.  And she would talk about her childhood because in that time, she actually had to work as a teenager with my aunt to clean out buildings and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: What kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: What kind of person is she?  She is my mother (laughter).  She's a, she's a very strong-willed person, but she's very compromising as well.  She's do what's required for her to get what she thinks needs to be done, get done.
Story_ID: 30131
Speaker 1: Let's now talk about your father.  Would you state his name, date of birth and place of birth if you know it?
Speaker 2: Okay, Amos Paul Kennedy, A-M-O-S, P-A-U-L, K-E-N-N-E-D-Y.  His date of birth is gonna be September 7th, 1925, and he was born in Rocky Mount, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And how far back can you go back on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I guess that would be my great grandfather, is that right?  Yeah, my great grandfather actually was alive when I was--we used to go visit him when we were younger.
Speaker 1: Would you give us his name?
Speaker 2: Ooh, that I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanna say Mr. Mike, is what we referred to him as.
Speaker 1: All right.  What about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was Mr. Frank, Frank Kennedy.  I don't know what his middle name was.
Speaker 1: Do you remember stories that would be passed down from your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were some stories on my father's side of the family (laughter).  I mean we used to go up, quite frequently when we were young to Rocky Mount and visit and especially during festive seasons like July, Fourth of July and things of that nature.  And as far as, yeah, there have been some stories associated with that side of the family as well.  I'm trying to remember one that they probably would tell.  Well, the one that my father always talks about is his (buzzer)--he and his brother working in the fields and that he would always want to try to impress his mother by picking more, whatever it was, more cotton or more peas than she would.  And one day he slipped up and said, mom, I picked a whole row more than you have.  And she looked at him and said, "Pick, Amos, pick." (laughter).  So he always sort of referring back to some of the things that helped make him what he was.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Let's see, he's a very determined man.  I'd say he can be quite stubborn at times, and that comes with the deterministic.  And he has exceptional work ethic and highly motivated.
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up? (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: Do you remember how your parents met?
Speaker 1: They met in college at the Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: And what was--did they both graduate from college?
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, my father had come back from Korea and had gotten the veterans loan to go back to school, and then my mother was in school at the same time there.  He got his degree in animal husbandry and she got her bachelor's degree in business.
Story_ID: 30132
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk about your father [Amos Paul Kennedy].  What was his occupation?
Speaker 2: You mean most recently?  Well, his most, his long-term occupation was a professor, a faculty member.  He originally started off in animal husbandry and in the ag [agriculture] department and he's worked at several--as a matter of fact, he worked here at Morgan State [University] for a while.  And over at--it used to be called Princess Anne, but it's the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland].  And then he went to Grambling [State] University [Grambling, Louisiana] where he was again in the agriculture department.  And after a while there, he was offered the opportunity to become chair of chemistry because he had a minor in chemistry, but he didn't have a degree.  So he packed us all up.  And we went to Michigan, and he finished his degree in chemistry.  And then he came back and was chair of the Department of Chemistry for, oh, about fifteen years or so.  And then from there he became dean at Grambling [State University].
Speaker 1: Was he the first in his family to go to college?  Was your father the first in his family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, he was, yeah, he was.  And at that--my mother [Helen Augusta Kennedy] and father were the first in their families to go.  Okay, so, but, yeah, so he got his, he got his Ph.D. actually in animal husbandry at Michigan State University.  That's where I was born in Lansing, Michigan.  And then from there, he went on to start trying to teach.  That was his fall-back position because actually he really wanted to go to medical school.  But at the time, his complexion was too dark for acceptance into medical school.  So I think while he was at Howard [University, Washington D.C.], someone had recommended he consider getting a Ph.D. degree.
Speaker 1: And your mother's occupation?
Speaker 2: She is an account professor, but she was a housewife for, oh, she was a housewife for almost all of her life until I reached seventeen [years old].  And when I got seventeen, she decided she wanted to go back to school.  And I, of course, thought she was abandoning me, but (laughter) she felt that she needed to further her education.  So she went and got a, she went and got her master's in business, and then she eventually got her Ph.D. in accounting at the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma].  And then she went from there to start to teach at Grambling [State University] and then to teach ad North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in the accounting department.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your parents talk about their early life growing up and their ambition to go to college?
Speaker 2: They talk about their early life, but there was not necessarily ambitions to go to college.  I think those things sort of (buzzer), the opportunity--the opportunities presented themselves and they took advantage of them when they came along.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about their experience while they were getting their education, obstacles that were placed in their way, those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, with my father it turns out, even though he had some funding from the veterans loan, he actually was--I forgot what they call them, but he actually sold zoot suits as part of his supplementation of his income to help pay for his education.  And how would I put that?  He wasn't exactly conformant (laughter) with many of the things that were expected in class.  So he, I think to a certain extent, he was considered more of a troublemaker as far as the class disruptions were concerned.
Speaker 1: You said your father was a veteran?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What branch of service was he in?
Speaker 2: He was in the army [United States Army] and worked in the medical corp.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about that experience at all?
Speaker 2: A little bit but not very much.  He normally just talked about that in reference to some of the things that he, some of things that he had experienced, but in general, it really didn't get mentioned that often.  Most of the talk concerned college life and life before the military.
Story_ID: 30133
Speaker 1: In terms of the value of education in your family, how would you describe it?
Speaker 2: Exceptionally high.  It's always been, it's always been understood that you are either expected to go to college or get out the house.  Those were the options that were made available to you.  I was, for whatever reason, motivated to go on for advance degree, even when I was ten or eleven years old.  So it was always something that was gonna happen.
Speaker 1: Did you think you had an option?
Speaker 2: I really didn't think of it as an option.  It was just what I wanted to do.  As a matter of fact, I guess when I was eleven or twelve, my real aspiration was to have two degrees at some point; didn't make that one, but one's enough.
Story_ID: 30134
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your father [Amos Paul Kennedy] and you described him as a troublemaker.  What did you mean by that? (buzzer)
Speaker 2: Well, what I (laughter) meant by that is that he doesn't always accept the norm or when he thinks something is--when he thinks he has a point and something should be done, he'll do it independent of what your view of him is or your opinion at that point.  So it becomes, that's when he becomes very deterministic and it doesn't matter what you think or say at that point.
Speaker 1: What kind of trouble do you think he got into because of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure (laughter) he got into more trouble than he's told me about, but normally, I think what I'm referring to are more events that occurred in academia where he had confrontations with various administrators about decisions that were being made, how funds were being spent, things of that nature.  Actually, it turns out he helped develop one of the first semester programs for science students.  He was instrumental in the development of the Brookhaven National Laboratories Coop Program.  And in doing that, he had to coordinate a lot of activities with different universities.  And it turned out that the Grambling [State University], there was a lot of tension about the fact that there was that opportunity made available, and obviously, administrators would like to get their fair share of the funding or their (buzzer), what they claim is their fair share of the funding, and so that led to what I would call more of the troublemaking situations. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):  When you hear that thing go off, just stop.
Speaker 1: Right, so the administrators wanted their fair share of the funding, and obviously, he felt that that funding should be used for other resources.  And that creates situations where he can get in trouble with people.
Story_ID: 30135
Speaker 1: Can you share with us some memories of your growing up and being in that household?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, sharing memories of growing up at our household.  I think in general, we were--we had tasks that we were expected to do.  And obviously, if they didn't get done, there were repercussions associated with it.  I tended to think that we, at least I behaved on a fairly reasonable basis (laughter).  I don't think my parents [Amos Paul Kennedy and Helen Augusta Kennedy] agreed with that 100 percent.  For the most part, we were extremely active outdoors in terms of basically going out and playing with whatever we had, dump trucks or whatever and riding bikes, playing ball.  So I mean it was a fairly standard, I think, childhood as far as that's concerned.  The--it turns out that Grambling [Louisiana] is an extremely unique environment because it has a university there.  But it's a small town at the same time, so it sort of comes off as suburban area (buzzer).  It sort of comes off as a suburban area in a rural environment.  So even though we were, even though we were separated, we still enjoyed a very normal lifestyle as far as that's concerned.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up, is, was that that?  My earliest memory of growing is actually from Maryland and Princess Anne [Maryland].  I just remember we were in some old house and for some reason, I was following my brother somewhere and we, I fell off into one of these little lakes, I mean a little river or stream.  And that was not (unclear).  That was pretty terrifying to say the least.  That's probably my, the memory I remember foremost in the earliest phases.
Story_ID: 30136
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your siblings, their order of birth and their dates?
Speaker 2: I have three brothers and a sister.  My oldest brother is Arlander Kennedy and--
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: A-R-L-A-N-D-E-R, Paul, P-A-U-L, K-E-N-N-E-D-Y.  And he was born July 11th and let me see here, (whispering) so yeah, that would be July 11th, 194- yeah 1942.  And then I have a sister, comes next, Gloria Marie Kennedy, G-L-O-R-I-A, M-A-R-I-E, K-E-N-N-E-D-Y, and she was born on October 10th, 1940, no, I'm sorry, 1945.  And then I have Amos, Jr. and he was born (buzzer), and he was born August 24th-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Say his name again.
Speaker 2: Oh, Amos, Jr..  He was born August 24th, 1948, and then I have my brother next to me which is Alan Paul, and he was born August 13th, 1953.
Story_ID: 30137
Speaker 1: Okay, you were talking about your siblings.  What was a-- where did you fit in the birth order?
Speaker 2: I was the last child.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the street that you lived on in Grambling [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Right, the street that I lived on used to be called Grand Avenue.  It's now Martin Luther King Boulevard, I think.  It's near the edge of town, just to try to explain to you.  There was Grambling, the city of Grambling, and most of that was the university [Grambling State University].  And then everything stretched out from the university.  And then five miles down the road was Ruston [Louisiana], which actually has Louisiana Tech University.  And that, of course, was the predominantly white university as well as town.  And so we lived on the edge of town, on the edge of Grambling so to speak, in between the Grambling and Ruston area.
Speaker 1: How did Grambling get its name?
Speaker 2: Grambling got its name--well, I've forgotten who the gentleman was, but originally there was the--it wasn't a university.  It was a technical trade school is what it started off as.  And I've forgotten who the gentleman now is, but it was named after an individual in that area that had, I think, donated the land to the state for the formation of the university.
Speaker 1: Was he a black person [observer speaking]?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Was he a black person?  I'm sorry [observer speaking].
Speaker 2: No, he was white.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about your neighbors where you lived?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had, let's see, right.  My immediate neighbors had, had siblings the same age as I was so actually, I had two best friends, so to speak, one on one side and one on the other.  Both of them were my age, and the Earls which was on one of us had a boy and a girl, where the boy was the older.  And then the, back behind us were the Blakes which actually had seven children.  And they had two boys.  One was the age of my second to me brother and the other one was my age.  And, actually, that was my best friend.  We got along really well.  And then down the s- --one block, one house over, with the Fergusons which had about eight children.  And then across the street were the Floyds who only had two children, and one boy was a little younger than I was.  And so it was a pretty close knit community.
Speaker 1: Was your community integrated or segregated?
Speaker 2: No, it was segregated.  We, let's see, we only, the only Whites there were there to teach.  And that was only a handful.
Speaker 1: Talk about the sights and sounds, the smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: The thing that stands out the most was the heat.  There was literally, the blacktop road where the index refraction would change so much, it looked like it was melting.  I mean that was, that was one of the things that stuck in most often because if you, because we were there pre air conditioning.  And so when you got into a car in the middle of summer, there was, you were gasping for air like a fish on a beach.  And you rolled down the windows and the heat would just hit you even more.  In the evenings, you didn't sleep--I have that problem with my wife [Sharon Kennedy] now.  I don't, didn't sleep with any covers or anything because it was just too hot.  I mean that was the thing that sort of stuck out most as far as that environment so to speak.
Story_ID: 30138
Speaker 1: Let's see, most of the stuff was--well, it turns out that the, all of the school systems, the elementary and high school systems were run by the university [Grambling State University].  And so we were actually a laboratory school.  So we actually got an extremely good education which was sort of, I won't say it's unusual, but people felt it was unusual because there was always the notion that, especially in the south in Louisiana, that there was this separate and unequal concept of education.  And for us, it really wasn't the case.  We actually had a far better education than many of the major white institutions.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 1: Then it was just Grambling Laboratory School [Grambling, Louisiana], but now it's, I think it's Alma J. Brown Elementary School is the name of it.
Speaker 2: And about how large was it?
Speaker 1: I think it was about, maybe three hundred students, something like that.  Again, it was servicing, it basically serviced all the staff and faculty of the university for the most part.
Speaker 2: Would you describe your early school experience?
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  My early school experience.  Okay, so I went to, actually, I went to pre-school and to kindergarten.  And those were both enjoyable.  Nothing outstanding there.  I went to first grade, yeah, okay.  I went to first grade and second grade there, and then in the, yeah, in the third grade actually, it turns out that's when my father [Amos Paul Kennedy] went back to Michigan State [University, Lansing, Michigan] to finish his degree in chemistry.  And the interesting thing there was that when I got to their laboratory school, it turns out that they were doing, they were just doing three and four-digit addition which we had done the year before.  So it turns out that I was fairly bored throughout the course, throughout class.  And that didn't work out very well cause I was, I think one of two black students at the school.  And that was my first time actually being in a white environment.  So it was, it was a lot to take up at one time.  And so I had a tendency to get put in detention from time to time.  The teacher just got tired of calling on me.  I'd sit in the front of the room with my hand up all the time.  And it was like, is there anybody else wanna answer.  So there was a stigma associated with me at a certain point.  But it was primarily due to boredom because I just--we had done everything they had done.  And I was waiting for the next thing.  And the funny thing though is when I came back to Grambling, when I got back, they had learned all their multiplication tables, and I was like, what?  I don't even know how to multiply (laughter), you know.  So I felt like I was behind and out of touch because, you know, it was such a--it was really an eye opening experience for me because it was really to the point where you knew that this, there was a misconception, that there are these disparities in education.  And there are some in some institutions, but in our case, there was none.  So actually, when we came back, several years later, they started trying to, they started with the integration where they were gonna bus people from Grambling to Ruston.  And many of us just didn't even wanna go.  It was, we didn't see the advantage to it at all.
Speaker 2: Do you recall your parents' reaction?
Speaker 1: They were supportive.  They were supportive, they--my parents were supportive.  There were a lot of parents in Grambling that did want their kids to go to the, bus to the white schools.  But ours was extremely supportive because they didn't see, they didn't see where the value (unclear) was.  I mean we were getting a good education.  That was the bottom line.
Story_ID: 30139
Speaker 1: How long were you in Michigan?
Speaker 2: Just a year.
Speaker 1: Just a year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just one year.
Speaker 1: Are there any other special memories of your experience there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, like I said, coming from Grambling [Louisiana], I mean one of the things about Grambling being a black town is that you get to understand that the differences in people have nothing to do with color.  So you can dislike--black people can dislike black people (laughter) and it has nothing to do with your color, okay.  Or you can segregate against people just because of other reasons alone.  And it wasn't until I got to Michigan that I actually, I mean we saw racism when we went to Ruston [Louisiana], but that was because we knew we were going to Ruston.  So that was the white town and so, you know, you're very careful about what you try to do and say.  But in Michigan, we were seeing the racism firsthand.  And so, I mean there was the typical stuff of kids picking on you going to school, walking to school.  Hey, blah, blah, blah, and it, you know, you got to the point where there was some violence required in order to just make it clear that you just can't do that to me, you know.  So, but that was my first time actually, I mean like I said, we'd seen it, but we didn't have to live in it which is a different situation when you can go home and it's out there someplace else.
Speaker 1: You stay in Michigan.  What about your teacher there?
Speaker 2: It was a nice enough person.  She was a nice enough person.  I can't remember her name right now.  But I don't think--well, because I was primarily bored, she had a problem with that, and she really felt that it was a discipline issue, that I needed to be disciplined.  So like I said, I ended up in detention quite a bit for, actually, for speaking out, just calling out answers and stuff cause I got tired of the kids not responding.  And so, it was like, no, you can't talk out in class like that.  So go back to the back room and sit down, you know.  And so there was a stigma associated with that as well.  And it's, I mean there were a lot of events that, just little things that occurred, you know, as little kids do things, like all the kids would hide right before school because if a girl touched the door, that's, you'd get cooties.  So all the kids would hide and wait for me to come to school to touch the door, and then well, Alvin's got the cooties.  You know, and it, it was just those things that sort of piled up, and it was like why am I always--and I had another problem that my name was Kennedy.  And it turned out that that was the year that President [John F.] Kennedy died [1963].  And so there was all of those issues associated with that as well.  So it was a lot of, a lot of things that were enlightening to me that I just hadn't experienced before.
Story_ID: 30140
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Grambling [Louisiana].  Are there special teachers there at the elementary school [Grambling Laboratory School] that stand out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, there were.  Ms. Turner, it was my fifth grade teacher.  And I think that was when I first started, that's when I first started accepting the fact that I could do math.  I mean I, and I realized that I was good at it and didn't--it wasn't a stigma associated with it.  It was sort of, it was actually fun to a large extent.  And so I think she was the one that really enabled me in terms of just being able to just recognize that I can do math and I was good at it.
Speaker 1: Is this also when you develop an interest in science?
Speaker 2: My interest in science?  I think I've always had an interest in science to a certain extent.  I've always been interested in fundamental questions, you know, the why am I here, what's going on type of thing?  So I've always had that interest in general.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your earliest recollection about science?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, actually, I do.  It turns out that we used to go to my father's [Amos Paul Kennedy] office after church.  And there, he actually had a chemical model set.  And so that's when I first started putting models together, seeing what a water molecule was, what a methane molecule was.  And it was pretty cool to be able to, but, you know, nobody had things to play with other than Tonka toys or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now, of the friends that you had at that stage, did most of them have parents who were educated like yours or were you unique in that respect?
Speaker 2: No, most of them were at the, educated.  My best friend's father was actually a graphics artist.  So he's a printer.  So he did not have an advanced degree, but he was in the arts themselves.  But, yeah, most of the, my friends had, their parents usually taught or else they at least had a college education.
Speaker 1: Do you recall having a discussion about science with your father [Amos Paul Kennedy]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and like I said, when we, we used to do the modeling things and stuff like that.  A lot of my discussion, more of my discussions with my father were, have always been more of a philosophical nature as opposed to a scientific nature.
Story_ID: 30141
Speaker 1: Okay, you now leave elementary school [Grambling Laboratory School, Grambling, Louisiana] to go to high school.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: It was Grambling High School.
Speaker 1: Grambling High School.  And do you remember things that were unique about Grambling High School?
Speaker 2: Again, I don't know if there was anything that was particularly unique.  Well, actually for the junior high school, my principal was actually the most influential, a very influential person, and he was the one that sort of exposed me to some scientific concepts and intrigued me about some things.  So that was probably the first time that I really had some science in terms of coursework.  Let me put it like that.  Everything else prior to that had normally been mathematics.  But as far as the school is concerned, as I said, there wasn't anything very unique about it.  One of the things that I do remember that always stuck with me is that we always took these PSAT [Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test] exams.  Even in ninth and tenth grade we were taking PSAT exams.  And I just remember that we would just come and take the exam.  There was nothing, there was no preparation.  There was no study or anythings like this.  It's like the PSAT exam is gonna be on Sat--on Friday at such and such a time.  And so we would just come and take it.  And we would always do well on it.  I mean we would score in the upper 80 and 90 percentiles nationwide on it, and--but we never thought of it--it wasn't a big deal.  It was just something that we did, you know.  And I just think now back, you know, now, you know, you gotta take all these preparations to get ready to take the exams, and it's all this big deal.  And we always thought of it as just testing to see what we know at that point.
Speaker 1: Now, if you look back at your elementary and high school, are they still of the same nature today that they were back when you were there?
Speaker 2: They're still there.  Let me put it like that.  I'm not sure about what the--well, as a matter of fact, there're now, they've now been classified as a magnet school.  So now anyone, just anyone can't just go to it at this point.  So it has been, has changed in that regard.  But I really couldn't speak about the content and the teaching in relationship to what we had, were exposed to.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first science fair project?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was the appendici- appendix.  It was the small intestine--small and large intestines.  Basically, I had, about two or three years before that, I had severe appendicitis, and that sort of was what I had based it on.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have discussions with your family doctor about science?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were in high school, what did you think you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to get a PhD. in, I think at that time, it was in mathematics.
Speaker 1: And did you know where you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I just knew that, when I was in high school, I just knew I wanted to go to Grambling [State University] for my undergraduate, which again is another interesting thing because at that point in time, we were very heavily recruited by schools from the North to come for their undergraduate programs.  And I didn't even think twice about it.
Story_ID: 30142
Speaker 1: So you went to Grambling [State University, Grambling Louisiana] and got an undergraduate?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Describe what it was like being at Grambling [State University] with your father [Amos Paul Kennedy] on the faculty?
Speaker 2: Well, it actually turned out to be pretty good (laughter) for the most part.  The reason I say that is because I actually took courses prior to graduation.  I actually could have gone to college in my senior year in high school.  But I didn't wanna miss the prom so I opted to stay another year.  But the point was, during that time I was on the basketball team, and these guys had these cars.  And I was like, man, I could, really, I'd love to get a car.  And they were like, well, all you gotta do is come out with us and pick some peaches cause that's how we get the money to buy our cars, is pick peaches.  And I was like, okay, I can probably do that.  So we had to get up at like four o'clock in the morning and drive out to this place and you'd get this little bucket and there were a lot of elderly people there with these little buckets and stuff.  And you had to fill them up, and the bucket was like five cents or something.  And I just remember when I got there, and it was hot and I was hungry, and so I went to the top of the peach tree and got some of the really good peaches (laughter) and just, you know, had breakfast and stuff.  And so we started filling the thing up, and after about the third or fourth day, I was like, you know, this really isn't working.  I mean I'm (laughter), this is not for me.  So it turns out that my father had an intern job in his office that he went on and offered it to me.  And I was like, okay, air conditioning.  I can do this.  So I went up to the foreman, and I was like, "look, I need to talk to you."  He was like, "yeah, I need to talk to you too."  He's like, "you're fired."  I said, "no, I quit" (laughter).  I don't wanna have anything else to do with it.  So that was one of the perks cause I did get the chance to work in the office and that was, that actually helped out quite a bit.  So, essentially what happened from there is that he had already developed this Brookhaven Semester Program, but as most programs do, they only take students in their junior and senior years.  Well, I actually was a rising sophomore, and I applied for the program anyway.  And, of course, my father turned me down, but they had a, my mother [Helen Augusta Kennedy] and father had a bedroom meeting, and it turned out the next week I was accepted into the program.
Speaker 1: Now, was this while you were still in high school or were you in college?
Speaker 2: This is college, yeah, this in college, right.  So this was my first experience away from--I mean that was my experience for, to do research actually.  So that was, that was very, very influential.
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was working on, I was working in the physical chemistry department at that time.  And we were looking at, I believe we were looking at the harpooning mechanism for electron transfer.  And it turns out, I didn't realize this until later, it turns out we actually got a paper out the work that I had done that summer.
Speaker 1: About what year was this?
Speaker 2: That should have been about '75 [1975] or something like that, I believe, yes, (unclear) '75 [1975].
Story_ID: 30143
Speaker 1: Let me go back to something you said previously, you played basketball, you said.  Was it a varsity team?  Could you describe that experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, okay, I did junior high and I did varsity.  That was an interesting situation as well.  I did, I started in junior high and then what happened was, was that because of my interactions with the, with the other players and my knowledge of the game, I actually turned out being the assistant coach.  So when I was, when I went to play varsity, I really didn't even play varsity.  I actually didn't even suit up.  I would just sit on the bench and we would, we would coach the game basically, is what it came down to.  It was kind of interesting cause we got to the point where, you know, I was still young and a lot stupid and thinking I knew everything.  So it got to the point where the coach really just got pissed and he just walked off.  He literally just left the stadium, and I just started coaching the team.  And it was, we had some issues after that, but it was interesting that we had gotten to that point.
Speaker 1: Describe that experience.
Speaker 2: Well, You mean the experience of the coaching?
Speaker 1: Yeah, of coaching, yes.
Speaker 2: It was, well, I think the thing was that I had such a strong interaction with the players, the guys because they were all my friends and stuff.  And they, they responded to me.  And so when things needed to get done, I could approach them and know what needed to get done.  I knew who the troublemakers were, who were the problem areas and who would actually do what needed to be done at the right point in time.  And so I actually, you know, studied to a certain extent, other teams.  We went to scout teams and things of that nature.  And so I did get to understand the nature of the game, and I think it was the fact that I was able to motivate the students, the players that was actually the important part.  And, but it turns out that after that game I was actually kicked off the basketball team and they were going to state at that point in time.  And they didn't wanna play.  And so I still had to step again, and sort of say, look, you know, this is not about me.  You need to, if you can win state, you gotta win state.  And so it was--but now the coach and I, we get along just fine.  We don't have any issues.
Story_ID: 30144
Speaker 1: Now, was it the research experience that you had that tipped the scale toward chemistry for you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What tipped the scale to chemistry was my father [Amos Paul Kennedy] didn't have any majors and he drafted me (laughter).  I was originally gonna go into business (laughter), or that's what I thought I was gonna do.  I thought I was gonna go into business.  And then actually, when I got into chemistry, I realized that I actually enjoyed physics and math just as much.  So I took a double minor in physics and math as well.  And, but it was the research exper--it has always been the research experience and exposure that has really sparked my interests in pursuing a career.
Speaker 1: Okay, other than your father, were there faculty at Grambling [State University, Grambling Louisiana] that had a significant influence upon you?
Speaker 2: Yes, his name was Dr. (Kumar?)  Actually, I spoke with him quite a bit because we would have discussions about the big bang theory and the origins of life.  And I found those to be quite stimulating.  So he had a great deal of influence on me in terms of having me understand that the science was, it was more than just the engineering or making things.  There is the fundamental science, asking very fundamental questions about our existence.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you see as the connection between the courses you were taking at Grambling [State University] at the time?
Speaker 2: Actually, I made my own, my own schedule as I went.  So basically, I was doing that primarily to--initially, I was doing it primarily to be able to have the exposure to math and physics.  Eventually, when I decided, when I was certain I was going to graduate school in physical chemistry, I started trying to target courses that I thought would be helpful, especially in the math areas as far as linear algebra and things of that nature were concerned.
Story_ID: 30145
Speaker 1: You mentioned Dr. (Kumar?) as your professor.  Could you tell me something about him?
Speaker 2: He was of Indian descent and he was in, inorganic chemistry.  And he taught me inorganic chemistry and some of the general chemistry.  And that's--but I think the thing was, I was trying to work with him as well during the academic year.  So actually during the academic year, I did work with him in the lab.  So I always had some type of research experience.  So after, basically after my father [Amos Paul Kennedy] hired me to do clerical work in the office, after that I was almost always in someone's laboratory doing something.
Speaker 1: You were at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] during the time that Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones was the president.  Do you have recollections of him?
Speaker 2: Actually, yeah, we were--actually, our family was fairly good friends with the Vice President as well.  And so his influence was, needless to say, extremely strong as far as the direction of the university was concerned.  As a matter of fact, that's sort of how it went from the college in general to a university status was through his leadership.
Story_ID: 30146
Speaker 1: Needless to say, the biggest, the biggest thing for Grambling was the football team.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that was a point of issue with me, needless to say (laughter)--
Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: Because they got all the attention.  They got all the girls.  I mean (laughter), come on.  I mean it was pretty rough when a scrawny little guy tries to talk to a girl and a football player walks up to her.  And it's like, well, what do you do?  Well, I'm a chemistry major.  It's like, oh, okay (laughter).  You know, it's like, okay, you're not gonna get anybody's first-round draft pick.  As a matter of fact, I was, I was in school with--ooph, why am I drawing a blank?  Ooh,--
Speaker 2: Redskin [Washington Redskins football team] quarterback?
Speaker 1: Yes, why am I drawing a blank.
Speaker 2: Doug Williams? [observer speaking]
Speaker 1: Doug Williams, yes.  I don't know why I'm drawing a blank.  Yeah, I was in school with Doug Williams.  And so, yeah, I mean you're just, you're just sitting there behind the sun essentially.  It's like, okay (laughter), you know, what are you gonna do?  So, yeah, there was, there was some--there was some serious tension there.  And, well, the tension actually was between the football team and the band.  But because we were from Grambling [Louisiana], we had a certain different status associated with us.  So we were the Grambling brats.  So we saw the football team and band come and go, so we knew that they didn't count that much (laughter), for the most part.  But, nah, that was the, there was a lot of tension associated with that as far as--and I think it still exists today, that academics just never gets that same level of recognition and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Did you get to know Coach [Edward Gay] Robinson?
Speaker 1: I knew him.  My father [Amos Paul Kennedy] is more familiar with him.  What, one of my best friend's mother was in the physical education department.  So we did get to interact with him.  For the most part, we were able sometimes to go down to the practice sessions and hang out with the guys and things like that.  But my friend actually had more interactions than I did cause he actually saw all of the old greats that came through, Willis and all of them.
Story_ID: 30147
Speaker 1: You grew up at a time when space exploration was popular.  Did that influence you at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, it still does.  I mean the--I think all--I've always felt that one of the more fundamental questions is, are we alone?  And it's always been a question I've wondered how you're gonna have an answer to that.  And there are a couple of ways that can happen.  One of them is that you find a bug and you prove that that bug is actually not from this planet.  The other is that you have some interaction with some other being that's of some type of intellectual value, and then there's some potential spiritual experience that might exist.  So, but from that standpoint, I've always felt that, I've always felt that science and religion shared one thing in common.  And that is, the earth is not gonna be here forever.  So I thought at some point, for human existence, we don't have a choice but to look beyond the planet for our survival.
Speaker 1: Was your family religious?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We went to church.  I think we were more, I think it was more of a discipline thing as opposed to a spiritual thing.  So, yeah, we went to church every week.
Speaker 1: What kind of church did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: It was a Methodist.
Speaker 1: Methodist church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a Methodist church, and the Reverend was quite a person because he would always make sure that the sermon ended before the basketball or football game started (laughter).  So he didn't wanna keep you any longer than he had to.
Speaker 1: Are there any other special recollections that you have from your church experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there's a couple (laughter).  As it turns out that my father [Amos Paul Kennedy] was actually my Sunday school teacher as well.  And so at one point there was this great debate about is God dead?  And so my father was trying to lead the discussion about if God is dead or not.  And I sort of raised my hand and said, "well, if he's dead, what did he die of?"  And my father got real silent (laughter).  And so we, we never did get an answer or discourse on that as well because it was getting into whether he has a physical being and what exactly constitutes death for God.  So that was, that was pretty funny.  And then some of the non-funny things of, I was talking out in church.  And my father says, "you just wait till you get home".  And I knew what that meant.  So when I got home, I was pretty smart so I went on and put on another pair of pants.  Unfortunately, he saw both pair (laughter), and he told me I could keep them on cause it wouldn't matter.  And it didn't (laughter).  He made his point quite well (laughter).
Speaker 1: What did your father use to discipline you?
Speaker 2: My parents [Amos Paul Kennedy and Helen Augusta Kennedy] used the same thing.  They used the electrical extension cord.  It would be now be abuse (laughter).
Story_ID: 30148
Speaker 1: Yes.  Now, you're at this age where your interest in science is really beginning to grow.  And you're also from a religious family.  Did you have conflict with that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have--I personally didn't have any conflicts with it.  I mean I think to a certain extent, I never fully believed all the dogma associated with religion.  I think it has a purpose and it does provide some potential for a person's growth in terms of their spiritual growth is concerned.  But, you know, I've always looked at, to a certain extent, science is a religion as well.  There's a certain level of faith that an individual has to have cause in the end, none of us has seen an electron.  We can calculate what that scintillation is and whether or not that is a particle or how many particles it is.  But technically, we've come no closer to touching or feeling an electron than we have God.  So there's, to me, there's still a certain amount of leap of faith that's necessary for both of them.  And so from my personal standpoint, I never really had any complex associated with it.  I mean there is a certain blind faith I think you have to have and acceptance.  And we, you know, we--my father [Amos Paul Kennedy] and I get into these discussions from time to time about what, you know, how these things happen.  After all, why did God create the devil?  I mean that's, that was his choice, right?  So there had to have been some purpose associated with it.  So in that sense there are things that you have to just believe in if you want to follow, you know, that religious dogma, and they won't lend themselves to logic.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think your approach to this is as a result of growing up in your family with your mother [Helen Augusta Kennedy] and your father both being educated people or did you have those discussions?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I think it is because, because of the family structure, there were things that were made available.  So, you know, we had the encyclopedia.  We had periodicals, 'Time Magazine', 'Ebony', all these things coming in, 'Science Ameri--Scientific America' [sic 'Scientific American']. And so those things were just there as part of the environment.  So, yeah, I think that was an important part of it, yes.
Story_ID: 30149
Speaker 1: Now, as a kid growing up, what kinds of things did you like to do for fun?
Speaker 2: For fun?  As a kid, regular stuff, playing basketball, riding bikes.  I mean that, that was basic--fishing.  That was another fun activity.  Yeah, most of the general stuff.  Actually, when I was getting out of high school, I became quite good at chess, and I used to play it all the time.  As a matter of fact, we had a little magnetic board that we would carry around.  That was our nerd status.  We had our chess board that we carried around with us.  And I used to play all the time, and then one day, my father [Amos Paul Kennedy] came in and he said, "you know, you're not gonna make no money doing that."  I said, "okay" (laughter).  So my interest declined somewhat after that.
Speaker 1: Did you read a lot?
Speaker 2: No, I did not read as much as my brother.  Actually, for a period there, reading was somewhat difficult.  When I was about seven years old, I was following my brother in a dirt fight, and I got struck in the eye.  And I lost the vision in my left eye.  And so it became a little stressful to read from time t-.  But it's gotten over it now.
Story_ID: 30150
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're now graduating from Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  And you make a decision to move on.  What do you decide to do next?
Speaker 2: Those decisions were actually made while I was going through the undergraduate because actually, I took five years to graduate instead of four.  And essentially what happened is, is that I spent a significant amount of time on coops and interns.  So I started off with a coop at Brookhaven National Laboratories [Upton, New York].  I then went and did a summer intern at Dow Well [], which was Dow Chemical's oil business.  And that was when it was booming.  And I did that in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  And I went from there to, (whispering), yeah, I went from there to [The] Dow Chemical [Company] to do a--in Midland, Michigan to do an intern in the dead of winter, which was not thrilling.  But I met one of my most important mentors there.  And then I went to Bell Laboratories [formerly AT&T Bell Laboratories] to do an intern.  Did I get those mixed up?  Right, and I went to Bell Laboratories to do an intern, and I did two summer interns at Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: Now, was this unique for you or was this a experience that, common experience for most of the people who were in your class and did the kinds of things that you did?
Speaker 2: It was unique for me.  The students did go to interns and coops, but they only normally went once or twice.  I spent almost two years, two academic years in coop or intern experiences.  And so I had a chance to see national labs.  I saw industry labs and, of course, I saw the Bell Labs.  And Bell Labs was a very influential experience as well.
Story_ID: 30151
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the Bell Lab experience?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, yeah.  I was there twice.  Both times I was in the physical chemistry area, and the first assignment was associated with a light scattering experience, light scattering and measurements of polymers.  And I'm trying to think of the fellow's name.  I can't remember his name right now.  And that was a really eye opening experience in the sense that when I went to Brookhaven [National Laboratories, Upton, New York], all of the students were from HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], minority institutions.  And when I did the other interns, I was either by myself--I was usually by myself and not anyone else.  This is the first time that I was in an environment with students from everywhere.  Okay, so they were from Howard [University, Washington D.C.] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Stamford [University, Palo Alto, California] and Alabama A and M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University] and Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], and so it was, it was a unique environment that you could see people from all areas, I mean all of the universities in one place.  And I think once again it came to, what came to light was that, coming from Grambling [University, Grambling, Louisiana] was not a handicap for me.  As a matter of fact, it was a strength for me in the sense that I had these experiences that I really don't think I could have got at another institution.
Speaker 1: Do you remember about what year this was when you had this experience?
Speaker 2: These would be '76 [1976] and '77 [1977].  Yeah, and so it really--and again, it was one of those situations where, coming from Grambling, these were still some of the first experiences in a white environment.  So, especially at Bell Labs, it stuck out, not Bell Labs, but New Jersey, it stuck out even more because coming from the South, I had been trained to speak to people even when you went to Ruston [Louisiana] or whatever, if you saw a white person, it didn't matter who it was, you, "hello, how you doing".  You know, that was just courtesy that you do.  You open doors.  That's what you do.  And I just remember when I went to New Jersey, it was, everyone would look at me like I was strange for saying hello, and I'd open the door, and could see the woman grabbing her purse and scurrying inside and stuff.  And it was like, okay, what just happened?  So it was a real, it was a real awakening that, again, because (unclear) a black town, I didn't have that.  If you didn't like me, you just didn't like me.  You didn't [dis]like me because of my color.  It's just you don't like Alvin, and that's fine.  But that was where things, when you're living in it on a daily basis.  Like I said, in Grambling [Louisiana], you'd just go back home and that was the end of that, you know.  Well, I don't go to Ruston till next week some time or whatever.  But--
Speaker 1: How did you come to grips with that?
Speaker 2: I just took it as ignorance on their part.  I mean I didn't, I--it was observation more so than anything else.  It just, it became, you became aware that there was a behavior they expected from you.  And that, you know, that's just what they, that's the caricature of you.  And unfortunately, I didn't fit the caricature.
Story_ID: 30152
Speaker 1: Now, this is now by the time that you go off to graduate school.  How did you decide where to go?  What was that thought process?
Speaker 2: Okay, that thought process.  Basically, I knew I wanted to go into physical chemistry.  And as far as I was concerned, there were only two choices.  There was either [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] or MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I don't tell my students this, but I only applied to two graduate schools, Berkley and MIT.  I got accepted to MIT and I almost started crying cause I was that's too cold.  I can't do this (laughter).  So eventually, I got the call from Berkley.  And I was like, okay, I can do that.  So it was primarily driven by the need to want to be in one of the best physical chemistry departments in the country.
Speaker 1: How did you become aware of those two schools?
Speaker 2: Primarily through my Bell Labs [Murray Hill, New Jersey] experience and exposure there, that we get to talk to the top people in the country.  And those were the choices that they gave--well, I mean they also include the other choices as well, but those were the ones that stood out.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any unique experiences about your graduate experience at Berkley that you would like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, all of it was unique (laughter).  I guess one of the, one of the first experiences that stuck out to me was the selection process.  And you had to select your advisors within like two weeks of being there.  And so we were doing interviews with people, and it turned out that, you know, we went through the standard list of [Dr. Brad] Moore and Lee and a couple other people we interviewed with.  And I'm not sure I--oh, I know what it was.  I talked to Dr. Moore who was in physical chemistry, Brad Moore in physical chemistry, and the next thing I know I was told that George Pimentel was gonna come on campus and that he was gonna be looking for students.  And so I, some kind of way, he had told me that he was coming and that he wanted to talk to me.  And so I remember I went into my classmates, and I was like, "yeah, you know, George Pimentel is coming to town and I'm gonna interview with him."  And they're like, "you're lying."  I said, "no, why would I lie about that."  "He's not here."  I'm like, "yeah, I know he's not here."  And so it was just interesting that they, the dynamics of it because it was like, well, we wanna talk to him too.  I'm like, I don't have anything to do with that.  So anyway, when I met him and we--he was such a personable individual that it was like, that's it.  I'm working with guy.
Speaker 1: Who was George Pimentel and would you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: George Pimentel, G-E-O-R-G-E, P-I-M-E-N-T-E-L.  He was a professor of chemistry at University of [California] Berkeley.  As a matter of fact, he got his undergraduate and his graduate at the University of [California] Berkeley.  And he's part of the, what is it, the Berkeley lineage because I--he presumably traces his education all the way back to Gibbs as far as the lineage of professors that associated with him.  And they, it was interesting because I had chosen to work with him because of the--he was doing chemical lasers research at the time.  And I had chosen to work with him because of the physical chemistry background associated with it.  What I didn't find out until later, which piqued my interest even more was that he had been instrumental in the first quest for life on Mars which it's always piqued my interest in the first place.  So I always thought that that was a special event that, to be able to have known someone who had actually made the experimental set up to measure or to test for life in, on another planet.

Speaker 1: Okay, we've been talking about physical chemistry.  What is physical chemistry, and what makes it unique?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I think the--what's interesting to me is that it is the real integration of math and physics into chemical principles.  I mean this is--and this is where our students always have the problem.  And I keep telling people, you can do an integration, and you can do a derivative.  And as long as it's just A's and B's and C's, a lot of people can do it.  But as soon as you start putting a physical perimeter in there, a variable in there, as soon as you put temperature in there or pressure, and it takes on a realism, for some reason, it's hard to make that leap from just numbers to reality.  And so, I mean a physical thing.  And so I think it's the combination of those things that have always intrigued me and I really think that's the basis for the, for physical chemistry, is that integration of all three co- sciences to find out some fundamental questions.
Story_ID: 30154
Speaker 1: Were there any difficulties that you had while you were at Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We, I was jokingly referred to as the president of the black chemists, black Berkeley chemists association, and we could hold our meetings in the broom closet cause it was only me (laughter), okay.  And it turns out that, I think two years later another black male was accepted into the program.  And I said, "wow, we've done excellent with recruitment.  We've increased it by a hundred percent" (laughter).  So, there were those situations, but it was difficult because studying was difficult because we didn't--I had people who, I only had a few people that studied with me.  And I remember quite clearly, especially for thermodynamics, we were studying for the thermodynamics exam, and Pitzer, Professor Pitzer was teaching it, and he had been teaching--
Speaker 1: Could you spell that name for me?
Speaker 2: P-I-T-Z-E-R.  And he had been teaching this for, like since thermodynamics was formed.  And so, so I walked into the study hall one night.  And all of a sudden, all of the other students are there, and all of a sudden, I see all this scurrying of papers and stuff.  And I was like, okay.  I was coming to study, and then they'd get quiet and stuff.  It gets uncomfortable so I leave.  It turns out that they had all his exams.  And so, you know, here I am struggling to study as best I can, and they're sitting up here with all the exams for the past ten years in front of them.  So it was, it was not good.  It was not good.  As a matter of fact, they always questioned me.  They were like, well, you know, I graduated from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or I graduated from Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], and where is Grambling [University, Grambling, Louisiana] and why are you here?  You know, it was like, okay, whatever, fella.  But I remember, though, we were taking quantum mechanics.  And we called that Bill's quantum mechanics because the instructor was a very unique person.  And I don't, I just recall I was struggling with it.  And I went to him, and I said, "you know, I have no clue of what you're talking about at all."  He said, "you're better off than most people."  I said, why?  He says, "because they think they know (laughter).  At least you know you don't know."  And it was quite funny because he was introducing these concepts of bras and kets [standard quantum state notation] which they didn't know either.  But because I wasn't handicapped with this other stuff as far as just the regular (unclear) and equations and stuff is concerned, it was more easy for me to develop those concepts and understand them.  And so it got to be quite funny because when we--I did have a little study group, and then, you know, we'd be solving problems and stuff.  And it finally, you know, we got out, and I remember the guy who was with me, he used to study with me all the time.  We had just finished our first semester, and he came up and it was like, "wow, I did it."  I said, "what?"  He said, "I made the first semester at Berkley."  I said, "yeah, yeah, that's great."  And he said, "well, I'm done."  I said, "done?"  He said, "yeah, I proved that I could do it."  I said, "man, you haven't proved anything.  It's not until you get the degree that you prove anything" (laughter).  But it was so funny cause he thought that that was it, that he just had to prove that he could make one semester at Berkeley, and that life was good after that.  So, and I used to say I lost my study partner after that, but I became quite acquainted with the library.  And that's where I spent most of my time.
Speaker 1: So how did you go about finding study partners?
Speaker 2: That was really haphazard.  And to be quite honest with you, at the end of the day, it was usually just me and maybe one or two others.  My group members helped me out quite a bit in terms of providing me with resources and at least helping me with some of the more difficult problems.
Speaker 1: And who were these group members?
Speaker 2: Ooh--
Speaker 1: I mean not their names, but in terms of--
Speaker 2: Oh, they were part of the [Dr. George] Pimentel group--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, in our research lab.  Okay, and so, and that was one of the reasons, again, that I was attracted to [University of California] Berkeley as well because it was focused on research.  It was not trying, worried about--it wasn't, as a matter of fact, the thing I remember most about [Dr. George] Pimentel is I told him once I wanted to go take some classes in physics, in quantum mechanics so I could understand it better.  And he was like, "you don't have to take any classes.  That's what the library is for.  You're here to do research."  I was like, "okay.  I think I got this now."
Story_ID: 30155
Speaker 1: Okay, you were talking about your advisor, [George] Pimentel and his telling you to, that's what the library was for.
Speaker 2: Right, right, so basically, it was if you wanna learn something, you go ask somebody or you read about it.  You don't have to go take a class to learn something was what it came down to.  And that was a really important lesson.
Speaker 1: So in terms of this lesson of learning how to learn and staying in graduate school, when did that really sink with you?
Speaker 2: I think the very first, the very first year as a matter of fact because things in undergraduate were so easy that it really didn't require a lot of effort.  I mean it really was like not hard and it--that's when I began to realize that you really need to understand stuff.  I mean that, I've always--I think I always was able to capture things quickly.  But I never really understood them.  So I can give it back to you to a certain extent, but if you really ask me how the wheels turn, I couldn't tell you.  And it wasn't until then that I realized that you really have to understand the concepts fully.  And you just have to go over and over again until--as a matter of fact, when we were talking about the quantum mechanics, I went back to [Paul] Dirac's original book and just, it was perfectly laid out.  I mean it wasn't all the jargon or anything.  It was beautifully laid out.  It was right there.  This is what a bra is, this is what a ket is.  These are the space that you deal with.  I mean it was just right there.  You didn't have to, you didn't have--it was understa- completely understandable and comprehensible.
Story_ID: 30156
Speaker 1: What was your research about, your graduate research to obtain your PhD?
Speaker 2: It was development of chemical lasers.  We actually were looking at the kinetics associated with very spontaneous reactions, especially in terms of elimination reactions from hydrogen fluorides.
Speaker 1: Okay, did that work have any special implication for the public at large?
Speaker 2: Its motivation was initially for, well, the funding was for, I think more of a defense related in terms of development of the chemical laser systems in general.  Where we were hoping to go was, and the original motivation was for selective laser chemistry.  That's what their, the holy grail was at the very beginning and developing tools that allow you to do that.
Speaker 1: Who funded your research and who funded your basic graduate education [at the University of California, Berkeley]?
Speaker 2: My graduate education, actually, I was a Bell Labs fellow. So my graduate education was actually paid through, by Bell Labs [Murray Hill, New Jersey], which was a problem as well because you were required to teach at least two semesters.  And because of the stipend I had, they didn't wanna pay me to teach.  So that became a problem because I had quite an attitude about having to teach and students were obviously quite aware of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you become a Bell Labs fellow?
Speaker 2: Actually, from the two years that I had been at Bell Labs during the summers, that put me in a position to actually be able to compete and I think what really took it over the top for me was that by the time I was a senior [in college], I had, I had three publications.  And even today, I tell my students, it's rare for an undergraduate to come out with publications.  And when you do, that trumps whatever your GPA [grade point average] is?
Speaker 1: What was your first publication about?
Speaker 2: The first publication was from the Brookhaven National Labs [Upton, New York] on the, actually, it was looking at the work functions in various metal systems, surfaces.
Speaker 1: Was Anthony Johnson at Bell Labs with you or was he gone by then?
Speaker 2: I think he was gone by then.  I think he was gone by then (unclear).
Story_ID: 30157
Speaker 1: I'm getting ready to move on to your graduation from [University of California ]Berkeley, the PhD, but before we do that, are there any other things about that period of time that you want to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, the funniest for me or the most enlightening, almost, well, two enlightening was, one of them was the, my final exam in quantum mechanics.  And on the final exam in quantum mechanics, it was open everything.  And we had five days to do it, sweated bullets day and night.  So I finally took the exam to the guy, and I was like, I just, I did the best I can, but there's a lot of blanks here.  He said, "I didn't make that exam for anybody to pass it."  I said, "what?"  He said, "no, I made it to check people's ego."  I said, "well, you certainly did that sir" (laughter).  The other thing was in a discussion with my advisor about some results I had gotten in the lab.  And we were throwing ideas around, and I've forgotten exactly what it was.  But he put up on the board what I thought was the stupidest thing in the world.  And he just put it up there just as casually as possible.  And I was like, "George, that doesn't make any sense", and I started laughing because I realized at that point that we were doing work that no one else did.  And that no one knows what the answer is at that point.  And it was--that's one of the things that I look for now in my students today is, when they realize that I'm not the oracle, that I don't know this thing either and that now we're sharing our ignorance in trying to figure out how to get to the next level.
Speaker 1: When did that first hit you, that realization that you could talk with the big boys?
Speaker 2: That was that.  That was the point.  That was when I, it was like okay.  You know, there's no intimidation.  This is strictly, we're just out here on our own.  And so that was the one that, where--I mean there were other events that, you know, keyed me in.  Like I said, throughout the years, I knew that my education was equivalent if not better than most people's education, but that was the one that really kind of said, okay, you know, there really is no God man (laughter).
Story_ID: 30158
Speaker 1: Okay, describe for me the experience that you had as your final dissertation defense [at University of California, Berkeley]?
Speaker 2: That was scary (laughter).  That was scary.  That was very scary.  It was, I mean this is where people are just taking you wherever they wanna go.  I mean it's, there's no bounds, there's no limits.  It's like, you know, as I was asked, you're in outer space.  You have a vibrating molecule.  Describe to me the Hamiltonian [corresponds to the total energy of a system].  And it's like, okay, guys (laughter), what are we doing here?  So it was, it was a real scary and eye opening event.  It was, as far as I was (unclear), the closest thing to hazing that you can get, mental hazing.
Speaker 1: Now, you always have said that your major professor won't let you go through that experience unless he thinks you're ready.  So what did George [Pimentel] do to give the clue that he thought you were ready?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, my experience was significantly different than most graduate experiences, primarily because at the time I was there, he was actually deputy director of NSF [National Science Foundation].  So he actually spent most of his time in Washington [D.C.].  So I sort of struggled through it on my own.
Speaker 1: So you had an absentee advisor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who picked up the slack?
Speaker 2: The group did, the group for the most part.  But I mean he was, he was accessible.  Let me put it like that.  He was accessible, but it wasn't on a daily or weekly basis until he came back from NSF.  So, actually, when I about ready to get out, he had come back at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you identify people at Berkley at the time who were there giving you encouragement saying, you know, you can do this?
Speaker 2: That'll be a little bit more difficult.  I think there were people I interacted with that were supportive.  Professor Sakely I think was extremely supportive, and--
Speaker 1: Could you spell is name?
Speaker 2: S-A-K-E-L-Y.  And I'm trying think of who else.  I mean that was probably the most supportive individual I think, yeah, at that time.
Speaker 1: So you went there determined that you were going to get out and you were going to stay through to the end?
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: Where did you think this came from?
Speaker 2: That was just something I wanted to do.  I was convinced that I was gonna do it.  I mean, actually, as a matter of fact, I didn't pass my qualifiers the first time through.  And that's when you get your second thoughts and that's when they dangle the master's in front of you.  And I just realized that that was something I wanted to do, and I was gonna do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, describe that to me, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when you realized that you had not passed the qualifiers?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was death (laughter).  That was death.  That was, okay, let me pack up the kids and the wife and figure out where I can get a job from.  So that was sort of the first response.  And to be honest with you, it wasn't until much later that evening that I really realized what had happened in terms of what went on in the--I mean I basically really just froze.  Nothing was coming out my mouth.  I mean even if I said something it was pure gibberish.  There was no connection to reality, and I didn't even know that until I got home later that evening that I, that I really literally wasn't saying anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, were your qualifiers all oral?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was, it was--it took a while for me to realize that I was going to do this.  But my first instinct was, you know, let's find a job.
Story_ID: 30159
Speaker 1: Okay, but there was something you just mentioned.  I need to back track.  You're married while you're in graduate school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: Actually, I got married right before I went to graduate school, that summer before I went to graduate school and while I was there, we had three children, a daughter, Arion, and two sons--
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: A-R-I-O-N.  And the next oldest was my son, Alvin, Jr. and the youngest was my son, Avery, A-V-E-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we also need to know your wife's name?
Speaker 2: LaToy, L-A-capital T-O-Y.
Speaker 1: And how did you meet?
Speaker 2: At Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana], actually we met in my freshman year at Grambling.
Speaker 1: And when did you get married?
Speaker 2: We got married when I graduated that's June, 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And I'm assuming your wife was extremely supportive of your experience there at Grambling?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And what impact did that have upon you?
Speaker 2: I think that, as far as from an academic standpoint, it didn't make any difference.  I think certainly from a more emotional standpoint in terms of our relationship, it was, I think it provided me with that extra element that I needed in terms of human interactions.
Speaker 1: Now, you were unique in that you had a family that had gone through that experience.  What impact do you think that had in terms of the general support that you received from your extended family?
Speaker 2: I think it had a lot.  I mean I don't think people realize what that process is.  I mean it's, you sort of want to believe that--well, I mean there're these general misconceptions like, okay, I'm gonna have to have my own research project when I go out there.  Well, you don't have to have the research project cause the guy is funded and he's only gonna do what the money does.  You know, those, there are those misconceptions.  And then there's the notion of the actual process of going through it and having them know that, you know, you have to deal with your major professor and your dissertation committee.  That makes a difference cause they understand some of the dynamics that you're going through, and they realize that there are these hurdles that are placed there simply because they're hurdles.  I mean there are things that people do, I mean like, forcing the students to teach at the beginning and taking all these courses at the same time is there to just, you know, be the weeder.  If you can't do that, then you don't need to go to the next level.  So understanding that I think was helpful.
Speaker 1: But you also knew that the master's was an also ran at that institution?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did you learn that would (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Actually, that I found out, and when I was looking at the institutions, that the master's was--that was just a courtesy call for the larger institutions because at first I really thought you had to have both the master's and the PhD.
Story_ID: 30160
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you graduate from [University of California] Berkeley--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with a PhD.  What year did you get your PhD?
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985].  And where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: I went into industry, and I went to Dow Chemical [Company, Murray Hill, New Jersey] and worked at the central research in Midland, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, why did you decide to go to industry?
Speaker 2: At that point, I did not want to teach because I--the experience that I had with TA'ing was both burdensome for me and the students.  And so, as a matter of fact, in my evaluations, one of the students actually wrote, please don't make him teach anybody else again.  So that's where I was at that point.  And then I was interested in the post doc, but with a family, it really didn't seem like the thing to do at that time.  And the research that they were conducting at Kodak and at Dow Chemical had interested me cause it was optically related.  So I had a great deal of interest in that as well.
Speaker 1: Now, is this at a time when the post doc had become the thing that most PhDs did.
Speaker 2: Not really.  During that period, people were going back into industry in that, during that time.
Story_ID: 30161
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you work on while you were at Dow?
Speaker 2: I was in the electronic materials group and basically, we characterized the electrical properties of various materials that we used in microelectronic applications and we developed new polymer systems for use in that as well.
Speaker 1: Did you have to worry about funding for the work you were doing or?
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact, it was kind of interesting because when I got there, my boss walked in and he said, "Alvin, you need to go and order some stuff for the lab."  And I think I gave him a list was maybe about twenty or thirty thousand dollars and he came back, and he was like, "what are you doing?  You have a quarter of a million dollars [$250,000] you need to spend."  I was like, oh, okay.  So we began to equip the lab at that point.  And so that was--finding money was not a problem (laughter).
Speaker 1: What stands out about your Dow experience?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I think there was a lot of learning going on at that time. I mean I was extremely naive about the corporate environment, and fortunately, I did have a mentor there, Lin Dorman, who--he didn't interfere, but he sort of gave me a head's up as to when there might be a potential problem or things I needed to be concerned about.  The--I think what really stood out for me is that we were trying to develop new thermoset polymers for dielectric applications and the company had decided upon this one particular compound.  And it had some fairly good properties associated with it, but it turns out that I had, I was sampling things for all, the whole company.  So it turns out that the polymer group from Texas set up a sample at one point, and I looked at it.  And it had even better properties.  Well, what I didn't know was that corporate didn't like Texas, and Texas didn't like corporate because Texas felt it was the moneymaker and corporate thought they were arrogant.  And so, no, I didn't realize you don't work with Texas (laughter).  So actually I worked with Texas (laughter).  And we actually developed a polymer system that was superior to the one they were trying to market.  And that didn't go over well at all.
Speaker 1: Now, I recall that you did an intern at Dow?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, did that [cough] (excuse me) have an influence in terms of your deciding to go there?
Speaker 2: Only because I had been there before.  So since I had been there before, I was comfortable with the fa- idea of returning there.  But the major motivator I have to be honest with you was my children.  We had been sold that Midland had the best educational system in the country, and that was the selling point.  It was only till we got there we realized that it was the best because they tend to hold the students back one year from first grade or whatever so technically, they're one more year older, and I hope they do better.  But that was the primary driver there.
Speaker 1: Now, you say you had a mentor at Dow?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that person become your mentor and what was the impact that (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Actually, that's who I worked--
Speaker 1: --and who was this person?
Speaker 2: It's Lin-, Lineaus Dorman--
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-I-N-E-A-U-S, D-O-R-M-A-N.  And he was a synthetic chemist there and I had recently worked with him during my intern.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was the person you mentioned that was your mentor while you were at--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, so that helped as well in the decision-making process.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay at Dow?
Speaker 2: I stayed at Dow for six years.
Speaker 1: Six years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then you decide to leave [Dow Chemical Company]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: A combination of things.  Basically, it turned out that in the first three or four years, I was extremely excited about going to work, and we were doing a lot of great things, and I enjoyed it.  And then in the last couple of years, once the politics started to set in and you began to see that you weren't receiving the full recognition, my interests declined.  In addition to that, I had been doing, I had always worked with high school students and summer interns while I was at there, and that piqued my interest again in working with students.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this was also a time when industry was beginning to slack off from fundamental science and start doing what I call application science.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Was that an impact?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did, yes, it did.  I mean it was, because I'd always felt that you still have to understand the fundamentals unless you're gonna play [Thomas Alva] Edison and just try everything under the sun.  So that did have an effect on it, although I did enjoy developing things that you could see some potential applications for.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you now leave Dow.  About what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was about '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 30162
Speaker 1: And where did you go [after leaving Dow Chemical Company]?
Speaker 2: I went North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: So you're now going to a HBCU [Historically black colleges and universities].
Speaker 2: Right, I was going into HBCU as an assistant professor in chemistry.
Speaker 1: What drove that choice?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew if I was going into education, it would be an HBCU.  Basically, I do believe in giving back.  As I tell people, a lot of people have sacrificed for me to be here, and I should be willing to make a similar sacrifice as well.  So it was definitely the HBCU.  The other thing that played a role there was that my parents were there, and they were getting older and I did wanna spend some time with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you deal with the change in resources that you had at your disposal?
Speaker 2: That was quite interesting because actually, typically--well, basically, what happened was, I knew no one was gonna continue the research that I was doing at Dow [Chemical Company].  And I thought I had an agreement to get my instrumentation moved with me to North Carolina A and T [State University].  Later, I found out that the lab director had informed my manager that he could get it if you put it on a slow boat (laughter).  So I ended up with no resources for several years.  So it took a while to rebuild from that.
Speaker 1: And how was the adjustment from the industrial environment to the academic environment?
Speaker 2: It was fine with me.  It was fine with me in the sense that you had less resources but more freedom.  So I had a lot of opportunities to work on various projects.  So that, I think kept me motivated, as well as interacting with the students.  I think student interaction is really what's been the driving force though.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you have a father [Amos Paul Kennedy] who had been through that experience.  How was he helpful in helping you make that adjustment?
Speaker 2: Well, he, of course, he would share some of the stories about the things that would happen in the department.  And I could share things that would happen, and he could tell me how he would handle the situation (laughter), which may not always be the way I would handle the situation.  But at least I was aware of the alternatives that were available.  So I think, you know, both, since they were both in the academic environment, they were able to talk to me about the tenure and promotion process and things of that nature.  So all of those things were not foreign.
Speaker 1: So you understood that P and T [promotion and tenure] process?
Speaker 2: I had a, yeah, there was exposure to that as to how to do that.
Story_ID: 30163
Speaker 1: Now, you get to A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in '91 [1991], but you got an awards in '92 [1992] for a paper.  Could you describe the award and the source of the work that you did to give the paper?
Speaker 2: Actually, that award was from Dow [Chemical Company].  It was from the work that we had done on these, the new polymer systems.  So it was an international award that was--
Speaker 1: Could you name the award and describe it for me?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I've forgotten the name of it right now to be honest with you.
Speaker 1: What was it about?
Speaker 2: It was for, it was actually, well, I think voted best, outstanding paper for the electronics, micro-electronics symposium in Japan.  But my other colleagues had presented it, but it was based on the work that we had done at, in the--at Dow Chemical in that lab.
Speaker 1: Now, as a chemist, you're often working with unique materials, etc., and so you often get patents.  Did you get any of those?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have three patents as a matter of fact.  Those, I have three patents for the work, for the compounds related to Texas as a matter of fact.  And I actually got five hundred dollars too (laughter), which is--well the reason I mention that is because someone else in the same year as I had received a salary increase.  And I only received five hundred dollars and I was like, "well, why didn't I get a salary increase."  And they were like, "well, you're already at the top of the pay scale.  We can't give you a salary increase because there's nothing left."  And I'm like, "well, why don't you take me to the next level and give me a salary increase?"  They're like, "no, that's not gonna happen."
Speaker 1: Could you describe those patents?
Speaker 2: They were for what's called perfluorocyclobenzenes and they primarily--perfluorocyclobutane, excuse me.  And they were primarily for device applications in terms of dielectric linearity for covering micro-electronic circuits.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm not gonna ask you to spell that--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --but I will ask you to talk about those and the impact they had for a layman.
Speaker 2: That, well, primarily the problem we were trying to address is that when you put down circuits, especially when you get to higher frequencies, you have cross top between the circuitry, especially as you get smaller and smaller devices.  So it's important to find material that will minimize if not eliminate that.  And those need to be very low-loss, very low dielectric constant materials.  And that's what we were trying to develop in general.  So those, that was the class of compounds we were trying to develop.  And there was a set of physical properties that needed to be met as well as the electric properties in order to be used in those applications.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, you arrive at A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in '91 [1991].  When did you start getting the support that you needed to start building your laboratory?
Speaker 2: Ooh, that was a long time.  Basically, when I got there, my first focus was on teaching, okay, trying to understand the needs of the students.  There was a desperate need to revamp the instrumentation in the laboratory facilities that we had.  And so I began writing basically infrastructure grants at that point.  And one of the first grants I wrote for NSF [National Science Foundation], I remember I got the reviews back, and basically, it said, "creative ideas, wrong place" (laughter).  So it was basically saying that if I had been at any other institution, I probably would have gotten funded.  And that was, that was an eye opener to say the least, to get, to have that explicitly written out (laughter) in a review.  That was the thing, I had excellents and very good, and it's like how do you not fund excellents and very goods.  So anyway, so I spent most of my time, initially trying to build the infrastructure for the physical chemistry and general chemistry courses that we had.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you go back and have a discussion with the program officer about that review?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know you could do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean that was one thing my parents couldn't give me any advice on and I didn't have anybody who was familiar with the funding process cause I had come out of industry.  So I didn't know you could go talk to the program officer.  I didn't, I thought that was forbidden, you know, that basically you just send it in and they tell you yes or no, and that's the end of that.
Story_ID: 30165
Speaker 1: You were talking about your experience with your first NSF [National Science Foundation] grant.  Now, how did you learn from that for your next series of grants?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was somewhat traumatized and didn't apply for quite a while after that.  After that I applied more for smaller funding for my own research, and mostly at local things, statewide and stuff, initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you are concentrating on your teaching, but you didn't get much experience doing this while you were in graduate school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did you make that adjustment?
Speaker 2: Actually, it came quite naturally at a certain point.  I think I was nervous initially when I got in, in terms of how to present material and how to cover material.  But once I began to see what some of the challenges for the students were and develop my own sort of style associated with it, I got very comfortable very quickly.
Speaker 1: Now, so soon after you arrive at A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University], you received an award for teaching, and you were listed in 'Who's Who.'  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Actually, it came about from one of my students that actually made the recommendation.  It turns out that my initial interactions with my students, they're not overly enthusiastic.  Let me put it like that, because I do have a tendency to be extremely challenging and try to push them as much as possible.  So they normally have a difficulty accepting the challenge initially, especially if they've been extremely good in their high school.  So they figure they should be able to do this without any problem.  So it normally takes at least one academic year before the student realizes that, no, I'm not trying to mentally abuse them, that I actually am trying to help them.  And usually it's when they graduate that it really sinks in that, you know, this was very, this was a positive experience for them.  So the, but that particular time, the student recognized fairly early on that I did have their best interest at heart.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the student?
Speaker 2: I can't remember that particular one, yeah.
Story_ID: 30166
Speaker 1: And the, now, you arrive at A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University].  And you're having difficulty getting your research started because of lack of funding, but you got tenure on time.  So--
Speaker 2: Basically, the way that happened is that I did what I told people not to do and I chased ambulances.  Essentially, whoever had money to do whatever, I would participate in the project.  So it was a painful learning experience because what I found out that you ended up not being good at anything except helping somebody else along.  So I was doing things with milk and nutrition.  I was doing things with (thin-filled?) carbon.  I mean I was just doing things all over the place that weren't beneficial for me but were able to get, at least get support for students and be able to at least demonstrate some level of funding.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, along where you formed the association with the Marshall Space Flight Center [Huntsville, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --could you describe that association and what year it was?
Speaker 2: Actually, let's see.  That one, I think was in '94 [1994] and '95 [1995].  Basically, actually, it goes back a little further than that because what happened was, I was actually, helped direct what was called the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Sharp program.  NASA had a program for high school students to come and conduct research at various universities.  And we had received a grant to do that.  And so I had started to develop a relationship with NASA at that point as far as the students coming from the high school for the summer was concerned.  So, and that's sort of what enabled me to get my research headed in the right direction.  Now, where it really took a turn, I think though, is that my old physics professor, Dr. Cummings, came to A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] one day.  And we were talking.  And he had, he was working with NASA at that point in time.  And I was telling him that I was interested in some polymer physics and polymer chemistry types of work.  And he had mentioned that, well, they do have to develop polymer materials in space.  So I go, gee, you know, I wonder what is the effect of developing materials in space and how does that impact the material properties and whether or not they can be utilized or not.  He's like, it sounds like an interesting concept to him.  So at that point he gave me, referenced me to the Marshall Space Flight Center [Huntsville, Alabama] where they were conducting some experiments on materials in space, development of materials in space.
Speaker 1: Where was Dr. Cummings your physics professor?
Speaker 2: At Grambling [University, Grambling, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: At Grambling.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you had met him there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And he had moved at the time?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 30167
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, very soon thereafter you make a decision to leave Grambling in 2000?
Speaker 2: No, A and T.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sorry to leave A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University], my mistake.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Why did you make that decision to move?
Speaker 2: Actually, that was a difficult decision because I had just gotten my first major funding through NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] at that point.  I had just received my first award, and I was in a perfect situation; that is, I had my summer salary.  I had my research group.  I had all the instrumentation I needed.  I wasn't getting the level of support I thought I should be getting from the university to do the things I was trying to do.  And I think more importantly was, the opportunity was presented at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] to actually build a program.  They were telling me that there are three to four people who were gonna be retiring and that I would have some opportunities to hire new faculty, and that they were trying to get--trying to develop their research capabilities and that they were primarily teaching at that point.  And I thought that was a very unique opportunity to build a program, and I said, let's give it a shot.
Speaker 1: Who was the person at Morgan [State University] who made the sale and convinced you to come?
Speaker 2: That would have been Dr. T. Joan Robinson.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Robinson.
Speaker 2: Okay, she was dean of the School of Computer Mathematics and Natural Science at that time.  And she hired me on as the chair of the department.
Speaker 1: And who was president at that time?
Speaker 2: [Earl S.] Richardson.
Speaker 1: Dr. Richardson, okay.  Did you have a connection with the president?
Speaker 2: No, I did speak with him, I mean when I was interviewing, but prior to that I hadn't met him.
Story_ID: 30168
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you now arrive at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  What did you find?
Speaker 2: What I found was, I found an administration that was interested in moving forward, but I found quite a few faculty who felt we needed to stay in our traditional mode of a teaching institution.  So there was a conflict of interest in terms of where we wanted to be and where we were.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you bring them on board?
Speaker 2: Everybody didn't come on board (laughter), okay.  Basically, what I was able to do with the help of sponsored programs was to start finding seed money for the faculty and start trying to identify general areas that we could collaborate in.  So I spent a lot of time trying to build internal collaborations and getting the instrumentation and resources that we needed cause all of our instrumentation at that point was antiquated, and it was out of date.  And so I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get those resources in place.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you bring to the department a culture of research.  And were you able to start giving your students the same kind of experience that you had had as an undergraduate?
Speaker 2: Right, as a matter of fact, that's exactly why we've been successful recently with our funding opportunities because what I've tried to do was, well, when I came in, we had just been given a PhD. program in bioenvironmental science.  And they had just realigned our master's program in chemistry.  But we didn't have any external funding.  None of the faculty had any funding, and we weren't gonna be able to get graduate students any time soon.  So I tried to take the experiences that I had had with all these various interns and said, okay, why don't we try to give the students what we call a continuous undergraduate research experience, that is, starting in the freshman and sophomore years, start them off in research and then allow them to grow and develop through that research project.  And when we first started it, it was very successful, and we were able to build the human resources that we needed to conduct the resour- research.  So at the same time that we were getting funding to get our instrumentation, we were able to get funding to support the students and the faculty to conduct research.  And we were able to develop a nucleus of researchers conducting research and development of bio-sensors.  And that's been based on that undergraduate experience.  So when we first started, very few people took freshmen and sophomore students into their programs.  We've become so successful now we can't hardly keep a sophomore anymore.  By the time we take them to a conference, they are snapped up immediately.  So I really did try to take--what I've realized from those experiences was that being constantly engaged in research helps you see what it's about.  And not only that, but the opportunities to go to conferences and present is a huge opportunity that students always need to be exposed to.  And so our students, for example, we required them to present at least three times a year, okay.  And sometimes they present more than that.  So it becomes the culture that this is just the expectation.  So right now, we have about thirty students that are going through our summer program.  And our summer program has evolved to the point where we've implemented formal measures for critical thinking skills, development and assessment tools associated with it.
Speaker 1: Could you describe some of those?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as the critical thinking skills are concerned, what we're looking at here is some basic things, three things.  We're looking at critical thinking in literature, critical thinking in research and critical thinking in peer review.  So the students get exposed to all of those.  In the case of literature, for example, what we've done, we've developed a model where we're trying to get the student to understand that you don't have to completely understand an article when you read it, but you should feel the article is approachable, okay.   So we're developing a process, for example, where we'll have a case study that everybody, no matter what your major is, you'll do the case study.  And the case study, I think, the case study for this time was synergistic vaccines.  If you take, if a child takes a series of vaccines, should they take one separately or should they take them all together.  And so that was the basis of the case study.  The idea though was that this particular case study had not done the calibration and standards that were required to actually make the judgments that they made.  So what we did was, we developed an inquiry-based lab for the students to conduct.  And we told them that there's cyanide in the water and we've got this compound that can detect cyanide and now you go to determine whether this is possible or not.  And then when they did all of this, we told them, ah-hah, well, you know, the reality is that not only can it detect cyanide, but it can detect fluoride as well.  So now you've just told everybody that our water is poison because you really detected fluorine.  So we tried to get them to relate that back to that particular article, and then there's a series of activities that they have to do with basically the logic of an article where they have to understand the purpose, the key concepts, the assumptions.  So normally when a student tries to read an article, they'll just regurgitate everything that's in that article.  They'll tell you what the data was and what the--what we're trying to get them to do is actually question whether or not that article makes sense, whether they convinced them of what they said is true.  And it's a very different way of approaching things.  So in the same sense, we have peer review.  So, for example, when they finish their inquiry-based labs, they have to do a peer review of their other colleagues lab's reports.  Well, this turns out to be exactly like the peer review that we have to do because the first thing they say is, they don't know what they're talking about (laughter).  You know, my paper was really good (laughter).  And what we're finding is that students are now, because we don't put any grades on it or anything, we do an assessment of it.  And we have a rubric for it, but because we don't have any grades associated with it, they're actually coming back saying, can I do the report again?  And we're saying, but you're not gonna get a grade.  It's like well, I know, but I didn't do a good a job as I could have.  So what we're seeing that, when we give them this continuous experience, they are able to make that transition to where they're actually internalizing these things.  And it's no longer the grade that's the motivation so much as their own curiosity or their own driven personalities that they want to find out what's the right answer or how do I conduct the correct research.  And so in that regard, we're really--and that's where we wanna go with the next step is to actually, formally institutionalize that so that more students get an opportunity to see that it's not about the grade.  It really is about my knowledge and my understanding that's really motivating me to do this.
Story_ID: 30169
Speaker 1: So at what point in the experience do you think the students start accepting the science as their own?
Speaker 2: It depends on the student, but normally, it happens around that second or third year when they become a rising junior that they begin to, really begin to see--normally, it's for the first experience.  What happens is, it's a kneejerk.  This is my assignment.  I was told to hand it in, type of response.  And so they're just giving you something cause you told them to give it to 'em.  Usually, in that second year, they're beginning to see that there's a connection between these exercises and activities that we have them to do and that the end result is their improvement in terms of their critical thinking skill capabilities.  And so then you begin to see them, instead of just writing down, but then they say the main purpose, and it says, it was to find out if the vaccines could be used more than once, I mean in synergy or not.  They'll say the vaccines, here are the types of vaccines and it has been shown that these are, can interact.  So they actually can see that next step of development where they're actually questioning it, and it's not just an assignment anymore or something for me to do to hand in to somebody.
Speaker 1: Have you started seeing the difference in the kinds of things your students do when they leave you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean we have, one of the students who left recently, as a matter of fact, when she got accepted to the PhD. program, she called back, and she's like, well, I've interviewed with people and I think I wanna do this.  But I wanna work with this guy because I've already designed my research project.  I'm like, (laughter) wait a minute (laughter).  That's wonderful, but (laughter), I think you're gonna have to do what your research advisor says, you know.  Hold that off until you become a post doc.  So we have seen that.  And I think the comments that we get from a lot of the people who have taken our students in the program is that they've matured as researchers.  So the common complaint has been that even from the major institutions, the students can take the exams and they do well GPA [grade point average] wise, but when you get them in the lab, they're lost.  They don't know what to do, okay.  So what we see is that the students are taking initiatives so they're opening up the user manuals.  So if something doesn't work, we just had a student--I was just talking to another colleague, a young lady who actually got a paper in her freshman year, she came in and said, "do I have to always come and ask you about what experiments I need to do?  Can I just go in and do some experiments on my own?"  And these are the things that we're looking for cause that, to me, is the turning point, where you know I'm no longer a technician.  This is a project that I'm genuinely interested in, and I have some ideas associated with it.
Story_ID: 30170
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanna shift a little bit and talk about the professional side of your life, professional organizations and your leadership on the national and other levels.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Describe what you do there?
Speaker 2: Right now I'm engaged in with the American Chemical Society and with the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers which is known as NOBCChE.  And the American Chemical Society, right now I am the chair of the Maryland section of the American Chemical Society.  So we do outreach activities and we actually have some--actually, one of our students, one of the students we're sponsoring is going to be in the olympiad, the world olympiad, the chemistry olympiad from out of Maryland.  And so, and there's a lot of things that we're trying to do to develop synergy between the local section and the undergraduate students.  And recently the ACS [American Chemical Society] has changed the structure of the undergraduate membership.  So we think we have a lot of opportunity there for bringing in more membership and having a more active participation.  So that's what we're doing as far as, I'm doing as far as the American Chemical Society is concerned.  I'm also, I've also participated in some of their workshops, leadership workshops and things of that nature.  The other thing I'm involved with is NOBCChE, the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers.  And one of the things we've done there is started a higher education initiative.  And what we're trying to do there is to develop a chair's counsel for chemistry and chemical engineering chairs where we can share experiences and begin to leverage our capabilities to go after other opportunities.  Normally, HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] have tended to see themselves as their own worst enemy and we're always competitive with one another for a limited amount of resources.  And what we're trying to do is at least develop a culture where we are, if nothing else, cooperative competitors, where we at least identify areas where we can work together to obtain additional funding or resources that we all need.
Speaker 1: And are you getting buy-in for what I call the political side of the society that we work in?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think there's a, what's clear now is that both organizations, American Chemical Society and NOBCChE understand that this, there is a great need for the scientific stem workforce that's not gonna be addressed unless large numbers of minority students become actively engaged in the scientific endeavor.
Speaker 1: How do you cultivate places for your students to go?
Speaker 2: Well, actually one of the things that we're doing now and we're trying to expand on, as I said, we've been looking at this continuous experience, undergraduate experience, and one of the things we've done in the case of Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], for example, we're developing a series of compounds that are quite similar to what they're developing.  Ours are for imaging processes and theirs are for other applications.  But they're similar compounds.  So what we're able to do is that the student has been able to--we have had students who can conduct research here, develop a series of compounds, go to Carnegie Mellon [University] and try them in applications which we don't have the capability for.  So the idea again, is ownership of the student, that now the student actually--instead of them coming in cold for the summer, starting a project up, they have something in hand.  And now they're trying to look at how it can be applied in a different application or even a different series of compounds.  We've also done this with the University of Southern Mississippi [Hattiesburg, Mississippi] as well.  And so the idea here is that the typical experience, undergraduate experience, has been a smorgasbord of experiences, which I don't have a problem with because I did it myself.  But the point is that you never get ownership.  At the end of the summer, you're done.  If you're lucky, you might make a presentation, but other than that, that research, for the most part, as far as you're concerned is finished.  So what we're trying to do now is to cultivate relationships with industry and national labs similar to what we have with Carnegie Mellon [University] where there is a win-win situation.  So the student takes something that they've done here.  They expand upon it.  They come back and probably we take a new direction which allows us to expand our capabilities, okay.
Story_ID: 30171
Speaker 1: What's your long-term vision for the department?
Speaker 2: Long term, I'm confident that we have the capability of doing two things.  One of them is this development of a CREST Center, NSF [National Science Foundation] CREST Center, Center of Excellence in Science and Technology.  And we're specifically looking at that for development of microwave technologies for bioenvironmental science.  And we have, we have the resources as well as the faculty in place to actually conduct some top-rate research in that area.  The other thing that we're working on is to actually develop a center for undergraduate research and education.  We really believe that undergraduate research experience is critical, especially for minority students to get them engaged and interested in the scientific endeavor.  And I really believe that we have an opportunity to make some significant advances in the area of student participation, quality, as well as success in the science area.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you a couple of philosophical questions.  What do you see as the future of your field?
Speaker 2: I think at this point we've, it's pretty much not going to be a field (laughter), in the sense that the boundaries that we've typically associated with areas are falling down.  And I think that's a benefit.  The concern that I have in that regard is the wide versus deep issue.  And what I am seeing is that when programs try to be interdisciplinary, they have a tendency to be shallow, and the student never really gets firmly grounded in something.  So I do think that in that respect, these divisions of fields will remain in the sense of developing that foundation.  But once that foundation is developed, being able to disperse that throughout other disciplines is going to be the key.  And, again, I really that research is the way to do that.  The classroom, you just can't do it in the classroom.  All you do in the classroom is teach them 120 credit hours, and no matter how you do it, it's 120 credit hours.  So it can be 120 credit hours of something that's not related to each other or 120 that teaches you something that you can hold onto.  And I think that as far as the curriculum is concerned, it will never be able to address interdisciplinary issues in a fundamental way.  And only through the research endeavor will you be able to do that.
Story_ID: 30172
Speaker 1: Okay, before I ask my last question, we haven't mentioned your family at all.  Can you say something about your family, your children, your spouse?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, my first wife [LaToy], actually was the one at Berkley, she is--actually, she just finished getting her PhD. in higher education.  My daughter [Arion Kennedy], my oldest, completed her bachelor's in chemistry and just recently received her PhD in nutritional science and is conducting a post doc at, oh, why is the name escaping me, is conducting a post doc in Tennessee at--
Speaker 1: Vanderbilt? (observer speaking)
Speaker 2: Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee], thank you (laughter), at Vanderbilt, okay.  My oldest son [Alvin Kennedy Jr.] is, has completed his degree and he's working on his law degree at Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina].  And my youngest one [Avery Kennedy] felt that he could not be taught anymore, and so he's working in the service industry.
Story_ID: 30173
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  Now, if you look--what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think at this point, I would be, want to be remembered for my passion for education and education of youth, okay, and their active participation in the research endeavor.  I think that's really what motivates me most.
Speaker 1: Okay, of all the things you've done, what are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: Hum, what am I most proud of?  I would have to say what has been accomplished here in the department [at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I think we've come a long way.  It's been challenging but very rewarding, and I think we have developed a significant reputation in terms of being able to develop highly qualified researchers in the area.
Speaker 1: And are there any things that you would like for us to know that I have not mentioned yet or have asked you?
Speaker 2: Hum, no, I think that about covers everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I wanna thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
