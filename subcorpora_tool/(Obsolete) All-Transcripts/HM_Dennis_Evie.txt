Speaker 1: Well tell me what you remember about your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother was the disciplinarian, and I remember that very well.  But was one who had skills.  I mean she could cook, she could sew, she could sing, and she did all of those things very well and, and was quite the good homemaker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about her education?
Speaker 2: She I think went through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you receive--what characteristic of your mother do you think you received from her?
Speaker 2: I think her calmness.  I, I have that--people tell me that's what I, I have pretty much in situations where it ordinarily wouldn't, you wouldn't expect people to be calm in, so I think that one.
Speaker 1: Was there anything else she shared about life at that time?
Speaker 2: My mother was religious.  She was quite a seamstress.  She believed in education and saw that all nine of us somehow graduated from high school at least.  And I think that was something that I remember very vividly about her.
Story_ID: 633694
Speaker 1: Tell me about her parents, your [maternal] grandparents.
Speaker 2: My grandfather was William Brown, my grandmother was Lucy Brown.  My grandmother was--I think had the characteristics that I just described about my mother [Ola Brown Garrett].

Speaker 2: His name was Eugene Garrett.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your dad.
Speaker 2: My, my father was--he had one sister [Annie Branson (ph.)], there were two children.  He was a minister.  He also was a lumberman, he made--cut down trees and made lumber.  And did not do a lot of farming.  He had just, you know, corn and--they used to call it truck, truck gardens or whatever that is that they talked about.  But he spent most of his time doing, making lumber.
Speaker 1: Do you know about his education?
Speaker 2: He I think went through eighth grade, but where, I don't know.  But he, he could write, he could read, he could preach and, and could do all of those things, but--
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Farmhaven [Mississippi].  But was a firm believer in education.  To make certain that all nine of us went to school at least through high school.
Speaker 1: What trait did you receive from your father?  Or characteristic do you think?
Speaker 2: I think the determination to succeed and excel in whatever I decided to do.  And, and that's where he came from.  He believed firmly in education.
Story_ID: 633696
Speaker 1: My four oldest brothers, well my, my three oldest brothers, the two didn't graduate from college, but went through high school.  And one of those graduated from college.  One who lives in Chicago [Illinois] right now, graduated from Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and was the personal chef for Dr. George Washington Carver.  And my oldest sister went through high school and my--the one just after her did.  My youngest sister graduated from Anderson College [Anderson University] in Anderson, Indiana, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's--while you're, while you're telling me this information, let's go ahead and get everybody in order.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and tell me their names and you know, just like you were doing now, tell me a little bit about them and then we'll go back to your dad [Eugene Garrett].  But put yourself in the order.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The oldest one was Ernest [Ernest Garrett].  He went through--I know grade school, maybe high school.  The next one was William Eugene [William Eugene Garrett], graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: What do they, what did they do in life?  What was their occupation?
Speaker 1: Both of them followed with and worked with my dad in, in the lumber business.  The next one was Coleman [Coleman Garrett], who served in the [U.S.] military and did graduate from college.  The next one was Ozie [Ozie Garrett Wattleton] who is ninety-three years old.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Ozie?
Speaker 1: O-Z-I-E.  She went through high school, but didn't go to college, but she was sort of self-taught and is a minister, a retired minister in movement the Church of God movement.  She lives in Mississippi.  Just recently built a three room, a three bedroom house and we all wonder about that.  She said I have it and I paid for it cash and I'm gonna live here.  But then the next one is Robert [Robert Garrett] who graduated from Tuskegee Institute.  He lives in Chicago.  And then Alice [Alice Garrett], who didn't graduate from college, but spent a few years and she has passed away, she's deceased.  And then I came along.  And then my younger sister, Ola [Ola Garrett], O-L-A, who went to Anderson College, lives in Laurel, Mississippi.  And then there's, there's me.  You must have eight--nine don't you?  I didn't skip anybody, did I?  Eight.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yes we have them all.
Story_ID: 633697
Speaker 1: Now let's go back to your, your father [Eugene Garrett].  And describe your father to me; tell me about your father.
Speaker 2: My father was for me--people say to me now when we talk, "You always talk about your father, you never say much about your mother [Ola Brown Garrett]."  My mother was the homemaker, the disciplinarian.  My father was the minister who believed in hard work, but who believed in education, was certain that, that we all would strive to get a good education as a way out of poverty and he would sit us all down and talk about that.  And he instilled that into our heads and in our minds.  And what he said is anything is possible, but you've got to stick to it and you've got to decide this is what you're gonna do to get on in life.  And that was pretty much what he was.  As I indicated earlier, someone said to us, to me one time, "You always talk about your father, but you don't say much about your mother."  My mother was the disciplinarian and the homemaker and, and that's where, where she was.  Wasn't that we didn't love her just as much, but--
Story_ID: 633698
Speaker 1: And your grandparents on your father's [Eugene Garrett] side.  Did you know them?
Speaker 2: I--no I didn't know my grandfather, but I do know, did know my grandmother.  And--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mariah [Mariah Williams].
Speaker 1: That's my grandmother's name.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Mariah Garrett and do you know what your grandfather's name was?
Speaker 2: I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did your father share any stories about his growing up?  He had how many brothers and sisters did he have?
Speaker 2: He had one sister [Annie Branson (ph.)].  And she lived very close to us when we were growing up.  But that was, that was all that, that he had.
Speaker 1: Did your mother or father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now Mariah's name was Williams.
Speaker 1: I see.  Did your parents or grandparents ever talk about any of your ancestors in slavery, interracial marriages or anything of history that you can share (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not, not that I remember because I probably would have been too young to, to know when they talked about that.  Faye [HistoryMaker Alyce Faye Wattleton], who has been doing some genealogy studies, she has somebody working on it, has tried to track down my grandfather on my father's side.  And she's in the throes of doing that right now, but we don't know.  Supposedly he was a traveling guy who came out of Texas and landed a little while there and kept going, but I don't, I don't really know much about him.
Story_ID: 633699
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your early days.  And I wanna first talk about your elementary school days.  But I want you to tell me what is your earliest childhood memory?  What is the--what can you think about would be your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) That--that's a good one.  And I assume you edit all of this out, don't you?
Speaker 1: No actually we don't.  But it's okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean when I stop and say that's a good one.
Speaker 1: No, that's fine.
Speaker 2: I think I just remember growing up as number eight out of nine children who hated my little sister [Ola Garrett] when she came along after five years and took my place as the baby of the family.  But we used to have a good time.  I mean remember the Sundays when you sat around the dinner table with the minister coming to visit and, and those kinds of things, but (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well tell me, tell me a story about that.  Now we're talk--okay let's, let's talk about religion.  Since you, you talked about the minister coming to your home.  What is your earliest childhood memory of religion?
Speaker 2: Sunday school and what was they, they called the Church of God as opposed to Church of God in Christ.  This was Church of God and they're very strict kind of religion.  No makeup, no profanity, no smoking, no rousing around, no drinking and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 633700
Speaker 1: But I can remember having a good time with other kids in, in the neighborhood and we could find things to do, to play and amuse ourselves quite different to what I see children doing today (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well what were some of those things that you did?
Speaker 1: We used to have a tree house and we used to have a place where, where we would--it turned out in retrospect, I guess I was a real leader 'cause I used to be the preacher.  And, and we would go out there and amuse ourselves with my cousins and, and what have you from around the community.  And could stay there for days and, and just enjoy.  But we had to make our own entertainment, and I think we did in that, growing up that way.
Speaker 2: Tell me about where you lived.  Was it rural, was it in the city?
Speaker 1: It was rural.
Speaker 2: Okay, was it on a farm?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So tell me, tell me about where you lived.
Speaker 1: On a farm in early days.  We did not farm.  At least the family didn't.  My father [Eugene Garrett] had people who, who worked his farm.  But then later on he went into the grocery store business and we moved from that area further toward Canton, Mississippi.  And that was about all we did because he and my older brothers did the work and supplied us with our needs.
Speaker 2: And who were some of the other children?  Do you remember who your best friend was?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I guess my cousin who's now passed away, and her name was Carine, C-A-R-I-N-E Wright [Carine Wright].  But she and I were I think pretty close.  But the rest were, you know, just kids.
Speaker 2: And, and so the, the community being that it was rural and, and farmland, tell me did the other parents, did they farm the land?  'Cause you said that your father had someone else that actually farmed your land, is that right?
Speaker 1: He, he, he actually was the farmer, but he had other people helping him do the work rather than--and my older, older siblings.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But certainly the, the last four or five of us didn't have to do anything on the farm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do anything, okay.
Speaker 1: Now you were born just a few years before the, the Depression [Great Depression].  Tell me what your thoughts are about that time.  Because you, you hear so many stories about the Depression, but what was your experience during that time?
Speaker 2: You know I didn't, didn't, didn't really know that we were in a depression, I just thought we were poor and that was it.  We didn't have everything that we thought we wanted and what have you.  But to have some remembrance of, of whether I really knew what it was or not, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So you, you didn't feel that you didn't have--did you--well let me ask you this.  Did you feel that you didn't have what you needed?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You always felt that you had the things that you needed (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had what I needed.
Speaker 1: And, and, and that's a blessing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in that time.
Story_ID: 633701
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of school?
Speaker 2: I remember walking from where we lived to--it was maybe a four room school house, rural.  And we would walk, thought nothing about it as opposed to what people do today.  And had a really good teacher.  I remember her name was Eunice Parrott [Eunice Thompson Parrott], but made certain that we learned.  And I was always eager.  Instead of having a computer, I had to memorize my time tables and, and those kinds of things.  But I remember her as being a very caring, but a very strict teacher.
Speaker 1: And what about books? And the schoolhouse was a freestanding schoolhouse, or was it a part of a church?
Speaker 2: No, it was a freestanding schoolhouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And as far as books and then materials that you needed, were they available to you?
Speaker 2: As I remember, we had books and we had materials.  But my parents [Ola Brown Garrett and Eugene Garrett] saw to it that we had the necessary kinds of materials that we needed.  All our papers and pencils and crayons and those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: And so you went to the school.  Was there a name of the school?
Speaker 2: You know it, it was I think just Madison County School [ph.].  I don't remember a name.  But for high school, then we moved from Farmhaven [Mississippi] to, close to Canton, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So how, what grade did you go to in Farmhaven?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Through eighth grade.  And then I went to--at that time it was Cameron Street High School [Canton, Mississippi].  They named it long after I got there, they now refer to it as Canton High School [Canton, Mississippi].  But I graduated from Cameron Street High School in Canton.
Story_ID: 633702
Speaker 1: Before we leave Farmhaven [Mississippi], if you could think about sounds, sights or smells, what does, what does that bring to your memory?
Speaker 2: Sounds, sights or smells.  Sights I think would be our big grove in front of our house.  We had a huge house.  And that's where my sister [Ozie Garrett Wattleton] just built her new home on that same site 'cause--where the old house used to stand.  But we had pecan trees, we picked pecans.  We had fruit trees and I can remember those.  I can remember going down the hill at one time to my father's sawmill where he cut the lumber and made those kinds of things.  We didn't have a lot of animals.  We had may be a--I can remember one dog that I was--really favorite.
Story_ID: 633703
Speaker 1: We left that area when I started in high school [Cameron Street High School, Canton, Mississippi], we moved closer to Canton [Mississippi].  And there he [Garrett Dennis' father, Eugene Garrett] had a grocery store.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I used to work in the grocery store (laughter).  And he built himself a bus and he would pick up children.  My, my brother who lives in Chicago [Illinois] would pick up children in the neighborhood and drive them into Canton to school.  And one day on that bus, he collided with another bus on the bridge.  And the guy got out and shot him in the face and it ripped off his finger.  This is my brother that still lives in Chicago, and knocked out one of his eyes.  And this is when I saw my father the most angry as I've ever seen him.  I'd never seen him angry like that.  Matter of fact, he got his own shotgun and was gonna go after the person, but didn't, we stopped him.  But that was a traumatic time in, in our lives that, that I can remember.  But we got over that and Bob [Robert Garrett] went on to--Robert was his name, went on to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And got his degree in commercial dietetics and that's when he served as George Washington Carver's personal cook who wouldn't have anybody else cook for him at all except Bob.  That I remember.
Story_ID: 633704
Speaker 1: And so we went from Farmhaven [Mississippi] to what was then Canton [Mississippi], although it wasn't right in the city.  And that's where we had the grocery store and served in that area.
Speaker 2: Just going back a little bit.  Did your father [Eugene Garrett] own the sawmill? And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: That, that was his business.
Speaker 1: That was his business.
Speaker 2: And that was how he was able to buy the land that your, that your family lived on in--
Speaker 1: I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: You guess, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I don't know if he inherited, they inherited it from my, my grandfather or what, but it was all land together there and what have you.
Speaker 2: And so when you go to Canton, you, you build, your family builds another home?
Speaker 1: We built a home just where, outside of Canton (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Outside of Canton.  And that was, was there another name for that area?  Was there a town named for the--
Speaker 1: No.  Just sub- out.
Story_ID: 633705
Speaker 1: And so now you're in high school [Cameron Street High School, Canton, Mississippi].  And your, your family is still attending the Church of God?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: Any memories about older--now, now that you're older, in church, and now that you're really be coming of age, a young lady.  And are they still very strict?
Speaker 2: We used to have, we used to have camp meetings and they occurred every, every summer.  Some--I think maybe in August.  And it was a gathering place for the people from all around and that's where the younger people had good times and, and what have you.  That they weren't strictly adhering to the beliefs of the older people, and I was one of those that didn't.  But I can remember with my friends and my cousins, lots of them, we used to enjoy that camp meeting and, and have a good time and it was a gathering place that still exists as Farmhaven [Mississippi] community, that my father [Eugene Garrett] donated the land for the building that they have their now, so.  And they just created a cemetery there several years ago, that he donated the land for.  Incidentally I didn't tell you, he had one sister.  We didn't get into that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her name?
Speaker 2: Annie [Annie Branson (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Annie.
Speaker 2: Annie.  And her name was not Garrett, but she was married to a Will Branson [ph.].  So I, I don't remember what her maiden name was, really.
Story_ID: 633706
Speaker 1: Now tell me more about your activities, or what your memories are of high school [Cameron Street High School, Canton, Mississippi].  Was there a teacher who might have encouraged or inspired you?
Speaker 2: My math teacher.  And his name was, last name was Vanado [ph.].  And he was really a great teacher and I guess I--it was one of my favorite subjects.  And so that was what I remember.  I remember the principal's wife was the disciplinarian and the piano player and did all the things for graduation exercises and I was--had a singing role and I didn't think I could sing at all in our graduation exercises.  I was a good student in, in high school.
Speaker 1: What type of child were you though?  'Cause you said you didn't adhere to the, the rules.
Speaker 2: Well as a Holiness church is what I mean (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Church. Yes, I understand.
Speaker 2: I think I was a pretty good child.  I think I was, among my peers, I was the leader, as I look back on it.  And, and had my followers and we used to have a good time as, as a child.
Speaker 1: And as a high school student besides church in your community, were you involved in any other activities?
Speaker 2: No, we were pretty much school oriented and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you, your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't have fan clubs, we didn't have cheerleading clubs.  No, you went to school and you got an education and, and that was about it.  I played at basketball a little bit.  I did, but I wasn't that good.
Speaker 1: And what about singing?  You said that you didn't think that you were a good singer.
Speaker 2: I didn't think I could sing, but I--
Speaker 1: Did you sing in church, or, or in school?
Speaker 2: No, I sang in school at that one, one time.  During when we were preparing for our graduation exercises, so--
Speaker 1: All right.  And music.  What type of music did you like when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: Didn't have much music at that--in, in my days.  But, but I liked I guess it was at that time jazz.  I didn't know what it was, but I did like it a lot.  That's where I am now in, in, in a lot of my music.
Story_ID: 633707
Speaker 1: What were holidays like at your house?
Speaker 2: Being not wealthy, we always had--waiting for Santa Claus to come and what we would have is perhaps an orange and an apple and some candy and some nuts and maybe a little gift, but it was always something for each one of us, all nine of us.  And my mother [Ola Brown Garrett] was a great cook at that, that bit.  And my aunt, my daddy's sister [Annie Branson (ph.)] who lived not far from us, would come and join us.  Always she would come and very strange, she had a, a goose that followed her and would go up under the house.  And she would get up to get ready to go home, the goose, you would hear him come and go out.  So she was with us during the holidays.  And so there were always not fancy.  I think children today would say this is not holiday if this is all you're getting for holidays, but we looked forward to that and it was good.
Story_ID: 633708
Speaker 1: We were talking about your family's move to Canton [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: I need to tell you, I forgot to tell you my brothers, four of them, had the Garrett quartet.  They were singers that sang all over the state and were very outstanding in their singing.
Speaker 1: Did they sing gospel, what type of music did they sing?
Speaker 2: They sang gospel mainly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were your mother [Ola Brown Garrett] and father [Eugene Garrett] musical at all?
Speaker 2: Not that I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then your sister [Ozie Garrett Wattleton], you said that your sister was a preacher or became a preacher.  When did she start to preach?
Speaker 2: When she was sixteen, and when was she born and she's ninety-three now.  How do we figure that one out?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifteen [1915].
Speaker 2: She was born in 1915, so sixteen years later.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-seven [1927], right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and tell me what that experience was like for the--you and for the household?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting, but it, it didn't seem to change the way we lived.  We were just sort of that kind of close knit family and it was fine.  It was fine.  And Thomas [Thomas Garrett] was what was the third one we, we named in there, was also a minister.  All following after my father.  So, didn't seem to change our lives too much, if at all.
Speaker 1: Thinking about that area in which you lived in Canton, Mississippi. Tell me more about the community and who lived there.
Speaker 2: We were just outside of Canton but the, the mailing address was that.  We weren't in the city itself.  Eventually my oldest brother Ernest [Ernest Garrett] did move into Canton.  And it, it was a segregated community of course.  And as a matter of fact, when James Meredith was doing his thing, he's, he's camped out at my oldest brother's house in, in Canton.  But he still worked with my father and, and when my father passed away, he still carried on with my other brothers, the lumber business.  Coleman [Coleman Garrett] was the one who stayed closest to the, the site just outside of Canton when we moved there and carried on the lumber business and, and what have you.  He had spent time in the [U.S.] Army and was in the Burma [Myanmar] area and what have you. He was the only one of my brothers that went to the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Did you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But Canton was very segregated as, as you can imagine.
Speaker 1: Any stories about that time?
Speaker 2: No.  You just, you lived with it and, and knew what it was.  And--
Speaker 1: Was there anything that your parents had to tell you as far as being safe?  Was there anything that they specifically might have said to you? No (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Because we, we knew.  That's what we'd grown up as and so it didn't--
Story_ID: 633709
Speaker 1: Let's go back to, to your high school.  You, you said that there was a teacher who did the commencement exercises.
Speaker 2: She was the principal's wife--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and musician (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there a prom?  Was there a prom?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) no, of course not.  No prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You made your own graduation dress and it was white and you can do your own pattern, but that, that was it.
Speaker 1: Did you know what you would become after high school?  Did you know automatically that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: No I never went to high s- I went to school after high school a day without working a full time job.  So no, I didn't really know, but along the way I decided I wanted to go to medical school.  When I was in, just a senior in high school, my mother [Ola Brown Garrett] passed away.  And my younger sister [Ola Garrett] and I went to live with my older sister [Ozie Garrett Wattleton] who then lived in St. Louis, Missouri.  My younger sister graduated from high school in St. Louis.  But I started working when I got out of high school and I did all kinds of funny little jobs, working in laundries and on and on and on.  But I always had in my mind I wanted to be a doctor.  And I started school, I had my sister that's passed away, Alice [Alice Garrett], lived in Omaha, Nebraska.  So I went to Omaha to live with her and attended the University of Omaha [Omaha University; University of Nebraska Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska], which was had the distinction of being the only complete air conditioned university in the world 'cause it was all in one building (laughter).  So I started there and was pursuing a degree in biology.  Did two years there and was asked to come back to Saint Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri] as one of ten students who integrated Saint Louis University and we were told by Father Reinert [Paul C. Reinert] who was the president of the university at that time.  He sat us all down in a room and said, "You're here to get an education and that's all."  And so the ten of us became very close to make certain that we all got the education and we were all up to date on what we were doing in our areas.  I was majoring in biology.  And the guy that I married was one of those ten.  Meantime I'm going to school part-time and working at odd jobs and I worked in laundries and, and whatever I could, could do along the way.  Because I told you all of this--we were not rich people; we were a very poor family.  I set my goal, got my degree in biology with a minor in chemistry and philosophy and education.  You either had to take religion or philosophy because of the Jesuit background.  During that time I got married to one of those guys that was part of the ten.
Speaker 1: What, what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Philip [Philip Dennis].
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name is Philip.
Speaker 1: Name is, okay.  Let's--
Speaker 2: With one L.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's fill in some dates.  You graduated from high school in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-nine [1939].
Speaker 1: And that was from the Cameron Street School [Cameron Street High School, Canton, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: High school.  And you went to St. Louis in--
Speaker 2: I went to Omaha.
Speaker 1: Omaha first, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you had moved with your sister right after high school to St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how was that transition for you?  From, from Canton [Mississippi] to St. Louis (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was different, but it was okay.  I mean you know I was with family.  Mother's gone, father's gone, so.
Speaker 1: When did your father [Eugene Garrett] pass away?
Speaker 2: You would ask me that.  Nineteen, 1951, and he passed away in St. Louis.  See we brought him there 'cause he was--
Speaker 1: Was he ill?
Speaker 2: He was ill, yeah.
Speaker 1: So from St. Louis, that's when you went to Omaha.
Speaker 2: From St. Louis, now my child--got married to Philip.  From St. Louis, I went to Omaha, okay.  Then came back to St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year was this?
Speaker 2: I enrolled at Saint Louis University--let's see I graduated from Saint Louis University in 1953.  Philip and I got married in 1950, so I would guess 1948 or so.
Speaker 1: So between the time that you grad- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those were years ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: --yeah, that was eight years.  Between high school and going to college, you just worked.
Speaker 2: Yeah I worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 633710
Speaker 1: So what happens next?  You get married to Philip [Philip Dennis]--
Speaker 2: And we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you graduated [from Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: And we, and we get pregnant (laughter) with Pia [Pia Dennis Smith].  We both applied to medical school, Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  He went, I stayed home and took care of the baby and worked two jobs to support him in medical school.  And the year he was supposed to graduate, the year he did graduate, suddenly there was somebody else on the scene with a child to be.  And so we were divorced.  And I worked two jobs during that time.  I worked at what they call the St. Louis Chronic Hospital [St. Louis, Missouri] sort of as a nurse's aide, and then I worked at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] at night.  And my sister took care of my baby while I supported him in medical school.  And as things happen, there you are with somebody else on the scene with a pregnancy and what have you and so a divorce occurred.  My child was--I'm doing research at, at Washington University medical school [Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri] during this time, as I indicated as well as working at the post office.  Pia was, Pia is my daughter's name, was an allergic child and so the allergist that I took her to see was doing research on the same floor where I was.  And he said to me one day, "How is Pia?  I haven't seen her in a long time."  And I said, "Well it's a long story."  He said, "Well better hurry up and tell me because I'm leaving St. Louis [Missouri]."  I said, "You are, where are you going?"  He said, "To Denver [Colorado]."  Then he told me he was coming here to establish the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital [Denver, Colorado].  I said to him, "Do you need a good technician?" He said, "As a matter of fact, Eileen [ph.] can't go," which was his person.  And I was working in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and research.  Well we--I conferred with the boss that I was working with on establishing a book, which is listed in, in my bibliography, I mean a list of publishing people there.  And he said, "Are you serious?"  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "I'm going to Denver."  And he came back he said, "You've got the job if you want it."  Well I have to go to court and talk about taking the child out of town, so that--we worked that in. and so I came here to help him establish the laboratory altogether. I had the, the luxury of equipping the laboratory and doing all the work in asthma and allergy and infectious diseases.
Story_ID: 633711
Speaker 1: Pia [Pia Dennis Smith] was six years old when we came here.  And being very poor, I worked two jobs.  I worked at night and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Once you got to Denver [Colorado] as well?
Speaker 1: When I got to Denver, yes.  My neighbors would look out for my child.  There we--I was able to co-publish with them several articles that you will see in my, in my resume.  During that time, I was able to attend conferences, the physiology and biology conferences in Atlantic City [New Jersey] is where they were usually held.  Became very involved in the scientific area.  Represented, which was the Children's Asthma Research Institute [Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital, Denver, Colorado] that became known as CARI at the national level and the area of immunology and infectious diseases.  We published several articles.  And then I worked with them, moved from there sort of as a, a person who got off into arthritis along with that.  I can remember sitting in the conferences with Miss Alice Marriott [Alice Sheets Marriott] who owned the Marriott Corporation and so I had a chance to, to do things I think I would not have been able to do had I not been in the area that I was in.
Story_ID: 633712
Speaker 1: You get to where then you, you get tired of publishing or perish and waiting for people to grant- offer you grants and what have you.  And the person I came here with left [the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital, Denver, Colorado].  And we had a new administration and vacation went from a month to six, two, two weeks, and things were changing.  So I thought well, I'll try my hand at teaching.  I went back to DU [University of Denver, Denver, Colorado], took a class in teaching secondary level in the State of Colorado.  Went on back to my laboratory and was firmly planted there.  Had applied for a job and was told, "Don't call us, if we need you, we'll call you."  School opened here, opens--opened then the day after Labor Day.  And the Friday before Labor Day I got a call from the principal at a school right across from where I was working, which was Lake Junior High School [Denver, Colorado] and said, "Will you teach math for us?"  And I said well, told him my story that they said, "Don't, don't call us.  If we need you, we'll call you."  And the Friday before Labor Day I was in his office getting firmly planted in, in my teaching duties.  And so I taught math and science, general science, and counseled.  Well I didn't know anything about counseling, but it turns out the counseling they were calling was sort of like homeroom.  You just sit there.  I got with some other people and said, "This is not counseling.  Why don't we do something about upgrading this?"  Well I, I did that.
Story_ID: 633713
Speaker 1: And one day he came in, my principal said, "You know there's a job downtown I think you ought to apply for."  I said, you know, "What, why?"  I said--and I had never worked 180 days in my life and enjoyed it so much, you know, that time off.  And he said, "Well I think it's a job that you, you could do."  Well he gave me the application.  I threw it on my desk and then he came back and he said, "Did you fill out that application?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well I think you should."  I said, "Am I not doing a good job for you here [Lake Junior High School, Denver, Colorado]?"  And he said, "Yes you are, you're doing a good job.  That's why I'm telling you you need to do this because I think you could benefit the district much more than having your talents all locked up here at this school."  Well I applied and I was working that summer with the University of Colorado [University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado] in, in the counseling department in what we call the street scene where we bought students in and sort of exposed them to what would be, you know, the slums or what have you.  Just put them out there and say, "What would you do in this case?"  So I got called and I was late for the interview.  And I came back to them and I said, "I never said 'I don't know' so many times in my life."  As I did. I said, "So that was a waste of time."  So I was firmly planted in my office back at school, and the principal came in and said, "Carl Stenmark would like to see you downtown."  I said, "Who's Carl Stenmark?"  I didn't know anything about this.  I was not interested in, in this at all.  Well indicate--make a long story short, I got the job and my task was to implement and monitor the desegregation case for the school district.  (Laughter) And that was a task because we had gone, I mean when I say we, the district had gone all the way to the [U.S.] Supreme Court in its deseg case, and was remanded back to the Tenth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit] to say if Denver [Denver Public Schools] cannot, can prove that it is not operating a dual system, they have to do nothing.  If they can't, then they must implement this order, root and branch.  And what that ended up doing was we were transporting kids all over this district from one school to another and had to put that whole plan together.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-one [1971] is when, when we started, 1975 was when the order became--had to start implementing it.
Speaker 2: Let me go back just for one other year.  What year did you move to Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 1: Nineteen--Pia [Pia Dennis Smith] was six years old, 1958.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: July, 1958.
Story_ID: 633714
Speaker 1: So tell me about the process in getting all of this ready for the implementation of the desegregation.
Speaker 2: Well I was at a school board meeting on Thursday and they called me out and said, "We have to have a plan for the courts by Monday morning on how we're gonna prepare this city for the impending court order.  You need to give us a plan."  Well you don't do your most scholarly piece of work from Thursday to Monday, having not thought it out at all and what have you.  So we got together and we wrote out something and it took on an exhibit number of ZB-III, that's how you've gone through the number of exhibits.  It became known as the ZB-III project to implement the schools.  That was to talk about how you were gonna deal with parents, faculty, students and everything that would be concerned so you didn't get a Pontiac, Michigan, a flare up with people being upset and burning buses.  We did have some buses burned, however.  So it was a plan to say how you were gonna implement the district's--I mean the court order, and you were gonna deal with the population in Denver [Colorado] to implement that order.  I spent fourteen years in federal court.  The sitting judge at that time was Judge William Doyle [William E. Doyle].  We used to wave at each other as we went down the street.  He left the--that court and moved to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit].  And Judge Richard Matsch [Richard P. Matsch] was the judge how was appointed.  I don't know if you remember, would know the name, but he was the same judge that handled the Oklahoma City case.  So Judge Matsch and I spent fourteen years together in and out of court.  That thing that we--I put together became known, it took on an exhibit number of ZB Roman numeral three.  That's how many things that--and it became known in this, in the school district [Denver Public Schools] as ZB-III.  At the time the courts appointed a citizens' committee to mon- committee to monitor what was going on in the area of desegregating, and of course this is something that you could pick on because you can't really put numbers to say this.  And so I was always hauled into court to testify about what was going on and what was being done.
Speaker 1: And the fourteen year span that you're talking about is what years?
Speaker 2: For the court order?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh (yes).
Speaker 2: Nineteen, I started this in 1975 and I retired in 1998.
Speaker 1: A very long time.
Story_ID: 633715
Speaker 1: Well, let's step back a little back and--because Brown v. the Board of Education is in 1954 [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  So and you actually didn't come to Denver [Colorado] until '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it took until '71 [1971] for anything--what was going on between '58 [1958] and '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Our schools were being segregated and family, as a matter of fact, I noticed [HistoryMaker] Rachel Noel was one of your, your people.  Rachel was very imple- instrumental in getting this going and we had a family that, that filed the actual suit [Keyes v. School District No. 1] named Keyes.  But we were actually segregated schools.  And the superintendent at one time when this was--superintendent at this time, had to transport his kids, bus his kids to one of the worst schools where our children were attending, black children, who would get the books from his area, used books.  Suddenly that school got painted, and we got new, new kinds of equipment and the whole thing.  So people said was it worth it?  I said to that extent for--to take a black child across town to sit next to a white child doesn't mean anything.  But you get the benefit of what the white child gets that black children in this city were not getting.  And I'm saying black now because I, I've ca- our population at that time was predominantly black and white.  Now it's shifted.  It's now predominantly Hispanic.  But things changed as far as resources were concerned, transportation and the whole thing.
Story_ID: 633716
Speaker 1: During that time I had some very turbulent times.  My office was on the third floor of the administration building.  Had a glass panel about like that in front of my (unclear) stall.  This particular day I took off because I'd been working around the clock, working at night, going to neighborhoods, going to schools, going to churches and talking to people about what can happen with the meager staff that I had.  This particular day they put a bomb in the restroom just across the hall from my office.  And that glass panel shattered and went into the wall.  Had I been sitting there, God only knows what would have happened.  And of course the tobacco and alcohol people came after me and I said you know, "Come on.  Don't, don't get after me.  I'm, thank God I was off.  Thank God I was tired enough to take a day off."  But we had some buses burned.
Speaker 2: What year was this that the, the bomb was in the bathroom?
Speaker 1: You would ask me that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was at the administration building, right?
Speaker 1: It was at the administration building.  And you know I cannot offhand tell you what year.  This was all after 1975.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: I, I would have to--I just don't know, remember the exact year.
Speaker 2: And so you were, you were saying about the buses being burned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had some buses that were set, set on fire.  But we really never had any, any community uprisings where people and students were injured or hurt.  Now I used to go to lunch and they would call me and say, "Don't go, don't come back to the ad building, go to Place Middle School [Denver, Colorado]," as a for instance.  "Because things are, you know, flaring up over there.  As you get over there and, and bring your security with you, they're there."  And you calm things down.  So I found myself doing that all over the city where you would send.  And so we prevented a Pontiac, Michigan type of thing.  We never really had any, any uprisings where people were injured or children were injured.  We did have a few buses that were burned.  But otherwise that, that was, was about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now tell me what was your title exactly at this time?
Speaker 1: Community resource person.  I didn't really have a title.  Community specialist is what they called it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was kind of a low level (laughter) administrative title--
Speaker 2: That you did all the work (laughter).
Speaker 1: --they created (laughter).
Story_ID: 633717
Speaker 1: Let's go back just a little bit and I want to get your thoughts on the Civil Rights Movement.  And if you--what other part you might have played, if any, and your thoughts about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his assassination.
Speaker 2: My thoughts as to whether it was necessary, or--
Speaker 1: No, just what you were thinking at that time, or even in retrospect, what, what do you feel about that period of time?
Speaker 2: I--you know overall, I think it was a process that we had to go through.  Unfortunately, we lost lives in it, important lives of people--but I think overall it was necessary.  I hope it is sustainable and it's not being reverted back to the--probably will never go back I hope to that, that kind of level.  But I think Martin Luther King had a great impact on this country and on this world.  And personally I could feel for what he was doing because of what I was having to do.  And had great respect for what he was doing.
Story_ID: 633718
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about Park- I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--I wanted to go back.  Between '58 [1958] and '71 [1971] to just, you know, fill in some of the blanks during those years and the quote, unquote civil rights era and the things that you were doing during those years.  So I asked you about Five Points area [Denver, Colorado] and you were gonna tell me about Park Hill [Denver, Colorado].  So let, let's start there.
Speaker 1: Five Points area was the area for blacks in this, in this city.  That's where they have the clubs, that's where, you know, there wasn't a lot of shopping 'cause there wasn't a lot of shops down there.  But you had beauty parlors and barbershops and shoe shops and, and the entertainment, Rossonian [Rossonian Hotel, Denver, Colorado] used to be the entertainment spot for all these people that you have in, in your archives at this point.  There was nothing really east of Colorado Boulevard.  They built a school just west of Colorado Boulevard, it's Barrett Elementary School [Denver, Colorado], which became an integral part of the court order because my daughter [Pia Dennis Smith] was to go across, east of Colorado Boulevard to a school called Park Hill [Park Hill Elementary School, Denver, Colorado].  And they built Barrett, again was an effort to keep segregated schools going.  That entered as a part of the court order.  And she was--had signed up to go to Smiley Junior High School [William H. Smiley Junior High School; McAuliffe International School, Denver, Colorado] when the court order became active and being implemented and she ended up going to Gove [Aaron Gove Junior High School, Denver, Colorado] which was out of the segregated neighborhood.  So it had, had a lot of movement in effects.  And anything west of Colorado Boulevard is where we belonged.  East of Colorado Boulevard, which is now Park Hill, then we had some good citizens over there who started to say you know we need to do something about this.  As a matter of fact, the family that--the Keyes family that brought the suit [Keyes v. School District No. 1], lived in that area.
Speaker 2: Were they a white family or a black?
Speaker 1: No, they were a black family.
Speaker 2: Black family.  And they lived in Park Hill?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So you begin to see a shift, but it was brought on by, by the federal court order in desegregating the schools.
Story_ID: 633719
Speaker 1: But during that area- era I should say of civil rights, were there any marches or sit-ins or anything in the Denver [Colorado] area?
Speaker 2: You, you didn't, you, you didn't have marches, no.  To the extent I think that, I don't, I don't really, really remember marches or sit-ins like--I guess I was so busy if they were, that--
Speaker 1: Right.  And you were busy because you were back in school.  Is that, that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was back in school, I was working, I was raising a child.  And then we come into when she is in fifth grade and came home one day and said to me, "Mom, I wanna run track."  I said, "Go away, I don't know what you're talking about.  Don't know anything about track."  Well, being the persistent child that she is, I finally said, "Look." She said, "There's this coach who wants to start a girls track team."  And I said, "All right, (unclear)."  So I finally said, "Okay tell that coach to call me."  And he did.  Turns out he was going to field days looking at kids who winning blue ribbons and he wanted to start a track club.  And we talked about it and I said, okay, I'll get another mother that I knew that had a daughter about Pia's [Pia Dennis Smith] age.  And we started a little girls track club.  And we--I remember the first track meet that we had was at the Colorado School of Mines [Golden, Colorado], an indoor track club--I mean meet.  And the kids that we were competing against had nice little uniforms and they looked--nice little track shoes and everything and our girls were running in cutoff shorts and you know, whatever we had.  So I said to the mother, "We gotta do better than this."  Both of us could sew, so we got our sewing machines and, and we learned how to silkscreen.  Our club was known as the Denver All-Stars.  Next time we went to a track meet, they looked just as good as the rest of them.  And we started to fundraise and do things there.  And we sent--that mother's daughter was the first black athlete, female athlete that competed in the Olympic Games in 1976 [sic.] in, in Munich [1972 Summer Olympics, Munich, Germany].
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Pam Greene, was a sprinter and ran the 100 and the 200.  And that's how I got involved in track and field.  Well to compete nationally, you had to belong to the Amateur Athletic Union.  And they had associations in each state.  This was the Rocky Mountain association.  And your club had to belong to the association.  And so I was president of my club.  And so I started going to the association meetings.  And I thought well you know, I don't see anybody in here representing the kids that I'm representing.  And so I guess I better run for office.  And so I ran and I was vice president of the Rocky Mountain AAU, which then says you know, you got to do things.  So I became chairman of Region Ten, which took in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico for the women.  I had to have the implementation of programs in those areas for girls.
Story_ID: 633720
Speaker 1: During that time, they would go to the national meetings of the AAU [Amateur Athletic Union] and come back and tell me what I needed to do.  I said, "Well if you want me to do this job, then I ought to go and hear this, you know, myself."  So I started attending the AAU meetings.  And I said, "I don't see anybody up there as officers representing the kids that I'm representing, so I probably ought to run for office here."  And it turns out I was running against two Anglo males and of course their strategy was have to go to multiple ballots.  And so one would drop out.  The guy who was a track coach from Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut], a very well known track coach, said to me, "I wanna nominate you."  I said, "Gee, that's an honor, Bob."  His name was Robert Giegengack.  I said, "Why do you wanna nominate me?"  He said, "Because I wanna tell them you're a woman and you're a minority."  And I said, "Well Bob, I don't want you to do that if that's what you have to say."  And he said, "Well why?"  I said, "Well I just happen to be that.  You just need to tell them I'm a good administrator and that's why they ought to have me."  Well I, I beat those two guys royally.  And the president, and I tell you these because you have to have a lot of no sense or a lot of gall or a lot of something to keep you going there.  The president after that said, "Well ladies and gentlemen, we made history today.  We've never had an officer who didn't share an officer--room with another officer or who didn't wear a tuxedo."  And I said at the time that I could respond, "You gotta buy another room, but I can take care of the tuxedo bit."  So I say all of that to say you have to be able to take those kinds of things and, you know--well at the next time we met I was so shocked, they didn't know what to do.  First time they'd ever had a woman or a minority as an officer of that organization which was formed in 1896.
Story_ID: 633721
Speaker 1: By virtue of that, I went on to the United States Olympic Committee as an officer from the AAU [Amateur Athletic Union].  I found the same thing there, six old white men running the thing.  Well turns out they had had one woman who served as a secretary one term.  She had been a figure skating and had won a gold medal, but that was all they'd had as a secretary.  So I decided to run for vice president.  They had first, second, third vice presidents, and a president.  So they chose them in that order based upon the votes you got.  So the guy who'd made that statement about the room and the tuxedo got third vice president.  I was elected as second vice president, and Jack Kelly [John B. Kelly, Jr.], who's Grace Kelly's brother, if you can remember, was first vice president.  Well make a long story short, Jack became president.  Eight days after he was moved in as president, he dropped dead on the streets in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] running.  In the history of the United States Olympic Committee, the next person in line should move in as the president.  They jumped over me and got Helmick [Robert Helmick], who was the third vice president who had been the president of the AAU.  I tell you all of this to tell you some of the things that, that I've fought in this whole thing on, on, on women and minorities.  And the women in the area just sort of just went crazy and they--, "We don't understand why--?" At any rate to keep them quiet, he said to me, "Will you serve as my special assistant?"  I thought about it and I thought I'll do that 'cause I can have some influence.  Well he got in trouble and had to step down.  You know there's a just God somewhere.  And the person who came in as president said, "I want you to stay in that position with me."  Well I did with him to finish out his term and then he was reelected and I served as his special assistant then.  During all of this time, I'm getting involved with the athletes and what have you and I did this at the AAU.  With women's track and field I became chairman of women's track and field where I served for five or six years for the United States.
Speaker 2: Do you, do you know the years?  Well first tell me the year for AAU when you become vice president.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--it should be on my resume, but--
Speaker 2: Okay, it's in 19--
Speaker 1: I think it was 1978 maybe.  No, it was before that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's on there.
Speaker 2: We'll, we'll, we'll find the dates, that's fine.
Story_ID: 633722
Speaker 1: In my role working with women's track and field for the United States, I traveled a lot with teams.  And I, I made this statement to a group meeting in Munich [Germany] in a different area one time that I've traveled on every continent in the, in the world and, and some two or three times.  And a little guy said to me, "Have you ever been to Iceland?"  And I said, "Well no, but I didn't think of Iceland as a continent." But I--it provided me the opportunity to take athletes around the world.  And so I've had lots of first in this movement.  I was the first then female or minority to serve as a vice president of the [U.S.] Olympic Committee.  I was the first female or minority, male or female, to serve as what they call a chef de maison for a major team.  I did that at the Pan American Games in Caracas [1983 Pan American Games, Caracas, Venezuela].
Speaker 2: And what does that actually--
Speaker 1: You are responsible for that team and all the staff, for whatever happens.  You are the connection to the International Olympic Committee, the international Pan American Games group [Pan American Sports Organization].  I served as that in Caracas [Venezuela] at the Pan American Games, a very difficult assignment.  And I was the first chef de maison to serve, female or minority, at an Olympic Games.  I did that in 1988 in Seoul [1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, South Korea].  Then they came back and wanted me to serve as chef de maison for the Pan American Games competing in Cuba [1991 Pan American Games, Havana, Cuba].  All three very difficult assignments because of the, the reaction for men and particularly men in those areas to women being in leadership roles.  Mr. Castro and I, well became kissing buddies.  Every time he saw me, he wanted to kiss me.  When the, when the Gulf War broke out, I was sitting in a press conference with Fidel Castro in Cuba.  And I was like how can I get out of here quickly because he just ranting and raving.  You didn't know what he was saying, but you knew that he was ranting and raving about that awful United States, you could hear that coming through all the time.  But before I was, was ready to leave there, he found out I was in education and he said, "Would you consider coming to, to serve as my deputy of education for two years?"  And I said, "Sorry, can't do that."  "Oh," he said, "I can arrange."  And I said well--
Speaker 2: You're talking about Castro?
Speaker 1: Fidel Castro.  I said, "Well let's get the games over with and we'll talk about it."  Well the games about over with and had thirty-eight countries competing in these games.  And wherever we went, when I came in leading my delegation, that's where the cameras were peeled.  They tell me he knew every minute of the day where I was.  When the games were over he sent his interpreter to say tell her we need to talk about this before.  And I said, "Well, I have to accompany my team back home, so we'll talk about it later."  So that ended that conversation.  But I, I just tell you all that to tell you some of the things I've, I've come up against in, in, in my role in these areas.
Story_ID: 633723
Speaker 1: I have traveled to every Olympic Games except two, summer or winter, since '76 [1976].  I missed Albertville [1992 Winter Olympics, Albertville, France] and Lillehammer [1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer, Norway], both winter games.  But I've not missed another one since 1976.  So that's another side of, of my life that, that I had going on.  And the school district--one of the things I liked about that, I was free in the summertime.  But the school district even when it wasn't vacation was very generous in allowing me to do some of these things because they saw it as fostering help for young people, and sort of as a plus for the, the Denver Public Schools.  And so they were very generous in, in allowing me to do these kinds of things.  Getting back--so that's another side of what I was doing and, and I'm still doing that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you--do you have a position on the Olympic Committee now?
Speaker 1: I still represent now USA Track and Field on their national governing body council, which is where they get all of the sports involved in rule making and decision making and that kind of thing.  As matter of fact, I was just, just last week in, in Nassau [Bahamas] at a meeting on this kind of thing.  I became--during my throes of that, they had had a person who represented the U.S, U.S. Olympic Committee to what they called the Association of National Olympic Committees in this areas.  Takes in Mexico, South America, North America and the Caribbean island countries.  And we had a gentleman who had held that position for years passed away.  And they appointed me to take his position.  And when I walked into the meeting, the Association on National Olympic Committees is what they call it, they thought I had come to serve coffee.  Only woman, only woman in, in the place.  And one of the guys says, "She's in here." They took a big picture of us and I'm sitting there.  "She's, she's created a scene in our--," you know it was like what's wrong with United States to send this woman and this woman in particular there?  So I've done those kinds of things as, as I moved around in, in sports.  So yes, I'm still involved, still doing that, still working actively with USA Track and Field.
Story_ID: 633724
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you did all of this and you did go back to school.  You got your master's degree in, in--and that was in 1971.  What did you receive your master's degree in?
Speaker 2: In?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Counseling and guidance.
Speaker 1: So you felt that that counseling when you first got there, this is not counseling.
Speaker 2: This is not counseling.  We've got to do something about this, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was homeroom.  I mean you know kids hanging out the windows, reading funny books and, and that was what they were calling counseling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you got an advanced degree at Nova Univers- Nova--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nova Southeastern University [Nova University; Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] in educational administration.
Speaker 1: And that was in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were a very busy woman.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Story_ID: 633725
Speaker 1: Now talking about the Olympics, let's just pause for a second and talk about all of the things that are--have gone on and in particular about your thoughts about Marion Jones and the whole issue of sports and, and steroids.
Speaker 2: Let me back up.  You heard me say I went to every games?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know we boycotted the games in 1980 [1980 Summer Olympics, Moscow, Russia].  I have represented the United States in track and field in what is called the International--I'll get to Marion Jones--International athletic association federation [International Association of Athletics Federations] for some thirty years.  And the president said at the time that anybody who represented the United States in national--in international sessions like this should go.  And so that's how I ended up going to the games in 1980.  Stayed--didn't, didn't stay through the games, but was able to get into the village and to see one or two competitions.  As a result of, of us not going to the games, we all received Congressional medals of honor [Congressional Gold Medal] from, from Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].  And I've had my picture with every president since Gerald Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], except the current one [President George Walker Bush].  I just refuse to go with the team.  I just did not want to have my picture with this man.  And so I didn't go.  But so I have--and, and those are all at the Blair Caldwell library [Blair Caldwell African American Research Library, Denver, Colorado].  Charleszine [Charleszine "Terry" Nelson] came and took 'em all, all this stuff.  But yes busy is, is what I've been.
Speaker 1: And the Congressional medal, that was, that was quite an honor for you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  Not a lot of people get those I hear.  But they--he gave them to the team.
Story_ID: 633726
Speaker 1: Now Marion Jones for me was an extreme disappointment.  I was in charge of, of the team and, and the track team in Australia and Sydney [2000 Summer Olympics, Sydney, Australia].  If you would have told me that she was doing this, I would have said you're absolutely wrong.  You, you just, you just wrong.  I think we've all been disappointed.  I know that I'm working with USA Track and Field on what we call zero tolerance.  You know we just will not, will not condone it, we don't.  But we--it's, it's rampant.  I mean it's just not in track and field, it's, it's in, in so many sports.  And we think that the chemists are miles ahead of us before we can detect it.  They already out there running them.  I'm sure they're working on something new right now.  But it was just such a disappointment to me and to women's track and field and to the whole program, the whole amateur movement in this country.  We had to send that husband [C.J. Hunter] that she referred to home from Australia because we discovered that he was on drugs before it came out.  I think she had just made some very bad choices in the men that she associated herself with, and got taken up by Trevor Graham who was her coach.  And once we instituted the fact that they could make money--we used to call it the Amateur Athletic Federation.  They changed, they removed that name of amateur because kids were then being paid.  Once we put the pay in there, this is when the corruption really started because to, to, to, to lose a few thousand dollars by a hundredth of a second, you're gonna try to do whatever that other person is doing to keep up to get that, that, that going.  And this, this is what happened.  I had to go back to represent USA Track and Field and, and the drug testing agency that I was, I was--with one other person, was instrumental in establishing it.  Before congressional committee headed by the congressman from, from Michigan.  The black Congressman Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] I guess his name is.  Who was investigating track and field had to say the word that had come to him was that we were unduly testing black athletes.  And so they used the young lady whose, whose name was Kelli [Kelli White], who said that she was tested seventeen times, and that is unusual as you're over testing black athletes.  Well they had all these people speaking and the attorney from USADA [U.S. Anti-Doping Agency], which is our drug testing program and I were the last two to talk.  He was gonna be last.  Well I went to the microphone and I said you know, "Yes, I'm not surprised that Kelli wasn't tested more than seventeen times because when you're running in meets that are sanctioned by the International Amateur Athletic Federation [International Association of Athletics Federations], you're always tested.  And Kelli was in Europe running in our AAF meets, making money.  And so yes she was tested."  And I said, "But for those clean athletes who knows that you're supporting this person, you're gonna get beat by a hundredth of a second and get the money, they're saying hey, you got to do something about this.  So yes, we're testing as fast as we can test.  But we can't keep up with the chemists."  And Marion was just absolutely a disappointment to all of us.  And I think the thing that made her come out and, and say right off, she got tied up in a check kiting situation with Tim Montgomery, who was her husband after the other one.  And so she made some bad decisions along those lines and we're all sad about it.  As you travel around the world, don't think they don't look at you and say, "You have any clean ones?"
Story_ID: 633727
Speaker 1: You talk about difficult situations and I just wanna go back to hear the ending of the story about Castro, about Fidel Castro.  Did you ever talk to him?  He sent a message that he wanted you to come and, and work with education?
Speaker 2: Before--he always had receptions at the Palace of the Revolution [Havana, Cuba], which was--you would think you were walking into a, a reception at the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York] or something.  I mean plush, anything you wanted--food, drinks, and I mean plush.  Somehow the television was always keyed on, on me and, and my delegation.  And he had a reception on the last night of, of the competition when we were ready to leave the next day.  So he sent his interpreter over to say, "Okay, I need an answer from her."  And I said, "Tell him that I must accompany my team back home and I'll get in touch with him after that."  So that's been the end of that.
Speaker 1: That was the end.
Speaker 2: But I have pictures with him, Charleszine [Charleszine "Terry" Nelson] as them at the, at the library [Blair Caldwell African American Research Library, Denver, Colorado].  And with him and with his, his guy who was his deputy at the Bay of Pigs and, and the whole kind of thing.  They're personable.  When we went on many of our visits, he was telling us how he was gonna solve his transportation problems.  He was getting unassembled bicycles from China and from Russia and he was gonna have his country people assemble those, and then they would get a bicycle to ride.  And we said, "Well Mr., Mr. President, can we have some of those for our village when we come for the games?"  And he said, "Oh, yeah, yeah."  So when we got there, he delivered, had delivered twenty-five bicycles to us.  And Pam Shriver (laughter) got on one and it collapsed.  By the time they were all ridden, they all fell apart.  So that was his, his bicycle kind of thing.  But he was very personable, very personable.  But I got out of that working for him that way (laughter).
Story_ID: 633728
Speaker 1: What about the situation in--with North and South Korea?  Was that a difficult situation at that time?
Speaker 2: I, I never went to North Korea, it was South Korea.  It was, it was difficult from the standpoint of being a female working with their people, no women whatsoever, and not a lot of regard for women in positions like the one I had.  That's where it was difficult.  And the same thing in Caracas [Venezuela], aside from the poverty and the village that was inadequate.  And the same thing in Cuba, you know.  Not much regard for people who are on the level with the men, being a woman.
Story_ID: 633729
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: You were asking me about Donna, about women's sports--
Speaker 1: About, yeah, about Title IX and that you were a staunch advocate and spokesperson for that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I worked, worked with Donna Lopiano at the Women's Sports Foundation and the whole thing in Title IX.  Mainly through what we were doing with the United States Olympic Committee.  And we're still--while one of the committees I chaired while I was, was there as special assistant to the president was--had to do with diversity and inclusion of women and minorities, starting with the Olympic offices itself, which still needs a lot of help, lot of help.  And then looking at the various sports organizations within the Olympic movement.  And Donna was one of those that, that was very active in the Women's Sports Foundation and she said, "You know it's, it's--doesn't seem to be going anywhere like it should."  We're still trying, still trying.
Story_ID: 633730
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Back to school?
Speaker 1: Back to school, yeah.  So we're in 1988 and you become the deputy superintendent of--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-eight [1988] I was--they had done a search for a superintendent and didn't find anybody they wanted.  And the person who headed their search committee had then an assistant superintendent in Denver Public Schools, and went to be superintendent in the Cherry Creek schools [Cherry Creek School District] which is just south of us here.  And he came to me in my office and said, "Evie [HistoryMaker Evie Garrett Dennis] what is, what do you have for your goal in the district from now?"  I said, "I'm getting ready to retire."  And he said, "I thought you might say that, but the board has not--we didn't find a superintendent we want and the board has asked me to serve as superintendent for one year and I've agreed to do that.  I'd like you to serve as the deputy superintendent for two years."  And I said, "No, I'm getting ready to retire," but then I said, "You're gonna serve for one year, why do you want me to serve for two years?"  He said, "Well one year with me and one year with the new superintendent."  I said, "Well the new superintendent might not want me. No I don't wanna do this.  I'm getting ready--." Well I talked to my daughter [Pia Dennis Smith] and she said, "Well mom, do it because you may be able to do some things that you have not been able to do that you'd like to see done in the district."  So I agreed.  At the end of the first year, he came down and he said, "Well, I'm going, but the board's gonna ask you to serve as superintendent." (Laughter) I said, "No, no way, no way."  Well by virtue of my educational background, I had a superintendent's license.  Well a lot of people talked.  I said, "Well okay, I'll do it for one year."  Evaluation time, "We want you to continue for another year."  Evaluation time--well it got to be four years.  End of near the fourth year, they came.  I said, "No, my contract ends and I'm out of here.  Find yourself a superintendent."  In the meantime, I had spent that last year as superintendent off and on in federal court with Judge Matsch [Richard P. Matsch] asking for the release from the court order.  By now we're transporting kids all over this city [Denver, Colorado] from one segregated school now to another because of the shift in the demographics in our student population.  And my, my reason for doing that was to say let's put the resources that we're using in buses and transportation into the classroom.  Didn't realize that he wouldn't keep his strict orders that he had in place.  And so I spent the last four weeks before I retired in his courts doing that.  One year after I retired to the day, he had his deputy call me and say--his bailiff call me and say, "Tell her that I'm releasing the school district.  I want her to know before I let them know."  But he did without putting any binding stipulations in how things should be run.  Just sort of left it up to them.  And so things are not--here I try to stay away from the schools, not going the way it is.  However, the population has shifted so drastically to now to a predominantly Hispanic school district as opposed to was black when we were doing this.
Story_ID: 633731
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of the other things as superintendent [of the Denver Public Schools] that you accomplished during those four years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, I closed some schools that were empty. I closed several schools.  But I also created, and you see his picture up there with Raymond Burr, the Denver schools, school of the arts and sciences, and, and the School of the Arts that, that's now become I'd say a Colorado school of the arts because they allow, they allow kids to come in from neighboring districts to the Denver School of the Arts [Denver, Colorado].  That's one of the things that I did.  We closed several schools that were under populated.  We instituted some programs.  I had several programs, one had to do with--we called it Denver Energy and Education and Energy Program [sic. Denver Energy, Engineering and Education Program], where we had kids into sciences, special sciences.  We created the international studies school [Denver Center for International Studies] at West High School [Denver, Colorado].  There were several others.  It must be in my resume somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's slipping my mind right now.  But Denver School of the Arts was, was the, the real jewel that I was able to pull together.
Speaker 1: And, and who were some of the, the teachers that helped to put that, that program together and why did you think it was important? That--
Speaker 2: I think it was important because we were, we were tending to, to slip away from music, arts, and, and, and those kinds of programs because of budget, you things that's cut, art, cut out this, cut out that and what have you.  And so I, I think what's important from that standpoint.  Actually, there were two board members, one, God rest his soul, has passed away, that was just, just--both of them have passed away, wanted to do this.  And they had tried to get three superintendents before me to implement this school, and they wouldn't touch it.  And so when I became superintendent, they said, "Well what we do?"  I said, "I'm, I'm willing to look at it."  And so they had been working with Raymond Burr, who then came into town and had the first fundraiser with me to get--help it get off the, off the ground and get started.  But it was a dream of two board members that had, had thought of this as, as a--I can't take credit for dreaming it up.
Story_ID: 633732
Speaker 1: And the American Israel Student Exchange Program?
Speaker 2: I had the responsibility--we had a board member, the first after [HistoryMaker] Rachel Noel, the next person, black board member, was Omar Blair [Omar D. Blair].  I'm surprised you guys haven't--I didn't see him in your book, but I'm surprised that hasn't been one that you would want to, want to get.  He would go to the Council of Great City Schools [Council of the Great City Schools], which took an--located in Washington, D.C. that involved fifty largest school districts in the, in this country.  And he'd see programs and hear programs and, and come back, "Well let's put this one together."  And I would say, "Okay Omar, we would--we need to get somebody--and I want you to do it."  So he comes back with this one called Denver Energy and, and became a--took on an acronym of DEEEP [Denver Energy, Engineering and Education Program], DEEEP, Energy and, and whatever.
Speaker 1: Engineering and Education Program (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Engineering and Education.  Want you to do that.  Then he'd go back and before that he was somewhere and he heard Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] talking about Excel [PUSH Excel] schools, Excel schools.  He comes back, "We want to do Excel with Jesse."  I said, "Omar, get somebody--I want you to do that."  So Jesse and I put together Excel in the school district.  DEEEP program in the school district [Denver Public Schools], and whatever he would go (laughter) and see and think was good, he'd come back and say, "I want this to happen.  Superintendent, get Evie [HistoryMaker Evie Garrett Dennis] to do this."  Well so I got involved in doing those kinds of programs and what have you.  And--
Speaker 1: The American Israel Program was--
Speaker 2: That was one of his babies too that he thought about.  Came back and said we want you to do this one.  And we sent students to Israel from across the district, chose them by their counselors in their, in their respective schools.  This is how they put them together.  And the ADL [Anti-Defamation League] here and some other Jewish organizations would help with support, financial support and that kinds of things that we needed to get the kids to go to Israel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did that for several years.  I'm not sure if they're still doing it now, I doubt it.  I, I don't know.  I try to stay away from the schools and not, not meddle.  They've had, let's see, seven, eight superintendents since me.
Speaker 1: They had how many?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Story_ID: 633733
Speaker 1: So you talk about your retirement and that you try and stay away from the schools.  So tell me what it is that you're doing today?
Speaker 2: I'm still--I go to a sorority meeting once in a while.
Speaker 1: You didn't tell me about when you pledged.  When did you pledge? And who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen forty-five [1945] in Omaha [Nebraska].
Speaker 1: And you pledged?
Speaker 2: AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].
Speaker 1: AKA, okay.
Speaker 2: What is it I'm doing now?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: I still represent track and field at the international level.  I was just in China at the--I was in Osaka [Japan] last year at the meeting of the International Amateur Athletic Federation [International Association of Athletics Federations], which is the world governing body for track and field.  I was just in Nassau in the Bahamas at an area meeting of that organization, representing track and field.  I head up for USA Track and Field, their diversity committee and their international relations committee.
Speaker 1: And what does that entail?
Speaker 2: That entails trying to work cooperatively with international organizations and we're pulling that together very strong right now, to influence our friends across the country because Chicago [Illinois] is bidding for the U.S. Oly- the Olympic Games [2016 Summer Olympics].  And how can we among the people that we know, influence them to vote, if we can, for Chicago.  So it's that kind of lobbying kind of stuff that, that I head up for track and field in the United States.  Like I said, I'm doing that diversity thing where we're trying to get more women minorities, people with disabilities involved in, in the movement.  Run around to my grandson's [Alex Smith] football games.
Story_ID: 633734
Speaker 1: Who is your grandson?
Speaker 2: My grandson is Alex Smith.  He plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  He was drafted when he graduated from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] as--four years to go now.  He's in his fourth year.  My granddaughter is refusing I think to graduate from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] 'cause she doesn't wanna leave Los Angeles [California], but--. "I all- I got to have another credit," and she--very two different kids.  He's so focus, she's happy go lucky kind of thing, but she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is grandmother, your granddaughter's name?
Speaker 2: Danielle Smith.  And that's--
Speaker 1: And you talk a little bit about your daughter [Pia Dennis Smith].  Tell me about her and, and what she does.
Speaker 2: My daughter was principal at East High School in Denver [Colorado], and then she went to work for Community College of Denver [Denver, Colorado].  And I think she still does some online teaching for them.  She, well she taught in the school district.  She biology and science, general science.  And now since we've got a professional football player, he's established a foundation, and she's working that foundation.  Established a board.  She and, and I help out, and I serve on the board with her, with several people from the Tampa Bay [Florida] area.  He has already, and he aims to provide assistance to kids to get into private schools or academic schools.  He's already provided a scholarship for a young black kid from Denver to go to school where he graduated, Mullen High School here in, in Denver.  He does a football camp for Bahamian youngsters, he's done it now for three years.  His father is Bahamian.  So they have dual, my two grandchildren have dual citizenship.  So he goes over and he does a football camp for kids in the Bahamas during his off time every July.  And he brings in some of his teammates and some of his classmates who are playing football, and some of his coaches and what have you, to help him put the camp on.  So she's handling now his foundation and, and helping him with that camp.  That's what she's doing, and still teaching a class online for community college.
Story_ID: 633735
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about?  I, I don't wanna miss anything in your life that now that you had a little more time to think about it, that we might have missed.
Speaker 2: Some of my travels with the track and the field program [USA Track and Field], other than with the Olympic program, has, have--my travels have taken me, like I said, to every continent except Iceland that I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Well how about some stories about some of your travel?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Some of those--trying to travel with girls and boys and track clubs and living in dormitories and living in hotels and before, before the advent of the pill, you know, to make certain you took those kids back home like you, you left them, was, was an experience.  And I had traveled into, like I said, Russia and to Germany.
Speaker 1: What was it like in Russia?
Speaker 2: Very, very sparse, but in the athletic area, the people you're competing with and what have you, very friendly, very nice.  When I was there in 1980, it was, it was very structured.  They march you to your room and when you were ready to go, it's like they knew what you were doing.  Ready to pick up my suitcase, I hear a knock on the door and this woman comes in and looks all around and then says--I was sleeping on a, on a, a wooden bunk bed, it's nothing in there I wanted.  And I had an old black TV that was, was pinned on one station, and that was panning the audience at the games; I couldn't move them.  So it was that kind of thing.  Very, very tense.  But this was when we were in Moscow [Russia].  When I was with the team and we traveled in Odessa [Ukraine] and in Donetsk [Ukraine], we moved and into Saint Petersburg [Russia], well Leningrad at that time.  We moved from the capital, they were very friendly, very nice.  Wanted you always to drink vodka and eat caviar, which I didn't like at all, but one of the receptions they had, they served the children apple juice and I discovered the apple juice instead of the brown vodka, and had one and they caught me.  They said, "No, no, no, you've got to drink the vodka."  Oh my god, I can't do that.
Story_ID: 633736
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of things.  And then I traveled with a team from Russia straight into Dakar in Senegal.  That was, was very interesting.  As a matter of fact, they just poured the track, it was not still dry when we got there.  But the difference in, in the natives and the, and the luxury behind the walls was, was just sort of disappointing to me.  Got to go to the island of Goree [Goree Island, Dakar, Senegal] with the team to see where the slaves were all put out and, and moved out.  In my, in my visit to Johannesburg [South Africa], we were there right after they bombed, did the bombing in Cape Town [South Africa] and so we were sort of like in a camp, you know, for security kind of thing.  I didn't like Johannesburg because of the dire poverty and right next door is the luxury.  It's just, just really, really luxury.  And Italy, ate a lot of pasta, and, and very friendly.  In Australia of all the games, Olympic Games that I went to from my '76 [1976 Summer Olympics, Montreal, Canada] one, I think I enjoyed the one in, in Australia [2000 Summer Olympics, Sydney, Australia] most of all.  Even just now in China [2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing, China].  I, I still have the, the fond memories and the enjoyment in Australia.  It was just different and the people were different and--
Speaker 2: What do you mean different?
Speaker 1: Friendly, food was good.  They were helpful and I don't know, I just enjoyed it most.  And maybe it was because I didn't have to work so hard that time.  But maybe that was, was why.

Speaker 1: In Cuba you've heard--Cuba was very different.  I made three visits there and then went back for the games.  When I was back for the games [1991 Pan American Games, Havana, Cuba], never had the revenge before until that time.  I couldn't live in the village, they wouldn't let me live in the village.  They built a little hotel just at the beginning of the village.  One day I couldn't go to my office in the village, couldn't go to work, so I had the revenge, okay I had to stay.  The next one I saw Castro [Fidel Castro].  Wherever we were, if we were at a competition, if he was there, I was sitting next to him with his people with all their bags.  He said, "I heard you weren't feeling well yesterday."  I'm saying, "How could he hear that?  How could he know that?"  They said, "He knows every minute of the day where you are."  We have some of our competition at the--what was Santiago de Cuba [Cuba], which was removed.  And on one of the many visits to Cuba leading up to the games, I made the statement that I like to fish or something.  Well we went to Santiago and they had this fishing expedition ready for me at ten o'clock in the morning.  And they had the party before with the brown vodka and, and all of this stuff.  They take me out in this boat.  It was hot in the water in Cuba.  And there was a boat alongside us and I'm sure when, when I casted out, they all applauded.  She knows how to, to fish.  I get this funny little fish about this long on the, on the hook and I know that boat next to me must have got that hook and put that thing on there.  And they say, "You caught a fish."  And I, I said, "Well I'm sure glad we can go," 'cause we were burning.  Make a long story short, when I got back to Havana [Cuba], next time I saw Castro he says, "I understand you had luck at fishing."  (Laughter) He knew, knew the size of the fish that I caught.  So it was an interesting kind of thing. And we had our supplies, our medicine and our water and that kind of thing on the ship, the Good Samaritan ship that would go around.  They docked in, in the, in the bay to--for--to keep our supplies.  Everyone--and the water was as darks as this around.  And every morning he had divers dive off of there to inspect the bottom of that ship.  Because he had heard that there were people coming back to, to cause trouble and what have you.  But that's what Cuba was like. Caracas [Venezuela], extremely poor.  I mean the village--we--that's where I learned how to do electrical work and how to do plumbing.  I mean the village was just not, not, not there.  We had--when we left Hollywood, Florida, which is where we processed and went--got to Cuba, called back to Florida and said, "Tell the athletes if they're taking anything more than an aspirin, please don't come over here because they're testing, they're testing hard."  They came.  Found out this was happening one said, "I've got to go home, my wife's having a baby."  Or, "I got to go home--," gave us warning that there's something that's there.  So you had different things happening at different situations.  You had to be able to deal with that.  And that particular trip, the deputy superintendent [of Denver Public Schools] at that time had said, "Just take vacation" because it was at a time when, when school was not out.  So I was gonna charge it to the vacation.  When the drug thing broke, the executive director and I were on television back to the United States.  And when I got back home and went to work, he said, "Okay kid, what are we gonna do now?" (Laughter) I said, "Okay we got to do something."  But it worked out all right.  But I had those kinds of situations, those kinds of experiences on and on.  When I was in Egypt, in Cairo, they wanted to show you everything and they wanted you to get on camels and they wanted you to ride and do these kinds of things.  And you had to somehow be gracious enough to say, "Sorry, but I can't get on a camel and, and move."  So it depends on the area where you are and what, what their, their mores and what they, they do that they want you to do.  And yet you don't wanna be seen as the snob from the United States who don't want to do this.  But--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --takes a lot of skill (laughter).
Story_ID: 633738
Speaker 1: And what about the China games [2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing, China]?
Speaker 2: I--any country that bids for the games and gets it will have a hard time anywhere matching what China has done.  That was my--I was in Beijing [China] in 1980.  I led a team from the United States.  We had competition in Tokyo [Japan] and then we went from Tokyo and we had competition with eight countries, eight other countries, seven other countries and us. Changed tremendously.  It has changed tremendously.  They spared nothing.  It will be a games that I don't think any other country will ever be able to, to match.  The facilities were outstanding.  The competition was great.  People worried about the safety after the, the guy that was, was stabbed [Todd Bachman], but he was not with the team and, and with us as the, as the staff and that kind of thing.  He was on a tourist trip.  Turns out his son-in-law [Hugh McCutcheon] was a coach of the volleyball team, but it could have happened anywhere.  But the hospitality was great.  The food, you had American food, you had all kinds of food you wanted.  It was a great games is, is, is what I would say (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you.  There was some question about the, the young gymnast.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: About the age.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How was that--all that handled?
Speaker 2: Well they said that the day that the child is born, the child is one year old.  They came up with something that nobody can refute.  But those were nothing but babies.  Did you seen any of them?
Speaker 1: Yes I did.
Speaker 2: Little limber babies.  That's, that's all.  But they, they questioned her, people questioned her and the International Olympic Committee, they questioned it.  And the last I heard is that they had accepted what they came up with.
Speaker 1: I mean but is that fair?
Speaker 2: No it isn't.  But if you can't prove that it's not right, what can you do about it?
Speaker 1: That's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not fair at all.
Speaker 1: That's, that's very true.
Story_ID: 633739
Speaker 1: Now I have to ask you this since I'm from Atlanta [Georgia], about the '96 games [1996 Summer Olympics] in Atlanta.  Were you there?
Speaker 2: I was referee of the track and field commi- meet there.
Speaker 1: And tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: It was an interesting experience.  As a matter of fact, I had one of my un- unhappy duties that I had during that time was to disqualify the Ghanaian relay team.  And when I did that, the media came out and said to me, "Who are you?  Why are you doing that?" (Laughter) But so you have those kinds of things too.  But Juan Antonio Samaranch made a statement that it was a games.  You know usually he says, it's a great games, and it was great things.  Atlanta made some mistakes, but overall it wasn't, I don't think the worse games that I had attended.  It, it wasn't any worse than, than Montreal [1976 Summer Olympics, Montreal, Canada].  It--the shooting, I mean the bombing, it could happen anywhere, and the shooting happened in Munich [1972 Summer Olympics, Munich, Germany].  So I think Atlanta's games were not as bad as, as the media or the powers that be tried to make it out to be.  I had a good time.
Story_ID: 633740
Speaker 1: Tell me, if you haven't already, the most memorable Olympic Games that you attended and why.
Speaker 2: I can remember a lot of them.  But I guess Seoul [1988 Summer Olympics, Seoul, South Korea] would be one because as the leader of the team from the United States, the president of the International Olympic Committee and his group had decided that they would not allow full teams to march in the opening ceremonies.  It would just have representative people.  And I said as the leader of the team, "If my full team cannot march, then we won't march at all."  Well discussion, discussion.  Okay, they relented to let the full teams march.  So we're coming to the stadium, and--cause we rehearsed with the kids and we talked to them over and over about the conduct on the field and what have you.  We're marching in and the back of our team, there were kids back there with cameras, with Mickey Mouse ears, with signs from, "Hi Mom."  All kinds of things, cutting up in the back of the line and we're talking about hundreds of kids now.  'Cause our teams usually run six hundred or so.  And so I'm up front, I don't see this.  They cut up so bad that they impeded the two countries right behind us.  The next morning I get pictures blown up, big pictures and a request to come meet with Samaranch [Juan Antonio Samaranch], et al, to let me know how bad my team was.  Well ended up I had to take gifts and visit the teams, the countries we impeded to our--right behind us, and apologize.  That I think was the, the most disappointing, yet memorable kind of thing.  A good memory was Australia [2000 Summer Olympics, Sydney, Australia].  It simply was because of the atmosphere, the, the, the competitiveness of our team and the good team where you didn't really have problems and, and what have you.  And, and I just enjoyed that one most.
Story_ID: 633741
Speaker 1: You said something about Los Angeles [1984 Summer Olympics, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Well I was gonna tell you at the time, you know, Los Angeles [California] ended up with the games because the country [Iran] that had them, had been awarded the games, backed out.  And so Los Angeles agreed to pick them up.  And the officers of the United States Olympic Committee had to sign a note saying that if there was deficits, bills owed, we would be responsible.  And I looked at that and I said, well I have a little house and child [Pia Dennis Smith] and they, they can't get much out of that, that's all I have.  And so I ended up signing a, a note as another officer, to be responsible for any shortfall in, in funding.  Turns out it's the only games that had a profit. Pete Ueberroth [Peter Ueberroth] put that together so well.  I was the officer who served on his board of directors.  And he made a speech in Colorado Springs [Colorado] to talk about that's the first time that an Olympic Games had made money.  And he said, "I made money because I had seventy-seven thousand volunteers that I didn't pay a cent."  And he said, "I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't know as Evie Dennis [HistoryMaker Evie Garrett Dennis] did and she's here in the audience."  And so it was, was really kind of funny.  But that was probably one of the, the good ones for us.  But we, we were able to establish an Olympic foundation that does aid chil- athletes in, in their training and, and what have you.
Story_ID: 633742
Speaker 1: Because you have this foundation that aids in children going to the Olympics, I don't think we talked about athletics in the schools here in Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 2: Well I fought any cutback in athletics and, and the arts.  And the board of education [Denver Board of Education] at that time said, "Well we would expect you to feel that way, but we need to cut it."  I said, "Well we're not gonna cut them.  Children need the arts and they need to be able to get out and run and jump and play and take a break from that."  And so I was able to maintain programs in, in the athletic area as well as in the arts because of my strong stance on that.  I understand now they've cut back a lot in the athletic program, and that, some of that, those things are the first things to go.  We've got to focus on reading and writing and arithmetic.  But you do need to give those kids time to get out and, and run and jump and, and get some fresh air kind of thing.  But I fought that to, to the nth degree.  We're not gonna cut back here.  We may cut back some teachers, we may make some classes a little bit bigger, but we're gonna keep, maintain these two programs.  And I was able to do that.
Story_ID: 633743
Speaker 1: What's next for you?  What have you not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Rest (laughter).  You know I don't know.  I, I don't have any great things in my future that I'd like to do besides--I, I still travel more than I, I think I ought to.  So I go now to my grandson's football games.  Especially home games.  I, I started going to his away games and you don't get good, good facilities and tickets.  But I go to Tampa [Florida] a lot.  I travel with him to Nassau [Bahamas] when he's doing that.  I don't think there's much else that I would want to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I've traveled the world and I've been able to do it with somebody else's dime.  So it's, it's been a real--although I give up my time.  You think I'm busy doing this, but I don't have to pay it out of my pocket, and it helps a lot.
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there a specific time that just stands out for you?
Speaker 2: Well big one is the birth of my child [Pia Dennis Smith] (laughter).  That, that's a--and my two grandchildren [Alex Smith and Danielle Smith].  A time that stands out.  I guess some of my visits to the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Like I said, I've had a chance to, to have my picture made with every president except the current one.  And I just refuse to go with the team there.  And the receptions that, that I've had with--the one in particular with Papa Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] and, and Barbara [Barbara Bush].  They bring the teams back to the White House after the games.  And this particular time they had the South Lawn set up with picnic tables and we were gonna have hot dogs and hamburgers and potato chips and ice cream.  And a storm came and just blew the tents and, and the tables.  So they moved it into the basement of the White House.  And the kids are sitting around eating potato chips and ice cream and the [U.S.] Secret Service people are going crazy 'cause Barbara and, and Papa Bush are just having a good time with the kids.  And one looked at the other, he said, "Only in America could this happen." The Secret--I said, "Well you guys don't need to follow them around. They're not gonna--these kids aren't gonna bother the--," but I thought that was a real interesting kind of one.  Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], we had--I'm with all these guys now, realize I'm the only woman with these officers and people that--from the USOC [U.S. Olympic Committee] that's there and he said to me, "Get out of the way you guys.  Let me stand next to this beautiful lady," kind of thing.  So you have all that.  And Charleszine [Charleszine "Terry" Nelson] has all those pictures [at the Blair Caldwell African American Research Library, Denver, Colorado].  I'm sorry I can't, can't provide them for you.  But I can show you a picture of my father [Eugene Garrett] and my grandmother and her sister out here on, on the wall.  But that was a memorable one for me.
Speaker 1: And you, you mentioned that you didn't wanna have your picture taken with George W. Bush. [President George Walker Bush]  Do you wanna share why?
Speaker 2: Do I have to say?  I just don't like the man. (Laughter) Is that a reason to not?
Speaker 1: Yes it is.  When you look back over your life, is there anything that you would have done differently or that you would have changed?
Speaker 2: I probably wouldn't have--well it wasn't my fault that I got a divorce.  But he [Garrett Dennis' ex-husband, Philip Dennis] doesn't--he talks about it all the time, what a mistake he made.  But we're still good friends.  Matter of fact, talked to him yesterday after my grandson's football game, so--and I've never remarried since then.  I just been busy and I did have a friend here who passed away, but--
Story_ID: 633744
Speaker 1: Because this is for future generations, hopefully they'll be many, many generations that will see your story, is there something that you would like to say to the future generations?
Speaker 2: One of the things I want to say is get an education and make certain it's a quality education.  Be firm in what you believe.  Set some goals and work hard at getting there and don't try to find excuses as to why you can't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anything else?
Speaker 2: And the basis of that is education.  And I wanna say good home training.  But sometimes they--kids are not with homes, but can still succeed.  But whatever that foundation is, don't make excuses for why you can't, find reasons for why you can.  Because I've never been rich.
Story_ID: 633745
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for the African American community for the future?
Speaker 2: I'm concerned about gang members.  I'm concerned about the lack of education and, and the will to, to succeed in spite of the adversities that you have.  The tendency to blame others for my lack of success.  But I also realize that when you have parents that have to work, or only one parent and the television becomes the parent, kids don't read because they don't read.  I often thought about how did I teach my child [Pia Dennis Smith] to read.  She was reading when she went to kindergarten.  And the more I thought about it, is I didn't do anything special.  I cut the television off and we read, and we don't have that anymore when you've got parents--if you got two parents, they're both probably working trying to make ends meet.  If you got one, think of what that child is doing.  I, I visited schools.  As a matter of fact, I went into this school and teacher said, "Can I touch you? 'Cause I've never seen a real live superintendent."  But I walked into a school and there was a little kid up where they hang their coats in here, and the little kid was up under coat rack, he's just crying his eyes out.  And I said, "Honey, what's the matter?"  He said, "My feet hurt."  I said, "Your feet hurt? Why?" "I had to wear my brother's shoes and they're too little."  I said, "Why did you have to wear your brother's shoes?"  "'Cause we don't have but that one pair."  I said, "Where is your brother?"  "He's at home, he had to stay at home today so I could wear the shoes."  I said, "Come on, honey."  Multiply that.  Took him to the office.  I said to the social worker, "Get this child some shoes."  How--multiply that.  Think you've got these children coming here trying to learn.  We think they can learn.  He's not gonna learn anything.  We've got to take all of that into consideration.  And I say we got to do this, this and this.  You've got to look at what's happening to these children.  His mother sent him to school.  She had to keep the other one at home so he could come.  So don't blame the parents entirely.  What can we do to help them know that--we've got to cut out the television.  Now we've got these things.  Won't know how to multiply two times two if you put it on the paper for them.  These are the kinds of things that we've got to say we've got to do something about.  Because we, we are not looking at the real reasons why some of this is occurring.  But multiply that one little kid by dozens and hundreds, and we think they ought to be learning.  The teachers are, most of them are teaching as hard as they can.  But you have that.  Maybe Barack's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] gonna do something about it.
Story_ID: 633746
Speaker 1: They're gonna--hopefully there's a committee that will name a school after you in the near future.  Tell me what do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The committee is working hard at it, my committee is.  Board of education [Denver Board of Education] will have to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your committee is working hard at it.  I'm sure that that's something that will come to be in the, in the near future.  But tell me what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I did all I could to help young people reach their goals.  That during my time as superintendent [of the Denver Public Schools], I set some educational standards that I think--I don't know if they're still doing them, that I would like to see continue.  Number one is that reading, reading with them.  One of the things I had with people, teachers that I worked with as a superintendent I said, "Look, you guys get together in your school and when you're teaching measurements in math, inches and, and milligrams and grams and these kinds of things, work with the teacher in home economics and see if they can't do the same with measurements and things that--while you've got this, this class of kids in there.  So that we integrate this stuff together that makes kids understand why and how it fits."  I would hope we could get a curriculum and people across the world to look at it from that standpoint.  Why do I need to know what a gram is?  How can it be really--what is it I can do with it?  Why do I need to know what milligram is?  Or even an inch?  How, how can it have meaning in my life?  And that simplicity is what I'm talking about.  But how can we integrate all facets of education to have meaning to children so that they can appreciate what they're doing.  I'd love to see that happen.
Story_ID: 633747
Speaker 1: How do you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: As a pleasant, happy, helpful person that believes in humankind and its ability to do what's right in this world, and my efforts to try to aid as many people that I came across to get to that point.  My volunteering was to help people, and I did it without pay.  And how can I establish in those people, and I think I have a lot of them still coming back saying well thank you for what you did, that they can move on and pass it on to the next generation.
Speaker 1: Well I wanna thank you for taking the time to share your story.  Because it is, it is most inspiring and it will be encouraging to generations now and for the future generations (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hope so.
Speaker 1: So I thank you very much for taking your time to share your story.
Speaker 2: I can show you my grandpa--I mean my father [Eugene Garrett] and my grandma--
