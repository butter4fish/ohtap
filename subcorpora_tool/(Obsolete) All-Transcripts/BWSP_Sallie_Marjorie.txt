JoAnn Roth: [00:00] Marjorie W. Sallie, [inaudible] 27. We are at her home in Birmingham,
Michigan. It’s June 11th, 1986. Now, I’m going to put this right up here, and I believe it’s going
to pick us up just fine.
Marjorie Whitcomb Sallie: OK, I hope so. You know, I’m no good at talking to a tape.
JR: Well, we’ll just forget it’s there now.
MWS: But, if, in fact one of the best times I’ve ever been on radio, he brought a tape, and – but
he was so easy to talk to. And it’s not as if you’re just talking to every–
JR: I would just take this off, you don’t mind.
MWS: I’m fine, I’m sure you need [inaudible].
JR: OK. I’d like to ask you, Ms. Sallie, about your family before you came to Brown. Did you
grow up in Michigan, or –
MWS: No, I grew up in Foxboro, Massachusetts, halfway between Boston and Providence.
[01:00] My ancestors came there in 1660, came from England. They had gone from France to
England in 1066. [laughs] And so I’m sure that our name was S-A-L-L sometime. And then in
England, there was an – I think it was an abbey that was called S-A-L-L-Y. And up until the
American Revolution the name was spelled S-A-L-L-Y.

JR: Now I’m just going to – OK, now we can continue. I’m sorry.
MWS: That’s all right. It’s spelled S-A-L-L-I-E now. And so that is –
JR: And you grew up in Foxboro.
MWS: I grew up in Foxboro.
JR: And how did you happen to come to Brown, or to Pembroke?
MWS: Well, I was planning to go to Boston University. And I’ve been trying to think – well, I’ll
tell it this way. When I was a senior in high school, [02:00] a graduate of Brown came to our
school. He had been brought up in Foxboro, and said that he was establishing a scholarship in
name of his mother for women or girls to go to Brown. So, I went home that night and at the
dinner table, I said, “I’m going to Brown, not Boston.” Mother said, “That’s interesting. How are
you going to do it?” And I told her. And so I’m not sure whether I had that scholarship or not,
but I had one. And that was how I first went to Brown. And then I loved it. And in fact I even
went back and took some courses towards a master’s degree, but didn’t get my master’s from
Brown.

JR: Were there other children in your family?
MWS: I had four brothers.
JR: Four brothers. And were you encouraged to go to college? Did they go –
MWS: My brother, oldest brother, went to Brown for two years, [03:00] and then he went to the
University of Iowa. He did exactly what I did, took pre-med. And the same thing happened that

2	
  
	
  

although we were both accepted at medical schools, we couldn’t afford to go. And he became
head of a research laboratory in business, and is the one who got plastic siding on the market.
JR: Is that right? Isn’t that interesting.
MWS: And then my next brother just went to Boston University for awhile, but didn’t finish, and
never quite made up things. Then I had a brother who went to University of Arizona.
JR: So they were sort of western-oriented, to the west.
MWS: And he did that because he knew World War II was on the verge of starting for us, and he
knew that [04:00] he had to be in to ROTC, because he’d gone to the Army as soon as he
finished college. And Arizona had a cavalry. And that’s what he wanted.
JR: He liked horses. And were family expectations the same for you as for your brothers, or do
you feel they were different because you were a woman?
MWS: No, I think that they just – the family felt that anybody who used what ability they had in
the way they wanted to use it, they should. And that they could make changes as they grew older
and knew what was happening.
JR: So you were encouraged in the same way your brothers were –
MWS: Yes.
JR: – and you didn’t feel at an early age that there was a difference.
MWS: No. In fact, I have just one brother left, and he is ten years younger than I am. It was on
my birthday in – 70 [05:00] years ago, I got a doll. That was in August. I played with her for a
few days, and then he was born in September. And I never played with a doll after that.

3	
  
	
  

JR: Oh, you always had him. [laughter]
MWS: I had [inaudible] to play with. In fact, he and his wife are coming out for my birthday this
summer.
JR: Oh, isn’t that nice.
MWS: And now he did not go to college, but he was very much interested in mechanics, and had
– he came up to plant and took General Motors’ courses and things like that.
JR: When you were at Brown, Ms. Sallie, what do you think was the most important influence on
you?
MWS: I think in many ways we can thank the dean because she let us all know that she cared,
and the faculty cared and wanted us to do the best that we could do, [06:00] and in the way that
we wanted to do it, as much as we could.
JR: And that was Dean Morriss, I think you told me –
MWS: Dean Morriss.
JR: – on the phone.
MWS: And she, as I say, she wasn’t just shut off from people. She was a very friendly, warm
person. And when I think of the years after she retired that I always got a Christmas card from
her.
JR: Is that right. And how were the male and female students, how was that integrated, in-class
and socially?
MWS: Integrated chiefly in science. And that was the thing that –
4	
  
	
  

JR: Can I get you a pillow or something?
MWS: No, that’s – and so that was the thing, because we – all of our science classes we took
over at Brown. And then the other classes we had at Pembroke.
JR: I see, I see. And socially, did you do things together the Brown [07:00] students and
Pembroke students?
MWS: Yes, there was – now where I was a commuter, I didn’t come as close to many of them as
the ones who were living there. But there was a very warm, good feeling between them. And I
could remember in, what was it, Advanced Physics once, that the boy helped me with the
experiment, and I helped him write his papers. [laughs]
JR: Oh, so that was a good give-and-take, then.
MWS: And there was that good give-and-take.
JR: Well that’s good. And you felt that the professors treated the male and female students pretty
much the same?
MWS: Yes I did, very definitely. And I still, and I hope that you can find the name, and I’ve
gone through the Brown yearbook without having people listed on the [Avda?]. The man who
taught [08:00] Beginning Biology was excellent. And that course changed everything I’d
planned to do.
JR: Is that right? I will try and find that out for you.
MWS: I’m sure – no.
JR: And let you know. They must have records of the faculty.
5	
  
	
  

MWS: They have to have them.
JR: And she taught biology.
MWS: She taught biology.
JR: I’ll make a note of that.
MWS: And then I know – what would you like...?
JR: That’s all right. I’ll just make a mental note. That’s fine. Thank you.
MWS: And so then, after my Biology I, I went into Comparative Biology, and things like that.
JR: And that’s really started your interest in science.
MWS: And started me in deciding that I wanted to go on.
JR: And that’s really how you decided on a major then.
MWS: Yes.
JR: In the sciences. Isn’t that interesting? What were the social rules? Well, you didn’t live there
on campus, so they probably didn’t affect you quite so much.
MWS: They didn’t affect me.
JR: How did you get back and forth?

6	
  
	
  

MWS: Well, I had to take a train. I started off in the morning, about 6:30, [09:00] walk a mile,
and get a bus, three miles. And then take a train to Providence, and then walk up from the
station.
JR: Walk up the hill.
MWS: And walk up the hill.
JR: Oh my. [laughs] You’d had almost a full morning before you got there.
MWS: And so I got there. But there again, I didn’t ask to not have to go to chapel, but somebody
said, well now, if you could come a little bit later, if you’d have the transportation, then don’t
worry if you miss chapel once in awhile.
JR: And that was first thing in the morning, chapel was.
MWS: That’s the first thing in the morning.
JR: I see. And you had certain required subjects that you had to take, and –
MWS: Yes. And because you had to take English. And then the next thing that you – see, I took
the first year English. Latin, I slept through most of that class. Somebody [10:00] when they
thought I might be called to read would [inaudible] me. English, Latin, French, and Calculus and
Biology. Those were the freshman classes.
JR: Rigorous curriculum.
MWS: And I liked everything that I was taking, but I found out that my French, I finally decided
forget any language major. And so that I did do that, and I – [laughs] I think it came when I was
in Paris in ’38. I went, and I could still read French and write it, but speak it, no. I told a taxi
driver where I wanted to go, and he said, “Say it in English.” [laughs]
7	
  
	
  

JR: [laughs] That’s interesting. That’s interesting.
MWS: And then of course I began my second year, to add to the Biology, [11:00] Physics,
Chemistry and Physics.
JR: And those courses were the ones that the Brown and the Pembroke students stick together –
MWS: Yes.
JR: – and your labs and everything together. I see.
MWS: So then we had those, and so that as I say, I enjoyed very much the courses, and
everything. I hope you like dogs.
JR: I do. She’s just fun. She has a very friendly face. [laughs]
MWS: And of course, [inaudible] happened, I was teaching part-time over at Kingswood, and
my little brown poodle died. So, they felt so sorry, and I said, “Well I’ll tell you, I’m going to
have another one when school closes.” Well one of my classes couldn’t wait. So they went to the
Humane Society and came back with him. And I say he’s 10% cocker and 90% traveling
salesman.
JR: Right. [laughs] He’s very cute. Did you have meals there, then you had lunch there, but then
you [12:00] went home later for dinner.
MWS: I went home for dinner at night, but we had lunch, and I seldom took a sandwich for
lunch, because the lunches were not too expensive. And they were – you had something hot, and
things like that. And so I thought it was very good.
JR: Were most of the students from the Providence area, or were there students from a distance?
8	
  
	
  

MWS: There were some from a distance. I can remember some who came up from New Jersey.
And, but there’s a tremendous number were from the Providence area.
JR: And most were boarders, or most lived at home, did you –
MWS: The Providence area, most of them lived at home.
JR: I see, OK. And Dean Morriss, did she advise you on your curriculum, or was her
involvement more on a personal –
MWS: Her involvement was more on a personal one. And I’m trying to think, and I haven’t
pulled out [13:00] of my memory anyone in particular that advised the curriculum. I think my
biology teacher, when I told her that I decided I wanted more science, that she told me what I
would need. And then I had somebody that was very good in chemistry. And then they –
JR: Was that a man or a woman?
MWS: That was a man.
JR: But the biology professor was a woman.
MWS: Was a woman.
JR: Well I’m going to find out the name for you. [laughs] I think that would be interesting.
MWS: And so that, I ended up with Sigma Psi and Phi Beta Kappa. There was only one – it was
very strange, because my senior year in college, I thought I’ve got to have something besides
science. So I took a course in religion. And that was the only thing they gave me enough points
to become Phi Beta Kappa. [laughs]

9	
  
	
  

JR: Oh, so that was a good decision then.
MWS: So that was what I did. I’m still interested, this, it’s a book I’ve just started to read, and I
am just [14:00] fascinated by it.
JR: Did you go on then to teach?
MWS: I began to teach biology and chemistry. And I did teach some physics, but not too much.
JR: In the Providence area, or...
MWS: In Foxboro.
JR: In Foxboro. In the public school.
MWS: In the public school. And then I went from public school to private school, going to
Stamford, Connecticut. And from that time on, I have been in private schools.
JR: And did you live on the school grounds then, and –
MWS: Yes.
JR: – at private schools, and taught science, as well?
MWS: And taught science.
JR: And the medical school idea, you would have gone on had you been able to afford –
MWS: I waited three years, and then knew I had – and Cornell was very good, because they said,
“No matter when you want to come, we’ll take you.” But I just knew at the end of three years

10	
  
	
  

[15:00] that that – I’ll say something, I tell the children in religion, sometimes it takes you a long
time to know what God’s telling you. [laughs]
JR: [laughs] Right. And religion’s played an important role in your life?
MWS: Religion was always important to me.
JR: Your personal religion, and an interest in it academically as well.
MWS: Academic, and I think you would enjoy my nickname, “Escathopalian,” because I’m an
Episcopalian, and I teach religion in a Catholic school.
JR: Is that right? [laughs] So that’s [inaudible].
MWS: And so that that is one of the things, and then I hoped this winter, well it will be a couple
of private schools that I’ll be able to give a course on history of Michigan, because some of them
say they’re interested in having it. And if I could have it just even one day a week through the
winter as part of an American history, well then that works out beautifully.
JR: And students that you have thought, have you encouraged them – obviously, you have
[16:00] to go on to medical school, or –
MWS: I have one of the girls who came, came from Walpole, Massachusetts. And it was very
interesting, because I went to her home during the summer, and they had almost as many books
around as I’ve got. [laughs] And she was brilliant. She went from Ashley Hall to Wellesley. And
then went to medical school, and she’s now head of the medical program, from beginning with
Arizona, and going north to Washington, along the Pacific coast. And I’m not sure – it’s a
telephone company, I’m not sure if it’s AT&T, just what that she is working with.
JR: I worked at Wellesley for six years before coming to Brown.

11	
  
	
  

MWS: Oh.
JR: What’s her name, it might be familiar to me? It’s not important, but –
MWS: Well, it’ll come to me.
JR: All right. [laughs] It’s not that important; I just thought perhaps –
MWS: I tried to find some of my old yearbooks, but I can’t find – because I do [17:00] have my
yearbooks from Ashley Hall.
JR: And that was the school in Connecticut, where you –
MWS: No, Ashley Hall was in Charleston, South Carolina.
JR: Oh really, so –
MWS: And I loved it.
JR: – where have you taught now, maybe we should –
MWS: I went from Foxboro to Stamford, Connecticut. And then I went from there down to
Ogontz in Pennsylvania. And from there, I went up to Northampton School for Girls. And that’s
where I got my master’s at Smith. And I went down there, from there to Ashley Hall. I’ll never
forget Ms. Whitaker and Ms. Bement were the heads of the school at Northampton, and they
were wonderful. We all called the older one aunts – we called them Aunt Sarah and Dorothy.
And Aunt Sarah called me in one day, and said, “I’d like you to be here forever with us. But I
think it’s time you went into administration. And I’ve made an appointment for you to meet
[18:00] the head of Ashley Hall in Charleston.” So I went to Charleston and stayed there 12
years.

12	
  
	
  

JR: And you taught there as well?
MWS: I taught – I did teach the biology there – [audio fades out] – [20:00] next door.
JR: Could we just scoot over here for a minute?
MWS: Sure.
JR: Would it be an imposition?
MWS: Heavens no.
JR: Because I have to plug it in here. [laughs] Oh, what a good-looking family.
MWS: Oh, they’re the nicest family.
JR: Oh goodness. Very attractive. And you say he went to Brown, or –
MWS: He went to Brown.
JR: What is his name?
MWS: His name is – oh, now wait a minute, I know his name backwards and names –
JR: Here I am putting you on the spot.
MWS: Bill and Belle – isn’t that terrible?
JR: Well, it’s all right. Well they’re a very attractive family.
MWS: There’s the parents of the boy and girl I showed you. [21:00]
13	
  
	
  

JR: Oh yes. Oh yeah, I can tell. Isn’t that nice.
MWS: Here, one, is very interesting. His mother was Jewish. His father is an Iranian. And he
was born in this country, but she went to Iran the minute that she left the hospital and he was
named over there, [Yahu?] and she came back to this country, and said, “What can I do? He
can’t grow up in the United States and be called Yahu.” And I said, “Well, Yahu probably comes
from the same root as Yahweh. And so does Joshua. So why don’t you call him Joshua? And
Josh would be cute for a nickname.” She said, “Well, maybe we’ll do that.” And so then, [Art?]
said maybe he’ll have an American name. So in a couple of weeks, I got a letter, love, from Ali,
the Muslim, [22:00] Dana the Jew, and they named him for my youngest brother, Glen. And
Glen was killed in World War II, and so that – I just can’t stand that, the Bill and Belle, I’ve got
to –
JR: Oh. [laughs] I see that, do you teach women’s history, is that one of your interests as well?
MWS: Yes, it’s women who have influenced history. And also, I’ve also –
JR: I’m noticing your books here. Women of Achievement. Great Women.
MWS: And here is something, anybody who’s interested in women’s history, this is – there are
four volumes to this encyclopedia.
JR: Notable American Women. Oh my. [23:00] Very complete.
MWS: Very complete.
JR: Do you receive mailings from the Pembroke Center at all?
MWS: No.

14	
  
	
  

JR: Well then I’ll be sure that you go on the mailing list there, because they’re doing some
interesting research. And they have a very active women’s center called the Sarah Doyle Center,
at Pembroke.
MWS: Oh, I love Pembroke, what they’re doing, and I could probably get some information
from them?
JR: Well, maybe they could get some information with you. [laughs]
MWS: And there were such things that I’m much interested. In at the present moment, the books
that are coming out about women are women in the west.
JR: That’s right. Kansas, the one written about the women in Kansas.
MWS: There are so many different ones about them. And so that, Women of Crisis, and then I’ve
got Labor of Love, Labor of [inaudible] [24:00], that’s black women, and there are so women of
these up here, there are various women [inaudible] – through the west.
JR: My goodness, what a library you have.
MWS: And I try to keep of the work, that’s when they first began to go to work. And it’s just one
after another, Women’s Diaries of the Westward Journey. And then Women in Religion.
JR: And Women in Michigan, is that part of your interest in – here, I’ll put this back.
MWS: [inaudible] very much interested, and we had just been working in Michigan with
[inaudible], and they have chosen, have women in Michigan that they [arm?]. [25:00] So, this is
one little book. And this woman, and I’ve talked to the head of the group there, they said she’d
never heard about her. But this woman that I really want to show you is someone that I have
there, Susan B. Johnston. That’s not her Indian name. She married an English –

15	
  
	
  

JR: Oh, for a Chippewa. Oh, for heavens’ sakes.
MWS: And you know Indian women had a great deal of influence.
JR: Did they?
MWS: Yes. They would choose, when it was time for a new chief, they would choose three men,
and then the men would vote for one of the three.
JR: Is that right? Isn’t that interesting.
MWS: And now she did something, and I want to get her in the Michigan Hall of Fame,
Women’s Hall of Fame, because what she did was so fascinating, after the War of 1812, [26:00]
the Indians had no desire to become friendly with the Americans. They wanted to stick to the
English. Schoolcraft, and Cass who was governor, went north in a fleet of canoes with other
people. And they got up there to the lower part of the peninsula, and the Indians wouldn’t sign a
treaty, and burn the American flag. And the next morning, when Cass woke up, he saw there
were no women and children left, and thought, “Oh, we’re going to have a terrible time.” But,
when they got started, they signed the treaty, because this Susan B. Johnston had gone to them
during the night, and said, “Now look here, you’ve got learn that the English are through. You’re
going to have to live with the Americans. And so you better sign that treaty and live and learn
[27:00] and work with them.”
JR: So she really did change the –
MWS: Also, she changed, and she did a tremendous amount. And then Schoolcraft almost
immediately was appointed in charge of the Indians in the territory. And he moved over to
Mackinac Island. I love Mackinac.
JR: Yes, it’s beautiful.

16	
  
	
  

MWS: Island. And he didn’t – he was living in the fort, but he didn’t like to live in the fort. And
so he moved in with Susan B. Johnston, who frequently would take in orders, met her daughter,
married her. And on their way, on a pleasant trip to England, stopped in Boston and gave
Longfellow the story of Hiawatha.
JR: Oh, for heavens’ sakes. That’s where he got it. You know, I often wondered about that,
because he was – it is about Michigan.
MWS: Yes.
JR: I wondered if Longfellow had ever been there. Isn’t that interesting. [28:00]
MWS: That book is very interesting.
JR: My family – my father’s family came to – now Helen Thomas just received an honorary
degree from Brown.
MWS: Oh, now nice!
JR: Now I didn’t realize she was from Michigan. Brought up in Detroit, and graduated from
Wayne State. Yes, she just received an honorary degree on the 31st of May. Quite an interesting
lady.
MWS: Let me see if I can find any others. Yes, here’s something that – [inaudible] from
Michigan.
JR: Well my father’s family were farmers, and they came into the port in Frankfurt on a boat
with their cattle from Canada. And the cattle swam ashore, and they came into the harbor at
Frankfurt, and they all have farms in [Joyfield?] there. And, have been t here for [29:00] I guess
over a hundred years, probably.

17	
  
	
  

MWS: So they have not chosen – now this one, Genevieve Gillette died just the other day. But
they have taken to the Michigan Women’s Hall of Fame. Each year they take some who are no
longer here, and others who are still alive.
JR: And who sponsors this?
MWS: It’s a group that they have taken, Michigan women, second award to the Michigan
Women’s Hall of Fame, and that’s [inaudible] they use.
JR: Is there an organization who does this?
MWS: It’s an organization, and that’s what it’s called.
JR: That’s marvelous.
MWS: And I have [field?].
JR: And you have been a member of this organization?
MWS: I’m a member, but I haven’t done anything in particular with it, because I do feel that I
want to get [30:00] Susan B. Johnston in.
JR: Yes, it certainly sounds as though she should be, doesn’t it?
MWS: Well that’s, when I was talking with a person, she told me, “You know, the greatest
women, I think, who ever lived in Michigan was Sojourner Truth. You know anything about
her?”
JR: Well, very little.

18	
  
	
  

MWS: Outstanding black woman. Outstanding woman. She’s the only woman who has any sort
of statue in the city of Detroit. And her head is on one side of the Soldier’s and Sailor’s
Monument. Of course, she never learned to read or write.
JR: I’m afraid I don’t know very much about her.
MWS: She was brought up living in New York State a slave, because they were able to keep
slaves for some time after the revolution. [31:00] And she finally, through the help of Quakers,
got away and went down to New York –
- End of Track 1 Track 2
MWS: [00:00] – takes to court. And won. And then, she did a lot. Well she lived in Northampton
for a while with a group who were working – well, they didn’t call themselves a communist
group, but they were living in a commune. And she lived there, and somebody wrote her
biography. Some of the stories I love to tell about her. She was much interested in religion and in
people. And Michigan was a very liberal state, and women could speak in Michigan when they
couldn’t speak in other states. And she had three things that she wanted: freedom for the blacks,
right for the blacks to vote, and right for the women to vote. And those were the things that she
talked about. [01:00] And so she was speaking in a church out here –
JR: Oh no, I don’t mind, I really don’t.
MWS: Well you’re very nice to say so. And so she was speaking one day, and some man got up
from the back, and said, “You shouldn’t be in here. This is God’s house. God is a man. Jesus was
a man. And no woman should be in their house.” And she said, “God created men and women.
And Jesus was born of a woman in the Holy Spirit. No man ain’t had nothing to with him.”
JR: [laughs] That was great.

19	
  
	
  

MWS: And then when she met Abraham Lincoln, he’d heard about her for some time. And she
said to him that she was so glad to meet him, because she’d heard so much about him. And he
said, “Well I’ve been hearing about you for years and looking forward to meeting you.” [02:00]
And she had, there were a lot of buckle stories like that about here, but she did things, and she
managed to support herself for quite awhile, and there’ve been several books written about her.
[to dog] I know you’re so friendly. Yes you are.
JR: So, did you teach courses on women at school as well as science, or is more of an avocation?
MWS: This, I didn’t do until I left Bloomfield. And then, I began – and that was in ’73. And that
was the time when the greatest interest in women started. And I didn’t realize it until – a long
time. But so, for years, I have now, been teaching down in the inner city. I gave an eighth grade
course in women who have influenced history. And then, I had the sixth grade in Michigan
history.
JR: I thought it was interesting that the reading that I’d done – as I say, I worked at Wellesley
[03:00] for six years before coming to Brown, and the history of Wellesley, it impressed me so
that a lot of the early professors were from the Midwest, because women, they needed educated
women to be the professors. So they came to Oberlin, the University of Michigan, the University
of Wisconsin, a lot of the early faculty were educated in the midwestern colleges.
MWS: Oh, they were. And so that they had so many things that were really very, very good.
And, this is a short little book, and that there were people who did things. And some of them are
still alive. Others are not. There’s Sojourner Truth. And, I’ve always just admired her very much.
[04:00]
JR: Did you feel at any time during your career as a teacher, or outside of your career, the effects
of discrimination because you were a woman?
MWS: I never felt it, that I can say, and I think that the reason was that I just – as my brother
would probably say, “You were just too stupid to pay attention.”
20	
  
	
  

JR: [laughs] You just chose not to.
MWS: I just chose not to. The only – there was just once in Brown, and I felt very sorry for a
man. He was black, and we had been taking the same lab course, and left the lab building and
started to walk down, because I was going to take the train home. And as we neared down the
hill, he said, “Well, I’m going to say goodbye, and I’ll see you in class. But it just wouldn’t be
right to you if I walked the rest of the way [05:00] down with you.” Now that showed, the
feeling that it wasn’t good.
JR: But you felt bad for him.
MWS: I felt very bad for him.
JR: But he was sensitive to you, which was very nice. Well that’s interesting that that tolerance
did exist. Rose Traurig, who I interviewed, was Jewish, and she said that there was an acceptance
of the Jewish students there, she felt, that there wasn’t – you know, that they were accepted and
didn’t feel any discrimination either.
MWS: I had said with Ms. Mack being there, Charleston has a lot of Jews, and they had one of
the earliest reform temples. And so I said to her, “You know, I think it’s time we took some
Jewish boarding students.” She said, “Well if you want some, go ahead and take them.” So, I did.
And I was assigning [06:00] church duty, because the girls could go to their own churches, but
the faculty went with them on Sunday. And I sat down, and so it wasn’t hard to get somebody.
Oh yes, I’m a Catholic. I want to go to the Episcopal church, Methodist, so on. Well I said, now I
want someone to go to the temple on Friday night. Who wants to go there? What sort of the thing
are you going to get? Oh, and they were horrible. And I finally said, “Forget, I’ll go.” And I went
for about eight years.
JR: Did you really?

MWS: And I learned an awful lot. And the people were so nice there. And when I went back,
now this tells you how some of my girls are, the class of ‘45 had their 40th reunion last spring.
And I had a couple of telephone calls, and they said, “It won’t be a good reunion if you’re not
there.” They sent me my airplane ticket and everything. And I had a wonderful time.
JR: Oh, isn’t that wonderful. That’s just great. [07:00]
MWS: I went down to Washington early in November and spent a week with a couple of the
class of ’45 who lived there.
JR: Did you? You’re really getting around. Well they feel that you’re part of their lives.
MWS: Well, I don’t know how many times they say, I couldn’t have done it if it hadn’t been for
you. And I think they’re being exceedingly nice, but I love them, and they knew it. And they
loved me.
JR: That’s marvelous.
MWS: And so, I just –
JR: And some of the same reinforcement that you got at Brown –
MWS: You passed on.
JR: – you passed it on.
MWS: That’s what we did. One of the girls who went to Brown – well, it must have been before
1950, and said, “I never would have gotten in if it hadn’t been for you.” [08:00] But she majored
in science, and she’s now working and heading one of the state laboratories in Connecticut. And
so, but I’ve had some very nice students. And they’ve been – I say, if you don’t have a family, if
you’re not married, be a teacher.

JR: Because then you –
MWS: Then you have it.
JR: Isn’t that wonderful. Well it sounds as though you’ve had a very full and interesting life.
MWS: I’ve had a very full life. And, well this shows you, sometimes I get, even though I’m just
volunteering for things now. But we have a woman priest at the Episcopal church, and she called
the other day, and she said – and I also am on the board over at the senior citizen’s place, and she
said, “I’d like to take you and Lois, the head of the [inaudible], out to lunch on Wednesday.”
[09:00] And I said, “Oh Nancy. I can’t go Wednesday, because I have to be over at church in
Bloomfield by 1:30. We wouldn’t have lunch in time to get through and to get over there. Would
Thursday be all right?” She said, “Yes, Thursday would be fine.” So I settled on Thursday. Then,
on Saturday, I heard that on Thursday, there was a meeting of the Christian service committee at
the Y. So, I called Nancy and said, “Well, I can’t go on Thursday.” Well last night, that meeting
was canceled, so I’m back, and I’m saying, I’ll go Thursday.
JR: You’re a busy lady.
MWS: I’m very active in a lot. And I want to show you something I don’t show to too many
people.
JR: “Presented to Marjorie Sallie, appointed to position [10:00] of Board of Director Emeritus, in
appreciation for dedicated volunteer service to the Birmingham Family YMCA, Board of
Directors since 1972, and her distinguished contribution to the development of international
understanding and world peace.” Isn’t that wonderful?
MWS: Well we have a free membership [inaudible] to all of the exchange students who come
here. And we have a [made?] dinner for them, sleigh rides, and things like that.

JR: Oh, that’s great. That’s very nice.
MWS: So I don’t show that to everybody. I’m very pleased with it.
JR: [laughs] Well I’m honored, thank you. Thank you. I think I must be tiring you out.
MWS: No, I’m just glad [inaudible].
JR: [laughs] I’m going to turn this machine off now, and thank you. I’m going to thank you here
right now here on the tape for taking time to spend with me, [11:00] and I know that people who
are interested in the history of Pembroke, and in the history of Brown will very much appreciate
the fact that you –
MWS: You know, over the years, I have managed to have several people go to Brown, and I
have liked it, and have nothing but good memories of Brown.
JR: Well that’s marvelous, and thank you so much.
MWS: And so that I enjoyed that. And as I say, and I loved – loved to teach, and loved to talk
about Brown.
JR: And that’s good. I’m glad, so glad to hear that.
[break in audio]
JR: This interview was conducted by JoAnn Roth, a member of the Development Office team
with responsibilities in Michigan. I met Ms. Sallie at an alumni meeting in Detroit, and decided
on my next trip Michigan to try and do this interview. It has been a great [12:00] pleasure for me
to do this and to make this contribution to the Pembroke Archives.
