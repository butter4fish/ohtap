 Gill. Today is November 24, 2009. I   m visiting with  Jared Whittington on the Oklahoma State University campus in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project  of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Jared, I appreciate  you taking the time away from your classes to come visit with us today. I  want to visit with you about your experiences at OSU, particularly with  the Honors and Scholar Development and Recognition Program.  Sounds good.  What I thought I might do was start at the beginning and ask you a little  bit about your background. Can you share a little bit about where you  grew up, about your family?  Definitely. Being thirty-one, this gets a little bit longer than it would be  normally, but I was born in Washington D.C. on March 3, 1978. I grew  up within the Washington Metro area most of my childhood. I attended  high school at Montrose Christian School. It   s a small private school.  What makes that unique is that my family never really did have a good  deal of money, but they suffered to put us through. I   ve always kind of  appreciated that opportunity, but even with that being said, a lot of my  childhood, we weren   t expected to establish much of an academic  reputation, and so some of our, I guess I will call it trajectory, was  limited by our low horizons. They did get us through high school, but  my parents had always told us that college was for other people and you  went out and worked. It was just what you did.  I started attending Montgomery College which is a local junior college. I  never did take the SATs because I knew I couldn   t afford to go to  Maryland or anything along those lines. I found it incredibly difficult to  meet up with the demands of school, even if it was just Montgomery  5  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  College and trying to make headway. I was working forty hours a week  and going to school full time, and then I found at first that I couldn   t  meet those demands, but, slowly but surely after a year and a half, my  performance started to kind of deteriorate and I was unable to meet up  with the demands. If you took look at a transcript, you could see that the  grades were good, but they started to fall off the more I had to meet up  with the need of paying for school.  What were you doing, work-wise, at that time?  I was working at a printing company, American Repo Graphics.  Interestingly enough, a young man named Edward Sanchez who  produced The Blair Witch Project, we did work together. Funny enough,  right prior to joining the Army, he asked if I wanted to be in his movie,  but at that time it was just a credit-card film, and I told him I had to  work the next day so I couldn   t be in his movie.  (Laughs) Bad decision, right?  Yes, and it was amusing because I did go to the opening. There were  two openings of that movie. One was at Montgomery College where  they took the twenty-four hours of film and made it down to an hour,  and then they released it. What happened after that is that it had its  recipients rise. They had a second opening and, ironically enough, they  invited me to attend right after I had signed up. There were just a couple  of circumstances that were amusing. I got a scholarship to University of  Maryland Baltimore campus that I could go  to . I also was invited to the  premier with Ron Howard in New York, both of which were terminated  by my entry in the United States military. (Laughter)  Just backing up a minute, in your family, did you have any brothers or  sisters growing up?  I did; I had one brother. His name is Jeremiah, and he   s two years  younger than me.  What did your dad do for a living?  My dad was a cartographer. He made maps.  Was your mom a work-at-home mother, or did she work outside the  home?  For the first few years of my life, she was a stay-at-home mom, and then  she went to start working for NIH  National Institute of Health  and  she   s done very well for herself. She did break the proverbial glass  6  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  ceiling. She   s in a GS13 position without a degree. She   s probably the  first one at NIH to do that, so I   ve always been very proud of my mom.  In November of    99, I joined the United States military, and I went on to  attend basic training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and AIT  Advanced  Individual Training  at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. During that time at  Fort Sam Houston, Texas, a number of recruiters came down, but the  group that I got in with as I started competing for a slot with the Third  U.S. Infantry was the Old Guard. They   re in charge of most of the state  ceremonies in D.C. and Arlington and a variety of other official military  functions that provide visibility for the United State Army. I decided to  pursue that. After I had actually been successfully recruited, I was  released on my leave, and I signed into the Old Guard on November 11,  1999.  I think it is a unique experience to anyone in the military because you  get to see what   s behind the veil, what   s actually going on in politics.  You get to see politicians in a more casual framework. I mean, of  course, there   s still a little bit of starchiness, but you still get to see  something a little bit more interesting. I got to participate in a number of  functions that I found to be interesting. The September 11 rescue and  recovery operations we participated in. George Bush   s initial  inauguration, I was standing behind on the ballast rise behind him, not in  the vicinity of the dignitaries like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, but on  the rise right above it, and I could see George Bush   s shoulder and see  the teleprompter and the crowd out there. So, I pretty much got to see  the inauguration from his vantage.  What were your duties there, Jared?  I think we had a funny term for it, but what we were doing was we were  seating the semi-important dignitaries, not the ones that were the big  bang, but the ones of lesser importance. We   d just carry them out to their  chairs, set them down, we were wearing our Class A uniform, and then  we took them back. Like I think Arnold Schwarzenegger actually got to  sit down with George Bush, but we had several other celebrities sitting  in that and then the president of the Czech Republic or whoever our  allies were at the time.  That   s great.  September 11 was particularly interesting, I mean, aside from the fact  that it was our nation   s great tragedy but, again, there were interesting  instances. And while people really consolidated  the events  down to a  day, I like to tell people that was, for soldiers at least and for a variety of  workers, not only a lifelong impact, but a very sad twenty-seven days,  7  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  because there was still a lot to be done afterwards. I guess we   ll  conclude with, it was an incredibly stressful assignment. Basic training  has its level of discipline and attention. Well, the Old Guard is basic  training for four years, and very few people are able to weather that kind  of stress and maintain an idea that they would like to stay in and  promote their military career. I decided to part service and go off to  pursue my education again. In 2003, I received an honorable discharge. I  moved locally and applied back to Montgomery College because this  time I did have access to my GI Bill, and I started attending classes. We  had several conflicts opening up at that time. I had difficulty finding  really substantive work.  Did you complete a two-year program at Montgomery?  I was unable to actually complete the program at Montgomery College. I  was doing nursing at the time because I had been a medic, and I thought  I would like to pursue that. About eight months after I got out, I started  getting letters in the mail that I was discarding, but the last one became  more heated, and they simply mentioned that I would need to call a  number or my GI Bill benefits would be terminated, which was a big  call to action (Laughter) and so     It got your attention.  It got my attention, and I called them and I went in to see the recruiter,  but this time I was more certain of myself because I was no longer a  private. I was a buck sergeant, and I had seen what I thought was the end  of what the Army could do to you. So, I   m sitting in there and they say,     Well, you have to come back into the military.    And I said,    Really?    I  was sure that they didn   t have any real juice. I didn   t think that they  would be able to do anything, but it turns out they did have some  weapons at their disposal. They said,    You will be returning to service.     And I said,    Well, what if I don   t want to?    And they got very casual  and a big smile on his face, he said,    We have three options. You can  choose from all three. We can send the Provost Marshal to your house  and have you arrested. Option B, we can take all your GI Bill benefits  back on your next taxes.    That was something I couldn   t do because that  was particularly expensive.    Or we can change your discharge from an  honorable to dishonorable.    And he said,    Oh, wait, but we have option  D, too, and I can do all three of them at once.    Pushed the paper across  the desk to me and I just closed my eyes and signed it. (Laughter)  And Jared, trying to get some understanding, why were they calling you  back in service?  They were calling me back in because of the conflict in Iraq. They were  8  having a problem with man power. But it was primarily because in the  Old Guard, we were required to have security clearances to be around  the president, and after September 11, those security clearances were  harder to get. So, the Army probably did it on key personnel with a good  background, and so in 2004 they recalled 4,033 people, which I was one  of those numbers. After the recall, it became even more difficult to get a  good job. Cost of living in D.C. is like  1,100 a month. I mean you  really have to be well healed to pay that kind of money. What happened  is  that  I was working, going to school. I had applied to George Mason   University  and gotten in, and I was in my first semester and I was back  in the Reserves. I was assigned to Walter Reed  Medical Center  and all  of a sudden you start getting the flurry of,    Okay, we   re ramping up to  do something. Not really quite sure what it is you   re going to be doing,     but it was a thought that Afghanistan  might be ratcheting up . They had  already pulled a number of people from Walter Reed, so I really thought  my number was coming. I was going to George Mason, but at that time  it was hard to focus on your responsibilities at the time, getting ready for  deployment and trying to go to school, and what ended up happening is I  was also trying to get a better job at the time. I was working at a cigar  store. Great job, no money. Smoke for free. (Laughter)  What I found is, someone pulled me aside later. I had put my resume out  for a variety of companies that require security clearances just to ride the  desk, and to have that security clearance in that area would be about  twenty dollars an hour without a college education because it cost them  so much money to run the security clearance. Turns out that I didn   t fit  the criteria. The recruiter told me the D.O.D.  Department of Defense   were going to call people. They put out a letter that they were bigger  contractors and they said,    Don   t rehire any veterans because we   re  getting them back.    So, what happens is instead of being a valid  candidate, you   re generally shunned because they just don   t want to  have any of that drama. Once I found that out, things became a little  more muddied, a little less clear. I thought I had a ticket punch for  Afghanistan.  I ended up dropping out of George Mason. That ended the GI Bill, and  so now I   m financially hurting. At the time, I was married, and you just  can   t live there without  1,200 a month, I mean, just for your basic rent,  and I was not making anything, and not having the GI Bill and being  unemployed was just brutal. I couldn   t figure how I   d get a job to make  ends meet, and we were offered a unique opportunity. My then wife   s  stepmother said,    Hey, you guys want to move to Oklahoma? You can  live in my house and go to OSU, and all you have to do is keep up the  maintenance.    And I was like,    Well, I   m into adventure.    Never having  seen the house, never having done anything, we sent our belongings to  the address, got in the car and drove across the country to Agra,  9  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Oklahoma. Having been raised in D.C., having done an assignment in  Alexandria and lived in that area, to go from an apartment complex  which was quadruple the size of Agra, Oklahoma to Agra, Oklahoma  was almost culture shock. (Laughter)  Not almost. It was a culture shock.  It was culture shock. So, a little bit stunned and taken back by the  experience, it wasn   t bad. Agra was really community oriented, of  course. I think people were very judgmental. They don   t see affluence or  education. They immediately depreciate the value of people or don   t see  that they have some internal merit, and that was a problem with my wife.  She just could not get along in the community. She couldn   t understand  that a cup of coffee and a piece of pie was a way to get to know people.  She never got to the place where she could calm down and enjoy what  was going on. Me, on the other hand, I came to it like a fish to water. I  had been living fast for a long time, and the opportunity to just sit down  with my neighbors and talk was captivating. It really meant a lot to me,  whereas she became frustrated. I really absorbed it and I really, really  enjoyed it. I had a great neighbor named Yoshi I still talk to. His  daughters love me. I still go back to Agra and I   m still known by my  first name, and so my first experience with Oklahoma was excellent.  What year was that that you moved to Agra?  2006, I think.  Is there a story about how you got to Oklahoma State University, then?  Yes, there   s a little bit more background that I can go through. So, I   d  been in Agra for about two months. I had applied for everything. The  problem with this area is that while I loved it, at least in the smaller  communities, you still have to be in the good-old-boy system. A new  person without an accent is going to be viewed as an outsider no matter  how good my resume was for fire, EMS. The fact that I didn   t know the  chief was a great hindrance to any type of really valid occupation. I was  pretty much shut out. I applied for everything. I mean, it was rough.  But two months back, I had applied for everything and my resumes were  out there, and I   d get call-backs and I   d get some letters in the mail.     Congratulations. You get to come back to the east coast so that you can  start training.    So, I picked myself up. I had to fly back to the coast and  start training for the present deployment I had gotten. Walter Reed  reassigned me to the 343rd Medical Ambulance Company. The 343rd  Medical Ambulance Company was going to make me a medical  ambulance supervisor, but they needed me to do their pre-mobilization  10  Gill  Whittington  training which required me to go to all Walter Reed, so for about two  and a half months, I met all of the pre-mobilization and mobilization  requirements. I was making E-6 money, which really didn   t help us  survive out here, and then I flew back.  This is where the story gets particularly depressing. All the jobs I had  applied for had called in those two months and filled those positions. So,  now I   ve got three months until deployment; no one   s going to hire me.  They know I   m going out, and then I had to go back once or twice a  month to Richmond. I didn   t have money so I had to ride the bus, or I  had to do all these other things that are horrible. Riding the bus from  here to the east coast was particularly brutal, but I   m trying. I   m making  all these efforts to get jobs, and it   s just not going well. My wife is just  infuriated with me. She can   t understand how this happens, why I can   t  get a job. She lays it all on my shoulders as if I can help the  circumstances that I   m in. This will eventually play into my love for  sociology because I   m trying to weather all of this. I   m taking all of this  guilt and blame on myself as if there must be something inherently  wrong with me. I can   t figure out why I can   t get a job.  What ends up happening is that I get a job working with a local farmer,  and the farmer isn   t a nice man. He   s pretty mean, actually. I start  working with him to try and get ahead. I was making five bucks an hour.  This guy was a sorry racist, just a horrible person to be around. The fact  that I was from the city made it even worse. But I was so desperately in  need of money because we did need to eat that I was willing to do just  about anything. So, I put up cattle fencing in the Oklahoma sun. I was  digging post holes. Anything I could do to survive, make headway. It  was just a rough time. One day, the guy just, I don   t know, he came  unglued on me a little bit, and I just told him he was a racist and I didn   t  want to be any part of this anymore. Even if I starved to death, I  wouldn   t work for him. What was even worse is, another sociological  thing, people   it   s not just businesses that exploit people. Other people  exploit them. He told me this:    You know, I can pay you five dollars an  hour because you work for less than a Mexican because you have to. I   d  have to pay them eight.    (Laughter) So, you get experiences like that,  and for the rest of the summer I filled in some guy   s foundation. There   s  a lot of just manual labor in there.  Where was this job?  Right outside of Agra. I won   t say his name because he   s still living and  his son is very prominent. So, I weather all these storms. My wife hates  me, thinks I   m completely worthless, even though I come home covered  in red dirt and exhausted every day, and just no understanding and  finally I   m like, the paycheck of a deployment. Anything for this  11  paycheck. So, I   oh, this is pretty fascinating, I forgot about this part of  the story. What happened   it didn   t really end with that. Towards the  end of summer, I couldn   t find a job, so my wife told me,    Don   t come  home until you get a job,    which is pretty rough. So, I just leave early in  the morning and start walking the streets asking for jobs. I start in  Cushing. I started on Main Street and I work my way down all these  businesses asking if they have a job. Of course, no one has a job and  then when they hear about my situation, it has an impact. They   re like,     You   re a veteran. Maybe we can give you some work.    The American  people like to give handshakes, but when it really comes down to it, do  you have to give a questionable guy a job and you   ve heard his  circumstances? Not likely.  So, I walk into the Cushing Daily Citizen. I like to write occasionally,  and my wife told me before I left,    You probably should make your  worthless hobby pay.    She was a nice lady. I walk into the office and  I   m beat down, man. I   ve had a rough summer. So, I go to the desk, and  I   m like,    I was wondering if you guys were hiring.    They   re like,     Well, yes. What do you do?    This is how I came out:    I will do  anything if you pay me. I don   t care what it is. I will scrub your toilets  for five bucks an hour if I can get a consistent paycheck.    They just  heard that in my voice and they say,    Oh, no, we actually have work.  Can you copy edit?    and I   m like,    No, I don   t have a degree, and I   m  not savvy on English grammar.       Are you a reporter?    and I   m like,     No, I don   t do reporting.       Can you do advertising?       I can sell  anything. I worked in retail for a long time.       Give us a resume. Come  back and give us a resume, and we   ll take a look.    I didn   t take a second  chance. Drove home, filled out the resume, brought it back. It was in  their hands within an hour, and I was ready and raring to go.  Well, the publishing editor asks to interview me. Turns out, my story  was the same story as her son who was a Marine, and she asked me what  my interests were. We talked for an hour and she said I   d get a job, and  it would be consistent at seven dollars an hour, which is like a fortune  compared to what I was making working for that farmer. And so, with  all that said and done, I   m glad I now have an occupation and they bring  me back. They heard that I liked to write, and I gave them a sample of  my writing and they said,    Why don   t you try reporting?    So, my first  story, they said,    Pick something. This is a small town. Write about  anything you want.    The fall web worms were up, and I   m from the east  coast so I   d never seen that. So, I called an entomologist from OSU, got  the scoop on it, but I   ve been reading way too much Mark Twain. What  ends up happening is, what   s supposed to be a news story turns out  being an editorial, but I didn   t know anything about AP narrative or  regular style, so I just wrote it the way I wanted to. So, I turn it in,  submit it and it gets published. What   s fabulous about this is that  12  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  someone else seemed to like it because it got put on the editorial page,  and CNHI  Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.  which runs the  Stillwater NewsPress has got most of the Midwest papers. Well, the  NewsPress picked it up, so every single newspaper that CNHI owned  ran that story right out of the gates on their editorial pages because they  thought it was fantastic. They hired me on as their consistent editorialist.  I did two stories a week, and that was all they wanted me to do was write  editorials and nothing else, and I was, for the first time in a long time,  just happy. It was fantastic. My wife was never really very happy, and  the fact that I was actually working now and making some money, and I  really loved what I was doing, who cares if it was seven dollars an hour.  I was getting to put my opinion in the paper twice a week. And I could  see my name in print and it was fantastic.  The thing was  that  it was only thirty hours a week instead of forty. I  tried to explain to her that we just need to be happy at seven dollars an  hour, thirty hours a week instead of zero and zero. She was like,    Well,  you   re just lazy and you don   t want to get a real job.    I   m just coming  unglued now. I don   t have any idea what she   s talking about anymore,  and slowly but surely I start pulling my exit strategy: leave her alone for  awhile and get sent on deployment. We train for about six months. I was  put in charge of Camp Ali Al Salem in Kuwait. That year   I mark out  years where I   m particularly productive. The year overseas was  incredibly important because I had to shed my active duty personality  which was brash, overbearing and not really suitable for the company of  others and really come to terms with my soldiers and working with the  people I was dealing with. Over that year, I struggled with my  personality, but in the end the soldiers came up a little bit, and I came  down a little bit and we saved lives and we were eventually recognized  as the best camp in the theater just for hard and unerring work. Nothing  of particular importance happened at that time I can recall.  What year was that now?  We were Operation Iraqi Freedom of    05-   07, and it was in Kuwait.  From 2005-2007? What were you doing, Jared, your responsibility?  I was a medical ambulance supervisor. The structure over there was odd.  I didn   t have any officer oversight directly on my camp. I was  essentially functionally in charge of everything in my domain, at least  within the emergency realm. I had responsibilities to medical regulation  to evacuate. I also had emergency response care for that camp and the  surrounding vicinity, and I was also accountable to   I was attached to  the Navy, which made it a little bit complicated. I was responsible for  some of the emergency care and treatment of their patients, which made  13  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  our mission not very clear, but it was a good mission.  Did you ever ride in the choppers to pick up the wounded and bring  them in? Was the nature of your unit taking care of wounded soldiers?  Not really. We did actually evacuate patients, but what happened is the  LSA, which is the Life Support Area for that area, was Ali Al Salem,  and it was attached to what we call    the rock   . It was the Air Force side.  We had two sides to our camp, and what happened is   that was the  departure and arrival area for Afghanistan and Iraq. So, if you were  departing for Iraq or Afghanistan, you got on one of the C-130s there  and you flew to the respective air bases all throughout the Middle East.  What ended up   respective air bases, and what it was is, also, the  wounded would fly in now. When the wounded flew in, some of them  would be stable and could go right on to launch. Others would come in  unstable, and then we   d have to evac them down for stabilization care,  bring them back and then send them out. But there were instances where  we had pretty disastrous injuries around the camp which we had to  respond to, and there was a mass-casualty event, which was fairly  notable. It actually made the AP, the Associated Press, over here. I still  have a copy of what the AP said about it, but since I   ve worked on two  fire departments, I   d say it was more of a reflective experience with  EMS than a genuine bona fide deployment experience. I tell people a  year in the dirt and the grime, you know, and we just waited. You just  waited your time out and came back.  Did you witness some of the injuries in moving the people? Were you in  charge of getting them to another base where they get more, major kind  of attention, or the ones who weren   t quite as severe, did you take care  of those at that base?  Yes, we took care of a lot of different types of patients or casualties. The  ones that really stick out aren   t anything particularly gruesome. It   s the  people with the thousand-dollar or million-dollar injuries, the ones that  get shrapnel in their butt, the funny stuff. The other stuff doesn   t really  stick out in my mind because having been on a rescue squad, a variety of  other experiences, I   m not desensitized to the grotesque. I   m not  fascinated by it, but I   m not horrified by it. So, ninety percent of the time  it   s there, but it passes over me. I work well in those environments  because I don   t take it in. It doesn   t affect me.  You had a year and a half or so deployment there where you   re in Iraq  and then you go back to the states. Could you pick up and tell how you  got to OSU from there?  I got back   my wife didn   t even let me get the sand out of my ears.  14  Three days after I got back, she   s already blistering me about how  worthless I am, how terrible life is, and you just throw up your hands  and say,    Geez, when will this end?    We went on a really jumpy pace. I  applied for a lot of jobs again. I applied everywhere. Stuff was not  forthcoming, and I was   I always tell people this. The VA, if not known  for the longevity of care of veterans, they do give you a free ninety days     worth of healthcare back. My ex-wife couldn   t even make the ninety  days of the VA. At day seventy, she did it rough. She asked me for  money for college so she could go back to college, which I gladly and  willingly gave her. The day after that, she said,    I want you gone.    So,  not only did she get the money for her schooling and her books, the day  after that she wanted the other half of the bonus money I had because I  had done that. I re-enlisted overseas because I knew I would not get a  job coming back. I had  20,000 in the bank. That   s enough to live on out  here for some time, so her stress about me not working was  unwarranted. Plus, I could draw unemployment. I felt that the whole  situation was completely unjust. So, that having been done, I just threw  up my hands and said,    Yep, we   re through. I can   t put up with this  anymore. This is absolutely absurd.     So, I started divorce paperwork. I ended up walking out with   I like to  joke. Red the mailman has talked about how I got to Cushing, and it   s  kind of an Okie joke, but  500 was all the further I could fall in  Oklahoma, and I had landed in Cushing, and so that   s how I got to  Cushing. The trajectory of my fall couldn   t go any further than five  hundred bucks. I had two cats, a little bit of furniture. The first three  months were horrible. I couldn   t turn on my gas. My electricity was on,  but I couldn   t turn that on. I ate bologna for three straight months. I  mean, it was just rough, and the Oklahoma cold after the desert. The cats  were miserable. We   d all get under the blankets, and the cats would be  crying about how cold it was. I   d have my Army bear suit on, and I  mean it was terrible, but I was elated just to be by myself. I just couldn   t  take anymore. But I had very little, and then what happened, I was  actually able to secure some employment, which was nice. It was only  five dollars an hour, but it was twenty hours a week and living by  myself, having low expectations, and eating a lot of bologna, I was able  to survive.  Now, this is where the GI Bill comes in. I realized I would not find a job  that paid as well as the GI Bill. I would make  1,100 a month going to  school. So, what I decided is, I   m going to treat school like a job. I   m  going to do it every day, sick or not. I   m going to come to school, and  I   m going to perform and make sure that I do the right thing. I   m not  going to pass on this opportunity that I   ve been given. So, I enroll for the  summer of 2007. First class I had was Professor  Danny  Atkinson on  American Government. I talked to him the other day. Then I took math  15  Gill  Whittington  functions. These two classes are important. The government  class   because I realized I was definitely out of my depth back in college, but I  was able to do it because I could endure. I   ve never been strong at math,  but I was determined to get an A because that was what I came to do. I  worked on that homework eight hours a day, every day, nonstop. Just  focused on it. No break in the action, just always that homework, and  eventually it bore out.  Going to the next semester, I was still unsure. D2L and all of these crazy  computer applications were mystifying to me because you normally  turned in your papers, when I went to school originally in    96, and  turned them in. So, I had to adapt not only to the vocabulary of the  students, which had terms that don   t make sense to anyone who is older,  you have to adapt to the technology and then also the way the teachers  are presenting the information. So, there   s a wide period that you have to  adapt to as a veteran coming back into college, but I did my best. Started  making forward progress, really going at it in school. Towards the end  of the semester, I had done pretty good. I did all my extra credit. Showed  up to every class. Straight As. I was like,    Oh my gosh, I really can do  this if I really apply myself.     Had you declared a major at this point?  This is the second semester,  which  was really key. I started taking  sociology classes. In America, we believe all responsibility rests on the  shoulders of the individual, that they are unerringly responsible for their  failures. I think that   s a ruinous disastrous idea for a lot of people. When  I came to my study of sociology, I became fascinated by the fact that my  own experience, it wasn   t so. Mine actually reflected the trajectory of  the nation. I could say that, with a certainty, George Bush made a  decision that impacted my life, that I was able to go to September 11 and  see how all the stuff worked together. In any less clear situation, the  discipline of sociology would not have been so profound, but you can  see the people   s course in life is directed by a lot of different things  outside of them, personally. And so recognizing that, I felt empowered,  liberated, that I could now go on and really achieve, because I recognize  when my wife said I was a failure, it wasn   t me, because I had been the  same the whole time. It was a bad series of events that was dictating my  flow through life. I had to move to Oklahoma based on economic  reasons. I couldn   t get a job for a variety of reasons. I got deployed and  come back, and then there   s all these things that just really just reflect  sociology very clearly.  At this point, I become impassioned. I   m devoted to this discipline, and  there   s an unstoppable passion. I continued to go to school. I started to  really take an interest in my classes. Here before, I hadn   t been  16  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  interested, but now it   s deep passion. I   m going to read C. Wright Mills;  I   m going to read about my discipline. I   m going to get involved in it,  and I did. I did read peripherally on other things, and then an anomalous  thing happened. My counselor Dahlia   we had been good friends. She  had helped me get through the first semester, which was incredibly bad.  I had to go talk to her a lot to get me through. She had to be there for me.  Dahlia Molloy is the reason that I   m still sitting here. My counselor said,     Ride it out. You will understand it later.    Well, sitting there one day  she said,    Hey, you know what? Based on your activities in the  community       because that was one thing I never left my focus on was  my desire to help with the veterans    community. She hands me this  scholarship thing and says,    I think you   d be good at this. Fill this out  and see what happens.    I fill it out, turn it in, win. First time I   d been  recognized for anything academic. It was the O.D. Duncan Scholarship  for Community Action.  What community action had you been engaged and involved in?  What it was is my own experiences had been dismal and so depressing.  Okay, let   s back up. What I recognized even initially, even before I  joined sociology, is there are things outside of you that will help you  succeed. Recognizing that I needed to have a good old boy standing in  Oklahoma to get ahead, I started addressing that right when I got back.  Instead of taking things casually, what I did is I went into the VFW. I  joined the VFW recognizing that that would be a good way to get a foot  in the door. If I had friends and acquaintances, I might be able to get a  job. But I didn   t stop there. I joined the local Masons because I knew  Masonry was big out here, which humorously enough, the original  motive for joining was not good, and the fraternity has never materially  profited me, but what I have gained spiritually is so much more  impressive. I   m a devoted Free Mason who joined for the wrong reasons  but who is now devoted to the fraternity. And then there was one more. I  joined the American Legion. I had three things working for me. I had  tried to put this into a package and started directing the course of my  life.  Jared, were you engaged in any activities on campus or interested in any  student activities at that time?  No. Being in the Masons, I met the mayor and what it was, I wanted to  address the problem that I had experienced with the transition. The fees  and the expenses it costs to get into an apartment were pretty  gargantuan, especially for me as a transitioning veteran. I felt it was  unjust to make veterans weather the cost of that  110, when they could  be like me and just had gotten divorced and  110 is their food budget.  So, what I did is I wrote what I called the Cushing Veterans Assistance  17  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Program. It was a way that the Cushing City Council could waive the  fees for veterans, and I figured, being that Cushing is strong on veterans,  it was likely that it would pass. So, I submitted it. We reworked it, and it  ended up getting passed. So, veterans didn   t necessarily get a free pass  on their utilities and fees, but they had a substantially reduced rate on  what they had to pay. So, that was my first adventure in community  action on the behalf of veterans.  At this time, were you living in Cushing?  Yes, I   ve never moved. I   ve stayed there. Then I was involved in the  Soc iology  Club, and I tried to be as participatory in OSU as possible.  So, there   s a lot of participation. I   m sure we   re all over the place now.  When did you first learn about the Scholar Development and  Recognition Program?  As Dahlia handed me stuff and I filled out more and more, I got more  and more confidence. Well, she handed me the Truman Scholarship one  day and she said,    Why don   t you give this a whack?    and I was like,     Alright, Dahlia, you haven   t been wrong yet.    So, I filled it out, put my  effort into it and turned it in. I don   t know how many undergraduates  competed for it, but I went into the interview and I just was not sure I  was at that kind of level. Dr. Graalman will even admit that first part of  the interview was just like teeth-pulling. It was brutal. They didn   t  understand what I was saying. There was no mutual understanding, but  slowly but surely as I relaxed and they asked me things, we got into  something that I really like to talk about, the stuff that I read in my  personal time, and that   s what got Dr. Graalman fascinated. You   ve got  this guy who fits a sort of little boxy mold, but he   s talking about all  these bizarre writers that most people only hear about at other times.  Is this the Truman committee on campus you   re talking about, to try to  get   if I understand, there   s a limited three or four that they accept to  go on for regional competitions, and this is the OSU phase?  Yes. I was trying to get into the OSU phase, and when the interview  concluded, I don   t know whether I was happy or sad, but I was kind of  relieved that it was over. Later, Dr. Graalman contacted me and said I  was the OSU Truman nominee,  and that  we   d have to get to work.  Well, based on my theory with Dahlia, I had basically been handed an  essay for an essay competition, the Eli Wiesel Essay in Ethics, and I  figured I had a fairly good background to address something I thought  was pertinent and view it academically, and this is when I started  working really hard with Dr. Graalman.  18  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  At the time, I was writing the personal essays for the Truman, the Eli  Wiesel Essay, and what happened is we were constantly focusing on this  stuff. This is where my passion for that program really develops,  because you can   t really appreciate  it  unless you know how much OSU  is willing to do for you. I mean this institution has dedicated beyond  what is even fathomable to its students. The process of Dr. Graalman   s  consistent   it was consistent communication. I would do something and  we he would communicate back. He would look at it   I mean, the hours  he spent personally on this was amazing. As an older student, I can  appreciate how much passion he had for it and how much he was  personally sacrificing, how much he   s doing for every other student.  With  what he   s doing with  me individually, he   s doing with forty other  people, and at that time it was just amazing to me. We progressively  worked on these scholarships and this paper.  Did you have a Wentz Research Project at this time?  No, what happened is I actually started doing research that following  summer, I think it was. Dr. Graalman and I were working on all these  different projects. Slowly but surely we closed each one out. We sent in  what I believe to be   having worked with Dr. Graalman, who is an  unerring perfectionist, if you are not prepared to give it your best, you  probably shouldn   t volunteer for it. But every time I did something with  him, every time I turned something in, I knew that it was the best  product that I could possibly create. There was no question in my mind  that I should be proud of what I just submitted, and that has never really  changed. Our communication continued. I   d tell him what I was doing,  and I started doing research. I had so much going on at the time. I was  working in the community. I had started a program, and I was working  with Dr. Shriver on nuclear and oil contamination in Cushing. So, a  number of projects, just trying to balance all of it mentally. I don   t even  remember all of it, but it was an incredibly productive period.  You mentioned a name or two of some professors that you worked  closely with, of course Bob Graalman in the Scholar Development and  Recognition Office. Were there other professors you were working with  on campus?  Dr. Tom Shriver from the sociology department. I took an  environmental sociology class with him that required a project on  Superfund sites, and so I selected the Hudson Superfund site in Cushing.  Was that funded through the Wentz, or separate funding?  Yes, it was a completely separate matter. What happened was I didn   t  ever do a Wentz Research Project. I ended up getting the Wentz  19  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Scholarship, the annual scholarship, and then the non-traditional  scholarship for books. So, we were doing that. Eventually, I guess it was  the spring of last year, I applied for everything, and Dahlia did the same  thing. She handed me a stack of stuff. I filled it all out. I sent it all in. I  have this thing. I call it the shotgun blast of success. You   re not  guaranteed to get everything, but you   re guaranteed to get something  and you have to shoot to see.  Well, bizarrely enough, last year everything hit. There was not a single  thing that I applied for that I didn   t get, which was stunning, amazing,  but also humbling, like, wow. From going from not knowing if you   re  going to graduate to all these different awards and accolades is pretty  substantive. The fact was is this is what I really have failed to talk about,  but when I was sitting in with the Truman thing, I had never thought that  I was even worthy enough to go to a state school. I had never believed in  myself even slightly, but sitting in that panel, the panel said,    What if  you decided you wanted to go to Stanford?    That was beyond even a  state school, and I never thought that I could achieve even that. What  happened was slowly but surely over time, with the support of the  faculty here, I started to see myself as a valid competitor and to see that  after never having seen it before, it broadens your horizon. The more I  dealt with Dr. Graalman in the Office of Scholar Development and  Recognition, the more I realized I didn   t have to bind myself to one  particular program, that I could have the faith in myself to go to some  other place. The completion of it all was filling out the Marshall  Scholarship. Dr. Graalman completely broke the idea that I would have  to stay here. Not that OSU is a bad institution, but he got me to see that I  can broaden my horizons beyond anything that I had previously  conceived, that I could go out and succeed.  Jared, now you   re a Henry Clay Scholar?  Yes, sir.  Can you talk a little bit about the process you went through for that  recognition and what is that scholarship   it   s aimed towards what?  What it is, Henry Clay, of course, is the historic orator. I think he was  four-time candidate for president. Let me recalibrate here. The  scholarship is a new scholarship. It   s meant to deal with diplomacy in  the modern era and open academic dialog. It takes one student from each  state and the District of Columbia and sends them to a week-long, I  guess I would call it, symposium on dialog and politics. I was selected.  Dr. Graalman was the one who suggested we apply for it, and he was the  one who enabled me to participate in the Henry Clay thing. So, the  week-long  symposium  in Lexington, Kentucky, it has a number of  20  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  notable political figures associated with it. We got to meet three Pulitzer  Prize winners, the coordinator for the Jimmy Carter Center, and we sat  through numerous excellent lectures on the practice of practical politics.  It was a completely eye-opening experience.  Was there an interview process with the committee that you had to go  through to get the award, or is it just an application process?  Humorously enough, one of the ladies who coordinated the program got  a hold of my biography, and I was talking to her over the phone and she  said,    You know, you were stationed at the Old Guard while my  husband was at the Pentagon.    And, so, we started talking military shop  and I think that   s what solidified that selection. Because, oddly enough,  that was a social force less than it was anything else, but I found that to  be interesting.  Did you have to interview?  No, sir.  Just applied and the committee looked at it? You mentioned the  Marshall Scholarship, which is a very prestigious national scholarship.  Can you take us through your application process, the interview and  selection process for that? Recently concluded, I think you were a  finalist?  Close, but no cigar.  Really close, doggone it. Can you kind of give us a sense of what it  means to go through one of those competitive scholarship processes?  Kansas State gives students three credits for filling out the Truman  Scholarship. Dr. Graalman, in a speech, said,    You should probably treat  this like a three credit hour class.    It is unbelievably the most grueling  process that you will ever go through. It will really test your mettle all  the way to the extreme.  The Truman or the Marshall?  The Marshall. I mean, any of the processes. I think there were eight  different essays, but the way that OSU prepares you is vastly different,  because I   ve talked to other students, from the way other schools prepare  for this. What Dr. Graalman did was bring his friend in, Louis Blair, to  talk to each of the different candidates for preparation for this process.  This is even before we set pen to paper or did anything. We have to talk  to Louis Blair. Louis Blair is an engaging individual. We discuss what  21  Gill  Whittington  Gill  he thinks is important. He pinpoints what   s important to us, and he  writes down some notes. So, we sit there for about thirty minutes with  him and he grills us, kind of like an interview would go. He writes down  the things he finds fascinating in our background and he says,    This is  how you should approach a person.    Because he sat on so many  different committees, he knows what these committees are really  looking for. Before we put pen to paper, Dr. Graalman already had us set  up for success. He gives us an idea. What you do is you have to hack out  your first rough draft, and that rough draft is ugly. You   re not going to  produce anything worth looking at, at least in that first cut.  This is where the process kind of speeds up. You progress   this is  always how I work with Dr. Graalman no matter what the project is. I   ll  write the personal essay. I   ll submit it at eight in the morning; he   ll have  it until about two in the afternoon. He   ll tear it apart. I   ll go back and  pick it up in the afternoon. I   ll work on it that night. Submit it at eight  o   clock, and you do this over and over and over again. I wrote fourteen  separate drafts of the Truman essays. I did a little bit better on the  Marshall. We did twelve, and the Eli Wiesel was something like eleven.  But it   s that level of preparation that makes OSU competitive, that kind  of focus.  Did you do a mock interview? And I think they still record those and  then coach you afterwards a little bit on what you did right and what  you did wrong?  I felt amazingly accomplished just to submit the Marshall application.  When the time came, we started doing a series of mock interviews, and  what I found amazing about that was the mock interviews were savage,  gut-wrenching, compared to what the Marshall committee actually did.  OSU sends us out there completely prepared to represent the institution.  Well, I talked to my buddy, Abdullah Farroze. He goes to New Mexico  State; we met at the Henry Clay thing. I asked him how his school  prepared him. He said they didn   t. They just let him go. And, talking to  the other students at the Henry Clay thing and in your travels, you  realize that OSU is the only one that has an office that is this focused on  students, that invests this much time into our success. What happens is,  if there was any question if I was orange before, there is no question  now. Having gotten to see   and I can   t even express it. You just really  would have to talk to the other students and realize that what happens  here is fundamentally different from what happens anywhere else in the  country.  So,  for  the Marshall, you did fourteen, sixteen drafts of your essay that  you sent in to them, and then you had Bob working with you, and then  you did some mock interviews getting ready. And Louis Blair, because  22  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  he was the former director of the Truman Foundation,  talked with you .  So, some experience there was obviously helpful. Now, you were one  of   how many did OSU send forth?  Two.  You were selected out of how many at OSU?  I can   t be sure, but it has to be a very large number.  Congratulations. Then you went to the regional competition, and you  met with the committee. Can you share a little bit about that process?  See, it was funny because I hadn   t really had a chance to take a break, so  a lot of the students were flying down there, but I was going to take a  road trip. I   ve always loved Jack Kerouac, and so I threw my suit in the  truck and as I drive to Houston, stop at greasy spoons, see the sights, just  take my time and do it. I drove down to Houston. It   s pretty good. They  actually had a festival right next to where they were going to be doing  interviews, and so I went to the festival and had a good time. Got a good  night   s sleep. I arrive at the interview hours early because I figured it  was like the military. If I have all this paperwork I have to submit,  there   s going to be a line. I guess it   s a little bit more efficient. I just  showed up early with my paperwork, turned it in, walked around  Houston for a little while, went back and sat there waiting for my  interview. I end up getting into the interview, and it started with a bang.  How many in the committee were in the interview?  There was a British consulate and then six  others , so seven people. To  be honest, what I thought was going to be just a grueling horrible  process was actually like throwing softballs. In my personal essays, I  wrote that Eugene Debs is my personal hero, which I had to start off  explaining that, which I thought I did pretty well.  Some people seem a little far left, don   t they?  (Laughter) Eugene Debs is my personal hero for a variety of reasons,  one of which is he never lost his passion, even though he was  consistently put upon. So, I had Eugene Debs, and then ExxonMobil was  there. My research had been on how large oil companies contaminate  small communities, and it was based on an issue of environmental  justice. And, so, ExxonMobil was sitting on one side of the room, and  one of the panelists was a big wig for Wal-Mart, and what are they  infamous for? Busting unions. Who was my hero? He created the  Pullman Strike. And who did I quote at the end of my essays? Trotsky. It  23  Gill  Whittington  Gill  was not going to go well for me that day. Anyone with progressively  social views, I felt like, really badly. Which is interesting. Trotsky said  that England, it was fundamentally right wing and the reason for it was  that they developed   they were, from the outset, a capitalist nation so  that their Labor Party was fundamentally more conservative than any  other labor party. So, even if you   re wildly left, in Britain you   re still  more conservative than anyone over here. So, he joked about their level  of conservatism. So, my brand of political ideology, even though I have  some things where I   m a moderate democrat, it was not going to win the  day. It didn   t go as badly as I thought. They didn   t rough me up, but I  didn   t anticipate good things.  What an experience, right? Are there other student expectations and  experiences and recognition you   ve had through Oklahoma State than  just the scholarly things you   re talking about?  See, my personal motivations have always just been to learn. That   s why  I read. That   s why I do anything. It   s never for self aggrandizement or  even money, and what I   ve taken away from this institution is exactly  what I needed. Working with Dr. Graalman, I   ve had to write what  amounts to three different sets of personal statements. Each time I wrote  those personal statements, I was forced to focus on what I was saying at  a level that I had never thought I could think. And, so, with each one, the  Truman was less honest. It was part of my personality, but not my whole  personality. It made me think about my future goals, my aspirations,  what I could achieve, and, so, it opened the door for other thoughts. The  Eli Wiesel essay forced me to think about my life in an ethical context,  and the focus by writing it twelve times, you focus on what you want to  say. And the Marshall scholarship I believe to be the sum ultimate of  what I could write here. That essay was absolutely me. It reflects  everything I believe, and I was able to be honest with it.  Through this whole process, it has been Dr. Graalman that has allowed  me to see that these things were possible, that by participating in the  academic dialog, I can succeed. And going from a guy who once  someone said,    You might want to consider Stanford if you get this,     and I chuckled and said,    I   m just a kid who can hardly pay for school  going to Stanford,    to now I want to pursue a master   s degree and  maybe I want to go to the University of Chicago as a revolution, aside  from the fact that all of my values and I know absolutely what I want to  do with the rest of my life. Whether I   ve won anything or not, the simple  fact that I   ve had to focus on ten years of diverse experience over and  over again has forced me to really hone what I believe to be true.  We   re going to pick up and begin on some of your thoughts and kind of  wrap up. Off the camera, you were talking about some unique  24  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  experiences in your life. Can you share some of those and what they  meant to you?  This is probably the best way to sum it up. When I was sitting in one of  the mock interviews for the Marshall, someone asked me,    Why do you  deserve to be here?    and I said,    I   m probably not the smartest person  that   s going to talk to you today, but I can guarantee you nobody has a  level of experience I do. For ten years, I   ve been a soldier, active duty,  Reserve, and eventually National Guard. I will have been on two rescue  squads. I   ve worked at the Library of Congress. I   ve been a journalist.  I   ve written stuff overseas. I   ve worked at a tobacconist. I   ve even  farmed. To jam all of that into ten years, most people can   t do it in a  life.     That   s great. Backing up a little bit, we were talking about from your  experience and your unique perspective, what do you feel are the  strengths and successes of OSU   s Scholar Development and Recognition  Program? You spoke positively about it, but could you speak of some of  the components that are most helpful to you and that you think are  unique to Oklahoma State?  I   d have to say that, first, it   s the reception of the scholar. They receive  you and make you feel a part. They make you want to succeed. The first  thing is that first impression. They are amicable, and they show that they  want to help. That   s the best way to grasp people first. Once they   ve  drawn students into the program, they work with them consistently.  There   s never any lapse in communication. That office communicates  succinctly, but it tells you what it needs. In the military, you lack  communication. Your communication deteriorates, and that   s always  negative, but that office produces good communication that people can  rely on.  Once you   ve moved beyond the communication, it is the exchange  between minds. Dr. Graalman has an idea of what is best of that  particular thing, but he never allows it to squash the individual   s  personality. Instead of it being one person   s production, it   s the work of  two people working together to create something that   s better, and it   s  hard to explain or describe, but what one gets out of the process is far  better than what one puts into it. I think that   s one of the fundamental  strengths of it. There   s no one voice in any of these applications that  outweighs the other, but it   s the work of two minds coming together to  create a better product. I guess it   s synthesis and synergy. Then when the  process is over, you know that you are not a casualty. You have never  been expendable in this entire project. You can go back to that office.  You can feel free to talk to them. You can be a part of that office, and  that   s what they want. They don   t want you go just disappear into the  25  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  ethers. They want you to continue to participate in the academic  discussion that they   re trying to promote at this school. Even after the  Truman, even after the Wiesel, I still would go back in that office just to  talk to them, see how things were going, and they would talk to me. I  never have any fear to go into that office just to say hi, and I do, just  because I love that office. I love Gail  Gillilan  and Dr. Graalman, and  sometimes I just go to chew the fat. That hasn   t changed, and what ends  up happening is once they   ve recognized that you   re willing to  participate in their activities, they give you more activities to participate  in. There   s always a growth and development.  Do you think there are some errors that could be improved over the  years that you think might be helpful?  As a military person, I   m always hesitant to change anything that   s  functional, because what happens is you may gain something in one area  and lose something in another. I think the only thing that I suggest is that  the university itself put more resources into Dr. Graalman   s hands. He  needs more people to help him. He needs more master   s degree people  who work in English to focus on the English and grammar while he can  focus on the broader perspective of what he   s dealing with. Dr.  Graalman needs to be, like in the eyes of an officer, he needs to be in the  big picture. He needs to have a group of people who are willing to help  him, and I think that the best way to promote Dr. Graalman   s success  and the success of this institution is   I know they put resources into it,  but they need to see that as a nerve center for the academic success of  this organization and this institution, because it is. They need to have  more resources, and they need to have more students involved in it.  They can   t allow all of this to rest on his shoulders because he works all  of the time. He works from his house. He needs resources, and I think  the only thing I would change is this school   s focus on it. More focus on  Dr. Graalman and giving him what he needs to succeed.  More resources. Were you involved with the Honors College program?  Did you take honors classes during this process?  No, sir. I never did. The thing was, is ROTC. I get up at four in the  morning to commute to school, to do PT, to have a very long day and get  home maybe by ten thirty if I haven   t done something in the community.  I knew very early that, while I might be able to get into the honors  classes, I simply would not have the time based on the ROTC constraint.  And the fact that for most of my college career I   ve had to work, it was  just not feasible.  And we hadn   t touched on that. Did you go through the four-year  program then, and you graduated   I think in December you   re getting  26  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  your bachelor   s, is that correct? Will you then also receive your  commissioning as a second lieutenant?  Yes, sir.  Then do you intend to stay? You said earlier you   re going to be in the  National Guard. Is that correct?  Yes, sir.  The Forty-Fifth  Infantry Brigade ?  I   ve always striven to be a good Oklahoman. There are fundamental  facets to an Oklahoma personality and background that I like to reflect  because I think Oklahoma is a great state. The people have good level  sense and they   re very community oriented, and that   s why I love the  state. But one of the things you do to be a part of your community and  the state is you join the Forty-Fifth, and that   s what I did.  You may have touched on some of this Jared, but maybe some  summarizing. How has your participation in the Scholar  Development   Program and the scholarship competition influenced and changed your  life?  I   m going to get the plaque out because I spent a lot of time thinking  about how I could concisely say all that Dr. Graalman has done for me.  Let   s take a second and sort of get in the camera here.  What I did by creating this plaque is I wanted this Office of Scholar  Development and Recognition to keep something of me in there because  I am taking something of the Office of Scholar Development and  Recognition Program with me. It was the most powerful experience that  I had here with my time at OSU and is something that I will remember  for the rest of my life. It is with that gratitude that I want to present a  plaque to the office.  Hold it up a little higher and maybe read it right quick.  I tried to find something that really expresses my deep gratitude, the  gratitude that I will have for the rest of my life, and this plaque simply  says,    In acknowledgement of its dedication to OSU students. Working  with the Office of Scholar Development and Recognition was the most  powerful experience of my undergraduate career. It redefined my  personal principles, broadened my horizons and stimulated the creation  of new goals. My gratitude knows no bounds.    And that is truthful and it  27  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  is heartfelt, and I will take it with me for the rest of my life.  They   ll appreciate that very much, Jared.  And, so, I mean, there   s not just one thing that they   ve done. It   s support  and caring, believing in me. So, on a very personal level, they really  grab me. Then, beyond that, it was this focus that they had for my own  betterment, which I will always appreciate. And then there was the  academic side, trying to promote and advance the institution. That is  what I told them before I went down for the Marshall. I said,     Irrespective of whether I get this scholarship or not, I simply want to  represent this institution.    Well, having had the opportunity to be an  OSU student at one of these competitions, articulate my values and sit  there in orange, because I wore an orange tie, and say,    I   m a Poke,    that  really meant a lot to me.  What plans do you have for your life after OSU, Jared?  Oh, my life has been pretty uneven up to this point. I hopefully will get a  little bit more stability.  Your life has a lot of turns, and you can   t see around corners, but where  are you going with your life after this?  I anticipate in February I have to go to my basic officer leader course, so  from February to April I   ll be doing that. I   ll come back and probably  get a low-wage job doing something until I get into grad school, but  what I   m probably going to do is get special student status and try to get  a second bachelor   s degree in political science, because that   s crucial to  the understanding of the discipline of sociology. I   ve got to understand  the structure if I   m going to understand the forces. What I   m going to do  is I   m going to enter graduate school in the fall here studying with Dr.  Shriver in environmental sociology, which I find to be interesting.  Do you think you   ll get enough hours in the summer to be able to get a  second major, a second degree?  It   ll probably be advanced over two years.  A year from next fall, okay.  I   ll do two years here, get a master   s degree in sociology, Master   s of  Science. In that time, I already have a   my project is going to be called  Sociology for the People.    When a discipline loses its ability to redeem,  to enlighten or to focus the goals of others, it is no longer pertinent.     Something C. Wright Mills said. Right now, sociology has fallen under  28  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  the error that C. Wright Mills blasts in Sociological Imagination. We are  quibblers. We are not dealing with social forces anymore, but with micro  systems, and that   s not going to help anyone. The discipline of sociology  as it was redeeming to me could be redeeming to others. They could see  what   s going on and they could grasp their own problems that they   re  having, and then they could go out and try to address them. I want to  write a book called Sociology for the People. I   m going to try, through  my own personal experience, because very clearly it   s tied to social  forces. By showing people that some of your individual failures are not  your own, that you can be redeemed, that not all of the great weight of  the world is on you, but if you can see   like, in the military, we see  terrain, and we carve our way through it because there   s a way to  approach your objective. If you can show people the invisible terrain  they   re encountering, show them how to navigate it, they might have a  more full life. I want people to not feel indifference. I want people to be  engaged, and that   s why I would do this. I would like them to be an  engaged part of their environment, and that would be the ultimate goal  of that book: that people, again, become a part of their communities, that  they see themselves not as separate as an individual, but as an integral  part of it, and they also can understand and expect their life trajectory.  They don   t have goals that are not compatible with what they can  expect, but they can become satisfied with where they are.  In your wildest dreams, did you ever think you would have a PhD and be  writing a book?  I   ve always written (Laughter)   not on sociology, not having a PhD, but  I   ve always wanted to help other people. That   s never changed. And to  do it in a discipline that I   m passionate about and that I love is probably  the greatest honor that I could have.  You wear that orange now, Jared. Are there some special, favorite  memories you have of Oklahoma State University?  Just sitting in class. Sociology, I loved it. I couldn   t think of anything  better to do than sit in a sociology class and debate something with a  teacher. Then there   s the ROTC moments where no one   the thing that  makes the military engaging is people really don   t like the military, but  what they do like is the people, and you can only meet the people in the  military, so they continue to re-enlist to be with the people. The best part  of my OSU career, aside from sitting in class, has been to deal with the  cadets over at Thatcher Hall. They   re a funny group of kids, and I  always have a good time talking to them. I don   t know if that   s really a  great answer, but those kids, they   re pretty funny. We go out to eat and  stuff, and we suffer in the cold in the mornings when we   re running, but  it   s the fact that everyone is miserable together that makes it a great  29  Gill  Whittington  Gill  Whittington  Gill  time.  Is there anything else that we haven   t covered or talked about, Jared?  Any comments you   d like to make?  I don   t know. I think that when words fail, you can only say that words  fail. I just have to say just one more time for my own health and well-being  that the Office of Scholar Development and Recognition was a  fascinating and fabulous time and that I will never be able to truly repay  this institution for all that it has done for me. But, in my life goals, it will  be to make sure that that office, when I have the money, for example, if I  get deployed overseas, that office will get a fat endowment to help some  of their students. That will be the first thing that comes out of that check  when I get back. I am a Poke, and this institution will flourish because of  what they have done for me. It was the first time I had, as an institution,  the first place that I felt loved, and I am orange to the core.  Well, I   m sure Bob   s going to listen   we   ve got it recorded, Jared.  (Laughter) That   s fine. That   s why I said it because I   m poor right now,  but I   m working on a plan. I think my first goal is   they told me, I   ve  talked to the people,    You get 5 percent.    That   s what you can expect on  whatever you put into these programs. You can expect to get 5 percent  back, I think, and my ultimate goal is to make sure that that office, in the  next 5 years, has  10,000. I want them to be able to give  500 to a  student in need so that they can buy the clothes they need to go to these  interviews. When I went to the Marshall, I was not poorly dressed, don   t  get me wrong, but I was wearing some shoes I had gotten at a thrift store  and some clothes that may not have reflected me the best that I could,  and when Dr. Graalman sees a student in need, he can say,    Hey,  someone set aside  500 for you to get some shoes and a coat so you can  go down there and knock it out.    And we   re going to give it a name  because a lot of times when people see this list of things, they don   t  know what they mean, but we   ll make it an award, so when these up and  comers come into his office and need something, he can tack that right  onto their resume and they can go on to succeed.  Jared, I appreciate it very much. Thank you.  -------  -------
