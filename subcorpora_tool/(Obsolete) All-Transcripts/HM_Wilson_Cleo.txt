Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us first of all your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother changed her name at some point, so the name that she was given, and I don't know how to spell it, was Frankie Mae Page [Frances Page Watson].  So I don't know if it was Frankie, I-E, or Franky, Y, and I don't know if Mae is M-A-E or M-A-Y.  She changed it to Frances, F-R-A-N-C-E-S.  So I'm trying to find out now.  This whole thing has sent me on a quest now (laughter) to do some family research.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there story behind why she changed it, from Frankie Mae to Frances?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad's name is Cleo [Cleo Chancey] and so they would get mail addressed to Mr. Frank and Cleo Chancey so she, she changed it.  And it's, and it's a history of changing names in my family.  I didn't know that until quite recently.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born November 11th and I believe she was born in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-one [1921].
Speaker 1: Okay, nine--in Kentucky and this is in western Kentucky?  I believe we were talking earlier.
Speaker 2: Brownsville, Kentucky which is thirty miles from Bowling Green, Kentucky.  It's right outside the Mammoth Caves [Mammoth Cave National Park].

Speaker 2: I haven't been able--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were telling us about your ancestors on your mother's side.
Speaker 1: On my mother's side the name is DePrad, D-E-capital P-R-A-D.  It's been, it's spelled different ways in the various senses.  Sometimes it's a lower case D and other times I've seen it DePrade with an E on the end.  The family seems to have been around Kentucky and, and Hamilton County, Ohio, which I don't know where that is, (laughter) but must be near Kentucky.
Speaker 2: That's Cincinnati [Ohio], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah Cincinnati--
Speaker 2: --right across the Ohio River.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah.  And some of the DePrads migrated to Kansas, Nicodemus?
Speaker 2: Oh that's historic, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Black town, all black town.
Speaker 1: Yeah right, right.
Speaker 2: Now that's, the town is all, all but dried up now.  They--I mean, I talked to a representative (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a ghost town, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, right.
Speaker 1: But at least one DePrad went there.  My grandmother [Margaret DePrad Page] stayed in Brownsville the longest.  All of her siblings, all one by one, came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know when, where, when was the Great Migration?  They were in the census in 1930.  They were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's the Great Migration.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were in Chicago in 1930--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: That's kind of the beginning of it.
Speaker 1: Right.  She came later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she was a teacher.
Story_ID: 611277
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?

Speaker 1: --to get her teaching--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did she teach here in the city?
Speaker 2: No, only in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: She was, from what I, you know, she was considered a spinster 'cause she married late.  And she married the town barber.
Speaker 1: From Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from Brownsville.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they both migrated to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, she remarried.  (Laughter) She ran away.
Speaker 1: Oh, she ran away?  (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I should tell that story?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a good story, we want to hear it.
Speaker 2: She--the circuit preacher came through town and from all I know is they ran away.  So, and they were married in Ohio.  I found a record of their marriage in Ohio, but my--I, I don't know the dates.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: So this would be, you said this was around 1930 that she came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: I think that she got married in '35 [1935].  I'm not sure to, to Robert Porter [sic. Robert Page] and then they, and at some point they came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the okay.  So she was married--Robert Porter was the person that, was the reverend?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and, and the other person that she was married to--
Speaker 2: She had two kids, my mother [Frances Page Watson] and a brother.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And what was the other, her husband in Kentucky's name?
Speaker 2: I think his name was John Henry Page [sic.].
Speaker 1: John Henry Page, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But I didn't, I didn't know him.  The peo- the guy I thought was my grandfather was her second husband.
Story_ID: 611278
Speaker 1: About 1935 they're in Chicago [Illinois] and, and your mother [Frances Page Watson] basically moved from Kentucky with her mother [Margaret DePrad Page] to Chicago, right?  With her (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't have that right, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I have to check those dates, okay?  Because my mother, my grandmother was still in, in Kentucky when my mother came to Chicago.  Her siblings were all here.  You know, my grandmother's siblings were here but she wasn't.  She was still down there teaching, and my mother's very dark skin and she kept telling my mother that there were no dark people in Chicago.  So she was making her--she was bathing with bleach water to lighten her skin before she came.
Speaker 1: That's, that's a odd que- odd story sort of like (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She said, my mother claims it dried out her skin, which I'm sure it did, yeah.
Speaker 1: So your mother came up before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She, when she, when she, the first time she came she was working what they called on a place in Michigan City, Indiana, as a domestic and that was where she met my father [Cleo Chancey].
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your mother was a teenager when she came up with regard, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no she wasn't.  No she wasn't.
Speaker 1: She wasn't?
Speaker 2: She was a late bloomer too.
Speaker 1: She was born in '21 [1921]?

Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was in her twenties then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was born when she was twenty-one and I'm the oldest.  (Pause) I'll have to get you all this stuff.  You gonna--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --put question marks where I can give you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the exact dates, or (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you filled out the, the questionnaire, didn't you or did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't know 'em then either. (Laughter) I had a lot of blanks in there. You know.
Speaker 1: Well, it's an ongoing process and we have a archive you can add information (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --to--
Speaker 2: --okay-
Speaker 1: --later, you know.
Speaker 2: As I find it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: (Clears throat).
Speaker 1: So right, right now what you know about it is, will have to suffice until we, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's driven me to go look.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty common, you know, we, we find that to be true, people don't know, necessarily know.  So she worked in Michigan City and she--did she meet your father in Michigan City?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Michigan City, Indiana.  Okay, and all right.  And so they, they met around 1940 or so?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941] or something like '42 [1942] something like that.
Speaker 1: Did your mother have any stories of growing up in the, in Kentucky about what it was like there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, that, that they walked to school barefoot and carried their shoes so they wouldn't wear out.  They had, they had like a small farm so she, you know, she had chickens and I know they had a mule because he kicked one of her cousins in the head and he had epileptic seizures for the rest of his life as a result of that.  So she, you know, she grew up in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did she have a chance to go to school--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --like her mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  She went to, she, you know, she completed high school I don't know what, and she took courses because she was a very fast typist.  She had during World War II [WWII], she went to Washington [D.C], you know, I guess they were calling people to come to war effort and she was some kind of, in some kind of large secretarial pool there.  And she also was a key punch operator on the early computers, on the giant, early computers.
Speaker 1: All right, that's when they punched the cards (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: COBOL [Common Business Oriented Language] and FORTRAN [Formula Translation] and all that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I did that too.
Story_ID: 611279
Speaker 1: Well let me get, get your father's story.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: The name that I know him by (laughter) is Cleo Chancey.  He has changed it over the course of his life and it, and it's Antonio Cleo and Cleo Antonio, so his nickname was Tony.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind why he changed his name to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Antonio?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  And I don't even think he thought there was any irony in the fact that it was, you know, that his names are Cleopatra and Anthony (laughter), you know, Cleo and Antonio so, but I don't, I don't have any idea.
Speaker 1: Well you-- his name was just Cleo was it, not Cleopatra?
Speaker 2: No, just Cleo.
Speaker 1: Just Cleo, okay.  Just want to clarify, okay.  But he, yeah there is, it is kind of ironic Antonio, okay.  And did, I mean did he, did he use Cleo as a last name or still used Chancey or?
Speaker 2: No, he was always Chancey.
Speaker 1: Chancey, okay, all right, okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, got dammit!  See!  It just comes right out.  Can we stop and I go get it?
Speaker 1: Oh, it's all right it is, it is like, is he (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Cough) Nineteen sixteen [1916].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixteen [1916]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think it was January 31, 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I am not sure about Oklahoma, what, you know, what part.
Speaker 1: But he was born in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well all right.  Is, what can you tell us about the ancestors on his side.
Speaker 2: I can't tell you much actually.  His mother [Marjorie Gay Chancey] died when he was two years old so he had no siblings.  He was an only child.  His father's name was Albert [Albert Chancey].  We don't know what his mother's name was.  And the one thing that he would say was, "My granddaddy was a white man" so, so we don't, you know.  When other Chanceys have tried to contact him when he was alive, you know, he would say, "You don't want to talk to me."  You know, if they were white.
Story_ID: 611280
Speaker 1: He have any stories about growing up or about his family that he shared with, with you?
Speaker 2: The story, you know, some of these stories are so embellished or something that, you know, I don't know what's is true anymore.  But the story that he tells is that, that as a young man his father couldn't take care of him, you know, 'cause he, here was man with this child and relatives put him on a train and sent him somewhere.  So I, I don't know if at some point his father had moved to Indiana in the Michigan City area and whoever he left my father [Cleo Chancey] with eventually put him on a train and sent him to his father.  And he, and he, the and the story he tells is the train just seemed so big and the steam and how scary it was to get on this train to go off somewhere, where to meet--
Speaker 1: Okay, let me just sit down and backtrack a little bit to try and get it straight that--so in Oklahoma relatives, after his mother [Marjorie Gay Chancey] died, I guess his father couldn't take care of him.  So some relatives put him on a train and sent him to Michigan City?
Speaker 2: His father, his father left and went to Michigan City.
Speaker 1: Oh, his father left and went to Michigan City?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Albert [Albert Chancey] left and went to Michigan City.
Speaker 1: And the relatives put him on a train to join his father?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At some point in his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he--that's how he wound up in Michigan City?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, now did, did he have a chance to go to finish high school too and?
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about his schooling.  He was a smart man, he was a story teller, a joke teller.  He was very light on his feet, a good dancer.  He grew up in, in Michigan City.  The woman that his father hooked up with was, you know, like what they would call a sporting woman, you know.  She ran a place that--they weren't whorehouses but they, you know, they had beds where people could come and have sex with partners and stuff.  And (cough) I'm not sure--he had a friend like that and when he went back to Oklahoma too so there he would cash his check, he could buy his liquor, there was entertainment, you could bring a woman.  It was all behind a big fence and it was private.  But it was where, where the men went when they were cheating or bring their girlfriends or whatever.  So that was the kind of place that he was in when he was at, also in Michigan City.  That was what he, the scene that he grew up in there.  So he was sort of a slick dude.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother [Frances Page Watson] was, was a country girl, you know, she was dumb, at least he thought she was.
Story_ID: 611281
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they [Wilson's parents, Frances Page Watson and Cleo Chancey] met?
Speaker 2: She was, it was on the weekend and she was getting her hair done and the only colored beauty parlor in the little town and he saw her in there and came and, and started flirting with her and she says he was singing, "Oh little playmate, come out and play with me" and seduced her.  And he said would--he, she asked him where were they going and they says only one, one place coloreds go in this town and that was to a carnival in Michigan City [Indiana], you know, like a little amusement park that was there for years and years and years.  And, and so that was only, it was the amusement park or a tavern somewhere in town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that, that was their first date (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the amusement park?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so that developed into more than just a date?
Speaker 2: Very quickly I assume.  (Laughter) Because she got pregnant with me.  He got drafted and shipped off to the war [World War II, WWII] and at some point they got married, I don't know when.  In my mind they got, and I don't know if this was the story she told me, is he was stationed in Biloxi and she took the train down there with me to meet him and to get married before he shipped off.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Biloxi, Mississippi (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, on the Gulf [Gulf of Mexico].
Story_ID: 611282
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their looks, their talents, their dispositions who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father [Cleo Chancey] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, in what respect?
Speaker 2: I have his eyes.  We, you know, we call 'em the Chancey eyes, these heavily, heavy lidded eyes.  I think I'm a, I'm a story teller.  I, I have more of his personality actually.  Everybody else is a little more quieter.  I used to describe my mom [Frances Page Watson] as a box of chocolates.  You know, she's just very sweet, very even tempered person.  She doesn't curse, you know.   She's, has a high, thin voice.  She's just so sweet.  That was--
Speaker 1: That's quite a description.  I've, I never, haven't heard anybody describe their, someone like that before. That's interesting, a box of chocolates  (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's just, just sweet.
Story_ID: 611283
Speaker 1: Did you start out life in Michigan City [Indiana], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: No.  After, after he [Wilson's father, Cleo Chancey] came back from the war [World War II, WWII]--I got another really good story (laughter) for you here--so when she [Wilson's mother, Frances Page Watson] went and met him and got married, she got pregnant.  I don't know where I was, but she got pregnant and he shipped off and she had, she was pregnant with twins [Gladys Chancey Lytle and Joyce Chancey Davis].  And so they were born in September, 1944.  I was born in May, 1943.  So the twins were born and the Red Cross [American Red Cross] was, you know, supposed to notify the soldiers when the children were born and it took so long for the Red Cross to get the story, you know, get the message to him that they were born, that he couldn't believe that those were his children.  So the story is he was coming back to kill her (laughter) 'cause she had had somebody else's kids.  And when he got there they were crawling around, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay. (Laughter) The time period frame didn't match up right.
Speaker 2: Right, right 'cause he was like, he's been gone all this time, how's she having twins (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay, so he came back after the war was over?
Speaker 2: After the war and we lived in Altgeld Gardens [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She lived, she lived in Roseland [Chicago, Illinois] with us until he came back and then we moved to Altgeld Gardens, and he worked at the steel mills out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he worked for a, which, which mill was it?
Speaker 2: There was two.  Is it one like South Works [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably, yeah big, that's a real big one.
Speaker 2: It's right, it's not far from Altgeld Gardens.  That's right.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not too far.  Okay.  So, I take it he worked for the steel mill the rest of his life (unclear)?
Speaker 2: He worked in steel for most of his life.  You know he left Chicago [Illinois] actually and went back to Oklahoma and there he worked at Boeing [The Boeing Company] but he was also in, in the steel part of it, operations.
Story_ID: 611284
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I do, I do.  The, I have, you know, when I was trying to tell you I have very complicated and dysfunctional history so I have the history I ended up becoming a foster child.  So my earliest memories with, are with my family when we lived in Altgeld Gardens [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and that was when we were a unit, you know.  That was, that was six kids and two parents [Frances Page Watson and Cleo Chancey].  And it seems--my parents were playful.  So they played with us all the time, you know, they would trick us and do all kinds of stuff, you know.  So I--one of my early memories is in Altgeld Gardens was more like a community then than it is now I would guess.  And on Halloween, at night, they would show movies.  They would project movies outside on a big screen and there would be a bonfire and I remember the movie that was showing was 'The Invisible Man.'  And I don't remember much about it except the fire and it's dark all around us and this big, white screen and a chair rocking with nobody in it.  (Laughter) That was just so scary to me, but that's one of the things that I remember.
Story_ID: 611285

And then my brother, Ronald Chancey, is the oldest boy.  And, oh, I didn't tell you where they live.  Gladys lives in Tulsa [Oklahoma].  Joyce lives in Altadena, California.  Ronald, the oldest boy, lives in New Jersey and he's retired from Bloom [Bloom Energy Corporation], that company that bought out the engineering side of AT&T [AT&T Inc.].  Luminous--I don't know what it is.  I can't remember.  And then Michael [Michael Chancey] is the second one.  Ronald and Michael are born the same day exactly a year apart and Michael suffers from schizophrenia and he's disabled and then my brother, [HistoryMaker] Vincent Chancey, is a famous jazz French horn player.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Jazz French horn, that's something.

Speaker 2: We all, we all went to, ended up in the same foster home.  She took all six of us.
Story_ID: 611286
Speaker 1: It's a perfunctory question we always ask and it's can you give us some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  Sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  I guess Altgeld [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois] would be the, would be the major (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that the Halloween thing I described, I think that's a sight. I don't know, I have to think about the sounds.  Smells, the cedar chips I guess.  Whatever kind of chips that they put on the playground.  I can remember that smell.  I don't know what kind of chips it is though, some wood chips of some kind.
Speaker 1: Right, right, pine or cedar, yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it kindergarten or first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kindergarten--
Speaker 1: --grade?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --first grade, you know, all the way through probably third or fourth grade, maybe fifth I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so all the way to the fifth grade.  So that's, that's the school that you went to at Altgeld, when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were at Altgeld Gardens.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you, were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a good student and my mother [Frances Page Watson] really taught me to read quite young.  So, and even before I was going to school my father [Cleo Chancey] would take me with him to the bar, the tavern as they called it, so I could read for his friends.  So I'd been reading for, you know, pretty, you know, long time before (laughter) by the time I got to school already.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did you have a favorite teacher at George Washington Carver?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: A favorite subject?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.

Speaker 1: When you were growing up were you, did you like television and radio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did sit around and listen to the radio and we did have a television.  I remember at one point we had the first TV on the block and, you know, we would watch 'Howdy Doody' ['The Howdy Doody Show'].  I remember that but I also remember that the payments weren't made and, and the people were coming to take the television and, and I remember us all, you know, like ducking around hiding from them and they are knocking on the door to take the TV back.  So, I think we, we would start out with a lot of new stuff and then it would go back, you know, we didn't keep it so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So times are kind of tough ec- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --ec- economically.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A steel, steel job, you know, was pretty good job on some level like, you know.
Speaker 2: Well he was, he was, he was a alcoholic and (laughter) so he had a, he had a tab at the tavern.  So and finally my mother [Frances Page Watson] actually went to the steel mill [South Works, Chicago, Illinois] and had them start mailing the check directly, directly to her so, so she would have the check.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I've heard those kind of stories before.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so was there a lot of tension in the home about it, money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there probably was, you know, I mean, we weren't aware of it.  The thing that, that changed for all of us is my mother became a Jehovah's Witness [Jehovah's Witnesses] and she just started doing all that studying and being gone all the time because she had to go, you know, knock on doors and, and so she was home less and less.  And at one point I believe she even took a job.  You know, somehow she was getting paid to do things and she was leaving us at home and, and a, a babysitter was supposed to come to the house be, and get us our breakfast and then get us off to school.  And she would, my mother would put the, what was supposed to be the dinner on the back burner and the breakfast on the front burner of the stove for a, so we, you know, the oatmeal or whatever it was.  And the babysitter learned that we could get our own food so she was coming late, later and later.  And my sister, one of my sisters, Gladys [Gladys Chancey Lytle], was standing in a rocking chair trying to take the oatmeal off the stove and my little brother, Vincent [HistoryMaker Vincent Chancey], was standing, standing holding on to the rocking chair and the whole thing fell over on him, and actually it was beans 'cause the oatmeal was in the wrong place, and burned him from his neck down.  And it was in the winter I remember and I was, nobody's home and the doors were frozen and I was, couldn't get out of the house and I finally climbed out of the window to go get the next door neighbor.  And they came in and they made a big mistake as they took the clothes off and it took his skin off with them and I just remember he didn't cry.  But my father [Cleo Chancey], that, that caused a lot of, lot of tension after that, that, you know, that my mother wasn't home, that she was spending so much time out in the field or whatever.  And the fights that I started remembering them having, you know, just were getting bigger and bigger and at some point he left.  And he, when he left he went back to Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even though he hadn't been there all of his life, he did (laughter) go back there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it he was not a Jehovah's Witness?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay. As far as I know he had no religion.
Speaker 2: Being a Jehovah's Witness is sort of a consuming kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is--
Speaker 2: --routine in terms of time.
Speaker 1: --it is, it is.  Yeah, you know, it, it consumed her life.  And you know, you know it was like you had to earn points or something and so she was always doing things.
Speaker 2: Did--I know they, I've heard they don't celebrate birthdays.
Speaker 1: No birthdays, no Christmas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: And we had all those holidays before, you know they were, and they were big deals before (cough).  They would, you know they would shop like crazy for us and hide stuff for us for Christmas and, and then all of a sudden it's no more Christmas and then he's not there anymore.  It was very different, very different.
Story_ID: 611289
Speaker 1: Your brother [HistoryMaker Vincent Chancey] survived the--
Speaker 2: He was in the hospital for almost a year and, and then he, well he came home and then, then he probably had picked it up in the hospital, he had spinal meningitis and had to go back in the hospital.  So he had a rough two years.  So, you know, it's just like a very traumatic thing, everything was shifting and changing in, in a different way from the happy times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did--now, how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: I was probably eight or nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so the, the family was broken up when you were ten, right, you were ten years old?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother [Margaret DePrad Page] died and that, and with my father [Cleo Chancey] gone, you know, that was so hard on my mother [Frances Page Watson].  And she had a nervous breakdown and so at that point she was hospitalized and for a, what I assume is a short period of time.  When I get all of us together none of us can remember how long we were separated but we were taken by twos to--we were with different families for a period of time and then my mother's first or second cousin came and she took all six of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So.
Speaker 2: So I was ten when that happened.
Speaker 1: Did you ever live with your mother again?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All six of us stayed there for the rest of our, 'til we grew up and moved away.
Speaker 1: What, how, do you have any indication of how your mother felt about that?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah!  Terrible (laughter), she felt really bad about it and she in fact married again in the hopes of, you know, if she had another husband that she would get the kids back, get us all back and, but, you know, the process was taking a long time.  By that time I was sixteen or seventeen years old, you know, it wasn't making any sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's, okay so, that's, you know, well, how did you make it during this period of time?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was rough.  It was very rough for all of us, you know, that transition and, and we went from, you know, playful parents who, you know, kind of let us be ourselves, let us be individuals, to a home where this was incredibly strict, Christian, you know, a totally different thing, totally different.
Speaker 1: This is your, with your cousins?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the foster mother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, did the, when your mother was a Jehovah Witness [Jehovah's Witnesses] did you go to, ever go to their services or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did--
Speaker 1: --with her?
Speaker 2: --and I remember she went to some convention or whatever they call those things in New York and I remember she took me with her and I remember that, we drove to New York.  I remember going through the, through the Allegheny Mountains.  It was when I learned the word Allegheny.  So, yeah, she did, she did take us, take me probably, only one on some of these things, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what religion were your cousins and or her cousins?
Speaker 2: She's some kind of Pentecostal, you know, store front church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There, was it out there near Altgeld [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois] or?
Speaker 2: No, it was on the West Side (laughter).  It was on, right off Lake [Street] on Washtenaw [Avenue].  So, Silvio's [Chicago, Illinois], where Muddy Waters and all that was happening was not too far from the house and she would go out there and beat a tambourine and preach.
Speaker 1: So she was the pastor of?
Speaker 2: Well, she, sort of, yeah.  And because I was the devil, you know, she would take me with her.
Speaker 1: You were the devil? That's--now let's look at that. Now why were you the devil?
Speaker 2: Well, she, that's what she thought I was 'cause I was mischievous I guess, you know, I had a little more of a personality.  I'm not saying my siblings (laughter) don't have personalities, but, but mine was already set.  You know, I was older and like I said, I was more like my father.  So, so I remember when we would be standing outside a nightclub I could see the name Muddy Morganfield McKinley Waters [sic.] and you could hear the music pouring out of there and she's, "Jesus blah, blah, blah, blah!"  You know, it was quite a contradiction and, of course, I was enjoying the other part of it.
Story_ID: 611290
Speaker 1: Did your father [Cleo Chancey] ever come back to visit or did you ever see him at--
Speaker 2: These are things that we learned later in life that because my foster mother had, had, you know, she had gotten us through the state, the, through the welfare system or whatever.
Speaker 1: Department of Children and Family Services [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services]?
Speaker 2: That's right, she got us through the Department of Children and Family Services, you know, with six kids all at once, you know, all of a sudden this was a, in those days it was a nice chunk of change.  So I think she was getting a, you know, so we're talking in the 1953 she was getting about three hundred dollars a month for the six of us plus, you know, they gave us some clothes and she got food allowance and stuff like that.  So she actually had threatened my father that if he came around she was, that she was gonna report him for desertion so, so he, you know, he, he would send things and we didn't know that these things came from him until much, much later, you know 'til we were all adults.  You know, and remember the, the stuff, the items but she never told us they were from him.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Frances Page Watson], was she able to visit?
Speaker 2: She would, she would, yeah we would visit with her and we would also go visit her in Manteno [Illinois] where she was at the mental hospital [Manteno State Hospital] but, you know, she was hospitalized for a lot of the time so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it just wasn't for a brief period of time she was?
Speaker 2: Off and on constantly--
Speaker 1: Off and on, constantly.
Speaker 2: --for most of her life afterwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she, did, I mean now is there a diagnosis of what was wrong with her?
Speaker 2: I think she probably--
Speaker 1: 'Cause in those days--
Speaker 2: --in those, what would, when, those days I don't know what they called it but she probably was what we'd call schizoaffective so she had a combination of schizophrenic and manic depression.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right I think though in those days they would just say a nervous breakdown and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's a different, yeah, yeah, so now, now we know a little bit more about what--
Speaker 2: And I know a lot about it.
Story_ID: 611291
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I, I went to a school called Hayes [ph.].  I don't know what the first name was and then for sixth through eighth grade I went to McKinley [William McKinley Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].  It was a, like a middle school.  And then from there I went to Crane, Crane High School [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I was at Crane High School until the end of my junior year.  I started my senior year at Parker [Parker High School] at sixth, and it's the same Francis Parker but it's a public school that's now Robeson [Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right, in, in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right, 6800 South Stewart [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So in your outline, they, I think they, whoever wrote the outline thought it was the exclusive Francis [Francis W. Parker School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everybody does, everybody does.  Only us who went there know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  So Parker High School--
Speaker 2: 'Cause--I remember the outline person asking what it was like and all that and I was like no I didn't go there.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I was thinking when I was reading it that it was probably the one in Englewood but I didn't.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The, okay, so now did your grades suffer any through all this traumatic?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 611292
Speaker 1: One of the things is, that I did is I just totally escaped in books and I just read all the time, all the time.  Everything I could get my hands on.  So I was one of those people who would read in the room with the flashlight and, you know, I just read all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so this is like late '50s [1950s] early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So what were your favorite reading materials?
Speaker 1: Believe it or not one of 'em was Ayn Rand.
Speaker 2: At that age?  At a, okay.
Speaker 1: But I mean at the same time I mean if she's considered what, some kind of neo-Nazi or something?  But, you know, it was all that individual strength kind of stuff.  I remember 'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged.'  I loved those books (laughter), you know, as a teenager.
Speaker 2: Did you see the movies or any of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no (laughter).
Speaker 2: Gary Cooper was in 'The Fountainhead.'
Speaker 1: It couldn't have been as good.  It couldn't have been as good (laughter) as my imagination.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  Who introduced you to Ayn Rand?
Speaker 1: I have no idea (laughter).
Speaker 2: Very interesting so, okay.  Did you have any, did you have a favorite subject in middle school or high school?
Speaker 1: Well, what we would call English, you know, everything that had to do with reading and writing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you were pretty accomplished with reading Ayn Rand in middle school.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But also, what, somehow or another I was interested in music too.  So I was, by the time I was in high, in high school I was in the, at Crane [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois] I was in the orchestra and I played a bass.
Speaker 2: Okay, played the--
Speaker 1: String bass.
Speaker 2: --string bass, okay.
Speaker 1: Upright.
Speaker 2: Upright bass, all right.  Did you play the classical with the bow too?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause it was an orchestra.  I wanted to play timpani and in those days they said, "Women don't play drums."
Speaker 2: Okay. Did you have a, in high school were you a part of, you know, the, their high school clubs and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Future Teachers of America (laughter).
Speaker 2: --activities?  Do you, did you see yourself becoming a teacher?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What about, did you ever run, run for class officer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: --or anything like that?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And were you an honor student?
Speaker 1: I was in the place, you know, up- upper placement stuff but, but I wasn't an honor student.
Speaker 2: Okay. But a good student?
Speaker 1: I was a good student.
Speaker 2: Okay. Did you have a favorite teacher during this period?
Speaker 1: The favorite teacher that I had was, it was when I was at McKinley [William McKinley Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois] and I don't remember much other than his name was Mr. Carter [ph.].  I think it might have been the first male teacher that I could remember and he just, he just said lots of things that, that impressed me.  I don't think I had a crush on him or anything like that but, but he, he was just an interesting person.  And one of the things that he said that women should learn how to read so they could, you know, learn how, could read recipes so they wouldn't make heavy bread (laughter).
Speaker 2: I've never heard that reason before.  (Laughter) So okay, you were playing the cello did, did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The bass, bass.
Speaker 2: --the bass? Okay, the bass, all right, all right.  Make sure to get it right.  All right now, did you participate in the marching band at all?
Speaker 1: Naw, I don't think Crane had one.  Naw, they had an orchestra and they had a band and I played in the orchestra and I don't, I don't remember the orchestra teacher's name.  But you know, you know we played classical music and, and some pops, you know, show tune kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 611293
Speaker 1: What happened that you changed high schools from Crane [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois] to?
Speaker 2: We moved to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We moved to 6624 South Lowe [Avenue] and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was into a bigger house, you know, to accommodate all of us.  In the meantime we gypsied around to different places, you know.  We moved from Washtenaw [Avenue] to two places on Walnut [Street] before moving to the South Side.  Each one was better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this was a pretty big place.  Now did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't huge but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we had more than--when we went to that, when we moved on, in on Washtenaw it was a two bedroom house and here she [Wilson's foster mother] had six kids from somebody else and two of her own.  So it was eight children in that house, in that two bedroom house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We slept everywhere.
Speaker 1: Were, were you treated, you know, like her children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --I mean in terms of?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's definitely a difference?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, very different, very different.  You know, if when it came to things like getting a bike for Christmas, you know, her boy, her son and daughter each got a bike and then in my family the girls, all three of us got a, one bike and the boys all three of them got one bike.  You know, so we didn't--their relatives didn't, you know (background noise) didn't treat us like family (background noise)--when it was gift giving time and stuff, you know, they would, we wouldn't get gifts from her family.
Speaker 1: So, even though these are your mother's cousins--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they didn't treat you like you were a part of the family?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They treated us like we were part of the family but they didn't treat us like, you know, because she, we would go and celebrate with her mother.  So, you know, we were, we were relatives but we, I mean they made a difference.  They made a difference and she and at, and she made a difference and maybe that's why.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, she set the tone for--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay.  So when you were a senior in high school [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois], were you anxious to get out of that situation?
Speaker 2: Oh god, yes.
Story_ID: 611294
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna go into the senior in high school.  So I was a senior at Parker [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I was there for one year and they didn't have an orchestra but they had a band and I went and asked about, you know, I asked about being in the orchestra.  They told me they didn't have one.  And so the band teacher, when he found out I played a bass, decided he would put together a jazz band.  And so it was me and three or four other players.  They, he found me a bass and it was an old bass and we painted it white and my brother, Vincent [HistoryMaker Vincent Chancey], would come to school and bring the bass home for me.  He pulled it in his wagon home.
Speaker 2: This is the one that was burned?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  He's a musician.  So it was during my bass playing years (laughter) that I hooked up with these guys who all (laughter) became famous.  Henry Threadgill.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Saxophone player--
Speaker 1: Joseph Jarman--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --Joe Jarman and I can't think of, we called him Bucky Weaver [ph.] but I, because (laughter) he had buck teeth (laugher) but I don't remember what his real name is.  And Ari Brown, he had a different name too then.  So I was the bass player with this group.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Richard Brown his name was.
Speaker 1: So that was by the time I was, you know, towards my end of my high school year, you know, my last semester in high school I was, and we, we would get these little gigs to do stuff.  And I still didn't know how to, I didn't know how to play, you know, like, I didn't know how to improvise and they would laugh at me and they said because I hadn't lived yet, you know.  So Joe would score it all out for me (laughter) just so I could read what I had to do.  (Cough) So, it was through these guys and all of this when I started at Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] which was on the same campus as Parker, you know.  On that campus you had Parker Elementary [Parker Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], Parker High School and Chicago Teachers College, so you could, and what was it?  They had a junior college there too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, became Kennedy-King [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  It was--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --was a, I don't know why I can't think of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh well.
Speaker 2: --it's named after a famous person but I can't think of it.
Speaker 1: But you could, you could stay on that campus and go from kindergarten to a Ph.D. (laughter).  So that, I started going to, I was at Chicago Teachers College and we were, and I was meeting these guys, you know, we hanging out and we were thinking we're so hip and stuff and, you know, the coffee house and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 2: But these guys became like famous avant garde jazz (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --musicians.  They were some of the best--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --in the world.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: World renowned--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Henry Threadgill, Ari Richard Brown, Joseph Jarman, you know, great musicians.  Everybody, you know, they're, they're big time.  So I just want to make sure anybody listening to this knows that these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and--
Speaker 2: --guys--
Speaker 1: --Joe wrote a song, it probably never gets played any, never heard it again but it was called 'Fran Dan' [ph.].   It was after me, you know, 'cause everybody knew me as Francine [HistoryMaker Cleo F. Wilson].
Speaker 2: So everybody knew you as Francine in high school, basically?
Speaker 1: Naw, these guys.
Speaker 2: Oh, just those guys.  Okay.
Speaker 1: My family called me Francine, still calls Francine 'cause Cleo [Cleo Chancey] was my daddy so I was Francine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mom [Frances Page Watson] called me Francine.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  All right, so this is, this was, sounds like an exciting senior year.
Speaker 1: And in, you know, my first year in college was great, yeah.
Story_ID: 611295
Speaker 1: You graduated from Parker [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] in--
Speaker 2: In 1961.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-one [1961], all right.  Then you went right over to Chicago Teachers [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Still living at home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So guess what was happening then?  The whole Willis Wagons thing.  So, which was in that same neighborhood.  And I remember sitting in a cafeteria at, at CTC as we called it and somebody came running in and said, "They're demonstrating!"  And we had been watching all this stuff on television, you know, and the south, the dogs, the, you know, the water hoses and all of the stuff, you know, Rosa Parks, the whole thing.  We'd been watching it every day on TV and then that, it was here, right here in Chicago [Illinois] where they said, "They're demonstrating!"  And it was like (deep breath) I got this shiver in my body and I thought, oh my god.  I got to get out there.  So that's, that's, what was the beginning of my new life.  I would, I would go to the demonstration site like I was going to work.  So I would leave home every day and my foster mother (laughter) thought I, everybody in my family thought (laughter) I was going to school, but I would go over to the site.  And there, there, you know, we were knocking on doors and trying to get, organize families and stuff to oppose these wagons that were on a parking at, they were originally on a parking lot of the playground of the school.  They had constructed these trailers essentially that was sitting up on railroad ties in there so that the kids wouldn't have to cross the, Halsted [Street] to go to a school that was still mostly white.
Speaker 1: So the issue of the black community was that instead of building bigger schools or allowing students to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was all the elementary schools were too crowded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they were putting these, these--Benjamin Willis was the school superintendent at the time and so they called 'em Willis Wagons.  And they just started placing these, these trailers on anywhere (laughter) it seemed like, anywhere.  And so then the kids, they put 'em in the playground so the kids didn't have anywhere to play because they, that was where their classes were so then they would have to block off the street, you know, for a few minutes, those fifteen minutes or whatever recess time was so they could play in the street.  It was just a, it was just a mess, it was a mess.  And so I met all kinds of people who were out there and that was--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people?  Now were, did you join an organization that was doing this?  Or what was--
Speaker 2: Not in the beginning, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not in the beginning, I didn't.  You know, because I, I was, was still going home every day.  So, so that I had one semester of college that was really good and then the second semester of college I flunked everything because I really wasn't going.  So, you know, when my grades came home then I was put on probation.  You know, I was put on probation, you know, at school and my grades came and when I had to tell what was happening my foster mother forbid me, forbid me, to do it anymore.  And I was flunking out of school, you know, and since I was eighteen she wasn't getting the check for me anymore and you gotta go get a job.  So I decided I couldn't not go that particular day that I wasn't supposed to go because we had worked, you know, we had worked all that time meeting with families and all of that.  This was the demonstration day and so I, I didn't go.  I, I, you know, I didn't go to school.  I went to the demonstration site (clears throat) and, you know, we shimmied, a few of us shimmied up under those wagons while the, everybody else protested, you know, picket lines and stuff.  And I got arrested and that's when I decided I couldn't go back home 'cause she said, you know, "If you're gonna keep this up, don't come back."  You know, and it was one of those dares and so I didn't.  I never, I didn't go back.  And so I ended up staying in somebody's basement over there with a couple of guys, John Stuckey [ph.] and, and Richard Harris [ph.] and it was John Woodward [ph.].  It was a bunch of us that stayed, you know, rest of us who were kind of like homeless (laughter) that were living in these places and, and organizing.   And that was, I did that for about a, until the weather got cold.  And, and it was through them that I started meeting other people.  So I was hanging out with what we called, it was, we called, it was CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] but we had a North Side CORE for some reason even though we were on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  And I think the split was that, that the other COREs had, had white leadership and this was, had black leadership and the, the Charles, I think his name is Charles Smith?  No it's not Charles Smith.  He's an architect.  He, he might even be in The HistoryMakers.  He was the head of it.
Story_ID: 611296
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the Willis Wagons.  Now, who were some of the leaders in, in you said you worked with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], North Side CORE, and the, who were some, some of the leaders?  During the break we talked about Al Raby [Albert Raby] and some of the other people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well Rosie Simpson was one of the mothers that, that grew out to be the leadership at that time but it was Al Raby and--.  Now I was nineteen years old so, you know, I, I was not part of any leadership and everybody, you know, when it came time for the big March on Washington I stayed home and babysat for people (laughter) so they could go.  So, you know, I was just a kid.  I mean, I was a unsophisticated kid so I didn't know, you know, I didn't interact with the leadership, I should say.  Reverend Porter [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Kwame John R. Porter], I mean it was several people around that I just didn't get to talk to.  I remember people like Lucy Montgomery, some young, young black women.
Speaker 1: What, was it, what was the effort successful?  Were you all successful in the changing of the policy of the Chicago Board of Education?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean it, you know, it led to a very, very large demonstration where we sat in on Lake Shore Drive.  We stopped all the traffic.  We were--we had protests at, at the board of education where we would go down there.  And at, at, at some point I can remember that, you know, we would talk about how many times we'd been arrested.  You know, that was like a badge of honor like five or six times, you know.  But, you know, this--the eventual solution worked itself out in that whites moved out of that neighborhood so it didn't make any difference any more.  You know, at that time it was--Halsted [Street] seemed to be the dividing line in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] and was black on the east side of Halsted and, and were white on the other side and flight took care of it.
Speaker 1: Now I've heard stories about Chicago [Illinois] lines of demarcation but, for instance, what would happen if, you know, two blacks on the other side of Halsted.
Speaker 2: My guess is people got beat up.  I mean, even when we moved to Englewood I can remember walking down the street and young white guys driving by in cars yelling, "Nigger, nigger, nigger."  So, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't, you know, cross burning or any of that kind of stuff but it was, it was a tension you were aware of, you know.  You knew the line.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now tell me about like what was the typical arrest like.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had all been trained that, you know, not to resist.  So the main thing that we would do is as soon as a policeman put their hands on you, you would just go limp and that, and that, and that was so there was no chance of them saying that you were trying to fight them or anything so they would, you know, could hurt you or, or do things to you.  So, so that was what it was mostly.  Our tactic was to go limp and then they would, you know, like drag us and throw us in the, in the paddy wagon or whatever.  And then when we would, when we would get, after we'd get fingerprint and booked and stuff they would put us in cells.  And depending on how, you know, how many women were in the group, you know, we might all be in the same one.  So, and the leadership always came and would get us out at some point, you know, so we never had to spend the night there, but they would come.
Speaker 1: Were they, were they, were the police careful not to hurt you.
Speaker 2: No.  (Laughter) They weren't careful not to hurt us, of course not.  No.  And, you know, I watched them beat up people and, and hurt people, you know.  So I was really--didn't want to give any impression that I had any right, any rights, you know, that I was just a ragdoll when it came to that because I was not gonna give them an excuse to bop me and all that.
Speaker 1: Things eventually just kind of worked them, themselves out with that, that issue of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, because they didn't build any new schools if that was a solution.  They didn't build new schools on the black side and those wagons [Willis Wagon] stayed there.  I, I haven't been over in the neighborhood [Englewood, Chicago, Illinois] for years now but I don't know if it's overcrowding anymore or there's less kids in the schools but I, I had seen that same solution applied in other parts of the city.  You know, like within the last twenty years so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, at that time did you consider yourself a member of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Or were you (unclear) with them.
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't any dues paying or anything, but (laughter) yeah, but I identified with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611297
Speaker 1: Dropping out of school [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], I mean did you have--what did you, did you get a job or what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, here I was I still didn't have a home.  You know, I had dropped out of school and was living in somebody's basement and, for a while and then eventually I had to, had to do something and at that point it was a lot of students from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] that had joined around--into the, in the movement over there and I was offered a chance to stay at the Student Peace Union that was on, part of, at, you know, that was based at the University of Chicago.  And it was a commune and I, my job was to run the mimeograph machine because they were putting out all these, all this propaganda, (laughter) putting out all these newsletters and fliers and stuff.  And we had to do it in shifts to make it a big enough run.  So, and so in exchange for doing that I had a place, a room and then food.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is at, on the campus of the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: It was at 6600 something North Woodlawn [sic. South Woodlawn Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was a student organization.
Speaker 1: Okay, right near the Midway [Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right near the Midway. Okay.  All right, so, all right.  So you were there or what were you thinking was gonna happen next there?  I mean, what were you, did you have any plans of, of--
Speaker 2: I stayed there for about a year and then I, you know, I knew I had to have some plans and I started looking for work and I didn't have any skills.  I had zero skills because I, my plan was always go to college and so I didn't take any business courses.  I didn't know how to type and so I took a, a couple of jobs just being a file clerk.  So I was a file clerk at CNA [Continental National American Group; CNA Financial Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] or whatever that insurance company is downtown.  I did that for forty-five dollars a week and I decided that I was gonna take a course cause it came back to me that my mother [Frances Page Watson] had been a keypunch operator.  I was gonna take a course and become a keypunch operator.  And so that's what I did and that was what actually got me in to, in to better paying work and was my like career for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now about what year did you get involved with keypunch?
Speaker 2: So, let's see.  When--the March on Washington was at '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], right.
Speaker 2: So it might have been '64 [1964] or sixty, around '64 [1964] or '65 [1965] and it turns out that, that I had been sending, giving the director, I don't, whose name I don't remember, giving her as a reference for these jobs that I was applying for and I never got a call back and then one--after Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed and people were throwing rocks through the window at the Student Peace Union, they connected it with us and it was all this SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] stuff going on at the time.  Everybody decided to (laughter) get out, get out of there, you know, to move on and--
Speaker 1: The people blame the student peace movement?
Speaker 2: That--well they--it was everybody.  They were mad at everybody about that.
Speaker 1: So it was a right wing kind of reaction and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so when, when, when she moved away I was the last one to leave 'cause I didn't have anywhere to go and she moved away I actually discovered letters from employers that she was supposed to be filling out to, you know, to respond to and she hadn't.  That was, that was very disappointing, very disappointing.  So I ended up hooking up with some woman that I had met and I moved in with her and her boyfriend and we were still in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and they were white and, and I would go to work and--
Speaker 1: Okay so this was about 1965, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty, or well, okay.  Did, did you move out right after Kennedy's assassination or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so that's still '63 [1963] I guess.
Speaker 2: Shortly after.
Speaker 1: Shortly after.  Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the beginning of '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then, all right.  So you're living in Hyde Park, all right, and, and working?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 611298
Speaker 1: You, you were still active in, with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] at that time or had CORE kind of?
Speaker 2: I had gotten sucked into all kinds of other stuff (laughter) by then and I was meeting all these Maoists and, you know, these Communists and stuff and so at one--'cause these were all the people that were hanging around the movement at the time, you know, and, and I was in a very, in a, in a place that I was receptive to all of, to their persuasion.  And so at first I was in Progressive Labor Party and they were the Trotskyites and they were--I just, I don't know, they seemed a little too nuts for me.  But it was through them that I met the guy, Earl Silbar, who would become my husband.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and--
Speaker 1: So, was he a member of Progressive Labor Party?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was, he was.  And he was in SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] and he was, he was an organizer for SDS and he was at Roos- he was at Roosevelt, went to uni- Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] and so was, you know, he knew Tom Hayden and all those people and so, you know, I started getting it--I was on the fringe of that stuff.  And, and I don't know what happened with PLP and me but I ended up with another group (laughter) that was also Socialist and weird and I was--and that was how I met my second husband was through them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the first that--how long were you married the first time?
Speaker 2: Maybe three years and long enough to have two children (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, now when you were married when, were you married when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Chicago [Illinois] in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: I, I was pregnant in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So my whole life changed at that point.  You know, I had had a child and you could see I was taking them to demonstrations but, in the picture I would, you know, march with them but, you know, I, I couldn't be out all day doing that stuff anymore.
Story_ID: 611299
Speaker 1: What were the issues of Progressive Labor Party and SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] in those days as opposed to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]?  I mean was there a difference in what they were focusing on?
Speaker 2: They had, they were, you know, they were focusing on a worldview and whereas CORE was, was focusing on, on the treatment and inequality of, of, of the races.  The, the, the Socialists to me were appealing to, their appeal to me was putting it in a system and making me so I could understand, you know, why this was the way it was and the divide and conquer, you know, the bigger scheme.  'Cause if, if you thought about it in the small way, you know, you were always bumping your head against, you know, somebody like Ben Willis [Benjamin Willis] but, you know, the, the--with the socialist idea and the Marxist way of thinking of this, who was pulling his strings?  So, that was what appealed to me at the time.  And the other thing was for some reason they were very supportive of Malcom X, you know, so that really appealed to me, you know, that they were supportive of Malcom X.  He would have hated them, you know, at the, at that time because he hadn't even been to Mecca [Saudi Arabia] at that time.  But, you know, they tried to organize trips to go hear his speeches and all kinds of stuff so.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was about '64 [1964] or '65 [1965] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Before--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he was killed in '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that--okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did, did you ever hear him speak in the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I heard the message what, Message to the Grassroots the one that he did in Detroit [Michigan].  And he was electrifying and I started writing to him.  And I think he thought I was a man 'cause he, you know, wrote me about going, getting an, going to college at the University of Alcazar in Egypt [sic. Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt] and all this kind of stuff and it was--and they didn't even take women, so, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you write under Cleo [HistoryMaker Cleo F. Wilson] or?
Speaker 2: I must have.  But, but eventually I changed my name to Francine Shabazz (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you--really?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was this after he passed or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yes, after he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, was it legally changed--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or just--
Speaker 2: I just started calling--
Speaker 1: --okay, just started calling yourself.  Okay, all right.  A lot of changes going on over there.
Speaker 2: Oh my god, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean it was a different time, you know, that was, you know there was, you know the Panthers [Black Panther Party] and, I mean everything was happening.  Everything was happening.
Speaker 1: Now did you know some of the Panthers in the city?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I didn't.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they would have been just probably starting up in '66 [1966], I guess, I don't think.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Just, you know--that's when--cause they didn't start--yeah they started up in Oakland [California] around '66 [1966] I think it was. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well Fred Hampton and them, you know, I had seen him and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], and who is that other guy?  H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin], you know, they were all here at some point in Chicago [Illinois] and you know, I had seen them speak and stuff like that.  And a lot of the Panther stuff was kind of scary to me because they--(laughter) not what they were doing, but their attitude to women was just, I just couldn't, (laughter) couldn't hang, I couldn't hang (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  There were a lot of famous quotes by them that are not very, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: --with that.  Oh god! I couldn't hang whatever.
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: Of course, all the guys I was hanging with that was, were always putting them down, you know, saying, you know, these Ns, the N words can't get no woman (laughter) so they, this is why they have to do this (laughter).
Story_ID: 611300
Speaker 1: So when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came here in '66 [1966] you weren't really a part of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what did your colleagues think about it and the--about Dr. King's visit?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time of the, you know, they were sort of anti-King because, you know, we were waiting for the revolution.  We didn't want this pacifist stuff here, you know.  And so it--we had a different reaction to him than the rest of the people.
Speaker 1: It was--often I know black folks in the North felt, you know, that nonviolent direct action was probably, you know, something they couldn't abide, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that pretty much what--
Speaker 2: And, and you know--yes it is, it is.  That, that was the way most of us felt is and, you know, with some, some confusion or disagreement about the fact that he was even coming here.  You know, it's like well we don't have leaders in Chicago [Illinois]?  You know, that they had to go get him and bring him up here?  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At any rate, well, you know--
Speaker 2: --we were more critical.
Story_ID: 611301
Speaker 1: So you were married for about three years to--
Speaker 2: Earl.
Speaker 1: --Earl.
Speaker 2: Silbar [Earl Silbar].
Speaker 1: Silbar.  And then--well what happened to the relationship?  Was it a--
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of stuff did happen.  One of, you know, with him in the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] and he was going all around organizing on different campuses and stuff.  And the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was starting to pay attention to him and the Red Squad here at Chicago--
Speaker 1: The Chicago Police Department's Red Squad?
Speaker 2: --yeah that.  They--yeah--and so they started watching our home and stuff and I don't remember who it was, which president who had come was speaking at--and it wasn't in '68 [1968] when the big riot was, but it was prior to that that we were under, under house arrest, you know, because we were considered a dangerous or something like that and--
Speaker 1: Well they surrounded your headquarters or something or?
Speaker 2: No, I mean in our house.
Speaker 1: In your house?
Speaker 2: In my house.  In my house.
Speaker 1: So the members of the Chicago Police Department--they would lock (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They would be in the front and the back.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And, and I, and they had, as I remember they had gone into people's houses, you know, they were, you know, harassing.  It was like--Hanrahan [Edward Hanrahan] was the state's attorney then, you know, so we called him Hammerhead Hanrahan.  So I mean they were harassing people all over the place.  So everybody who was suspected of, you know, talking or thinking about overthrowing the government they were breaking in their houses.  It was like, like drug raids in the middle of the night going in and, you know, scaring people's children and tearing up stuff and I mean it was crazy, period.  It was a crazy period and so I can, I remember that at some point Earl was gone and the police were in the front and the back of the house.  I had two small children [David Silbar and Sulyn Silbar] upstairs.  And they come down and they want to talk to me.  And I, you know, I knew not to let them come in the house 'cause I didn't know what they were looking for but I didn't want 'em scaring the children.  So I went downstairs and I put the keys, the key to my door in my mouth in case I had to swallow it.  I wasn't thinking that they would just break down the door but I was gonna swallow the key.  And they were there to try to get me to tell them about Earl and so they were telling me--they were giving me names and stuff of all the girls he was cheating with and didn't I want to talk to them, you know.  Because they knew, you know, how bad I must feel and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and, you know, they were, they were looking for informants and this is how they did it is to go and do this kind of thing.  So but, you know, it had an effect, you know, 'cause now I know who it is and everything else.
Story_ID: 611302
Speaker 1: But it was some, it was some bad times and, and, you know, the thing in '68 [1968] in, in Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois]--we lived right there, you know, people were hiding in our house.  I mean it was--
Speaker 2: The Democratic National Convention in '68 [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  And he [Wilson's first husband, Earl Silbar] was out there and, you know, I didn't know where he was, whether he was killed or, you know, or what.  The hospital in the neighborhood was called Augustana [Augustana Hospital and Health Care Center]. Now it's Lutheran [Lutheran General Hospital Lincoln Park, Chicago, Illinois], you know, they had attached handcuffs to their, to all of the gurneys in the emergency room.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: It was, it doesn't even seem like it's the same time, the same country today.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: It really doesn't.
Speaker 2: You're right.  These are gross violations of civil rights.
Speaker 1: In every opportunity.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There was a drugstore on the corner that the pharmacist had, pharmacist agreed that he would give antibiotics and stuff because anybody who went to the hospital with any injury would be arrested.
Speaker 2: That is, that's--wow.  Wow, 1968.  So you were, you didn't participate in the demonstrations?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: You had your children?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So I went to a march on Washington [D.C.] in '69 [1969] or something and--
Speaker 2: This is the Poor People's Campaign?
Speaker 1: --something.
Story_ID: 611303
Speaker 1: Do you remember what, how you felt when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: --April of '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: You know what?  That is what was really interesting.  It's because, you know, I had been critical of him as a leader but when they killed him I was devastated.  And it was so hard for me to believe, you know, that I, I just felt like, but he was harmless, you know.  He wanted to get along and, and, and, you know, all the stuff was going around me in the neighborhood, you know fires and all that kind of stuff but.  Yeah, I felt really bad.  I felt, I felt really bad when Malcom X was killed, you know, I, I and I thought that, you know, that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] or somebody was gonna come because I was writing to him so, you know, I burned everything 'cause I thought they were coming.  You know, if they weren't coming, the Muslims were coming, the Nation of Islam, you know 'cause, you know at that time they were saying that was who killed him.  I don't believe it anymore but--
Speaker 1: Okay so, yeah, these were tough times.
Story_ID: 611304
Speaker 1: So is it--well, after the, the Democratic Convention of '68 [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois] did you and Earl [Wilson's first husband, Earl Silbar] break up then?
Speaker 2: No.  It was after the--I went to Washington [D.C.] for the people's, the poor people's thing [Poor People's Campaign] and he didn't go.  He stayed home and babysat and it was there that I--one of the women that he, that he had fooled around with told me.  So I came home and kicked him out and that was the end of that, period (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's--okay.  Was the Red Squad [of the Chicago Police Department] right when they or correct about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --the women?  Okay.  So okay, so they weren't making that up, that part up?  Okay, so did you meet your second husband shortly after that or did you?
Speaker 2: I didn't, we didn't get married until 1972 so it was a period in between.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's sixty--'68 [1968] now.  Were you involved, still involved in movement activities when Fred Hampton was killed in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: No.  Not.  I wasn't, I was just going to rallies and stuff like that, but I wasn't involved at all.  And, you know, I knew, knew some of those underground people [Weather Underground Organization] because they were living down the street testing, you know, making bombs that blew up in their own house.  (Laughter) You know, trying to make a bomb in their own house was so stupid (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so you were basically trying to take care of your children [David Silbar and Sulyn Silbar] during this period of time, you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I had to work.  I worked.  (Laughter) You know, so he could run around and be a revolutionary.  I worked.  You know, I had babysitters.  They were at daycare at DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 611305
Speaker 1: I know at some point, some junction you, you, decide to go back to school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?  And so this is about '73 [1973] or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there anything significant I'm missing before we get too far?
Speaker 2: Right.  I got married again--
Speaker 1: Okay, you got married again.
Speaker 2: --to my working class hero, Freeman Wilson.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what was he like and how did you meet him?
Speaker 2: He had, he had--his family had been in the movement in Alabama.  So he was from Alabama.  He was from Birmingham [Alabama] and his--I met him about six or seven months after he had gotten out of, come back from Vietnam.  And he seemed, he seemed like a very stable person who would take care of me and the kids [David Silbar and Sulyn Silbar] and, and he was a nice man.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but he wasn't necessarily involved in any--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --movement activities or anything?
Speaker 2: He was involved in the, in a movement at, not a movement but a union thing at, with the Teamsters [International Brotherhood of Teamsters] 'cause he worked at UPS [United Parcel Service].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Against the Teamsters I should say (laughter).
Story_ID: 611306
Speaker 1: In, in '73 [1973] you decided to go back to school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I think it's 'cause I'd turned thirty.  And I had always been saying I was gonna go back to school, but here I was.  I was still keypunching but now it was called data entry.  I was working at Oak Park Hospital [Rush Oak Park Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] and that was what I did.  I had worked at St. Joseph Hospital [Presence St. Joseph Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].  I was, you know, making the rounds doing this stuff and it was still putting holes in the cards.  I mean it was still the old, the old system.  And the thirtieth birthday came and I just decided if I don't do it now I'll never do it.  I'll still be doing this and saying, "I should of."  So that's when I decided to go back.  I went over and registered and they took, they took some of, some of my credits, you know, but the, the statute of limitations had passed (laughter) on a lot of them so I basically had to catch up.  And it was, they had, they were on a quarter system so you, you could do, you could do two years of college in a year.  So I went, I went year round for two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now who were some of the, the--you majored in English, right?  And who were some of the professors there that, that influenced you or, or, or were there any that you really admired at, at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in those days?
Speaker 2: There was one that I admired.  I was in an honors, I don't know if we would call it honors college but we, we had a core, I don't, of course, I don't remember his name.  We had a course that, that included all kinds of stuff and so it was where I first heard Scott Joplin's music and, you know, we were reading in, you know, covering everything culturally in a period.  And it was, that was very exciting, very exciting.  But I went, I went to school like it was a job.  I, you know, I wasn't there to socialize and all that kind of stuff.  And because Otis Freeman [Freeman Wilson], my husband, worked a second shift at UPS [United Parcel Service] he--I had to take the kids [David Silbar and Sulyn Silbar] with me to school.  So on the days that they had holidays, I would just take them over there.  I was at the University of Illinois and then they just had to sit there and be quiet.  You know, I'd give 'em stuff to do and they would, they would do their work and I would do my work.  You know, I'd be in class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember Sterling Plumpp [HistoryMaker Sterling Plumpp]?  I think he was over there.
Speaker 2: I do, I do.  Yeah, but he was teaching poetry though, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, poet man, mainly poet.  I, I think [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti took some, taught some courses over there and, you know, I don't know, but, you know, they, that's when they started establishing the black writers workshops and all that sort of thing.  Now, you were busy writing (laughter).
Speaker 2: I was going--'cause I was still working.  So I worked, went to school.  So I would go to school from eight to one and then at one o'clock I would go to work and work 'til six or seven and then come home and cook dinner.
Story_ID: 611307
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I graduated [from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Okay, 1976 and you were almost immediately hired by Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I, I was.
Speaker 2: That's what I read.
Speaker 1: Within days actually.  I graduated and, and a friend of mine was, was going to Playboy to pick up another friend of hers who I didn't know at the time.  And she was taking us both out to lunch because we had both finished school, you know, adults.  She, she was a teacher at, at Lincoln Park High [Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And so well I thought well I'm here, I might as well apply (laughter) for a job.  And I, I, had no, you know, I had no intention of staying.  I thought it was just gonna be a summer job because I was gonna, I wanted to go to graduate school 'cause I had decided that I didn't want to teach on the high school level, that I wanted to teach on, on the junior college level.  The just, I wanted to get kids interested in reading but I didn't, I thought that after, after doing my student teaching I thought not these kids, (laughter) they got to be older than this.  So, 'cause I, 'cause my degree was, it was high school, to teach high school.  I didn't want to teach those kids so, so I, I--they had one opening and it was for an accounting clerk.  I didn't know anything about accounting but, you know, they gave me, said, "You could take the test," and it was just adding up columns of numbers and so the keypad was almost the same as the, as the, as the keypunch machine, you know.  And they gave me a sheet of paper and they, it had ten columns of numbers that you add up and I added up those things and then she said, "Have you practiced enough?"  And I said, "Yes."  So she gave me, gave me another sheet of paper to take the test but it was identical (laughter) so I had 100.  I passed with flying colors.  They called me that night, it was on a Thursday.  They asked me could I start, so I started that Monday.  And I worked as an accounting clerk for, well, I worked for, as a clerk for about three or four years and then I moved up to, I was the accounts payable supervisor and then, and then from that I went to work for the foundation [Playboy Foundation].  So I was six years doing that stuff.  And it turned out I had a facility for it that I didn't know.  Working with the numbers was, seemed to be easier, you know, 'cause it, it allowed me to use the side of the brain while I could still use the other side, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Unclear) when I saw it on the outline I was kind of surprised 'cause I, I said, well, she has no training in accounting that I could see but, you know, I was gonna ask you where, where you got your secret accounting training (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I just learned it.  And yet, I, and that's what I'm saying it surprised me, you know, and it, I ended up, you know doing the books for the whole company.  It was, it was, it was pretty interesting, but I could, you know, I could do it, I don't know if that's the left or the right brain, but I could, I could do it and it wouldn't interfere, with my, my artistic, my creative side.
Story_ID: 611308
Speaker 1: You started working with Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] when Playboy was a, really a big--
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--they, they were, they had, they had the Playboy Building [Palmolive Building] there on Walton [Street] and they had, they were on eight floors 'cause, and, and I mean, complete floors of work and, you know, the beautiful women and it was, it was a lot of good parties (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember the, the bunny rabbit thing, neon bunny rabbit dominated the Chicago [Illinois] skyline at one point (unclear) the rabbit coming up by the Drake Hotel [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: No.  It was just the words Playboy.
Speaker 1: No, they actually had an outline of a rabbit head with the ears--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah!  On the Drake side.
Speaker 1: Right.  Years, I remember that.  So, so if you drove by you'd see it.  Now, so people would probably want to know, so I'm gone ask, what was the work culture like working for Playboy?
Speaker 2: It was great actually and, you know, from the outside, especially when I came to the foundation [Playboy Foundation] I would run into feminists and like how could you work there and stuff like that.  But everybody there was incredibly nice.  It was a great collection of, of creative people, of people who were a little left of center, you know.  It--we--it was, because it was a political decision, it wasn't for me, but for a lot of people to take that job, you know.  It was a political decision so they were, they weren't ordinary people to me and anyway that, that's the way they seemed.  And I just enjoyed it.  I, you know, it became my family.  You know, I've helped, I have friends who I met there that are friends today.  You know, that'll be the friends for the rest of my life, actually.  And it's a terrific springboard for people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so the place is kind of left of center and know the community, organizing community for years would pass out the Playboy interview with Saul Alinsky to everybody.
Speaker 2: You know, they did, you know, the interview with Malcom X, you know.  Alex Haley did the first interviews in Playboy magazine, period, you know.  And his first interview was with Miles Davis.  So, you know, then he went on to do all, you know, all the famous ones, the top ones but, they, you know, they did, they interviewed Fidel Castro, you know, they, they had lots of that.  And at the same time, you know, they were giving their money to very political causes.  So it was, it was good to be part of that.
Story_ID: 611309
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the history of the foundation and--
Speaker 2: The foundation really started--it has two, two beginnings, the one I prefer is that in 1968 when, when the city was, you know, under curfew and all that stuff was happening during the Democratic Convention [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois], Hef [Hugh Hefner] who was use to sleeping all day and coming out at night, you know, he was kind of like a vampire, was out after curfew and the police were hustling them and, you know, threatening to arrest them and stuff like that.  And he got upset about the police state and what's going on here and the money, you know, he decided that the focus would be government misconduct.  Prior to that, the money that the foundation had been giving out was all related to sex and reproduction.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what year is this, I guess, at the change, focus changed?
Speaker 2: In '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.  Okay, all right so (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, you know, they had been funding Masters and Johnson [William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson] and stuff like that and then it became very political.
Speaker 1: And you were totally unaware of that stuff in '68 [1968], I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --Playboy Foundation was doing in--
Speaker 2: Except that I know that in the underground world that, you know, if, that if you had flyers and things that you wanted done, that somebody at Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] would do it for you, you know, 'cause it, you know, there was somebody that worked there that would, could get stuff done for you so, get printing or whatever.
Speaker 1: Now, now was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know that the company knew but (laughter).
Story_ID: 611310
Speaker 1: Was Hugh Hefner--did, did you interact with him much?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: By the time I started there he had already moved to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So his daughter [Christie Hefner] at some point took over, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  She came, she came in November or September '75 [1975] and I came in June '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So but--
Speaker 2: 'Cause we, we had, we applied for the same job.
Speaker 1: Oh really (laughter)?
Speaker 2: She got it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were thinking big early on?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was a vice presidency and she got the job (laughter).
Speaker 1: Maybe she had an unfair advantage (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, really, nepotism.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you--in 1981--
Speaker 2: Two, '82 [1982]--
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982]--
Speaker 2: I came to the foundation [Playboy Foundation].
Speaker 1: --you came to the foundation.  Now, how did you, I mean, how, how did that, that come, come about or did you target, why did you target that phase of the--
Speaker 2: Of the company?
Speaker 1: --yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I wanted to get out of accounting and every time a job opened I figured out--in the meantime, my marriage [to Freeman Wilson] was ending and I had to work.  So I didn't have the luxury of graduate school and all this kind of stuff.  And I would apply every time I saw something was a better position and, and, and, and, and could never make it.  But as fate would have it, the account that I was handling was the foundation account.  And so I was very aware of the organiza- you know, a lot of the organizations that they were giving money to, you know, like to Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was--I remember I had never said anything before but I remembered that they were giving us a check for thirty or forty thousand dollars to this organization called People for the American Way.  And I said, "What is this?"  And I actually went and met with the executive director at--wanted to know why are you giving these people money.  'Cause in my mind it was something like Up with People and, you know, it turns out it was the organization that Norman Lear had founded, you know, that was supporting First Amendment issues and countering a lot of the, you know, the new Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] and all of the stuff that was happening at that time.  And so it was through, you know, getting to know her and being part of the foundation that, you know, with the accounting side of me.  That when they, when they hired a new executive director and she told me that they had an opening I went applied for it and the person in HR [human resources] said, "Well this job has X, Y, Z qualifications," and I said, "Well it's not written on the job description," and so that was how I got the job.
Speaker 1: So did, what do you think it was about, about you that appealed to, the department?
Speaker 2: I, you know, because I was, that I was interested in the same kind of issues (laughter) and stuff that, you know, that I, you know, started wanting to talk about what was going on with them.  And the other thing that, you know, it took six years for me to figure out that you don't just apply for a job inside the company and expect it to be fair and if you're the best qualified, you get it, that I learned that it, what everybody else was doing is they were going and talking to the person who was hiring in that, you know, going and talking to the boss.  And so that, I did that and that helped a lot.  That really helped.  That was the only way it was gonna happen.  But, you know, it took me six hard knock years to figure that part out.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, it's often the case that people think that they apply for jobs and think it's gone be a fair--
Speaker 2: No, even in a company as liberal as Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.], you know, it's people still, you know, all different kind of attitudes so, no.  It's the advice I give to young people, you know.  Yeah, you can move up the ladder inside a company but you have, it's more than just being at, in the right place.
Story_ID: 611311
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were the grants and programs manager.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were your duties?
Speaker 2: Well it, it, it, that--the early stuff was, everything is presented to the board.  We had a board of directors and Christie Hefner was on the board but she wasn't the chair of the board.  Burt Joseph [Burton Joseph] who had been the first executive director of the foundation [Playboy Foundation] was the chair and so we had to take all the proposals that were coming to us and write 'em up in a way to, you know, plead the case and, you know, put 'em in a context of whatever we were funding and so that was part of what I did.  And we, we were pretty large department at that point.  It was six of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--what, what kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We make site visits too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you mentioned Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] and People for the American Way.  What other, so these are mostly social change organizations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah, for sure.
Speaker 1: --and nonprofit?
Speaker 2: For sure.  And they gave a lot of money to the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], a lot of money to the ACLU, to various programs of the ACLU, the gay and lesbian project [ACLU Lesbian and Gay Rights Project], the women's reproductive rights project [sic. ACLU Women's Rights Project] which I think Ruth Bader Ginsburg was actually on, at the ACLU at the time that the, we gave money for the reproductive rights project.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now so, what was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneous] [U.S.] Supreme Court justice.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 611312
Speaker 1: In 1984 you became the executive director.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now how did that happen?  That's pretty fast it seems, it seems.
Speaker 2: Well, Rebecca Sive [Rebecca A. Sive] was the executive director when I came.  She is the one who hired me and she became very involved in Harold Washington's campaign [for mayor of Chicago, Illinois] and, and also she got promoted to vice president of the cable division of Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] and so I got promoted (laughter) whether I really want to or not.  And, you know, I didn't expect it to come as quickly as it did either.  But because she had been so involved in Harold's campaign she was barely there anyway.  I was, you know, running a lot of the stuff so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you involved in the Washington campaign, campaign at all?
Speaker 2: No, you know, not really.  I was more of like the bag lady.  I was, (laughter) you know, when they would do all their collections and stuff, I was the one who would take the money and then I would go give it to, oh my god, I feel so--[HistoryMaker] Roland Burris.  'Cause he was like the, was he the treasurer or he was, he was his treasurer or something?  I would, so I would, I would leave these meetings with bags of money, just bags of money.
Speaker 1: So, you went to a lot of the, the public rallies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, I was at, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right and you'd end up taking the money.  (Laughter) Was there ever a dangerous moment with all that money?  I mean (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, 'cause nobody ever knew I had it
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nobody ever knew I had it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was, was Harold Washington's election a surprise to you?
Speaker 2: That he won?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I thought it was the nastiest campaign I had ever seen in my life.  I mean I still, I saved some of that hate stuff, you know, Bernie Epton [Bernard Epton] and all that before it's too late, ah.  It was horrible.  But it's, what's interesting is, is it was some material put out like that against [HistoryMaker] Toni Preckwinkle.  I don't know if you've seen it.  One of 'em is--it's really bad.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 611313
Speaker 1: What about Playboy [Playboy Foundation] in the arts community.  When, when did Playboy start really supporting the arts community?
Speaker 2: It, it always did because, because of the illustrators of the magazine.  So it relied pretty heavily on the Chicago Imagists, Roger Brown, Karl Wirsum, lots of 'em, Seymour Rosofsky.  A lot of them illustrated for the magazine so that was already in place.  And then when Playboy moved from its old space 'cause it was moving into that, to that building on Walton [Street] they still had a lease, you know, that they were bound to and so they moved out of that space and gave the, gave it over to the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois] and that was before the museum moved to their new space.
Story_ID: 611314
Speaker 1: Around 1986 or so, we, we were just looking at the news article over there with you at the, at Will Feed [Will Feed Community Organization] and Christ United Methodist Church in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], Reverend John Porter's [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Kwame John R. Porter] church.  And, and the article is about a new, I guess, way of seeing giving, you know, that you're credited with.  So tell us a little bit about this.
Speaker 2: I should have read the article (laughter) but it was, one of the things was that, I think that I, that we--when I came to the foundation [Playboy Foundation], I thought it was the most exciting thing that Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] does.  And I was concerned that the, that the employees of the company, of which there were, you know, hundreds, knew nothing about it.  All of this stuff was happening on another level.  So, so I created a thing called a neighborhood relations board which was regular like employees that would be a governing board that would help decide to give grants in the community.  So it would be in the communities where they live, to organizations that they knew about.  And, and the allocation that we got from the foundation wasn't a huge amount of money so we had to be able to have a lot of impact with a lot of money, with a little bit of money.  And so, it was the people who lived in the neighborhoods that would recommend what we should give money to.  And, and in the case of Will Feed, you know, it was just enough to take, you know, a, a small amount of money but they could make huge soups and things to feed the community with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So these grants were called micro grants or the concept has been called micro philanthropy.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, you know, that's, that's really taken off now and it's, they do it all over the world now, you know.  So it's that whole thing of teaching somebody to fish.  I didn't know I was creating something.
Speaker 1: Now it says here that the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] dubbed it as micro philanthropy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that, is that true pretty much? Is that true or did you, did you have a name for it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, no I didn't.
Speaker 1: --yourself?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a name for it
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't think it was (laughter) micro philanthropy. I didn't think it was.
Speaker 1: And you're right now, that's the biggest thing, you know, a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they are doing it all over the world.
Speaker 1: --banks with micro loans and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: But all over the world they're doing that now.
Story_ID: 611315
Speaker 1: The grants that Will Feed [Will Feed Community Organization, Chicago, Illinois] got was about eight hundred and some dollars [from the Playboy Foundation].
Speaker 2: And they talked about all the food they could buy with it, you know.  So and, and it was, you know, these were the kind of organizations that weren't able to get grants from the other foundations because they didn't have the proper paperwork or, you know, they didn't have, you know, it was a lot of rigmarole.  This was easy.
Speaker 1: Okay. So Will Feed's the kind of organization that if--and I've been there myself many times and seen, I mean, they're actually feeding people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how did you ensure that the, the money you were granting was actually being used the way it was supposed to be used.
Speaker 2: Because I would go visit (laughter) so that, you know, that was how that was captured.  You know, I would do site visits.  I would go and visit the places to make sure, you know, to see what, if the program itself was what they said it was and how it worked.  And, you know, the other thing is because it was not lots of money, you know, it's not like giving 'em ten thousand dollars or something or, you know, nobody's gonna run away with eight hundred dollars (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, the, the photo in the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] is, is of you in the kitchen of Will, at Will Feed, right?  I've seen you around the town in places too.
Story_ID: 611316
Speaker 1: How has the foundation world changed?  I know that there were some big changes that came across in I guess the early '90s [1990s] in a way that foundations had to make grants or, you know, from the time you started in I, in this position in '82 [1982] to today, how has, how has the process changed?
Speaker 2: Well I, I--one of the things that I think is different is I think foundations have become more savvy or concerned about marketing.  So, you know, they want their name out there as not just anonymous giving sort of thing, you know, they want everybody to know that you've given it and it, and the, the other change is reporting and evaluation is, has become very important to it and it's, it's all things that I know from being on this side of the table now where I have raise money.  I have to write proposals and, you know, some of the, the final reports that you have to give are (laughter) so involved it's like, you know, it's not worth the money.  You know, especially for a small staff.  So I could see how that would impact these smaller organizations like Will Feed [Will Feed Community Organization, Chicago, Illinois], you know, that, you know, who's gonna sit and do all that writing for them?  We do keep statistics and, you know, everybody wants statistical data about what you're doing and now they want pre and post, you know, to see what changed.  I mean it's, it's, it's much, it's becoming more scientific or trying to become more scientific because people want to see the impact of what their money has done.  So it makes it, I, I think it makes it harder for the small guys, for the, you know, for the real community grassroots organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What advice would you give an organization writing for a grant?  I heard someone say the other day that, that a lot of organizations that really have a serious cause spend a lot of time developing a philosophy of why they're doing what they're doing.  Is that or, or then someone else said that it, the simpler you make it the better it the better it might fly.  I mean, how--what do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: On the writing part?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When you write (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of the things--
Speaker 1: --a proposal, what are you looking for?
Speaker 2: Okay, so one of, one of the things that, that, that they've done, I know that in the arts, I don't know about the other subjects now, but in, so in social services I don't know if this has changed.  But in the arts they're trying to make it so that everything is collected the same.  So you can do a comparison, so they can, you know, compare all arts organizations against each other no matter the discipline.  And so, more and more are going to online applications and, and they, you know, they give you a question and you answer it.  It use to be just, you know, a narrative so I think that, that's easier, it's easier to do.  And I think it's, you know, if you have a mission, you know, they'll ask a question like how does this tie to your mission, you know.  How does this project that you're asking for money for tie to your mission.  But I think having it be questions and a box to fill in makes it easier and it's more uniform.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The state, I know they have huge reporting requirements, you know, it's, it's hard for these people.  And right now they're working without (laughter) money waiting to get reimbursed.
Story_ID: 611317
Speaker 1: By being in the foundation community you, you also got involved in other aspects of the, of for instance Illinois Arts Council [Chicago, Illinois] and others (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: You know, so how many other, you know entities did you join boards of to, belong to?
Speaker 2: Well, I was on the board of the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] for a number of years.  I was on the board of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I was its president for a while and I was for--and that was for a few years too and I was on some small, you know, some smaller boards.  And I was on the board of Chicago Filmmakers and, and they came--a number of us African Americans on that board and we came up with the Black Harvest Film Festival.  So I'm, you know, still friends with Sergio Mims who does that and Terry Glover was on that board too with me and now she's managing editor of Ebony.  She was also worked at Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] so and now she's on the board of Intuit [Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, Chicago, Illinois] so it's a lot of overlapping going on.  But I enjoy the board work.  I'm still, I'm still on the board now of the Illinois Arts Council and it's helping me.  So, you know, I like Rod [ph.].  I don't know if he thinks that, that, I'm helping him (laughter) but I, I'm learning from being on that board.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It also takes you, well you get, well a lot of receptions to go to, a lot of meetings to go to, a lot of just, a life of an, of a foundation executive and its busy.
Speaker 2: It was very different than from this life, you know, here.  If I'm going to a reception I'm trying to see whose, whose the funder here.  And, you know, I had a lot, I did a lot of glamorous things as a foundation executive, especially as a Playboy Foundation executive.  So the year that they, the thirtieth anniversary of the interview, they did a party, a big party in New York [New York] and they invited everybody who had been interviewed in the magazine, you know, to, to be there.  Of course, Malcolm X wasn't there, but Betty Shabazz was.  I got to meet her and talk to her.  I had to talk to her on the phone to convince her to come.  Yeah, it was just, it was just amazing stuff that would, wouldn't happen to an ordinary person that, that just seemed to be to me.  It was--I went to, to the Sundance Film Festival for ten years.  We created an award there.  Christie [Christie Hefner] and I worked on it and, and then I, I just got to go out there and, you know.  Robert Redford knew me by face.  It was, it so different, so different.  It's a life that I never anticipated having.
Speaker 1: And so when you, you when you were living in, at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in the basement (laughter) working, you know, you never thought that.
Speaker 2: Never, never, never.  Or, you know, even in, when I was living, you know, as a kid in Altgeld Gardens [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois] in my happy days, you know, I didn't, the wildest I dreamed was to be a school teacher, to teach children and it's taken a totally different path and some of the hard knocks shaped who I am.  I think they made, they made me care about other people, what happens to other people.  It gave me a social justice conscience consciousness.  So, everything worked together.

Speaker 1: Is there any particular project that was the most satisfying to be involved in, you know, in, in your, in your years with Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I would, I would say there were several but so one of the things that I really, really enjoyed, of course, was Sundance [Sundance Film Festival] 'cause it--we created award that went to the documentary film that best told the story of a issue for social change.  And so it was, it was great seeing what films would come through there for that.  And the foundation [Playboy Foundation] also funded social change documentaries.  So I have friends all over the country that I hear from every once and a while even here at Intuit [Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, Chicago, Illinois] who, you know, have made films and on important issues, you know, like I--years ago I saw the original, the Harvey Milk film ['The Times of Harvey Milk'], 'Who Killed Vincent Chin?' the film about the Chinese worker who was beat to death by autoworkers in Detroit [Michigan] because they thought he was Japanese, just some fabulous films.
Speaker 1: I'd never heard that story.  That's (unclear).
Speaker 2: And, and as, as a side light my name is in credits on lots of films (laughter) that I don't even have actually in my own personal collection but it's so--that, that's, that's one thing.  The other thing was, was our Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Awards which were given to individuals, you know, not organizations, to individuals who stood up for the First Amendment in a way that, you know, was exemplary and I, and there again, I met some fabulous people.  So that was how I got to, to meet Studs Terkel.  He was a judge for us and he was fun to work with and, you know, I got to talk to him more, you know, off and on, and would see him at different places and, and so he got to be a personal friend.  I'm trying to think, Jamie Kalven, whose father, Harry Kalven, Harvey Kalven [sic. Harry Kalven, Jr.]--anyway they, First Amendment scholars, you know, did stuff with post posthumously honoring Lenny Bruce but it was given to the lawyers who won the case to have, have his case exonerated, you know, thrown out those charges of the seven dirty (laughter) words.  And I've met young, young people all from all over the country, young African American usually exclusively girls who've, you know, who were newspaper writers on their college campus and decided to tell their truth about one thing or another and got in trouble, coal miners who blew the whistle on things that happened in their mines.  It's just been a fabulous, fabulous history of things that I got to do and people I got to meet.  And, and it's, it was, it was good for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you think that, do you think that, that by giving something like the First Amendment award you're encouraging people to do things that they might not do otherwise or they, or celebrating something done that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  It, it celebrated what they did and in, and in for some of these people, you know, they were teachers who lost their jobs, you know, to who had, who were blackballed or what have you.  It wasn't a lot of money.  It was only five thousand dollars but, but for the, they got to bring their, you know, we would have an awards ceremony most of the time in New York [New York].  We'd fly 'em to New York.  They were allowed to bring one family member.  We'd put 'em up in a hotel, you know, it was, it was somebody who recognized what they did and valued what they did.  And I think that, that is really important when somebody is, is standing up for our rights and at the same time, you know, being persecuted or their families don't understand (laughter), you know, it really makes a difference to, to have it be celebrated.
Story_ID: 611319
Speaker 1: You were with Playboy.  You became the, basically the vice president of Playboy, right? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I was of, of, of not of the company [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] (laughter), you know, okay I was still, I was still very much tied to the foundation [Playboy Foundation], but, but the public affairs community, that branch of the company, yes I, yeah, so.  So because I was an officer of the company I still, you know, I got to go to management meetings and stuff and so I was involved in all of the, what was really going on (laughter) and I'd--not just focused on my little world.
Speaker 1: When I think about the trajectory of your life, you know, how did all the success in you--is pretty rapid climb at Playboy.  How did this affect your own life?  I mean did you?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it, it was, it changed things radically for my family because, you know, when I, when I, by the time I had gotten to the foundation I think I was a single parent at this point.  So the difference of, in, in the amount of money that I made and the things that I could do made a big difference to my children [David Silbar and Sulyn Silbar] 'cause when I was in accounting we were, we were really poor.  I mean we would, we would have periods where we didn't even have electricity, you know, or water or gas.  It was something we were always without and then, then it was just like this radical change from that standard of living.  I mean, we weren't rich or anything but, but I didn't have to worry about paying the gas bill anymore.
Speaker 1: So that's probably the first time in life where you, you didn't have to worry about that I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So there was, it had a, you know, my, my, my daughter was angry about it, you know, like, "You had to wait 'til I was almost out of high school before we could have a decent life."
Speaker 1: That's--it's interesting though that, I, I think a lot of people they see somebody, let's say an African American community we see someone that's in a position where they're some, they're actually making some money or should be, you know, it's an assumption that they started out there, or they started off only in that position.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Always were way up there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  And, and the other thing is, you know, even occasionally within the company there were women who were, you know, making assumptions that, that I was, you know, sleeping with somebody and whatever.  And that really, really, really bothered me because I'd always worked with (laughter) women for one thing and, and, you know, I worked with Christie Hefner and, and she liked me and, you know, I like her so she trusted me, she took a chance with me and it worked, it worked.  And it worked, it worked out for both of us I think.  I think that I--people started thinking of me as the foundation and, and it, and it didn't bother her (laughter).  It didn't bother her at all.  She trusted the decisions that I made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you worked for Playboy until, 'til--
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005] full time and then, and then for, well, when I retired it was December, you know my last official day was December 31st and so January 1, I didn't have a job and by January 15th or 21st I was bored to death so I walked back, you know, I went back, walked back in and I asked Martha Lindeman who is my, she's the vice president, senior vice president of corporate communications and I said, "Do you all have," (laughter), "anything I can do around here?"  And because this is the only place I knew to go.  And so, you know, they hadn't hadn't hired anybody.  They hadn't you know, replaced me so, so I worked a couple a days a week there and continued there for two more years I think.
Story_ID: 611320
Speaker 1: When you finally did retire [from the Playboy Foundation], what, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I came to Intuit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was, at the same time I was a founder of Intuit.  It was seven of us that started this organization and, and I was president at the time.  I had been president for (laughter) maybe four years and the, the executive director that we had hired to run this place got hired away by the B.B. King Museum in Mississippi [Indianola, Mississippi] so, you know, it was--we couldn't beat that offer for one thing and, or the excitement of that job.  'Cause here she was gonna, she was in there on the ground floor to create and build this museum and so she took it but she gave us one month, month's notice.  It was our fifteenth anniversary year.  It was four years ago.  We didn't have, and there was no way would could find anybody that quick.  It took us nine months to find her so, so everybody said, "You do it."  And I thought I would do it for, you know, a short period of time and like I said, it's been four years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now give us some history on Intuit.  What, what's the full name of it and what is the purpose (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Intuit is the short name for Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art [Chicago, Illinois] and our purpose is to promote and educate people about the art of self-taught and untrained artists.  And 'cause for me it's the most democratic form and it's the work of people like Sister Gertrude Morgan who was a street preacher in New Orleans [Louisiana] who created these beautiful charts that were just part of her sermons, her, you know, her sermons on the street about heaven.  She spent a lot of time with beautiful charts of heaven and, you know, we believe that this is, is an accepted and should be accepted art form.  It's the, it's the same as any contemporary art, but the museums have rejected it and so we try to, to educate people about its value.  We have a fabulous program for the schools.  We're in ten schools training teachers about this art because the thing is you can create art from anything and so it is especially appealing to, to the teachers who, you know, don't have budgets for supplies and, you know, the schools are being--art is being cut out of the schools so we get grants for that program.  And then we can also give, give re-grant.  We give five hundred dollars per teacher for supplies and for their travel and stuff and then we train them.  They can get Lane Credits which is, you know, professional development credits and, and then their students create art work and we have a show of the student work.  So it's a great program and in, and in, and in some way I'm still doing what I have always done, I guess, and that's fighting for the underdog (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are almost like the micro, you know, philanthropy grants and some, you know, (laughter) the teacher gets some more grant to do something
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  (Laughter) It sure is, isn't it?  It sure is.
Speaker 1: Teachers often complain that they don't, they don't get reimbursed for the--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --the materials they have to buy and the things they do (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And, and they say the average teacher spends five hundred dollars out of their own pocket so we give 'em the five hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what have been, just kind of tell us about some of the exhibitions that have been here and what they.
Speaker 2: The one, the, the, the, the one that I was the most excited about, well two, one was the Sister Gertrude Morgan show that traveled, it was organized at the New Orleans Museum of Art and it went from New Orleans [Louisiana] to New York [New York] to the American Folk Art Museum and then it came to Intuit and that was wonderful.  We got a grant from Sara Lee [Sara Lee Foundation] to help, to mount that show and so, you know, to have a show that's of the caliber as traveling show.  It was great to get that and then the second one that I was really excited about is, we had in January of this year and it was 'The Treasures of Ulysses Davis' ['The Treasure of Ulysses Davis, Sculpture from a Savannah Barbershop'] and he was an African American carver, beautiful carver and a barber from Savannah, Georgia and so we had 110 of his pieces here.  It was big enough that it was in both the galleries.  We have two galleries here, one large gallery where the shows change three times a year and a smaller gallery where the shows are usually six months each.
Story_ID: 611321
Speaker 1: Why are you drawn to this kind of art as opposed to the artist, the, the art by a trained M.F.A. or something similar who's gone to school and studied (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I like it all.  You know, I like it all.  I, I, I, I only, you know, I shouldn't say at all.  I don't like the, the art that's too high concept, you know, so that, so high concept I don't get it.  You know, like they had one at the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois] was, was just an orange shag carpet, (laughter) you know.  It was nothing on the wall.  It was just a orange shag carpet that filled the whole room.  You know, I don't get that kind.  But, you know, I like Dubuffet [Jean Dubuffet].  I, I like, I like the Chicago Imagists.  I love, love Roger Brown and Ed Paschke's work.  I mean I, I like it all but, but that's the accepted stuff.  That's the work that, that the museums appreciate.  That's the work that the museums own that have these giant retrospectives or what have you.  It's the work that I'm championing, is the work that the museum has because it's, some of it's been given to them and they never show it, they never show it.  So because, you know, it's not what they would consider high art.  These people are working outside the mainstream.  They're making their own rules, you know, they're defining the medium, you know, they'll paint on anything, they'll use anything.  Coca-Cola and mud, one guy used to create on, on old, you know, old wood and he would draw, you know, draw and fill it in with his hands and they were wonderful pieces.  And they'd never studied art so they don't know that you're not supposed to (laughter) do that.  Now everybody's copying 'em (laughter).
Story_ID: 611322
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, and you've received a lot of awards and those, and, you know, in the literature, if anybody wants to read those that are watching this in the future, but when you look back at everything you've done at this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: That I would do different?  Oh, there's lots of thing that I would do differently, but I might have stayed married the second time (laughter).  I might have stayed with Freeman Wilson but other than that I'm not sure.  I mean, the fact that we didn't stay created a trajectory that I, you know, a path that I had to take because I had to earn more money so I, might, maybe I wouldn't have gone to the foundation [Playboy Foundation].  You know, I would have been complacent with, you know, you never know, you never know.  So what I became was based on what was happening to me so.
Speaker 1: Why did you, you?  Is there a, well can you tell us a reason why, why the marriage didn't work?
Speaker 2: No, you know, no biggie.  You know, after I'd gone back to school I changed.  I was a different person than I was, then what he met, when he met me.  And I, you know, that changed, you know, the fact that I was more interested now and getting more ambitious about more schooling and climbing, social climbing.  I don't know maybe social climbing is not (laughter) the right word but, you know, making more of myself.  I think he, he might of felt a little threatened by that and it wasn't, it wasn't like a horror story or anything.
Story_ID: 611323
Speaker 1: Now, once again, if you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My daughter (laughter).  I guess my daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On that note now I would ask you about your family now.  You, you have like how many children now?
Speaker 2: I have two.
Speaker 1: Two?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a daughter, Sulyn Silbar, who lives in New York [New York] and she's a massage therapist and personal trainer.  She has her own company, Body + Mind [Body + Plus Mind NYC, New York, New York], and my son [David Silbar] is deceased.  He died at age thirty-two, drowned at Montrose Beach [Chicago, Illinois].  So, twelve years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, your parents are, are they still alive?
Speaker 2: No, they are both dead, yeah.  My mom [Frances Page Watson] died in 2003 and my father [Cleo Chancey] died earlier.  So no, they are both deceased.  And all, and, and, and all of my siblings--I'm the only one stayed in Chicago [Illinois].  Everybody left long time ago.  (Laughter) Which is really odd that I was the Kizzy of the family, stayed put.  I just wouldn't leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your, your parents?
Speaker 2: They left too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They, they had a chance to see you become successful?  I mean, your, your mother did at least--
Speaker 2: My, yeah, my mother did.  Oh, and she, and she didn't understand (laughter) it at all, you know.  So she was going around and she was telling her friends, 'cause by that time she was living in Oklahoma with my sister, and she said, "Yeah, she's one of the three highest paid women in Chicago:  Oprah Winfrey, Christie Hefner."  And Francine [HistoryMaker Cleo F. Wilson] is like no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, she had it all confused.  She had it all confused.
Speaker 1: She, but she was excited about it?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she was and my uncle.  Everybody was excited about it.  And my family was.  You know, nobody was, you know, ashamed or anything that it was Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.].  Everybody thought it was great.
Speaker 1: Now did, did--so was your mother still a Jehovah's Witness [Jehovah's Witnesses]?
Speaker 2: 'Til she died.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and did your, the cousins that you were fostered, a foster child with, did you ever reconnect with them at all?
Speaker 2: I've reconnected with the, the youngest daughter and, 'cause they had a third daughter while we were living there.  And so her children now are like my grandchildren.  So she had--they're all grown now.  They're all in college but I'm very close to her, her children and to her too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they're in Chicago.  It's the only family I have here.
Story_ID: 611324
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked about or mentioned that we should mention before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: We'll think of it later probably (laughter).
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: We'll probably think of it later (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I'd like to be remembered as a generous and compassionate person.  'Cause I think I am (laughter) a generous and compassion- compassionate.  I also like to have fun and, yeah.  Those, those would be the attributes that I would like to be remembered as having.
Story_ID: 611325
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us about this?
Speaker 2: This, I love this picture but this is a picture of my mother, Frances Page Watson, who for many years, you know, we always remembered that she was gray haired and then to see her looking so cute on this picture, I just love it and, you know, the fact that my grandmother thought that she was too dark to come to Chicago [Illinois] makes a big difference.
Speaker 1: That's unbelievable.  I think I heard about that before (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's me the year that the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] gave me an award and so I was doing my acceptance speech.
Speaker 1: Can you remember what year it was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was in the '90s [1990s] I guess or.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no it was in 2000s, yeah.
Speaker 1: Two thousands [2000s]?  Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is my son, David Silbar.  It's probably 20, 20, 22 or 23 years old--ago this picture is.
Speaker 1: Okay, next one.
Speaker 2: This is the Chanceys as we call ourselves.  This is all my siblings, at least the first set, the three girls and three boys.  That was our attempt at a family reunion.
Speaker 1: Okay, next one.
Speaker 2: This is, this is me in about 19--it might, I can--Thanksgiving 1967 would have to be at my foster mother's home with David and Sulyn [Sulyn Silbar], my daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was the first vacation that I took with Otis Freeman Wilson [Freeman Wilson] and the kids.  We were at the Wisconsin Dells [Wisconsin] and that was something there.
Speaker 1: And this, this is at Susie's graduation.  She graduated from the University of Illinois.  This, so this is me with Otis.  She graduated with, you know, two majors, computer science and oh, and a fine, and a arts, she had a Bachelor of Arts, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who is the other person?
Speaker 1: Freeman, Otis Wilson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Her stepdad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So this is me with Earl Silbar, the father of the children, David and Sulyn, and this was probably Christmas 1967.
Speaker 2: This is me in kindergarten or first grade and I believe that school was Corliss [sic.] not, not Carver [George Washington Carver Primary School, Chicago, Illinois].  So I'm not sure where, you know, but it's the only picture that I have of myself as a child, as a little child I should say, youngest picture.
Speaker 1: We want to do this, I guess we should, maybe we should start here go around like this (background noise). (Laughter) You want to start here and then go around?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I like, I like this picture of myself.  It was before I started having a lot of dentals, dental work.  I believe I was pregnant on this picture.  So it was 1967.  And that's my brother, Michael [Michael Chancey], the one who suffers from schizophrenia who lives in New York and this was his graduation photo from the University of Illinois at Champaign [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And that's, that's me with Sulyn when she was young and then we purposely took this other picture of us when we were, when she was older.  I had no idea that they were opposite though at the time.  And then this is my mother after she was into her eighties.  She died at eighty-three so that was maybe '80 [1980] or '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Do you remember a show called 'Blake's 7,' a science fiction show on public television?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: That's the only other place I ever heard the name Sulyn.  There was a character named Soolin on it.
Speaker 1: Oh really, really?
Speaker 2: 'Blake's 7' was made in the early '70s [1970s], I guess.
Speaker 1: This is 1986 right after I'd, or '80 [1980], well early '82 [1982], '84 [1984] maybe when I'd come to the foundation [Playboy Foundation].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was my office.
Speaker 2: Now this is a later picture of my mother as you can see where her hair was all gray and one, one of the traits in my family is we get all gray--Frances Watson, Frances Page Watson.
Speaker 1: You could tell from that spot, the burn spot in this picture, but this is a picture of a picture.  This is my grandmother, Margaret DePrad [Margaret DePrad Page] and her husband, John Henry Page [sic. John Porter].
Speaker 2: What is this?  Turn of the, looks like turn of the century.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Let's not put that in.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is me in an anti-war [Vietnam War] demonstration in 1966 walking around the Federal Building [Chicago Federal Building, Chicago, Illinois] carrying David.
Speaker 1: And this is me and Freeman at a march on Washington [D.C.] and I have to be honest, I don't know what the subject (laughter) of the march was.
Speaker 2: Poor People's Campaign? Sixty-nine [1969] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, it was, well no it was, was much later, much later, yeah.  It looks '80s [1980s], you know, from how we're dressed and stuff, hip huggers and the first time around, you know.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) when those came out.
Speaker 1: I had this picture reconstituted.  (Laughter) This is, this is me on the right with my sister, Gladys [Gladys Chancey Lytle], and her dog between us, Tuffy [ph.] (laughter) and my brother, Vincent [HistoryMaker Vincent Chancey] standing on the porch and my cousin and foster sister, same person, Sharon [ph.] peeping through the hole right here (laughter).  And this is in our backyard.  And everybody looks at this picture and, and you know, wanted to know what part of the South was this.  And this is, this actually was at 1947 West Walnut [Street] in Chicago, one block from Lake Street and right by Damen [Avenue].  That's it.
