Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: So your middle name was Xavier anyway?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Before--okay.
Speaker 2: So it worked out, you know, Richard X. When I was in the mosque in Temple No. 7 [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], I was Richard 3X. There were three other brothers named Richard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I'm glad I asked that. That's interesting. Okay.

Story_ID: 656142
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer. The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is it?
Speaker 2: Actually, it's two, meatloaf and fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Again two, red and blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the years?
Speaker 2: Winter.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Brazil.
Speaker 1: All right, and the last one is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'll never quit.
Story_ID: 656143
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history. I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side. We'll start with your mother's side first. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Jennie McDowell, M-C-D-O-W-E-L-L, first name Jennie, J-E-N-N-I-E. I have no knowledge of her. The only knowledge I have of my mother and my father [Leslie James (ph.)] is what I got from a sheet of paper from the foster agency whose care I was put under. The agency was called Sheltering Arms children service [Sheltering Arms Children's Service; Sheltering Arms Children and Family Services] in New York [New York], 122 East 22nd Street. I used to go there and see my counselor on a regular basis. I've been on foster care since I was born. I was born in the Metropolitan Hospital [Metropolitan Hospital Center; NYC Health + Hospitals/Metropolitan, New York, New York], and I stayed there until I was thirteen, fourteen months and then I was put in a foster home. I don't remember fost- the first home I was in. The second one, I spent the most time in. The occupants were Mr. and Mrs. Otis Stukes.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was like, was I three? Two or three.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you stay with them a long time?
Speaker 2: I stayed with them until I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Otis Dukes?
Speaker 2: Stukes, S-T-U-K-E-S (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Stukes, oh, okay, S-T-U-K-E-S.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So you don't have any idea--do you know where Jennie McDowell was from?
Speaker 2: Actually, yes. On the paper, she said--it said that she was from Asheville, North Carolina. I went up to Asheville on a couple occasions. I could not find anything out about her. My father whom, again, I got this information off the sheet of paper, she never told him that she was pregnant. She had went to New York [New York], and worked as a domestic from Asheville. And while there, she ran into my fath- or met my father. And she got pregnant. When she got pregnant, she gave me up to Sheltering Arms children service, having never told my father that I was conceived. From my understanding, she got married again and had two more sons. I have a brother who's deceased, younger brother. She supposedly had gotten married to a transit worker and had two more boys.
Speaker 1: In New York?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, she stayed in New York City.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, I, you know, I guess it's psychologically (unclear) to my problems in life, I would say. When I say that, I say this because I've always (sighs), I had a problem with my self esteem, okay. I used to roam the streets of Jamaica, Long Island [Queens, New York] and wonder who I was. I used to roam the streets of Manhattan, New York and wonder who I was. This person my father, this person, my mother, that whole psychological thing, trauma. I used to go to counseling for this, you know, me and other guys in growing up that didn't know their parents, all right. That was the good side as far as having the agency available because by me being in the agency, again, state care, they made sure I got the psychological, the physical, the clothing that I needed, okay, even though the foster home that I was in--I was being habitually, continually abused, which resulted in me leaving there when I was thirteen.
Story_ID: 656144
Speaker 1: Just go back a little bit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know your biological father's name?
Speaker 2: Leslie James [ph.].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Leslie James. That's why I don't know where this Clark came up at.
Speaker 1: Okay, Leslie James, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, he's from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, from South Carolina, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: They met in New York [New York]. That's it.
Speaker 1: Do you know what he did for a living?
Speaker 2: No, no idea.
Speaker 1: Now, have you, have you met him or talked to him or--
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: --any of his relatives (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't even know if he knows I exist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So all you know is that she [Clark's biological mother, Jennie McDowell] didn't tell him, so he may not, he never knew--
Speaker 2: He may not, never, you know.
Speaker 1: --never knew.
Speaker 2: And then I found, you know, when I found that his name was Leslie James, that made all attempts of finding out who I am futile because Richard Clark [HistoryMaker Richard X. Clark] is supposed to have--this is the name she gave me. But it's supposed to be her maternal grandfather's name. So as far as family, my family is probably named McDowell, as far as I know.
Speaker 1: Or James?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, or, yeah, James.
Speaker 1: So you might be related to LeBron James and that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, hey (gesture). I could use some money right now (laughter). Anyway, but--
Speaker 1: But you have no idea where those Jameses are or--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I know is Leslie James, and he was from South Carolina. Now, what's, it's kind of ironic because Mr. Stukes [Otis Stukes] was from Denmark, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Was Mr. James from Denmark?
Speaker 2: No, he was just--all I know is South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay. I know there's a, there's a black college [HBCU], a little black college there in Denmark, South Carolina, Voorhees [Voorhees College]. It's a black Episcopal school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Denmark.
Story_ID: 656145
Speaker 1: Otis Stukes, Mr. and Mrs. Otis Stukes. So you were with them from age three--
Speaker 2: Three 'til I was thirteen, about ten years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were there--well, tell me about 'em. What were they like? They--
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) Well--
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a good relationship, right?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't, actually. Mr. Stukes worked for the City of New York [New York]. He was an alcoholic. He smoked cigars, but he worked every day, all right. He had a home in Jamaica, New York--Queens. We, I grew up having two gardens. He had a garage in the back, converted into a bar, little dance floor, cement dance floor in the backyard, cement barbeque. I mean he had a nice backyard. I had a garden in the back, garden (background noise)--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So he was a truck driver for the City of New York. Miss Stukes [Lucille Stukes (ph.)], she had, what was it. She only had three fingers on her right hand. She got 'em blown off from a coal stove when she was in South Carolina. She was his second wife. She worked as a domestic. She was also an alcoholic. This enhanced, enhanced my dislike for cigarette smoke and alcohol. As I said to you before, that was the major part of my growing up. My only companion at that time was my German Shepherd dog. Her name was Bama [ph.]. And we used to roam the backyard and go on the--I used to jump off the (laughter) garage, thinking I was Superman. And my childhood to adolescence was pretty much solitary except for Mrs. Stukes had eight grown sons. And they would come by the house. They would have barbeques and they would always treat me like I was their younger brother, you know, and I used to like that. We used to take trips. I used to go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], Mr. Stukes' mother lived in D.C. Let's see, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], he had a--Mrs. Stukes' sister lived in Philadelphia. Buffalo, New York, one of the sons lived up in Buffalo, and I used to do a lot of traveling with the Stukes. When they (laughter), what, what used to happen was that he would be drunk, and I would sit in between his legs at the steering wheel, before my feet could really reach the pedals of the, you know, the gas and the brakes, and I would steer. And he would be out (makes sound), drunk as a skunk. But that's how I learned how to drive. Anyway--
Speaker 1: This is on the highway going to--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm, yep. Yeah, I know (laughter), but, you know, that's, again, that's how I learned how to drive.
Story_ID: 656146
Speaker 1: Through my older years (clears throat), when I was like fifteen, sixteen, I must say that Mr. Stukes [Otis Stukes] was very industrious. He, as I said, he used to work as a truck driver for the City of New York [New York]. But he started his own floor waxing business, okay. And he used to wax the floors of dentists' offices, doctors' offices, some Jewish homes, you know, and make side money. He used to take me with him, even though I didn't wanna go because, you know, I had homework to do and he wanted me to sacrifice my homework and my other responsibilities just to work with him.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sometimes he'd pay me, sometime he wouldn't.
Speaker 2: So education wasn't a priority for him necessarily.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no. And I was like in junior high school at that point in time. So this made me kind of rebellious. I used to--you know, if I didn't wanna go with him, he would beat me, strip me naked, had a razor strap and whipped the hell out of me.
Speaker 2: So, is this like the way you were raised from--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --from three years old up?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: You had to take off all your clothes--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and be beat with a razor strap.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. It escalated to a razor strap when I got older. Before then, it was anything that was available, you know, ironing cord, brick, broom handle, yeah. That was their, that was their sense of discipline and corporal punishment, you know.
Speaker 2: So did you have a sense of, that that was wrong or did you think that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a sense that was wrong because I didn't think, you know, I had, I had low self esteem as it was, and I didn't think that, you know, I don't care how bad or who I was, you know, I didn't need to be treated this way.
Speaker 2: Now, did they let you know that you weren't theirs, I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --did you ever think that they were your parents?
Speaker 1: No, never, no.
Speaker 2: So you were three. You know, some people they reach--a lot of people reach the stage of consciousness at three where they know who they are, you know. But I don't know if you had a--
Speaker 1: I, no, I didn't know who I was, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, I mean in terms of just knowing your name and where you--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, that's all I knew, you know. I didn't know where I was from. All I knew is my name, all right, and I knew that the people I was with didn't care about me, all right. I thought that Sheltering Arms children agency [Sheltering Arms Children's Service; Sheltering Arms Children and Family Services, New York, New York] cared more, cared more about me than Mr. and Mrs. Otis and Lucille Stukes [ph.], you know. It didn't, it didn't transpire until later that I got up enough nerve to tell anybody about it. And how that came about, it was because of my actions. I, I'd run away from home.
Speaker 2: When, when did you start running away from home?
Speaker 1: When I was about eleven, twelve, about the same time I started smoking marijuana.
Story_ID: 656147
Speaker 1: Now, did you live in the same neighborhood the whole time, growing up?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Jamaica, 105-12 Pinegrove Street, Jamaica, New York [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, there're other kids in the neighborhood and stuff?
Speaker 2: Actually, there were no children, no. That's why my life primarily was solitary. The only time I was exposed to other children was when I went to public school, and that was P.S. 50 [P.S. 50, Talfourd Lawn Elementary School, Queens, New York]. It was up there on Liberty Avenue, Liberty and something boulevard. When I went there, I was still like isolated because all the other kids, as far as I knew, they had parents--they had their parents. They had people that loved them, you know. They knew one another. I didn't, you know. So I would come to school. I would walk in one door and walk out the other. And at that time, they had a little place called, what was it? Coos Bakery [ph.]. It was like two blocks from the school. And I used to go in that bakery, go in the trucks and steal the fruitcakes and the, the Boston cream pies. And I would take 'em back home where I lived at, and sequestered 'em under my bed because I used to be sent to bed without supper, you know, from time--many times. And that was, it was kind of funny to me because my room was, had two doors. One was at the house--in the house, you know, from the living room to my bedroom. And the other door went from my room outside. So they would send me, they would send me to bed without supper, you know, beat me and then send me to bed. When they out cold, you know, drunk and out cold, I'd go outside. I used to take the car (laughter), and I'd drive around, and, you know, I'd drive around. They wouldn't know the difference. They'd wake up in the morning, you know, I would clean--I'd be there cleaning the house up, you know, getting the cigarette ashes and everything up. I done been out all night, you know. But that was my way--
Speaker 1: This is in junior high school. You would just take the car--
Speaker 2: No, this was in public school.
Speaker 1: I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just before I got to junior high school.
Speaker 1: So this is at age--
Speaker 2: Eleven and twelve.
Speaker 1: Eleven and twelve.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Just take the car.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I used to back it out the driveway. I could drive. I've been driving since I was like ten. I've never had an accident, okay. But that was my way of getting away from them. I wouldn't go to no great distances. I'd drive up and down the (unclear), you know, just looking and gawking. What am I going to do? I'm ten years, eleven years old. Anyway, and then I'd come back the next night, you know. But when I ran away, I never took the car, you know. I'd run away and take my bike (laughter).
Story_ID: 656148
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you, was church a significant part of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, that's, that's the funny thing. Mr. Stukes [Otis Stukes] again, he was a deacon for Calvary Baptist Church [Jamaica, New York] (laughter), and the times that he would force me to go to church, I used to like to go 'cause I'd be able to sit in the money room and watch after they'd make all these collections and watch them count this money. And I'm, I guess that kind of turned me off of Catholicism or Catholics or baptisms or Baptists, you know, that whole thing because for me, Catholic, Protestants, they all about the money. They are. And I used to sit up there, I used to sit up in that money room and watch. Now, here's a man, he is drunk Saturday night, Sunday morning, he up at church. What is the hypocrisy in that? Here is a man that abuses children, but he's in church Sunday morning. What is the hypocrisy in that? Here is a man that, when he leave church, he going home and get a drink. I grew up seeing all this, so I, (unclear) no, I would never do that. But for all his faults, I'd like to say that he was a good man, you know. I, by being in, in foster care, I went to camp for a month every summer. I had my own horse when I went to camp, the responsibility of taking care of this horse. I learned how to horseback ride at an early age. So I've had, I had things that people with parents didn't have, okay. I always had good healthcare, dental work, you know. So that's, you know, that's the good side. The bad side is that I don't know my mother [Jennie McDowell], still don't know my father [Leslie James (ph.)], you know. I don't know any family history. That's the bad side of it.
Speaker 1: So were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you just saw my family.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's been solved nowadays.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 656149
Speaker 1: Did you have any special teachers or any--
Speaker 2: I had, there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) any ment- counselors in camp or coaches or anything that--
Speaker 2: I had--there was a, my sixth grade teacher [at P.S. 50, Talfourd Lawn Elementary School, Queens, New York]. Her name was Miss Greenup [ph.]. And I don't know whether she saw the anger and the hurt in me, but she used to try, you know, to try to address my disciplinary problems. She was one of the few people that called Ms. Stukes [Lucille Stukes (ph.)] to school, which I greatly regretted it because she came to school, and Ms. Stukes knocked the hell out of me right in front of the class. And that made my self esteem plummet even more than it was, you know (makes sound). Anyway, but Miss Greenup, she cared, you know, and I could detect that she really cared. After that, I would say Malcolm X, Captain Joseph [Yusuf Shah], Elijah Muhammad--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm a talk- I'm talking about when you were grade school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I became familiar, in contact with, with Malcolm when I was young, you know, when I was like eleven or twelve, all right. So, but only in a sense that gave me--I was able to substitute a knowledge of self with not having a knowledge of self.
Speaker 1: So we're talking about like 1957 or something when you were eleven?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: If you were born in '46 [1946] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-six [1946], yeah--
Speaker 1: --so, so '57 [1957], you knew Malcolm X then, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I'd heard of him at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They knew I was too--you know, I had the opportunity to meet him, but at that time, I had heard the teachings of the Elij- the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 1: So would you--did you hear him on, on the streets in New York [New York] or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or in the, in Jamaica [Queens, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They used to have, on 125th Street, they used to have--there was bookscore- bookstore. I think it was the National Bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they would have Garveyites. They would have Israelites, they would have Five Percenters. They would Muslims, and they would have all these orators on the podium speaking. Later days, it became Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton]. It became, what's his name, Charles Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], you know, in the later days. I've heard, even heard Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], you know, all of these individuals and many, many more, have spoken from these podiums at this bookstore on 121st Street. I used to go down there, yeah, specifically, to listen to different ideologies, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you go in the store?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's where I gathered my fondness for reading. I--you look in my car now, you'll see books scattered all over the backseat. I love to read.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Lewis Michaux's [Lewis H. Michaux] bookstore.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Pictures of all the African heads of state on the side of the store (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yep, the flags.
Speaker 1: It was a landmark place until it was--
Speaker 2: They tore it down.
Speaker 1: Adam Clayton Powell's [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] office building I think took the space.
Speaker 2: Yeah, New York State building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, New York, New York]. Now, they have open air, free concerts there and all that, but still that bookstore, I thought, was a landmark. But they got rid of it. Thank god, there's still, you know, Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] is still there (laughter). But this is what I grew up with, all right.
Story_ID: 656150
Speaker 1: School, I graduated from DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York], you know, but it was more so, with me, it was street life.
Speaker 2: Well, well le- let's go back to you running away. Now, and you're thirteen--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you said, years old, you, you run, you ran away from home.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What events led to you running away?
Speaker 1: Being beaten by my foster, by my foster parents [Lucille Stukes (ph.) and Otis Stukes], being made to work at night in absence of getting some rest and being able to go to school the next morning. So I, I guess that would be interpreted as rebellion.
Speaker 2: Was there any one incident that triggered it or was, you just thought about it over time and said, well, this is bad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, it was a succession, it was a succession of incidents.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, I just got tired of being continually beaten, all right, you know, and most of the time--now, legitimately, why he had--there were things that I had did, all right. I took lunch money. They wouldn't give me no money so I could get lunch. Yeah, I took the money. I knew he kept money under the bed. So, yeah, I took two dollars, all right. I did that. Yeah, I broke all the liquor in the, in the closets (laughter)--
Speaker 2: You did (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you did that once?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a couple times, yeah, because, "I'm tired of y'all drinking and abusing me. You know, y'all don't know how to act when you all drink. It would be a whole different story if you drank and was sociable. You get antagonistic and ask- act asinine when you drink, so, yes, I broke your liquor." So they beat me, you know. But I got tired of it, you know.
Speaker 2: So you said you left on your bicycle?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. I road, I got on my bike--I had a Schwinn. I got on my bike, and I went from Jamaica [Queens, New York] to Brooklyn [New York]--
Speaker 2: What time of day did you leave?
Speaker 1: It was at night.
Speaker 2: At night, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Yeah, I had a white--a little light on the front of my bike (laughter).
Speaker 2: So you'd gather your stuff together and--
Speaker 1: No stuff.
Speaker 2: You didn't have anything?
Speaker 1: No stuff. I could barely ride that--you need two hands to ride that bike (laughter). I had a basket upfront, but I wasn't thinking that, you know, with the little thing on my shoulder, stick on my shoulder and a little bag. I wasn't thinking (laughter) in that mode. I was just thinking about getting away and my thoughts of running away was to go to the all night movie, all right. At that time, it was a choice. I could go to all night movie in Brooklyn or I could go to all night movie on 42nd Street. And at that time, 42nd Street was open 24/7. You can go and stay and stand on those sticky, greasy floors in the porno movies and stay in there all night, you know. I mean had to be aware of your surroundings, but you could stay there. I mean sleep wasn't--
Speaker 2: So you'd actually ride your bike all the way to 42nd--
Speaker 1: No, I'd ride my bike to Brooklyn. They--
Speaker 2: Brooklyn, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they have all, all night Westerns.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's where--I guess that's where I, I gained my fondness for Western movies. But they would have all night Westerns, cartoons, and twenty-four hours, you know. You can go out of there--come out of there seven o'clock in the morning. I'd go in there about nine, ten o'clock. I'd come out of there seven o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 2: So this is 1959, I guess.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, 1959, 1960, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you, you actually went--so where did you actually go? Did you go to--
Speaker 1: To Brooklyn (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to Brooklyn, you're saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: On that occasion.
Speaker 2: On that occasion.
Speaker 1: Okay, on many occasions I was at 42nd Street, but the police would always bring you back.
Speaker 2: But you ran away several times, you're saying?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, but you always end up coming back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before they finally got the message--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --to move me.
Speaker 2: But how--what would bring you back?
Speaker 1: The police.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's actually what--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'd bring me back to the Stukes 'cause they would, they would call the Stukes and the Stukes said, "I ain't coming to get him." So they'd, police take me back there. "You wanna take him back in?" "Yeah." If they didn't take me back in, they wouldn't get paid, see, and they whole purpose of keeping me there was to get paid, all right. So, so they'd bring me back home. And they'd tell them--the police would tell the Stukes, "Call his caseworker. Let them know what's going on." They're scared to call the caseworker. I was praying that they did, all right.

Speaker 1: So when the caseworker came, fortunately, I was in the pro- they changed my caseworker. They changed my caseworker from a black female to a white male, Mr. Robert Wheeler [ph.]. I love him to this day. I--even though he was gay (laughter), but Mr. Wheeler, he listened to me. And he got me moved out of that home to another home in the Bronx.
Speaker 2: So this is with another couple?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Henry [Henry Nelson] and Mary Nelson, lived at 1474 Stickney Place, Bronx, New York 10469.
Speaker 2: Now, what were the Nelsons like?
Speaker 1: The Nelsons was fantabulous, in the sense that I was the oldest child in the home. So I immediately became a big brother. The Nelsons had in their home, at one time or another, ten other foster children. I was the oldest. They had, let's see, four other boys, and--no, five, six, seven--and six girls. At the time, I mean, at that time, at one time--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven children lived in that house at one time. They had a nice home, private home in the Bronx. Stickney Place was the one family development between East 221st Street in the Bronx, Laconia Avenue, they called it East Bronx [Bronx, New York], and East 220th Street. The closest thoroughfare was Boston Road, Laconia Avenue, (Unclear), Evander Childs Hosp- High School [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York]. I went to DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York]. It was a all-boys school at that particular time.
Story_ID: 656152
Speaker 1: DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, like I said, it was a all-boys school. This was--my decision to go there was greatly, I guess, greatly influenced by Mr. Nelson [Henry Nelson]. I guess Mr. Nelson saw my propensity (laughter) to like females. So he suggested for my concentration I go to a all-boys school so I wouldn't--
Speaker 1: Be distracted.
Speaker 2: --be distracted, you know, by a female. When I came to the Bronx [New York] from, from Jamaica [Queens, New York], it was a whole new experience for me. One, being among other children I wasn't familiar with. Being the oldest brother, you know, big brother, I wasn't familiar with. I was ready for it, but I wasn't familiar with it.
Speaker 1: Did you like the younger kids?
Speaker 2: Huh? Yeah, yeah. Being in a, in a neighborhood that there were other children there; girls, boys. I guess the Stickney Place or in the Bronx where I grew up at was, could be considered a blue collar area, neighborhood. Mr. Nelson worked for the transit [New York City Transit Authority]. Ms. Nelson [Mary Nelson] just took care of children and was home, you know, 24/7. By her having like seven kids--seven children that would--that meant seven checks coming in a month. So she was, you know, they were well off with the money that he made. Mr. Nelson showed me something as far as what a man should be like. Mr. Nelson did all the grocery shopping, all right. Mrs. Nelson gave Mr. Nelson an allowance. Her money was her money, and he took care of the house. If anything had to be repaired there, he would do it or have somebody come in and do it. Aside from working in the, for the transit authority, Mr. Nelson was a co-owner in a store on 145th Street in Harlem [New York, New York], right off Amsterdam [Avenue], and he used to go there at the store and work when he wasn't at his other job. So he wasn't home a lot of the times. Mr. Nelson, he had his den, he had his own den, and he had a safe in that den. And every week all the kids would go to the den, knock on the door (knocks), "Mr. Nelson." "Who is it?" You'd tell him your name, "Come in. How you doing?" "What you been doing," dah, dah, dah. And there would be a envelope on top of the desk with your name on it. That was your allowance, every week. Yeah. If you were bad, he wouldn't beat you. He would talk you to death. There were times I would rather him beat me than talk to me (laughter). I mean, you know, I wouldn't meet curfew, beat me. But he would sit there and talk to me, "Richard [HistoryMaker Richard X. Clark], you know, you're a man." And Mr. Nelson was, he was a short person. He was like, what, Mr. Nelson was like 4'11". Yeah, about 4'11". He used to call me Big Giraffe. But I can honestly, I think--the vibe I got from him was that he really cared, yeah. He knew my dilemma as far as not knowing my parents [Jennie McDowell and Leslie James (ph.)]. And he knew that at eighteen, I was--I was on my own, okay. And he used to tell me that. He said, "You gonna have it most harder than a lot of these kids here," said, "because their families coming back and get them. You ain't got nobody to come and get you." And I used to see it, I used to--it used to hurt tremendously. I'd see their family come, you know, take 'em out to dinner and all this stuff. Mine, nobody comes. But Mr. Nelson told me the truth, you know. Start being a man. Don't depend on nobody else. Do for self. The same principles that I was hearing coming from another black man, Elijah Muhammad, "Do for self," can't depend on nobody else. So that became really engrained in me, you know, and I saw it being done through Mr. Nelson, okay. So that, I--then that added positively to my, in my growing up.
Story_ID: 656153
Speaker 1: The other side was my being exposed to other adolescents, you know. I would know girls, and that was new to me, but I wouldn't be after them in a lustful manner. I was known as the big brother, you know, the great adviser. I could sit--I would sit down, and they would talk to me about their boyfriends, you know, what did they need to do. And I would tell 'em, you know, truthfully, don't let him take advantage of you, you know, and not to get 'em. There's other guys, and, you know, so forth. And they appreciated that. So I began to get some sense of self worth by being, helping others and being truthful with others. So that became one of the proponents of my life, you know, to be able to help somebody, you know, because the reality is, even though I think I had it bad, somebody got it worse than me, yeah. So that--
Speaker 2: That, how--well, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: That's--I keep that in front of me. That's one of my everyday endeavors, to always remember that. I may have it bad, but somebody got it worse than me.
Story_ID: 656154
Speaker 1: At Dewitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York], did--I mean did you, did you play any sports or anything or did you--
Speaker 2: I--track and field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I ran track and field, cross country, you know. We used to run in Van Cortlandt Park [Bronx, New York]. Yeah, we had the cross country, yeah, ran 5K [kilometers].
Speaker 1: Was church a big factor with the Nelsons [Mary Nelson and Henry Nelson]?
Speaker 2: Not a big factor. I was like, I wouldn't say torn between going to church and going down to 120--116th Street and listening to the brothers. Going to church was basically--at that time, I had a girlfriend. And she used to go to Laconia Presbyterian Church [Laconia Community Presbyterian Church, Bronx, New York]. I used to go with her, yeah. I used to try to get her to come down to 116th Street--
Speaker 1: To the mosque?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but at that time--
Speaker 1: This is Temple No. 7 [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], right, of the Nation [Nation of Islam]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which I ended up joining before I went in the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: So, and this is when Malcolm X was actually the, the head of Temple No. 7 and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] was a junior--
Speaker 2: FOI (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or someone coming along.
Speaker 2: Junior minister, yeah, um-hm, student minister.
Speaker 1: And Joseph was --
Speaker 2: Captain Joseph [Yusuf Shah], yes.
Speaker 1: --captain, you know, Fruit of Islam, FOI.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes, yes. And, you know, as I said earlier, I was a Fruit, and that's where I came in contact with--
Speaker 1: Did you join the Fruit of Islam in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm, I joined the temple--
Speaker 1: --in the, in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I joined the temple, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's where I met, also met Brother Norman and Brother Thomas. I say these two brothers, and Brother Talmadge, I say these three brothers 'cause those were the brothers that was ultimately charged with killing Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Talmadge (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Norman--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Brother Norman, Brother Talmadge Hagan [Talmadge X Hayer], Hagan was the one that was guilty of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and Brother Thomas--
Speaker 1: Was his real name Hayer or, or Hagans?
Speaker 2: Thomas Hagan, H-A-G-E-N [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Cause his name, he's known as Talmadge Hayer, Thomas Hagans--
Speaker 2: And Jamar Hayer [sic.].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's his Islamic name [sic.].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Just like mines is Jahad [ph.].
Speaker 1: Norman 3X Butler, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Islamic name is Aziz [Muhammad Abdul Aziz].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the other one, the third one was?
Speaker 2: Brother Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thomas 5X Johnson [sic. Thomas 15X Johnson].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So, you know, it's strange how brothers' lives intersect one another, you know. But through these brothers and my contact with, with Islam and with the mosque, that's how I was, you know, I was exposed to Brother Farrakhan, Brother Malcolm, Brother Norman, Brother Joseph, you know, all these brothers 'cause I used to go down 116th Street and FOI, at that particular time, we used to go from New York [New York], Newark [New Jersey], you know, all up and down the eastern seaboard, checking out different mosques.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now did, I mean did Temple No. 7 kind of give you like a home away from home, sort of?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Temple No. 7 at that time was my, I guess, my sanctuary. I say it in a sense that though I was doing other things I, you know, I would go there and seek refuge and forgiveness. I'll say it in that sense, forgiveness for the negative things that I was doing, all right, in the sense of, you gotta remember, we're, we're in the time of the black revolution.
Speaker 1: Well, '61 [1961] where--a little bit before, and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were, there were a lot of things transpiring, you know, that was mobilizing to where it was becoming more apparent.
Speaker 1: Probably more so in New York than any place else in the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --if it was--
Speaker 2: 'Cause like I was saying, like we used to travel up and down--when I say we, FOI used to travel up and down the eastern seaboard checking out other mosques, you know, and making sure the brothers was doing what they was supposed to be doing, making sure that they--a brother disrespected a sister, you had to take care of that and, you know, so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and at that particular time or in later years, it was the upheaval 'cause this was the time that Malcolm was so called revealing the actions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad as far as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, this happens around '62 [1962], '63 [1963], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or '63 [sic. 1964] actually.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, where, where Malcolm is talking about the messenger having different affairs, you know, having different concubines, having different women, you know, supporting different women and different children, all right.
Story_ID: 656155
Speaker 1: So you're around a senior in high school during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: I'm young where, I'm the young Fruit [Fruit of Islam].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're actually in--are you selling the papers [Muhammad Speaks; Muslim Journal] and stuff--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and bean pies (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Papers, fish, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, fish, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The whole, the whole nine yards (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you dressing in a suit and the bowtie?
Speaker 2: Bowtie, suit, yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Every day?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in a bowtie and a suit to the FOI uniform.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, you know, gray hat, star and crescent, well, you see this, still got this, star and crescent, and, you know. Yeah, I progressed to the Fruit.
Speaker 1: And how did this work at home? Did Mr. Nelson [Henry Nelson] have any problems with it?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I, no, I was, I was out of the Nelson home. I had--
Speaker 1: When did you leave the Nelsons?
Speaker 2: I left, I left the Nelson house, home and went into the [U.S. military] service, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute. Okay, now, we don't wanna jump too far ahead of our--'cause I had you in high school here at DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 2: I went into the service from high school.
Speaker 1: So you went--did you go in when you were sixteen or something or seventeen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ms.--who was it? Ms. Nelson [Mary Nelson] signed for me to go in the service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't choose, I went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That'd been '62 [1962], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '63 [1963]. I went in the service in '63 [1963]. I was in the naval reserves [U.S. Navy Reserve]. So I had to go to a meeting a week and two weeks in the summertime from '63 [1963] to '65 [1965]. This is when I was in high school. So that enabled me to still have my activities with the Nation [Nation of Islam]. But in '65 [1965], I was ordered to active duty. All right, so I was on active duty from '65 [1965] to '68 [1968] 'til I got discharged in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: And so were you living in Mr. Nelson's in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Nelson, in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: No, in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: No, I went into the service in, in '63 [1963]? No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you went into the--
Speaker 2: No, I got my own apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was just on the crux of being--
Speaker 1: So you got your own apartment before you joined the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I lived on my own before that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Actually, I got my apartment. I was living in the Bronx [New York], still was living in the Bronx, but downtown in the Bronx on Tinton Avenue, yeah. And as to how I used to pay my rent, was I would hustle, you know. So I had a little girlfriend, and she moved in with me. And, you know, she--I was regularly attending the mosque [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York] at that particular time. I was with the Fruit, young Fruit. And I thought I had it going on as far as, you know, having an identity of who I was, you know, belonging to something. But I was worried about the draft, you know. I didn't wanna go through the same thing that--well, I didn't even think that it was, could soon be possible for me. The same thing that Muhammad Ali went through, you know, conscientious objector. I didn't really wanna go in the service. But it turned out to be one of the best things I did. So after doing, you know, I went to my reserve meeting, again, contradiction, here I'm in the reserves but I'm also a Fruit (laughter) of Islam, yeah. Anyway, so when they called me to active duty, I guess I might as--tell it all. When they called me to active duty, I had a girlfriend at that particular time. And I was, ended up being stationed on one of the last ships to be built at the Brooklyn Navy Yard [New York, New York], the USS Duluth LPD-6. Just--well, after the ship was finished being built, we were scheduled to go on the commission ceremonies or shakedown crews. So we left Brooklyn [New York] going to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], then going to Panama, then come into West Coast and then going over to Vietnam.
Story_ID: 656156
Speaker 1: I'm gonna freeze right here for a second, just 'cause I need to go back and get something that we didn't talk about, just 'cause I was thinking, if we go too far away, I won't be able to talk about it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's, that's when Malcolm X was, I guess, banned by the Nation of Islam by Elijah Muhammad, in '63 [sic. 1964], right after the assassination of John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], what did you think about that?
Speaker 2: Well, truthfully, I left the Nation actually. I, I think I kind of knew a little bit more than the common person knew, in the sense that I knew it was a lot of jealousy in the Nation. I knew that the messenger didn't know or (unclear) didn't know what was happening to Malcolm. I knew there was, through the jealousy of the brothers along with the conspiracy of Interpol [International Criminal Police Organization] at that particular time, that they fit into Malcolm being killed, okay. I knew--
Speaker 1: But at that time in '63 [1963], when he, when he split off from--or he was pushed out of the Nation--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they basically thought (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because he, because the messenger put him under suspension.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And the suspension was because of what he said about the assassination of Kennedy--
Speaker 1: "Chickens coming home to roost," right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That statement.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: There's more to it than that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's more to it than that in the sense that other brothers made it out to be more than it was. And it put the messenger, it backed him up into a corner, to, that he could do nothing else but say, you got--to Malcolm, "You're suspended indefinitely. You got too much power." You know, you're getting too much notoriety and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know other, I mean authors and documentary filmmakers have--I think Captain Joseph is one of the, those in opposition to Malcolm X--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who really wanted to see--
Speaker 2: Jealous, jealous.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Captain Joseph, well, they call him Yusuf Shah, a lot of the ministers, a lot of ministers, very jealous. And I would say that Malcolm attributed a little bit because what he was saying that the brothers couldn't--he didn't understand and the brothers didn't really understand it, in the sense that, yes, the messenger was taking care of various women and children. But because of the Islamic--that the so called American Negro got, didn't reveal all its tenets. In Islam, it tells about, if you got a brother, and he gets killed, you're supposed to take care of that brother's family, all right. A lot of people don't understand that, so a lot of people don't, don't realize what (unclear) just in saying. A lot of the, the women that the messenger so called had, he wasn't having intimate relationships with them. He was taking care of them and their children because the head of the family was, wasn't there.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that the children that, that were alleged to be the children of Elijah Muhammad--
Speaker 2: There were some, yes.
Speaker 1: I know some that actually say they are in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are some, yes.
Speaker 1: That are the sons and daughters of Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. But you forget, in Islam, not--well, not in the watered down sense of how, how the Nation of Islam came about, but in Islam, a man can have four wives as long as he treats 'em equally, all right. Now, this is Islamic customs, pure Islamic customs, Sunni, (Unclear), you know, pure Islamic. You can have more than one wife. The Nation of Islam never condoned or went into that philosophy. The messenger did because he had a little--well, he acquired through his lifestyle, he acquired more knowledge about polygamy, all right. But when Malcolm said acquired, he didn't utilize it correctly, all right. So--
Speaker 1: Okay, he had a lot--that was the controversy, that he wasn't really married to them, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they were young girls that didn't expect even to be dealing with him necessarily when they signed on to work with him.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 656157
Speaker 1: I wondered if you had stayed in the Nation [Nation of Islam] because of the--
Speaker 2: Well, see, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) joining the [U.S.] Navy seems to be something that a member of the Nation would not do.
Speaker 2: No, no, because of--definitely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because Elijah Muhammad actually, he resisted the draft.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, along with Malcolm [Malcolm X], I mean along with Muhammad, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Elijah Muhammad didn't allow himself to be drafted--
Speaker 2: And neither did Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 1: --and went to jail for it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Muhammad Ali didn't have to go to jail, but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, he resisted it.
Speaker 1: Elijah Muhammad was serious enough where he did not go--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean he actually went to jail.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so I mean with me, it was reality in the sense that, hey, I'm gonna get drafted. I, yeah, I could have said, "Well, I'm not--I don't wanna go. I'm not going." I could've went through the whole process of going to jail and all that stuff. I didn't--
Speaker 1: But personally for you, it is the best option for you to do it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --probably there.
Speaker 2: I mean 'cause here I am, you know, I'm gonna be cast asunder come eighteen. So what better than I have--yeah, I can still have my thoughts and still be in the service. That's what I figured at that time--you know, the particular time, you know. They got my body, but they ain't got my soul.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll do this, but this is gonna help me out in the long run.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it has, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: All right, so now we're aboard the USS Duluth [USS Duluth LPD-6]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-three [1963], I guess, and you're on your way to--
Speaker 2: Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Um-hm
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, like I said, we--before I left, you know how--I don't know if you've done this (laughter), but you know how when you're getting ready to go away, you told, you told that girl, "I won't be back for a while. You need to give me a little bit before," (laughter), "we leave," (laughter), yes, I did. This is in the Bronx [New York], okay. And I don't know, but I just knew that she was pregnant. I knew that, that first time. We got up off of that couch, I knew, I said, "Oh, I messed up now." But to compound injury, we are stopping at Philadelphia. I got another girlfriend in the Bronx. She's going to college up in Albright University [sic. Albright College]. So me and my friend, he's a postmaster, I'm a personnel man onboard ship. We decide to rent a house in Philadelphia, PA [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] on Susquehanna Avenue. I've been to Philadelphia before when I was growing up to the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival], yeah. So we used to have a ball. Anyway, but we rented a house. I went and got my girlfriend from Albright University in Reading, Pennsylvania, brought her back down to this house that we rented for the weekend, 'cause I'm getting ready to pull out from here, go to Panama and then to Vietnam. I got this college girl. I'm intimate with her. I take her back to school. "I'll see you when I get back." Everything hunky dory. I get to Panama. I get a letter and I get a telegram. Both of these women are saying, "Richard [HistoryMaker Richard X. Clark], I'm pregnant. What are we going to do?" Now, this is being conveyed to a individual that always grew up vowing I would never have any children that didn't know me.
Story_ID: 656158
Speaker 1: Now, this is really serious for you. 'Cause you, you were raised without family, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Makes sounds) Now, I got two women pregnant. All right, the naivete and the bravado in me tells me, I'm gonna face my responsibility. I'm in the [U.S. military] service. I ain't got a pot to piss in, but I'm gonna face my responsibilities. We go to Panama, and we get to California. And I request emergency leave. I can only get two weeks. We were in Pendleton [Camp Pendleton; Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California]. I try to get a plane from California to New York [New York]. All the commercial lines are on strike. I don't know if you remember. Was it 1967? I think it was 1967, all the planes went on strike. And I couldn't get a flight back to New York. So--
Speaker 1: And you're wasting your time, you're wasting your leave time, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. So I, I get a bus. Me and a friend of mine who I grew up with, his ship happened to be--he was on Ticonderoga [USS Ticonderoga]. And we get a bus, four days from--nonstop from California to New York. Man, we were on this bus. He gets hemorrhoids. He had to sit on his hands and knees in the back of the bus (laughter), all the way--I leave three days. We finally get back to New York, all right. Now, my foster mother, Ms. Nelson [Mary Nelson], knows both girls. She likes Celeste [Celeste Baker Clark] more than she likes Leslie [Leslie Mardenborough]. So before I get back to, to the Bronx [New York], Ms. Nelson has bought the rings, told everybody we gonna get married to Celeste, that I'm going to get married to Celeste, when the wedding is, and the whole nine yards. I'm not aware of this, all right. I get back to New York. First person I try to get in contact is not Celeste, it's Leslie all right. I come to find out that her mother and her father has sequestered her away, and I can't get in touch with her. I can't find her. So I caught myself doing the next best thing. I go ahead and get married to Celeste, all right. You saw the result--
Speaker 1: Right, I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One of 'em [Kevin Clark], yeah. The other one [Keith Clark] is in Maui [Hawaii]. He--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause that--you've got a granddaughter named Celeste [Celeste Clark] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just met her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's the granddaughter, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: See, because their mother is deceased and my wife, she gone. But he named his daughter after his mother, yeah. So, I'm back in New York, supposed to be in California, yeah. So I request a discharge, okay. They locked me up in the Brooklyn brig because I missed movement.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there--your company left, I mean your--
Speaker 2: My ship, yeah, but it went to Nam [Vietnam], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so they locked me up for missing movement. I was supposed to be in California 'cause I couldn't go back. You know, she's pregnant, and, you know, the whole nine yards. So I applied for a, what I did, while I was AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave], I took the test for the New York City police force [New York City Police Department], passed it, okay. I'm in the brig, but I'm waiting to get on the police force.
Story_ID: 656159
Speaker 1: Here you're waiting to--you passed the police exam (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sitting in the brig.
Speaker 1: And sitting in the brig.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Navy brig [Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Navy brig.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, now the [U.S.] Navy is, you know--so what were the--how was the Navy disposed? Were they gonna send you to Vietnam anyway or what?
Speaker 2: No, no, they actually, what they were going to do was give me a bad conduct discharge. But I had too much time in. So I was fortunate to, to run into two JAG officers, and what they did is, I was working for JAG while I was waiting to be discharged. So they reviewed my record, found out that I was eligible for a honorable discharge and had me work over at JAG until they discharged me. Okay, so I was able to--I was married. I was able to get an apartment while my wife was pregnant.
Speaker 1: And the JAG, JAG is a law department of the Navy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Judge Advocate Generals [Judge Advocate General's Corps]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --legal part of the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I was able to come back to the military every day, you know, had off weekends. I get off at five o'clock, from nine to five, you know. So I had my apartment up with my wife, up in Brooklyn--I mean up in the Bronx [New York]. She gave birth to the twins, and--
Speaker 1: She had twins?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my--that was Kevin [Kevin Clark], the other one's Keith [Keith Clark]. And I decided not to, to go on the police force [New York City Police Department] 'cause I was thinking about being shot and all that, you know. I got two kids to think about. So I started working for 1199 [Local 1199; 1199SEIU, United Healthcare Workers East], okay. And my wife, she worked there, all right. Oh, Celeste [Celeste Baker Clark] was a neurosurgeon technician at NYU [New York University, New York, New York]. Unfortunately, she had a brain tumor, and she passed. My sons were eight years old. Yeah--
Speaker 1: So--wait, we're running kind of ahead of schedule. I mean, but so--
Speaker 2: Okay, you wanna back. Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], right?
Speaker 1: Did we run past Attica?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we need to go back. We'll pick up the rest of it, but you were saying, so when you got out of the Navy, you were--well, you were working for JAG until you got out of the Navy.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then you--but you didn't take the police job.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was working for 1199.
Speaker 1: So, 1199?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is that? That's--
Speaker 2: Hospital union.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I was at--working at the benefits--
Speaker 1: Hospital union, okay.
Speaker 2: --beneficiaries' office on 34th Street in New York [New York] for 1199. And this is when I got arrested.
Speaker 1: Okay, the hospital workers' union.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656160
Speaker 1: Tell us--now, what happened? How did you--now, you and Celeste [Celeste Baker Clark] are married, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, and you're working for the union [Local 1199; 1199SEIU, United Healthcare Workers East].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell us the story of how you got arrested?
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm working for the union. I'm (gesture) still in the Nation [Nation of Islam], but I'm reuniting with old friends that I hadn't seen since I've been in the--since I came out the [U.S. military] service. So we get together and we're going downtown to look at, to go to a movie, all right. And I get in the car with them, three other guys, and we're going downtown. They get off at FDR Drive on 96th Street and stop at a delicatessen to get some beer and some soda, cigarettes. I wait in the car. They come out. They get in the car. We go about two blocks. Suddenly, we're surrounded by police officers, their guns out. Everybody get out the car. The guy comes up, points three of the brothers out, "Yeah, they robbed my store." I'm not identified. Police said that they--I can't prove that I wasn't the getaway driver. They take us all downtown.
Speaker 1: So were you driving?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was sitting in the passenger seat, you know, waiting for them to come out the store. Anyway, now, I can't prove I'm not the get- the getaway driver; take us downtown. I think I'm the youngest. Anyway--no, I'm the, I'm the youngest--I mean the older br- but anyway, I get sent to Rikers Island [New York, New York]. And I think they get sent to Brooklyn House of Detention [Brooklyn Detention Complex, Brooklyn, New York] or Manhattan [Manhattan Detention Complex, New York, New York], you know, at Tombs. Through the process, I'm offered five years if I take a plea, if I give somebody twenty thousand dollars, the judge, Judge Schweitzer [Mitchell Schweitzer]. I'll never forget that dude. If I give Judge Schweitzer, twenty grand, I'll get five years' probation.
Speaker 1: Now, what would happen if you pled not guilty?
Speaker 2: I'd have to go to trial.
Speaker 1: And you would be risking a sentence of what?
Speaker 2: Twenty to thirty [years] for armed robbery.
Speaker 1: So this is--so you think your chances in that court were probably not that great to win even though you didn't do it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, and not really. You know, I mean realistically, my chances were a lot better than theirs in the sense that I had never been arrested before, all right. I didn't do it. I wasn't, you know, I didn't even have knowledge of the crime. So in that sense, you know, I was of the belief, well, this is America, and I'm not guilty. So I shouldn't be found guilty. But then I had to deal with reality, you know. Here I am, a black man, being charged with a crime, and I can't prove that I had no knowledge of the crime or that I didn't do the crime. I got proof that I didn't do the crime by a witness. But that doesn't mean jack.
Speaker 1: You've got the judge actually asking for a bribe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which indicates that he's not gonna be fair.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, definitely not. And Schweitzer at that time was known to be a crooked judge. How he was able to--sitting on the bench, I have no idea. But, so many more have been manifested to be crooked, you know, especially in the criminal justice system. So, you know, even though my early contact with the criminal justice system made me realize that a black person, not gonna get no justice in this country, you know. And I learned that at a early age.
Speaker 1: So that--you were telling us earlier that the deal was if you pled, you wouldn't get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, I would get five years' probation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did that, that didn't happen, right, or we wouldn't be having this (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, no. (Laughter) I didn't have twenty grand, first of all. I did plea, but I was supposed to be five years' probation. The other guys were supposed to get four years, department of correction [New York City Department of Correction]. I got five years department of correction. They got five years department of correction. Everybody got five years department of correction. There we went. My first place--you know, I had to leave my wife, my kids [Kevin Clark and Keith Clark].
Story_ID: 656161
Speaker 1: My first facility was Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York], okay. And going to prison at that particular time was not good, I mean it wasn't good for anybody, but when I say it wasn't, it wasn't good for a Muslim, especially, a black Muslim. In the department of correction [New York City Department of Correction] (makes sound), they didn't have too many of 'em, and those that they did have, they didn't want and they didn't like because they were of the opinion that when you said you were a black Muslim, you was a racist, all right. And that's how they dealt with you. So I taught school in Sing Sing.
Speaker 2: Well, let's deal with that for a second. How do you--would you consider being a Muslim in those days as being a racist?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, and why not?
Speaker 1: Because Islam was never, is never--it's not about racism. It's not about race, creed or color. You got Muslims of every color.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but in those days, the Nation of Islam (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In those days, they--the Nation of Islam--
Speaker 2: --said the white man was the devil and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, see, now, that's, that's where the controversy is. Yes, the--in those days, the--Elijah Muhammad said that the, the white man is the devil. But you have to understand what he was saying, all right. And what he was saying is this: is that the white man, for what you wanna, or what you read or would not read, is the epitome of evil. The white man has always been evil to the black man--
Speaker 2: Now, do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) historically proven.
Speaker 2: I remember James Baldwin was on a talk show with Malcolm X, and he was accused by the host of making black people hate white people or something.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And James Baldwin stepped in and defended Muhammad and said, "Well, he didn't make us hate white people." He said, "White people" (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yes, yeah--
Speaker 2: --"are the ones that are, you know--if black people hate white people at all, and any reason, is because of the actions of white people."
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah. See, but what, what Elijah Muhammad was saying and what the powers that be manipulated and, and turned it into something negative. But what--basically, what Elijah Muhammad was saying was, have knowledge of self, do for self. Don't ask anyone to do something that you can do for yourself, all right. Realistically, in this country, the white man don't mean--don't mean the black man any good, all right. Now, he's talking about back then to now, okay.
Speaker 2: He's also making a big generality.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a big generality (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's not talking about--
Speaker 1: --but he's going through the concepts of history, through slavery, through us, through us not knowing who we are, see, because if we--if you or we know who we really are, then we know we are the originals--originators of this universe, you know. We--which Muhammad also taught, that the original black man is the owner and the creator of civilization, all right. The, your everyday black man, he doesn't know about the universities in Timbuktu [Mali]. You know, he doesn't know about us, black people being the first in civilization. The basic black man or woman doesn't know who they are, doesn't know their own history. Your knowledge of history of who you are gives you that--or I think gives you that sense of pride, okay. All right, we, as far as what we think history reveals to us, is that when the European or the Caucasian was in the mountains in caves in Europe, we, as a civilization was in Africa, having universities and so forth. So there's a difference, you know. We had civilization long before they did, all right. They were able through manipulation and a whole lot of devious actions, was able to turn it around. Then you can get into the biblical aspect of it which says that six thousand years, the black man is supposed to be subjugated by the white man. This is for six thousand years. Supposedly, we're coming to the end of our six thousand years, you know. That's biblically.
Speaker 2: Is this in the Bible somewhere that actually says this?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. Yeah, if you read, let me see, Elijah Muhammad's book, 'Black Men in America' [sic. 'Message to the Blackman In America'], and he reveals--well, you can take a Final Call newspaper [The Final Call] today and it tells you, and it show you where it says in the Bible, in the Torah, the Qur'an [Koran], but basically, in the Bible, whereas for six thousand years and how in the last days, at the end of the six thousand years, how the rulers or the so called white man and his attempts not to give up rule, will let this world be destroyed.
Story_ID: 656162
Speaker 1: Maybe I should ask you like, what does being a Muslim mean in the, in the American prison system? I mean what does it mean to a black person if you are not a Muslim, what would you be subject to? And if you were a Muslim, what would--what advantage would it be for you?
Speaker 2: Okay, in the American prison society today, to be a Muslim is to immediately place yourself as an outcast in prison society, outcast because you have various principles, you have various practices by being a Muslim which mandates that you not--you don't allow yourself to be manipulated or used as a tool by the prison authorities, used as a tool in the sense of doing their job. The prison authorities like to keep the prison population divided, fighting one another, crabs in the barrel, pulling one another down. That enables them not to have to do their job because we're doing their job for them, creating confusion, all right.
Speaker 1: Basically punishing each other.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --promoting all kinds (background noise)--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --activities, you know, doing all kinds of undermining things, thinking that you're running the institution, whereas you're being contained.
Speaker 1: Now, there's another aspect of this I wanted to ask about, and I've heard, I've heard it--I heard it just recently again by somebody that seemed to make sense on some level, that today especially, and probably then too, being a Muslim in prison, not only just makes you different, it makes you--it gives a protection in terms of certain gang situations in prison and that sort of thing. If you're a Muslim (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Definitely.
Speaker 1: --then you're not--that's your primary identity--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and not a rival gang member or--
Speaker 2: Right, well, see they--well, the prison population is basically controlled by different fractions, gangs. You got the Bloods, you got the Crips, you got the Mau Maus, you got the Nazis, you got the white supremists, you know, you got different gangs, the Aryan Nation (background noise), you have different gangs. And if you're a Muslim, what you're saying is, first of all, I got the protection of my whole umat, my whole community or the Islamic community inside the institution. I got that as a protection. That's one. Number two, I'm not about different deviant acts that you're doing. I'm not about you making no wine, no swag. I'm not about no homosexual activities, you know, I'm not about any kind of negativity. All I'm about is making my slot, my prayers, making jum'ah, congregation prayers with the other brothers. That's all I socialize. I may have or know guys that's not involved, but they come to me, I go to them, on a diff- certain level. Yeah, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be involved in any kind of negativity. That, they know, if you say you're a Muslim.
Speaker 1: So would that inspire the guards or the other prisoners to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the guards are gonna respect you for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do the other prisoners respect that too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: If you don't drink, you don't curse--
Speaker 2: Definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: --you don't--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, they respect you for that. They don't--they're not gonna mess you for--you know, with you that for that because they know that when they go, you're dedicated, you know. Just like they're dedicated to whatever they're doing, they know that you're dedicated, and you're willing to die for it. And that's the whole thing right there in a nutshell. You're willing to die for Islam, yeah. No wavering nothing, you know. But it also mandates that you in your sirat al-mustaqim being, you continue to walk that straight path 'cause you gonna be observed. You gonna be observed by the prison guards, and they gonna be able to tell whether you shamming or not. And that's the worst thing.
Speaker 1: So the discipline to be a Muslim in prison or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Being a Muslim in the world.
Speaker 1: --to be in the Nation of Islam, especially, is to be disciplined.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, definitely. Yeah, first and foremost. Yeah, you work--you wake up with that in the morning and that carries you through the day, and at night when you're asleep, you're still in that mode.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 656163
Speaker 1: I think you were saying before I, I kind of interrupted you, you were saying that you were teaching--
Speaker 2: I taught in Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York]. I taught high school equivalency diploma, all right. When I came to prison--again, I had never been to prison. I didn't even know what that was about. I didn't even know about Rikers Island [New York, New York]. I'd heard about it, you know. But when I came to prison, it astonished me that you had men that couldn't read, you know. You had guys sitting up in a institution, that couldn't even read their warrant, that couldn't even read their sentence, that couldn't even read their minutes of their, their trial, yeah. So I used to teach the brothers how to read, you know. I used to help 'em out with their cases. At that time, we had law libraries, you know. You had a regular library. You could take correspondence courses. At that time, you had guys grad- I mean being released from prison who got their bachelor's [degree], who got their Ph.D.'s., master's [degree] because they allowed that to transpire in the facilities. Now, nada. They don't even have, you don't even have law libraries. The only thing you got now is when I was in the student--it was like seven--seven prisons in New York State. Now, there're, I think there's about thirty-seven, forty-two in New York State.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the stories we receive, we read about people like Malcolm X and Sonny Carson [Robert "Sonny" Carson] and Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, people are reading actually in prison and corresponding with people--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, looking up their cases in law books.
Speaker 2: See, 'cause now, they got a few, I wouldn't say so many. But now, they got a few--what do they call it, what they call Amnesty International where they help brothers and sisters review their cases and they're finding out they got so many brothers and sisters behind prison walls that are innocent. And through just looking in their cases, you can tell. But by their--no fault to them, but by their not being able to read or their ignorance, they're, you know, they haven't been able to overturn their cases. But now, they got organizations that are doing this, you know. But before, you know, when I was in, we were doing it, and we had to help the brothers in there, yeah. And we basically, only expertise that we had in the law was what we acquired by doing the research ourselves.
Story_ID: 656164
Speaker 1: So in these five years that you're serving, you're at Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York] first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --then you go--where do you go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right, I'm at Sing Sing--
Speaker 1: And I don't wanna miss anything in any of these places so, if something's significant tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, I went from Sing Sing--where'd I go, Sing Sing, I went to Wallkill [Wallkill Correctional Facility, Wallkill, New York]--no, excuse me. From Sing Sing, I went to Elmira [Elmira Correctional Facility, Elmira, New York]--
Speaker 1: Elmira, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter). I think I stayed in Elmira for what, a month, but the whole time I was in Elmira, I stayed in the box, segregation.
Speaker 1: Well, why? What happened?
Speaker 2: I was a Muslim. And I got put in the box because I had a Muslim meeting. At that time, I was a student minister, and they put me in the box and then shipped me out to Auburn. I stayed--I don't remember how long I stayed in Auburn, but from Auburn--
Speaker 1: Well, what does it mean to be put in the box?
Speaker 2: Segregation.
Speaker 1: Just in a cell by yourself.
Speaker 2: They take away your clothes, away from you. They give you a blanket. You sleep on a cement floor. They feed you through a slot. You get beans, two slices--no, four slices of white bread, beans, container of--no, a cup of tea, beans, bread, that's it, three times a day. And you're in darkness (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --you're in darkness twenty-four hours a day. The only light you get is from the light in the hallway.
Speaker 1: But this is as soon as you got to Elmira--
Speaker 2: Punishment. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they put you in a box--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --then they give you--I mean did you do anything when you, when you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What I did was I was a Muslim.
Speaker 1: So just on sight? Or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You didn't have to say anything.
Speaker 2: They had me--well, let me see. They had me down as a rabble rouser on my record.
Speaker 1: Now, is this from something you did at Sing Sing?
Speaker 2: No, because I was a Muslim.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't have to do anything but just come in with a--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: So that particular (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Any other way I see, which is ironic because that's how I got released. I never broke any institutional infractions. So they had no reason to hold me.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: My only fault was being a Muslim.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Elmira put you in a box, and then they shipped you off to Auburn.
Speaker 2: Auburn. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Auburn Correctional Facility [Auburn, New York]. Now, this is a place--well, not like the others weren't under this turmoil, but Auburn was boiling, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. Yeah, I worked in the, in the prison industry office as an accountant when I was Auburn.
Speaker 1: So this was in 1970?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I worked as a, up in the office in Auburn, and we used to travel from the cell, through the walls and go to work every morning. And when we came back, we used to congregate and talk about changing the conditions in Auburn, all right. Again, as I said earlier, I was a model prisoner. So they sent me to Wallkill, which was a minimum security prison. I stayed in Wallkill for (laughter) two weeks.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened? Did you, did you become a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had a meeting, I had a little meeting, and I had a picture of the messenger [Elijah Muhammad], and I had a poster of a star and crescent (shakes head). I came in that institution, walking out. They unpacked my bags and packed me up. I, I conducted a--well, they told me not to have any meetings while I was there. But I wouldn't listen to them. All the brothers knew I was coming. So we sat in the yard and we talked, Islamically. And when I got back to my room--'cause you didn't have a cell there, I got back to my room, they had packed my stuff up, and shipped me out to Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think when you left Auburn, it was less than a couple of months when they had the Auburn prison occupation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was that next month.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that next month.
Speaker 1: So this is in '70 [1970], 1970--October [sic. November], 1970.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Attica went off--
Speaker 1: September of--
Speaker 2: September 9, 1971.
Speaker 1: Right. So, in October, 1970--well, what set off Auburn?
Speaker 2: About the same thing, but not to the intensity of Attica, but what set off Auburn was about the same thing that set off Attica, which was the conditions. I mean, when I say conditions, you had at that time in all your prisons and as far as I know, in New York State--even in California, you had every political group outside, you had inside. The institutions weren't ready to deal with the new mentality of the prisoners that was coming in.
Story_ID: 656165
Speaker 1: This is the age of black consciousness movement, black power, cultural, nationalism, people were wearing Afros and--
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Dashikis, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a whole--
Speaker 2: You got white people, you know, white women and white guys talking about, "Power to the people." "What's going on, brother?" You know, you go the Weathermen [Weather Underground Organization], you know, you got SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], you got all, you know, every proletarian, so called proletarian is being involved with each other. You're having a consciousness in this country that we have never had before, all right. How, what you say, "Different strokes for different folks," this made up Five Percenters, Muslims, Israelites, Weathermen, every political group, different strokes, but we all trying to get to the same place. So we were united in our endeavors to get to the same place.
Speaker 1: And that place was?
Speaker 2: Freedom.
Story_ID: 656166
Speaker 1: All right, so we're at Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]. Now in 1971, they sent you out of Wallkill [Wallkill Correctional Facility, Wallkill, New York], 'cause you was--you were too Muslim--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I guess for them. So--
Speaker 2: Too Muslim (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they packed your stuff up. So you go to Attica. Now, what was the reputation of Attica?
Speaker 2: Woo, Attica was a tinderbox, I tell you. Their whole sense of sending me to Attica was punishment. They knew I hadn't done anything. But to keep me corralled, okay, because when I got to Attica, usually when you get--you're in a prison system, you're given a job, okay. When I got to Attica, they put me on what they called the grading gang. All right, the grading gangs doesn't--don't work, okay. You stay in your cell twenty-three and a half hours a day. They let you out for meals, and you get half an hour, forty-five minute yard. Attica (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yeah. Attica has four distinct yards, all right. You got A block, B block, D block and C block. A block is basically used for the individuals that they call--they have labeled incorrigibles, okay. They don't allow you to work.
Speaker 1: Okay, these are the people you can't tell anything to, supposedly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, supposedly, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You're either in, in A block or you're in the box. From A block, your next stop is the box automatically. B block is usually, is the metal shop, okay. They go to work, they go to the yard. C block is the cafeteria, mess hall. All mess hall workers live in C block. D block, basically the educational area, administrative offices, the prisoners that live there work over there in D block, okay. So that's the makeup of Attica. My exposure was A block. I stayed in the cell twenty-three and a half hours a day. The time that I got to go to the yard, I had my meetings, Islamic meetings, my Muslim meetings. I was the assistant minister at that particular time. I had matriculated from captain--from lieutenant--well, from squad leader, lieutenant, captain, assistant minister. So I would conduct the Islamic meetings every day I got in the yard. I used to have to stand with my back against the wall to keep from being pounced on by the prison guards, all right.
Speaker 1: So in 1971, what were the teaching of the Nation of Islam? Was--the Nation hadn't become like orthodox at that point, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--at that time, in 1971 or earlier, we emphasized doing right, basically, and in prison, it was a little bit different than what was practiced outside. In prison, basically, it was educational in the sense of your studies. At that time, the Nation had what they called lessons, your--the circumference of the planet Earth, what is it, five thousand one hund- and, you know, the square feet of a mile, 3,100 and something feet [sic.]. But it was educational. You had actual facts, and you had to study, and you had to know all this knowledge. You had Qur'an- Qur'anic studies where you studied the Qur'an [Koran]. You had studies where you tried to learn Arabic, okay.
Story_ID: 656167
Speaker 1: Basically, Islam in prison was a study time. Your interaction with other brothers was seeking knowledge, you know, sharing knowledge and seeking other knowledge. But basically, it was reading, which put you at odds with the institution. I say at odds with the institution because of this: at that time, the Nation of Islam, they had a newspaper, Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal]. They didn't allow you to get this paper in the institution. At that time, bearing in mind that most of your Muslims, or your inmate--inmate in general, are readers. There were certain books you could get and certain books you couldn't get. Black books, you couldn't get, you know, Fanon, Fanon [Frantz Fanon], Eldridge Cleaver, Malcolm X, you couldn't get no black books in--
Speaker 2: I know in your book ['The Brothers of Attica,' Richard X. Clark], you mentioned the warden [Vincent R. Mancusi] had held up a shipment of books for you that included J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and some other books.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to, man, like I said--
Speaker 2: And slammed his fist on the desk, and you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm, "You're not getting, you're not getting a damn thing," you know. And this is, these are--those were items that how they tried to get around it, I used to have my family send me books. They stopped that. They said the only way you can get any kind of publications was get 'em from the publishers themselves. So my family sent money. I used to send money to the publishers themselves to get books. I couldn't get the books per se, themselves. They wouldn't let 'em in the institution [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]. I mean a newspaper. They wouldn't let it in, okay. We went to court as well, as I mentioned to you before about--they told us to go through the chain of command, the correct procedures. We would do this, and we still would be denied. You know how frustrating that could be. Yeah, they're telling you one thing. You do that, and then you still can't get what you're seeking.
Speaker 2: Now, in contrast thereto, say if I was a Methodist in prison, what would I have access to? Would I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Everything you wanted.
Speaker 2: Okay, would I have the time to have a service or--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, you had services every Sunday, Methodist, Presbyterian--
Speaker 2: Would they (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jew- Jewish had services every, what was it? Every Saturday or so. Yeah.
Speaker 2: So they, so the--
Speaker 1: We went through--
Speaker 2: --did that mean--and it had to be a rabbi in the congregation of the prison or would somebody come in from the outside?
Speaker 1: For, for Jewish services?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They would get a rabbi outside, from outside. He would come in.
Speaker 2: So a rabbi, okay, he would actually come in and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and the same if I was a Methodist?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: A minister would come in?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Yep, you had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If I was a Catholic?
Speaker 1: You had a chapel, you had a chapel there. They would come in the institution, and the inmates could go sit in the pews in the chapel, come out their cells and be allowed to go to religious services, every week.
Speaker 2: But if I was a member of the Nation of Islam, then I wouldn't--
Speaker 1: You couldn't even go stand with your brother in the yard. They had a thing where you couldn't congregate. There couldn't be no more than two people--two prisoners together at one time. And God forbid if you're walking, if I'm walking with a white inmate. That was not allowed.
Speaker 2: So, well, now, wait a minute, now. They--you couldn't--you're in a--they're accusing you of being a racist--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --by being a member of the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, I couldn't have no white friends. I'm a racist.
Speaker 2: But you couldn't have white friends if you wanted to?
Speaker 1: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Well, now, why is that? Wouldn't they want you to--
Speaker 1: Because it's a sign of solidarity, and they didn't want the prisoners to have any kind of sense of solidarity. And in my particular case, it refuted their ideology, and it refuted their picture of me. How dare I have a white friend? I'm a racist, you know. How in the hell--how can I be a racist? Can I, please, tell me how? I'm a black man in America. Can I be a racist? I don't think so. But they, you know, this is what they project.
Story_ID: 656168
Speaker 1: Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] is, so you got the Five Percenters there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a spinoff of the Nation, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah. Clarence 15X [sic. Clarence 13X]. Clarence had a problem with the Nation, and he decided to get his own group. And basically, the Five Percenters was younger brothers, yeah. They couldn't go--quite handle discipline the Nation of Islam, so they decided to take the 5 percent. Now, 5 percent comes up from the theory that, it's supposed to be 5 percent of all populations that have the knowledge, wisdom and understanding of who they are. So, these brothers and sisters who claim to be Five Percent, they're able to say that they're god, all right, and that they can do primarily what they wanna do because they are god. Now, the difference between the Five Percent [Five Percent Nation] and Muslims, or the Nation of Islam, is this, that we recognize there is a god. We recognize that collectively, that we make up god. But we are just a manifestation of who god is. We're not god. Okay, that's the difference between the Five Percent. And as I said to you before, they're more fiery and they're younger, yeah. So you got that, you got the Young Lords, who was Latino, you know, brothers in the struggle. You got the Weathermen [Weathermen Underground Organization], Sam Melville, the Weathermen, who, Caucasian or the white guys, who are trying to make a change. So--
Speaker 1: Were some of them incarcerated with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sam Melville got killed at Attica. Me and Sam Melville used to walk around the yard together.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: Melville, M-E-L-V-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Like Herman Melville, the writer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. They tried to say that Sam Mel- that Sam had a shotgun and was running at a guard. And that's why he got killed in the trenches.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we won't get into that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He didn't have no gun.
Story_ID: 656169
Speaker 1: So things are kind of tied down at Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for you. You don't have a lot of freedom there. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no. See but I was in the originators of trying to bring about a change, and when I say originators, we feel--well, the brothers who were in the know feel that Attica started long before September 9th, and, in our endeavors to deal with it, we had went to Oswald [Russell Oswald]. He told us to write the commissioner.
Speaker 1: He's the--Oswald was the commissioner of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The commissioner, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the prisons--
Speaker 2: He told us to write--
Speaker 1: --for the State of New York.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, well, I'll digress. We went to Mancusi [Vincent R. Mancusi]. He told us to write Oswald.
Speaker 1: Now, he's the warden, Mancusi?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, he told us to write Oswald. We wrote Oswald. He told us to go--write the court, wrote the court, and won the decision by the court, change the conditions. The conditions being, allow us to have more than one shower a week, okay. Allow us to have more than one roll of toilet paper a month, okay. Allow us to have one pork free meal a day, okay. Allow us to get reading material that's conducive to our rehabilitation, okay.
Speaker 1: So what kind of material was available for prisoners?
Speaker 2: National Geographic, Newsday, old copies of Time magazine, what else? And that's basically, that's basically it, yeah. No--I think they may--let me think. Oh, yeah, they used to let us have Jet, but they tore out the Beauty of the Week (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's cruel (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But, you know, hey, they were giving us Jet and Ebony (laughter), but--and it took a while to get that. But that was basically, you know, that's all we had, yeah. Now, there were, what we call swag, you know, like 'Soul on Ice' [Eldridge Cleaver], would pass through the underground, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was the Iceberg Slim book about being a pimp [sic.]--
Speaker 2: Iceberg Slim, yeah.
Speaker 1: --how to be a pimp, and all--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Or, you know, 'Pimp Daddy' [ph.] and all that stuff. That was the underground, you know. Brothers would--you could rent those books out, two cigarettes, you could hold a book for a night, stuff like that. But if they were found, they were confiscated, you know, so. But that's all we had access to. So it wasn't like we didn't civilize--go after revitalization of the inside institution in a civilized manner because we knew we were tired of being beaten. They had a thing that, as I was saying to you before, if you were walking around the yard with a white guy, they would call, what we called the goon squad. Now, these were white correction officers. The average one was 6'5", 270 [pounds]. They would come out, drag you out your cell, and take you up to what you call HBZ [housing block Z], which is segregation, all because you were walking with a white guy or the white guy is walking with the black guy, yeah. And they would lose you in the system. If you didn't have somebody that cared about you outside, they had a graveyard right in the back of Attica where they would bury you, you know. So it--we knew it wasn't no joke. And it became more apparent with Auburn [Auburn Correctional Facility, Auburn, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and people there knew about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Auburn and Bronx House--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, Auburn and the Bronx House of Detention [Bronx House of Detention for Men, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 1: Now, did you have access to television and radio in prison?
Speaker 2: No. Radio. They had headphones in your cell. That's it.
Speaker 1: And what did you listen to on the radio? Could you change stations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they had their own--no, no. They had stations that they piped in.
Speaker 1: And what were they--what was the content?
Speaker 2: Country and western, country and western.
Speaker 1: Country and western music, really?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: For everybody?
Speaker 2: Everybody. "Dang me, go and take a rope and hang me" (laughter), country and western. I used to hate it. I wouldn't take--I wouldn't even mess with my headphones.
Speaker 1: Did they have the news on these stations at all?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no, no. Only way we get the news is when a boat came in, what we called a boat, a new shipment of inmates came in or the guards would let you read a paper if you were, you know, cordial to one or he was--you and him were what you considered to be friends.
Story_ID: 656170
Speaker 1: Now, did you earn any income in pri- prison?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I made--what I made? Eight cents a day.
Speaker 1: And for doing what?
Speaker 2: Working in the office on a calculator.
Speaker 1: Eight cents a day.
Speaker 2: Was it eight cents a day or eight cents an hour? I think it was maybe--no, no. Maybe it was--no, eight cents an hour, yeah.
Speaker 1: Eight cents an hour, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I could buy commissary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So every two weeks, I had like maybe three dollars, yeah, and I could buy a candy bar or soap or whatever, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you--could your relatives send you money?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, again, it's still--only available to you at that time was commissary and junk food, yeah. But we had--actually, we had, we did most of our own cooking. And how we cooked was this. We could buy can--you could buy canned foods from the commissary. You could have canned foods sent to you. You get thirty pounds of food a month, all right.
Speaker 1: Sent to you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, from the outside. So, to supplement our diet, you know, you could take bread out the cafeteria or the mess hall, four slices of bread. So to supplement your diet, you usually would get cheese spread sent to you, sardines, kippered herrings, wheat germ, canned rice and beans. And we would take these items and put 'em on the radiator, heat 'em up. We had a homemade can opener, and that's how we'd have our meals, send 'em up and down--there's a guy that comes out at night to--called a pier man. And he would go up and down the piers, to give you water so you wash up, water to drink. And he would put your cans on the radiator, let 'em heat up and then he would hand 'em back to you. And that's how we ate in opposition to going to mess hall or eating in the mess hall, you know.
Speaker 1: And what was wrong with eating in the mess hall?
Speaker 2: Well, pork, flies, lice, worms, stank, filthy, yeah, and you had, you had brothers cooking, and half of the time, it was, it was something that you couldn't eat, half cooked, you know. So we were forced in the sense that we didn't have to eat it, you know. We could, you know, we're forced in the sense that you were in the (unclear), in the Islamic community, so the brothers wanna make sure, one brother there, you know, didn't get a package or didn't--wasn't eating. He's gonna eat 'cause we would share our food, you know, send up and down the, the pier, the tier. So everybody ate, you know, even brothers that weren't Muslims, you know. We would feed everybody on the tier.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you had a lot of issues at Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you said it was, I think I read it was even like really hot there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Super hot with no ventilation.
Speaker 2: Super hot, super cold, you know, 'cause you stayed in your cell 24/7, you know. So, summertime, oh, man. And you have no air conditioners (laughter), you know. You was in a sweatbox, and then don't put it, put in the segregation. Even though they took all your clothes, you still, you know, you're gonna be sitting in that cell sweating. And that's what it's like, a sweatbox.
Story_ID: 656171
Speaker 1: Now, let me ju- let's, let's go to September the 8th, 1971.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I think you opened your book ['The Brothers of Attica,' Richard X. Clark] with a football game, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Brothers are playing football [at Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, Raymond Lamorie and Dewer [Leroy Dewer]. Raymond was a white guy, a white inmate, and Dewer was a black inmate. This is like September the 8th, and we in the yard, A block, and they're throwing the football to one another. I'm standing against the wall, having a meeting, and I'm watching 'em throw the football, one, nothing. And I'm talking to the other brothers. There's like myself, maybe four of us, four or five of us. Anyway, guard comes to the yard door and yells at Raymond and Leroy, "Yo, y'all need to stop that." "We ain't doing nothing." "I told you, you need to stop it."
Speaker 1: What was wrong?
Speaker 2: They congregating. They're throwing the football at one another. They're playing. They're co- whatever.
Speaker 1: Well, don't they have the football there so that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they can throw it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he's white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 2: --and he's black.
Speaker 1: So they can't, okay.
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) That's a no-no, yeah. You can congregate with two inmates, but you got to be of the same color, all right. So he's white, one's black. Guard tells 'em to stop. They don't stop, okay. Guard comes in the yard, and he gonna take them bodily out the yard. All the brothers in the yard, white and black, Puerto Rican, surround the guard, say, "You ain't taking 'em out of here." That started it. Okay. Didn't ignite it then, that we know. But they didn't take 'em out the yard. They closed the yard, meant for us to lock in, end of the day. We locked in, we locked in the cells maybe ten, fifteen minutes. We hear the goon squad coming down the tier, and they go to these two brothers' cell, drag 'em out the cell and take 'em up to HBZ [housing block Z]. We are livid, but we're in our cells individually locked up. Next morning, they let us out for breakfast. Now, 9 Company, which is the company I'm on, is the last company to eat breakfast, because we're on the grading gang, and we don't have jobs. So we're the last--excuse me, we're the last company to go to chow. They let everybody out their cell. We're on the tier, one tier--one flight up. They let everybody out the cell. You line up on the sides, and you march down the tier, down the steps into the hallway to go to the chow line. We do this. It's the same day that we're giving commemoration and memorial to George Jackson in California.
Speaker 1: Now, George Jackson had just been killed in California, right at--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. So everybody, what we do, black armband. If you don't have a black armband, silence. March to the mess hall, down the hall to the mess hall, go in the mess hall. Everybody sits there, don't eat.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was killed in Soledad Prison [sic. San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: George Jackson (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Soledad. They said he had a gun in his Afro (laughter).
Speaker 1: And there was no such thing.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no such, no such, yeah. But the brother was involved with [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis at that time, you know, so. Anyway, so we're silent, you know. Usually, procedure is you go in the mess hall, you pick up a spoon. You go sit at a table, you know, go to the line, get your chow, sit at a table, eat and get up, put your spoon back in there and go. We sit down, nobody's making a sound. Okay, I think we got like ten, fifteen minutes to eat. They knock on the, on the wall, us get up, return our spoons. We did this quietly, and we're walking through, back through the hallways.
Story_ID: 656172
Speaker 1: Now, in Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], they got what they call Time Square. This is where all four blocks converge, and they can lock all areas, okay. We're walking through Time Square. We're walk to the entrance to A block, and we're walking down A block hallway. At the end of the hallway, on this end is the administration building, and it's also the entrance to the stairwell for 9 Company, okay. We're going that way. We notice that they have locked it. As we go through Time Square, we see the gate in front of us is locked, and the gate behind us (claps hands) locks. Suddenly, we see the goon squad running down the hall with what--they got eighteen inch batons. We call 'em nigger sticks. And they're swinging them, beating everybody up in the hall. We say, no, no, no, this is it. We're not going through this. So we fight. We disarm the guards. They run one way (laughter). We don't run after 'em.
Speaker 2: How many of you are there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On, on the company, I think there was like sixteen of us.
Speaker 2: Okay, so sixteen of you and here comes the goon squad, is how many people?
Speaker 1: About fifteen, sixteen, yeah, about fifteen.
Speaker 2: About the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, about the same amount, but, you know, we're prisoners, man, we ain't taking no shit (laughter). So we disarm 'em, and they, you know--but they never--I guess they never expected us to fight back. Anyway, so--
Speaker 2: So why--do you have any idea what they were doing? Why were they--
Speaker 1: They wanted to take us and put us in HBZ [housing block Z].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what their whole intentions was because we rebelled about them taking the two prisoners [Raymond Lamorie and Leroy Dewer] the night before, okay. So after we disarm them, my--I would say, my little group walk into the--we went back upstairs to our cells or the tier. But we're congregating and mingling on the tier itself. We're not in the cells. And we hear, "They have taken over the prison." And we say, "Oh, hell, it's on, okay." So I got about five brothers with me. My whole aspiration is to get to D block to the other brothers because there is Brother Norman and Brother Thomas who are over me. They're ministers. I'm assistant minister, okay. So my intention is to get over to D block and find out what we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are these the same Norman and Thomas we were talking about before?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Norman Butler [Norman 3X Butler; Muhammad Abdul Aziz] and Thomas--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, we was in the same institution--
Speaker 2: --Johnson [Thomas 15X Johnson].
Speaker 1: We was in the same--ended up being in the same institution.
Speaker 2: I did not realize that until the--yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: He got shipped out, Norman got shipped out a little bit after.
Speaker 2: These are the same two brothers who were--
Speaker 1: Accused of killing Malcolm [Malcolm X].
Speaker 2: Everybody says were falsely accused of killing Malcolm. They weren't even there that day.
Speaker 1: No, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 2: But they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) End up doing twenty-five years for something they didn't do.
Speaker 2: Tallmadge Hayer [Talmadge X Hayer], of course, or Thomas Hayer--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --was captured there--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was hired, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was there too, he was there, well he was in Attica, but he wasn't during the riots.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But--
Speaker 2: So, all right, so this is--so what you're saying then too is that it was more going on in the prison than you realized, where you were--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because you all had a confrontation with goon squad, but somebody else apparently (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We found out, yes.
Speaker 2: --had bigger confrontations--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, because they had closed down the metal shop. There was fires, all this stuff, you know. And we--I had no knowledge of it until--
Speaker 2: So do you think the goon squad knew when they came, they confronted you all and locked you all in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I--
Speaker 2: --did they know that the rest of the prison was in a--
Speaker 1: I have no idea.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have no idea. But so--in our running through the institution, I don't, I don't go to D block immediately. I go, you know, I'm running around, and I'm pulling guards out from under beds, cells and everything--
Speaker 2: Guards? Now, what were guards doing under--
Speaker 1: Hiding--
Speaker 2: All right, so they knew that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because the inmates is just running rampant.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, but inmates--brothers running rampant, brothers is knocking guards out and brothers are starting fires, you know.
Story_ID: 656173
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember in the book ['The Brothers of Attica,' Richard X. Clark], you had some interesting little vignettes about the guards [at Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]. I mean, one guy was--I mean they were pleading different, offered (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Offered themselves to me and all this other nonsense, yeah, yeah, yep. But like I said, my intention was never to harm anybody, all right. It was always--I'm not gonna let anybody harm me. But I'm not, you know, I'm not into that, you know. Yeah, you were doing your job. I'm a do mine. And my job ain't to hurt you, you know. At that particular time, I don't know why, but at that particular time, it was to protect them, to keep the other brothers off of them, you know, other inmates off of them. And this is how we ended up being in D yard. I thought--I brought--I think I must have brought three or four guards with my little contingency over to D block. And this is when I found out that the other Muslim brothers had detected and collected the guards, had 'em sitting in a certain area with the Muslims around them to protect them from the other inmates. Okay, I got there. I saw what was going on, and we said, "Well, we need to organize this nonsense," I mean not nonsense but, "We need to organize to let them know that we're civilized and to help ourselves because these people gonna come in here, and they gonna kill us."
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had--so I mean, so what we have here is a spontaneous kind of a uprising--
Speaker 2: That's what it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but no, no--
Speaker 2: No, no perceived--
Speaker 1: --no plan.
Speaker 2: --plan, nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean we knew it was gonna happen, but we never planned for it.
Speaker 1: Not--you didn't know when it was gonna happen, but you thought it would probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--yeah--
Speaker 1: --probably would happen at some point because of--
Speaker 2: It was like we made all the decisions and policies and everything on the run, on the, literally on the run. I'm running around in the institution, trying to save guards and help other brothers and stop brothers from doing this, that, and the other. And at the same time, I'm trying to organize security, same time, I'm trying to find out about the brothers that's hurt, same time, I'm looking at all these guards sitting on the walls with all these guns, and same time, I'm thinking about I ain't never getting home.
Speaker 1: Now, there were guards sitting on the walls with guns, observing this?
Speaker 2: On the walls, yeah, on the walls with guns, administration (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they still have--okay.
Speaker 2: --administration office with guns.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: They got the state troopers and everything there immediately, you know. It wasn't 'til later that the National Guards came in.
Speaker 1: All right, so you got like a perimeter of armed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, on the walls, you know, and--
Speaker 1: --guards.
Speaker 2: And bear in mind that we're now, we're contained in one yard, okay. This is when they had what they call no man's land. Now, bearing in mind, I came from A block. And now, that area is called no man's land, okay. They would not allow anybody in that area except me.
Story_ID: 656174
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just discussing off camera, who's gonna watch this later on. It's gonna be interesting. And I was just thinking, somebody from one of these prisons is gonna see (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, I hope so. I hope something can be learned from it at least.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, all right, so you have--you're originally from A block--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but the D block is where the--
Speaker 2: Where it all went down, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where the hostages or the guards and stuff that had been, and prison employees that had been rounded up [at Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], were, were being protected by--
Speaker 2: Muslims, yeah, in D block, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any other prisons- prisoners other than the Muslims that were concerned about--
Speaker 2: About the hostages?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or guards and stuff that were, had been wandering around 'cause at this point, they're not hostages, right, as such?
Speaker 2: They never were.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: They never--see, that's, that's where it was greatly misconstrued. And I think during the process or during the happenings there, I made it--I said that they were never hostages. They could leave anytime they wanted to, but those people were more afraid of their own people, of the garage- of the guards and the correctional staff than they were of us. And they got 'em on camera saying that we treated them better than their own people treated them. And at the end, their own people were responsible for killing 'em, not us. They tried to say that the inmates--
Speaker 1: Well, let's make sure we get to them. Let's get to the points before we get to the inmates (unclear). So--
Speaker 2: Okay. So our thing was to organize this whole thing.
Speaker 1: Well, who, who--did you gather, who came together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, how that happened was, as I said, I went into, from A block I went to D block. And as I got there, it was like, now, I'm coming from the tunnels, and there's smoke in the tunnels, and fires going on and all kind of craziness. So I come into the yard and it's like coming into a arena. And everybody there, "(Makes sound) Yo, Brother Richard [HistoryMaker Richard X. Clark]." So they say, you know, as far as the organization- organizational factors are concerned, they say, we're going to vote. "We're gonna have a vote, and we're gonna take two brothers from each block to be representative of the inmate population." Now, you gotta bear in mind that it's about fifteen hundred men in that yard, okay, in the yard itself. All right, so through the election process I come up and I'm voted in. Truthfully, I don't want it, really don't, you know, but they're putting this responsibility on me, I gotta do the best I can.
Speaker 1: So that makes you an official leader of this uprising.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, it wasn't through my endeavors or my, you know, my purposes. They did it, okay. And the negotiating committee was created. So--
Speaker 1: So who did it consist of that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, L.D. Barkley [Elliott "L.D." Barkley].
Speaker 1: Now, he was a very vocal--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, younger brother, younger brother, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he--
Speaker 2: Actually, what did L--L.D. had no, L.D. had no political, really, affiliation. I think he was more of a--maybe he was a Panther [Black Panther Party], yeah, 'cause that's one of the groups that we did have there. Jomo [Jomo Joka Omowale], Eric, Eric Thompson; Akil Al-jundi, Herbert Blyden [Herbert X Blyden]; Herbert Scott Dean; James Richey; Roger Champion [sic. Roger Champen]; Frank Smith, Big Black [Frank "Big Black" Smith]; who else, Lawrence Killebrew, oh, there was a lot of other brothers. But those, all of us were, end up being, sitting at the negotiating table, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, up to this point, was any shooting going on?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So the guards, the prison guards who still had guns and stuff, they're all on a wall.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But they were--they didn't shoot anybody?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: They weren't shooting anybody yet?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: It was a kind of a standoff, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah. The only--
Speaker 1: Did the prisoners have guns?
Speaker 2: No, we never had, no--all they had--
Speaker 1: At this point.
Speaker 2: --all they had, or all we had was--well, I never carried a weapon, but all they had was like, makeshift knives, sticks, clubs, no kind of real fire power, none at all. They tried to put us having a flair gun, but we had nothing, you know, except, what the brothers carried in their hands. And they were far beyond guns, okay. We didn't have anything that even projected, you know, any kind of projectile or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We could throw a rock, you know, but that's it.
Story_ID: 656175
Speaker 1: Okay so, you organize yourselves--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --into a committee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we put up, we put up what we called--at first it was thirty-two demands, which dealt with the conditions of the prison and what we wanted immediately, which was to let cameramen in, newspapers, reporters, notable members from different communities. Once they got the cameras in and everything, this is where it became televised. And through our endeavors to get various notables inside the prison, we got Arthur Eve who was an assemblyman up in Buffalo [New York]. He came in. We got other--
Speaker 1: He was the first, right, of the politicians?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he was one of the first ones, yes.
Speaker 1: This is a black politician, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --from Buffalo.
Speaker 2: Assembly--Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve, you know, from Buffalo. He was one of the first. He came in with Russell Oswald with a whole lot of other dignitaries or so called dignitaries from Rochester [New York], Buffalo, Syracuse [New York], New York City [New York, New York]. We had, what is his name, Bobby Seale. Who else? We had a lot of people come in there.
Speaker 1: So they let Bobby Seale come in?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which is interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bobby Seale came in for a hot minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And hurried up and got him outta there. We had a office-
Speaker 1: Did Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] show up?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The messenger [Elijah Muhammad] saw me on TV and said that I was doing a job, and he didn't think that Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]--'cause we requested Minister Farrakhan, he didn't think that Minister Farrakhan needed to come up there, up to Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] because I was doing a good enough job.
Speaker 1: So he didn't--he wasn't there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's funny 'cause I read, I read an article that said he was there. But--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --that's--it's interesting that somebody would write that he was there when you said he didn't--he wasn't there.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't there. He wasn't there. I was sent the message that he saw us, and that he thought that the Muslim contingent was doing a good job, and that was nec- it wasn't necessary for Minister Farrakhan to come up there. But I think it was a little bit different than that. I think that because we were prisoners, that the Nation [Nation of Islam] didn't wanna feel obliged or obligated to the Muslims inside the prison at that time. That's what I feel. But anyway, the administration, this is when the administration established or mandated that they would only deal with one individual, and that individual was me. I don't know why. But I had a--I got a little idea of why, because they were familiar with me, and--or my actions in A block. And I think they was able to ascertain that I was very even keeled and though people said I was racist, they always saw me, you know, they saw me interacting with white people. And I wasn't any--as excitable as a lot of the other brothers, you know. Or, and--I say, or/and, I wasn't intimidated by them like other brothers were because I had to walk up to the gate and listen to them berate me, call me, nigger, this, nigger, that. "We gonna kill you, nigger, we gonna put you in the electric chair." I had to listen to all this, you know, every time I went through that gate. And they telling me, "When you gonna give the institution back to us?" "It ain't my institution to give you." "All right, when you gonna let your hostages go?" "You can come and get 'em now." (Unclear) so, but I was the only one that was doing this. I had to guarantee (scoffs) the safety of every observer that came in that institution. This is where Frank Smith [Frank "Big Black" Smith] came in, Big Black, 'cause I made him the head of security, 'cause I couldn't be around doing everything. And now I knew Big Black, I didn't particularly like Big Black for reasons of, when he was involved in, in the institution. He was on the football team. I didn't play football. I didn't do any sporting play when I was in the institution. I used to exercise, but Frank was, Frank was involved in sporting play. Frank was involved with a whole lot of devious activities that I could not, neither condone nor accept. But I knew Frank. Frank knew me, and I knew if I got his word, that he would do the best he could. So I trusted him by being the head of security, okay. And it worked out good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it, and it worked out good in the sense that we were able to have people come in and get out, not being hurt.
Story_ID: 656176
Speaker 1: So, with, with Frank [Frank "Big Black" Smith], even though I didn't try to condone all his actions, I knew he was a standup guy. And I could trust him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I, you know, I made him head of security.
Speaker 2: You say, Big Black. He's a big guy, I guess?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: And was he like an enforcer for a certain faction in the prison or something or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I would say he basically, wasn't any, with any particular faction. But nobody messed with him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You know, that's why he got the name Big Black 'cause he was big and he's black, but nobody messed with him, you know. And I made him my security because there was a lot going on. We had a lot of people coming in from inside the institution, I mean from the outside to inside. There was a lot of brothers inside that had animosity for reasons unknown to me and for--and maybe unknown to them. Just that they were established people, they wanted to hurt 'em. So for our benefit, the whole population's benefit, we knew that if we hurt these people, they were gonna kill us, outright. That would be just enough reason. So I had to make sure that everybody that came in there--because that was the sort of objective to have people come in to see how we were living, that we weren't just making stuff up. You know, we weren't just fantasizing about the conditions that was going on. And (cough) excuse me, we were trying to deal with it intelligently, you know. Everybody was of the mindset that the men and women inside the institutions are so much savages and all this and that all we're thinking about is escaping, getting out and running rampant in the community. That's not what we're about.
Speaker 2: Well, in your--I know in your book ['The Brothers of Attica,' Richard X. Clark], you state that the guards even were afraid of, of the prisoners because they had created such an image of the prisoners in their mind, of being like, subhuman--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah, we were beasts, you know--
Speaker 2: Beasts.
Speaker 1: --not even beast of burden, but we were just downright beast, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they're afraid the prisoners would do all kind of things to them--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that never took place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, never, never transpired. And unfortunately, most of your prison guards at that time--you have to bear in mind that your population, your prison population at Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], at that particular time, was like 82 percent black and Latino, and the prison population--I mean the prison guard population at that time were all white, all white. And to add injury to it (cough), they were, they weren't from urban areas. They were from the sticks here, you know, from the township of Attica [New York]. You got guys from the Bronx [New York], Brooklyn [New York], Manhattan [New York], you got guys from New York City [New York, New York], you got guys from Buffalo [New York] in the prison that came up in the ghetto that these prison guards had no knowledge of it.
Speaker 2: So they're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They had no knowledge of our vernacular, or our language. They couldn't even communicate with us.
Speaker 2: So they were fundamentally alienated from the people they were supposed to be guarding and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --completely, where they didn't understand 'em, never been around people like them when--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and then there was the other kind that's, felt that their job was to punish us, you know. Now, I mean forget the fact that, you have been punished by the courts, you know. They felt that they just, "I'm here to punish you," yeah, unh-uh. So, you know, we were, we had to deal with that craziness. But we were able to, and I think that's, that's what fooled a lot of people because all the wrong that was perpetrated there wasn't done by the inmates, all right.
Story_ID: 656177
Speaker 1: Let me go back just a little bit, just to get a timeline. So, first, how long were you there before the other inmates [at Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] decided to form a, that organization, to, to talk about demands?
Speaker 2: When I first came, when I--
Speaker 1: No, on the day when the uprising took place? What was the--
Speaker 2: Oh, when I came in the yard--
Speaker 1: You got a uprising going on, and then did you organize by the first day or did it take a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, the first day.
Speaker 2: Within the, within the first two hours--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I would say, or even before then, when everybody started congregating in the yard. I don't know where that came from, but it was a pivotal point for us in the sense that it, again, solidified us and unified us in one endeavor. And at that time, our one expectation was to get killed.
Speaker 1: So this is September the 9th.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did the--
Speaker 2: We went on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when did Arthur Eve show up as the first--
Speaker 2: September the 9th.
Speaker 1: That same day?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: First day, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah. It was like, maybe in a matter of hours before they finally let somebody come in. I think Arthur came in then by his self, okay, and he assured us that we would get the other people that we requested. We didn't know the specific names. We just wanted people to come in. The next day Tom Wicker, he came, Kunstler [William Kunstler] and a lot of--Russell Oswald, you know, I mean Oswald wouldn't come in unless Julian Tepper, all these other dignitaries. He wouldn't come in unless these other people came in because he felt that if he went in by his self, they would kill him, or we would, you know, we would have killed him. So he decided, well, if this man, meaning me, can guarantee these other people's lives, then he can guarantee mines and I'll go in. So they go in, you know. And then we wrote up, through an election process. The election process at that time was, we're all sitting around the negotiating table, and we're yelling different proposals, and our--the vote is carried is by the decimal point or the octave of the voices of the yard, the brothers in the yard, yea or nay. We vote for it or it's not voted for. And this is when we came up with the forty-two, but it ended up being thirty-two, forty-eight ended up being thirty-two demands.
Story_ID: 656178
Speaker 1: So we started with the democratic process of trying to get them to implement, you know, different demands as far as enhance- well, not enhancing, but changing the conditions of the institution [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]. I didn't know at that particular time, but Russell Oswald was saying that, you know, all he could do was so much. We had to take our grievances to the governor who was Nelson D. Rockefeller [Nelson Rockefeller].
Speaker 2: Right, who had just been candidate for president in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Lost the nomination to Richard Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 1: Yep, yep. So, we said, all right, you know. We understood what he was saying as far as the only one that could really do anything about the situation was, was the governor. Our worry was that, again, which is our constant worry, was our lives. And we knew that the National Guards, state troopers and regular corrections officers, their intent was to annihilate us, to come in and level the yard and put the whole matter to rest. Rockefeller was a sneaky guy, sneaky guy because we didn't know it at the time, but what they did with the observers, is the observers left the yard. Now, this is like 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, we're think- we, we, the inmates, think that we're still in a negotiation process. The observers who have been sequestered away into another part of the institution think negotiation process is still going on. They think they're waiting the same way that we think we're waiting for Rockefeller. Unbeknownst to both parties, they lock them up and September the 13th, it's a rainy morning or it was a rainy night. September the 12th, it rained all night. That next morning, September the 13th, I didn't have any sleep. It's about, maybe six o'clock in the morning, the sun is just coming up. It's raining. It's a dismal morning. It's kind of cold. All of a sudden, I hear this roar. I know what it is, 'cause I been in the [U.S.] military. It's a helicopter. And we're sitting down. We got--I think I had just had a cup of coffee. Anyway, I'm squatting down. I hear the roar. I stand straight up, and I'm looking at the top of the wall, and I see the helicopter reach the apex of the wall. Suddenly, I hear all this gunfire (makes sounds). And I'm looking around in the yard, and I'm seeing brothers being hit. I'm seeing, being hit in the head, being hit in the chess, arms, legs, hit all over. I'm wondering why I'm not being hit. I know I'm gonna die, you know, God as my witness, I know I'm a die.
Speaker 2: So they're firing on everybody in the courtyard?
Speaker 1: Indiscriminately, they're just firing down there. But they're telling you--
Speaker 2: The prison employees are there too, right? The guards and the--
Speaker 1: The, the hostages, everybody, and they're just firing away. Simultaneously, with them firing, I don't know it at the time, but they're running down--they're busting in. They're running down the catwalk, shotguns, blasting away. Still the hostages is in there. This is where some of the hostages get killed. They're yelling indiscriminate, "Put your hands on your head, you will not be harmed. Walk to the nearest exit." They're telling you this, but they're still firing in the yard, all right. I'm wondering why I haven't been hit. I put my hands on my head. I walk to the nearest exit. I get to the exit, gotta walk up three steps. You hit the hallway, the corridor, then they, they usher you down three steps, hit you in the knees, in the back, strip all your clothes off you, glasses, watch, everything, throw you in the mud. Okay, this is actually what saved my life, threw me in the mud, then took my glasses, couldn't recognize me, all right. Then I'm in the mud. I must have been in that mud three, four hours, all right.
Speaker 2: So naked in the mud--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for three or four hours.
Speaker 1: Naked, butt naked in the mud, three or four hours, cold. In that three--during that three or four hours, I see them running around the yard, you know, picking up guys, take 'em out the yard, you know, dragging 'em out, whole nine yards. I don't know that they looking for me at that particular time.
Story_ID: 656179
Speaker 1: From laying in the mud, they put me--I still don't think they know who I am. They stand me up, run me through a gauntlet to HBZ. I gotta run up a spiral staircase to the housing block Z, which is segregation. I'm one of the first brothers to be locked up at HBZ.
Speaker 2: So you were--you said a gauntlet like, I mean is it like--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Put the keys down.
Speaker 2: A gauntlet is, consisted of a row, a line of correction officers with batons, and they, you're being--you run through it and they're beating you, with all the power they can. They're just beating you. And you gotta run up this spiral staircase where they're not standing at the spiral staircase, but get up to the top, they beat you 'til you get to the cell. Again, like I said, I was one of the first brothers up there. I was in the first cell. So I was able to see every brother that came up there, all right. So I knew every brother that came up there. And we were the so called, leaders, yeah. They would come, you know, at night, late at night. We're still, we were in the cells--I think we stayed in the cells, those cells, butt naked for like two days before they gave us a blanket or anything, before they even fed us. They would come up and take guys out, out the cell. I later found out that they tried to say that these brothers confronted 'em and they had to kill them or they were killed in the takeover. But I knew the brothers had been in the cell, you know, so. I said before that, I think they would a got me except that Arthur Eve was one of the first individuals that was allowed up to HBZ. And when he came and he saw me that cell, he said, "Brother Richard [HistoryMaker Richard X. Clark], I thought you were dead. They told me you were dead." Said, "No, you see me right here."
Speaker 1: So they intended to kill you, but they--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm. I said, "Arthur, tell my wife [Celeste Baker Clark], my sons [Kevin Clark and Keith Clark], I love 'em, sorry what happened, but I had to do what I had to do." But I think, you know, by him seeing me alive, saved me, you know. We stayed in HB- I, well, I stayed in HBZ until I got out in February. I got out February 9th. Only reason I got out, because as I said to you earlier, I had never been charged with any institutional infractions, okay. Even during the riot they didn't charge me. I got out on my conditional release. I had done two thirds of my sentence. They had to let me go because there was no other charges. I hadn't even been indicted.
Speaker 1: How did they neglect to charge you with something, because, I mean it's not like that they--you're already in prison on trumped up charges.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how did they fail to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was in prison on a charge I took a plea to.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but how they, they--I guess because they felt that they were gonna kill me for one, and I guess through their own negligence, you know, they were so anxious to kill me that they forgot they had to keep me there. And they didn't realize that my conditional release was (claps hands), I mean Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] happened in September, but my conditional release, I stayed in the box 'til February. Now, they could have charged me any time I was up in HBZ. And I thought they would. The closer I got to February, the scareder I became. And I told my attorneys 'cause they would come and visit me. I said, "Listen, man, (mumbles) my conditional release is coming up in a few days man, they ain't telling me nothing, you know. Yeah, what's gonna happen?" They said, "Well, they ain't charged with--don't say nothing. If they ain't charged you with nothing, you out." But when that morning came, and they called me, I left from HBZ, went straight to the airport. My attorneys was downstairs. I left trembling 'cause as soon as I hit the door, they was gonna say something. But they did tell me, they said, "You gonna be indicted. There's a secret indictment gonna be drawn up with you." My attorneys told me don't run, you know. I was thinking about it. To be totally honest with you, I was thinking about absconding, but then I had to think about my wife and my sons, you know. Unfortunately, during the process, my wife died, you know. Ultimately, I was indicated, okay. Ultimately, I had to move up to the, Buffalo [New York] to fight my, you know, to go to trial.
Story_ID: 656180
Speaker 1: Well, was it through your attorneys that you found out how many people were killed during the riot? Maybe--
Speaker 2: Actually, no. How I found out how many people were killed was--I found that out when I was still in HBZ [housing block Z], and how I found out was through the attorneys 'cause the attorneys used to come and visit us on a regular basis. And they told us about how the coroner [John F. Edland] up in Warsaw County [sic. Monroe County, New York] revealed that he had been--or he had been coerced by the state to say that the inmates were responsible for cutting the hostages' throats, and for the deaths that transpired there at Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York].
Speaker 1: Now, were there any throats cut of any hostages?
Speaker 2: No, none of 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of hostages, no. All the hostages were shot by a gun, killed by gunshot wounds.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And we didn't have any guns. So that's how it was being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is a actual lie perpetrated by the--
Speaker 2: State. Yeah, and it was through kismet that the coroner revealed it, you know, revealed the fact that they approached him to try to get him to cover up the gunshot wounds because they didn't wanna show that they killed their own people trying to get to us, man, which was--but, again, that shows you--well, it shows you the nature of the beast.
Speaker 1: So it's forty-three people, I think were killed, and--
Speaker 2: Three inmates, three inmates--well, no, how can I say this? Three inmates had their throats cut. Okay. So they say that three inmates were killed by inmates, all right, which they were.
Speaker 1: Why? What was the--
Speaker 2: Okay, who was it? Perachero [ph.] was one of the guys that got killed. I forget the name of the other two, Palmier [ph.] was another one. But, allegedly, these guys were killed because they were stool pigeons, all right. Other inmates took it upon themselves to cut their throats.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they, so they had that reputation of being stool pigeons before the riots (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, and from what I understand, they were, they were observed trying to give up information while they were in the yard.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so they were trying to sell the other inmates--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Sell us out.
Speaker 1: --for their own--yeah, okay. And so ten guards, I guess, or prison employees were, were killed too by the fire of the state--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, because what transpired was that when they took over the institution, there's what is called a catwalk, which is on top of HBZ [housing block Z]--I mean not HBZ, top of Times Square. If you look at a outlay of the institution, you see the four blocks. And you have four squares, and on top of the four squares, you got a corridor that runs down on top. When they took over the institution, they had a simultaneous assault. They came in on the top of Time Square. They run down that catwalk, shotguns. The hostages was at the end of that catwalk. To get to the inmates, they had to go through the hostages, and they went through them. They literally went through them. The brothers had stood the hostages up in front of them to protect themselves, okay. And the guards, state troopers, National Guards, ran right through 'em, killed the hostages, killed the brothers. That's how the civilian population or civilian personnel got killed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't by us. It was by their own people.
Speaker 1: So in terms of your--so forty-three killed, ten were prison guards, three inmates killed by some of the--the other thirty were, were people that were involved in the uprising, the prisoners involved in the uprising (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.

Speaker 1: So, was your legal defense--was William Kunstler in charge of the defense of the, of the prisoners (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was not, not--well, not--at one particular time, Kunstler was involved in it. But legally, there's always been the--well, there were different heads of--we had Don Jelinek [Donald Jelinek]. We have Haywood Burns [W. Haywood Burns]. We had Gerald Lefcourt [Gerald B. Lefcourt], we had Jonathan Lewbel [sic. Jonathan Gradess]. We had David Lewbel [ph.]. We had Elizabeth Fink. So we've had different attorneys that could be called the head of it, but basically, it's been a contingency of attorneys that, you know, we had Dennis Cunningham, Michael Deutsch, Herman Schwartz. There's been a lot of attorneys involved with Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], but you gotta consider too, that Attica's been going on for years and years.
Speaker 1: So this has been a protracted legal struggle ever since 1971.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the--so, when you were released that February, when you left, you said that they promised they would indict you and they did, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But tell us first about your wife [Celeste Baker Clark]. Did your wife pass away while you were in prison?
Speaker 2: No, she passed away, and I was out.
Speaker 1: How long was it after you were released?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see, I got out in February. She, she died that March.
Speaker 1: So less than a month.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what did your wife pass away from?
Speaker 2: She had a brain tumor, yeah. It was an inoperable brain tumor.
Speaker 1: So she had been sick during the time that you were incarcerated?
Speaker 2: She had--she was always in a lot of pain, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And like I said to you earlier by her working as a neurosurgeon technician, we had availability to specialists, doctors, and, you know, I talked to 'em. She talked to 'em. And it was ascertained that if she had the operation, it would--80, 90 percent, she would be a vegetable, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's nothing, they could really do.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So, okay, in terms of this indictment against you, when did this emerge?
Speaker 2: I got indicted in 1975, yeah, I think I got indicted in 1975.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is like four years later.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So they indict you--
Speaker 2: No, nineteen seventy--two years.
Speaker 1: Two years, okay.
Speaker 2: I got home, I came home February, 1972, I got indicted, I think it was April '75 [1975]. So it was like, two, two and a half years. What I was doing during that time, when my wife passed, I left New York [New York], came down to North Carolina, yeah. I worked for the criminal justice system, even though I have a felony. When I got indicted--
Speaker 1: So who'd you work for, I mean--
Speaker 2: I worked for Greensboro Drug Action Council [Alcohol and Drug Services] and TASC. I don't know if you know, Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime, TASC. What that is, is a subsidiary of the LEAA, which is Law Enforcement Assistance Association [sic. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]. And what they do is offer alternatives to incarceration, you know. If you don't have a major felony, like if you have a--if you're in jail for property crime or something like that, and you got a history of substance abuse, then I would come in. I would screen you and offer you a substance abuse program, inpatient or outpatient, before you go to court. If you complete the program, then I give a good recommendation to the court.
Story_ID: 656182
Speaker 1: So when this indictment came out, well, what were you indicted for?
Speaker 2: I was indicted for thirty-four counts of first degree kidnapping (laughter). That's what I was indicted for.
Speaker 1: And how long did it take to get out of that--
Speaker 2: I went to trial--well, I had to move back up to Buffalo [New York]. I went to trial for three and a half years before they finally cut it loose, dismissed it 'cause they knew I hadn't kidnapped anybody, you know, so they had to cut it loose.
Speaker 1: So you had--you were able to demonstrate that you had not kidnapped anyone and that the--you actually rescued some--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --people.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah, I was responsible for saving a lot of people's lives.
Speaker 1: Did any of the people that--did they testify on your behalf, those who--
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't get to that point, okay. The only individual that had, that was killed--well, let me see. The only individual I spoke with was the daughter [Dee Quinn Miller] of one of the guards, and this guard was one of the youngest guards to get killed at Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]. His name was Michael Smith [sic. William Quinn]. I spoke to his daughter. Michael Smith was a guard who got beat up by other inmates, knocked unconscious. I laid him on a mattress, by the administration door, and told the officers on the other side of the gate to come and get this man. He needed medical attention. They let him lay there for two days. We even went as far as backing up, making the area clear so they could come and drag this man out of the facility. They did not do it. He died. I had to tell his daughter, you know, what had--how her father died, you know. That's the only contact I had with any of the hostages or prison guards (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so the indictment was--you won your case--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --basically, I mean you didn't--
Speaker 2: Attica, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the indictment didn't stick.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: And then--now, there was a--did you sue the state?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--the Attica brothers sued the state. We won a suit of $12 million to distribute--to be distributed, I think it was 134 people. You know, I ended up getting--what I got? I got thirty- $33,000, you know. Some brothers got 30,000, 33,000, some brothers got 60,000, some brothers got 125,000. I think one brother--two brothers got 125,000.
Speaker 1: This is as compensation from the state for what you went through?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from the beatings and, you know, yeah. And Attica was one of the first cases in history that prisoners won a suit, class action suit against any state. But Attica, we won the class action suit against the State of New York, first time in history.
Speaker 1: Now, what did--now, Nelson Rockefeller died in the mid-'70s [1970s]. He had a heart attack, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I think he, yeah, I remember the circumstances, but I'm not gonna--but he, did he ever apologize or anything or--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He didn't even--that was one of the issues. He never even apologized to the correctional staff, to the administrative staff that worked there, you know. And like I said to you earlier also was that because they really, you know, they weren't anything influential. They had no clout, no power. These were blue collar workers, prison- you know--I mean correction officers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 656183

Story_ID: 656184
Speaker 1: I know you, one of the big jobs you had was work- working for Phase Piggy Back [Phase Piggy Back, Inc.], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which is a New York [New York] based--
Speaker 2: Non-profit organization in New York, yeah, basically, run by Muslims.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, Phase Pizzy- Phase Piggy Back is a nonprofit organization in New York, in Harlem [New York, New York] on 145th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. What they basically do is provide (unclear) services to the black community. All right, the founder, Minister Shabazz [Abukarriem Shabazz], started the program, Phase Piggy Back, to feed the community, to mentor the youth in the community. This is where the brother that was charged with killing Malcolm [Malcolm X], Aziz, brother Aziz, Norman Butler [Norman 3X Butler; Muhammad Abdul Aziz], he works for Phase Piggy Back, also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so. And I think Brother Thomas [Thomas 15X Johnson] worked for them, you know, for a little while. But it's a very progressive organization in Harlem.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope--well my sons [Kevin Clark and Keith Clark], first of all. My legacy as far as the prison system is concerned, I hope would be to realize there's always room for improvement, to come to the understanding that the men and women inside of your prisons are human beings, just like you are, you know, and that regardless of the alleged crimes that we have committed, okay. Supposedly, we are paying for these crimes by going to prison, all right. Allow, allow the men and women, when they come out of prison to have a life, all right. What was said about the inalienable rights, our inalienable rights are the pursuant of happiness, and the right to live a dignified life, I hope and pray that somehow, my legacy will manifest some of that.
Story_ID: 656186
Speaker 1: What are some of your concerns about the black community today?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of concerns about the black community, but basically, my aspiration would be that we would be able to unite and stand together like every other minority, every other race, every other creed, to stand together and be unified in your efforts to bring about a change.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The black community, we are divided in our aspirations to bring about a change, you know. If I can't bring it about, I don't want it to come about. I don't think that's the way to be, you know. If I see somebody is trying to bring about a change, and I don't want to, either I should step back or join in until I find my niche.
Story_ID: 656187
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different, a little bit more personal. Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a man who, though not perfect, always strived to do better. That's how I'd like to be remembered, you know. Here was a man that he may not have been correct in a lot of things, but he always kept on trying.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you very much, sir.
