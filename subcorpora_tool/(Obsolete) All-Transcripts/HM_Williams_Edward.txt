Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?

Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, South Carolina--when you lived in North Carolina, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I wouldn't want to live there year round.  It's too hot.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, that's okay.  It's hotter than North Carolina then?
Speaker 2: It's much hotter--
Speaker 1: Okay, hmm.
Speaker 2: --than North Carolina in Charleston, yeah.
Speaker 1: And a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite would be--let me get it right.  Oh, my gosh--it just left me just that quick.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  I hope my hair wasn't all over the place (laughter).  I know that's on tape (laughter).  Is it--
Speaker 2: Oh, you're beautiful.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: If--one that's most, more recent is--that I think about a lot, particularly as I spent so many years in banking.  And people look at me at some kind of oracle--you think you know everything.  But I think, it's what you learn after you think you know it all, is most important.
Story_ID: 209658
Speaker 1: I'd like to start with your mother, Lillian [Watkins Williams]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --if you can talk about her and what you know about her growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was born in Port Gibson, Mississippi.  She was--they grew up on a plantation which we were able to go back and, and find some years later, after they left there, at the plantation there in Mississippi.  But they, like many at that time, picked cotton as they were growing up as children.  She left the South and came to Chicago [Illinois] in the mid-'30s [1930s] and married here in Chicago, and was, was here--lived here ever, ever since.  She has a sister and a brother.  That sister is still alive.  Her brother is deceased, twenty years or so.  But they would talk about life on the, on the plantation, as they call it behind the big house.  And life for them wasn't as difficult as the stereotypical view of blacks growing up in the South, but it was difficult enough.  But I guess the family that they worked for was a bit more benevolent than many that you would hear about it--read about.
Speaker 1: Now, where was it in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: In Port Gibson.
Speaker 1: Port, okay, Port Gibson, you said that.  Now, what was your mother's last name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Watkins.
Speaker 1: Watkins, okay, it wasn't on the form.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I updated the, the form there, too, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  And can you describe her as a person, sir?
Speaker 2: She was one of the most gentle, compassionate, understanding person you'd ever meet.  Everyone just loved her instantly.  She only once do I remember her raising her voice, and that was at my father [Joseph Williams] one time, and it just shocked everybody--him most of all.  But she was--she didn't finish grammar school, but she was able to take care of their, their finances after my father died and run the household.  She was, till the day she died, trying to help others even though she was ill and sick herself.  She was out trying to take food to elderly people, and people who couldn't get out.
Speaker 1: And did she share any stories of her growing up, you know?  You said it wasn't, you know, all the hard times that you hear of, but did she share any stories of her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, one that I remember that it was when they had the floods in Mississippi, where the Mississippi River flooded, and it was over its banks for months.  And they were able to get in a row boat, and get to one of the Indian [Native American] mounds there in the area.  And they lived on top of this mound--dozens of people on this very tip of these mounds there for several weeks until the waters receded, and people--when row boats would come and bring food to them.  And we were able to, when I went back once with her to Mississippi, there was a national park monument there.  And we were going through the little house there where they had photographs.  And she was walked past--she says, "That's us."  And she was able to pick out a photograph they'd taken from the air of them living on this mound there in the--during the flood, and which was, you know, quite exciting, of course, that she was able to, to recognize them there.
Speaker 1: Now, when did she come to Chicago?  And what, what was the, you know, what was the move?  Do you know the date or time?
Speaker 2: The, the time would have been like 1936 to Chicago.  And they first lived on South Michigan [Avenue] on--would be about 3300 South Michigan across from where IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] is today, and lived there for seven or eight years.  And from there to 4728 [South] Prairie [Avenue], and that's where I was born on the third floor at 4728 Prairie above Lang's Bar B Que [Chicago, Illinois].  So I--when I say barbecue is my favorite food, it's because I woke up--the first breath I took was barbecue smoke.  I don't know if you're familiar with Lang's or not, but Mr. [Arthur] Lang lived to be 113 [sic. 115].  And he was purported to be the oldest Chicagoan at the time and he was African American.  And he had this barbecue place there when we moved there in the early '40s [1940s].  And then, the restaurant closed when he died which would have been about 1998 or so.  And it's amazing that a restaurant would have survived that long, but it was that good.  And it was in that same location--just an incredible restaurant.  And he only served barbecue--nothing but, no French fries or anything, just barbecue, yeah.
Story_ID: 209659
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  Can you give his name and--
Speaker 2: He was Joseph Williams.  He was born in Maryland--don't know a lot about his background.  He died when we were relatively young.
Speaker 1: You were fourteen, I think.
Speaker 2: I was fourteen at the time when he died and didn't know his side of the family very much at all.  He, by trade, was a welder.  He worked at a company on the southwest side, Athey Products [Corporation, Chicago, Illinois], but he was--he had a couple years of college.  I remember him talking about it.  He was a World War I [WWI] vet because I remember once he got his [U.S.] military uniform and his medals and what-not and, for some reason, he discarded them.  But I remember seeing them before he discarded them.  But he had worked with James Baldwin--I remember that quite well because he had books and papers from James Baldwin--that they had done some kind of collaboration, early in James' career.  And I don't know the details of that, but I know that these documents were there around the house.
Speaker 1: And you don't know--was he--I mean, 'cause you said he was a welder, and James Baldwin was a writer.
Speaker 2: He was a writer, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you don't know what the nature of the collaboration--
Speaker 2: No, but, my father was very literate.  He wrote--not that he was ever published or anything, but he did some writing himself, but their connection, I don't know.  I didn't realize the significance of it at that time.  And then when I did, then I--of course, it was too late, but I remember him having these, these books and these documents, and just the conversations that I didn't understand--didn't pay much, much attention to it at, at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: He was--I think, a very handsome gentleman when he put on his Sunday clothes.  He was very active in the church and he taught Sunday school and on Sunday as the black community did at that time.  All, you know, it was very proper, but he was very respected--looked up to, people sought him out for his advice, his counsel.  He was able to purchase a small building on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  He knew his death, death was imminent.  He had cancer, and he wanted to make sure that the family was provided for.  He didn't have insurance, so he had this small apartment building at 56th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and that provided the livelihood for our family after he died.  So he was smart enough and able to save enough to do that.
Speaker 1: And how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't answer that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they met here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Met here in Chicago, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 209660
Speaker 1: Let's give your siblings, because you're the second, right?
Speaker 2: I'm the third. I have a sister--
Speaker 1: Helen [Williams]?
Speaker 2: --Helen, who's deceased.  She died in '99 [1999].  George [Williams]--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --who died in '98 [1998], and then myself, and then Michael [Williams] who's born in '44 [1944].  We're two years apart, '40 [1940], '42 [1942], '44 [1944], '46 [1946]--my brothers, and then there's Gene [Eugene Williams] as the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now who was--when you say we moved here from Mississippi, did you actually live in Mississippi (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No--
Speaker 1: No, you--
Speaker 2: --the family.  My mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] did.  I was born here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: --you were born here.  That's right because you were born on South Prairie [Avenue].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 209661
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your earliest memory of growing up.
Speaker 2: Earliest memory would be at 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois].  We lived in a third floor apartment there.  My brother, George [Williams], was there with us for a part of the time, but my mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] was not--we were not--she was not able to keep George there so my--he moved in with my aunt, and so my mother and I and my younger brothers [Michael Williams and Eugene Williams] were there.  But it was just a lot of fun there.  We didn't have very much, but we grew up on the streets, playing in the streets, and in the alleyway behind the building.  We had little odd jobs.  We started working.  We were very young.  We'd go to the Kroger store and pull groceries for shoppers on Saturday.  And we could earn a dime by pulling groceries.  And we could hustle other odd jobs--cleaning up the gas station there on the corner, or taking hangers back to the cleaners for a penny apiece, or going through the alleys, and picking up pop bottles for--you could return those for two cents apiece, or collecting old newspapers and rags because this was right after the war, and the guys would come through the alleys collecting.  They'd buy old newspaper and rags from you for so much a pound and so, we'd collect those and save that just to help support the family.
Story_ID: 209662
Speaker 1: I would like you just to describe the block that you grew up on, you know, just if you could sort of visualize, you know, who was on the block, or what, or things that happened on the block, or neighbors.  I just would like you to describe.
Speaker 2: Well, the block I grew up on was a building of two and three-flat buildings.  Towards 47th Street, then it was a theater.  I don't remember the name of it but it converted to a church in later years.  And then, of course, on 47th Street was where everyone did their shopping.  47th Street was the business district for the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] in the, in the '40s [1940s] and on until the early '50s [1950s].  And so, we never had to leave the neighborhood.  Everything was right there that you could, that you ever thought you'd needed or wanted because you didn't know anything beyond that, but there were kids up and down the street.  We were all running around in little short--everyone wore shorts and knickers in those days with mismatched shoes and t-shirts.  The only person I really remember off the block was Mr. [Arthur] Lang and his wife [Theresa Lang].  They had a big impact on us in the family. He--we were born--we were a tenant in his building on the third floor.  And so, he kind of looked after us there.  To what extent, I don't know, but I just know he was sort of a protector for the family.  The doctor that my mother worked with was Dr. Dumas [ph.].  He was around the corner there on 47th Street.  And I was born in the building on the third--delivered in the building because she waited too long to make it to Provident [Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] to deliver.  And so, I was delivered on the third floor there at 4728 [South] Prairie [Avenue] by Dr. Dumas.
Speaker 1: And let's--do you have a favorite story of Mr. Lang?  And that's L-A-
Speaker 2: L-A-N-G.
Speaker 1: L-A-N-G, L-A, L-A-N-G.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I just--let me, sorry, let me turn--Mr. Lang was a just a hardworking guy.  And I just remember him as being in his restaurant [Lang's Bar B Que, Chicago, Illinois] every day--day in, day out.  He would, he would be there, even when he got too old to work the counter or to do anything, but he would sit there just to make sure that everything went okay.  And no one ever bothered the restaurant.  I mean, there was lots of activity along 47th Street--things that, you know, robberies and what-not, but no one ever bothered Mr. Lang because he was Mr. Lang.  But they also knew that Mr. Lang, under his apron, always had a .38 [handgun] that he tucked in his belt, so no one ever came in to do anything that would disturb his operation.
Story_ID: 209663
Speaker 1: Memories that I have most are from when we moved from 47th Street to 56th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And that was there when I was, oh, about five or six years old.  And then, you know, things began to stick with you a bit more after that then.
Speaker 2: So, you were five or six when you moved, when the family moved to 56th and Michigan, okay.
Speaker 1: To 56th and Michigan--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --yes, yes.
Speaker 2: And what was that community, what is that community called?
Speaker 1: Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Washington, okay.  And what was that community like?
Speaker 1: That was a community of larger buildings that were six-flat buildings, courtyard buildings.  We lived next door to Coppin Chapel, [sic. Coppin Memorial] AME Church [Chicago, Illinois], next to the parsonage there.  That was the building that my father [Joseph Williams] bought before he had died.  And that's where I started school from that location-[William W.] Carter [Elementary] School [Carter School of Excellence] at 57th and Michigan.
Speaker 2: So you only had to walk a block to school then?
Speaker 1: Only a block, oh, yeah, pretty well, yeah.
Story_ID: 209664
Speaker 1: I want you to take you back to that, you know, to that neighborhood [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois].  And I want you to tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up there.
Speaker 2: I remember most fondly the guys that I grew up with--just a, just a, you know, neighborhood gang.  There was Peewee [ph.].  There was Mack--it was Mack Adams [ph.], lived across the street.  There was Randall Wall [ph.] who lived next door to where Cliff [Clifford] Kelley still lives.  He was a part of the, the group, too, at the time--Cliff Kelley.  But there was just this gang of young guys who hung out each day after school and doing boy kinds of things, you know, playing Cowboys and Indians [Native Americans], or making skateboards, or trying to play baseball in the alley, ducking the cars.  We didn't get into very much trouble, you know, minor kinds of things, you know, that kids--we never got arrested or, or got into real trouble--things that your mother would get after you, but never the police would have to track you down for.  We were close to the church.  Our family was very involved with the church there at Coppin [Memorial AME Church, Chicago, Illinois], so we did spend a fair amount of time there and in the church.  My father [Joseph Williams] was a Sunday school teacher there, and so we went the whole nine yards.  You'd go there before Sunday school.  We stayed through Sunday school.  You'd go to church all day, and then they'd have dinner afterwards in the church.  And that was--as long as my father lived, that was the only time we'd ever gone out to dinner together was there at the church.  We'd never go into a restaurant while he was alive--only to the church was our afternoon out.  The--we were active with the--there was a wonderful woman there who had--she was on crutches and they said it was infantile paralysis.  I don't know if that was really what she had.  But anyway, she was Ms. Bayham [ph.].  And Ms. Bayham worked with the children there at the church who--she was musically inclined.  And she was constantly having us in different programs--operatas or different plays or programs.  And she was also a major influence on our life there in the, in the neighborhood because she instilled discipline in us.  You know, we had to be there at the rehearsals at a certain time each evening, three days a week.  And then she made sure we had our homework done.  Otherwise, we couldn't participate in the plays there at the church.  The sights and sounds of the neighborhood--sounds were, were sirens in the night, up and down the street.  The smells were from the Silvercup Bakery.  The Schulze Bakery [Schulze Baking Company, Chicago, Illinois], was there at 55th [Street] and Wentworth [Street]--I guess that was.  They did cinnamon rolls and breads there.  And there were two bakeries--one on 55th [Street] and one on 57th [Street].  If the wind was blowing right, it was phenomenal.  It was just great to smell this fresh baking bread all day long.
Story_ID: 209665
Speaker 1: It was just a wonderful neighborhood [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois].  And the Cub Scouts there, Boy Scouts [of America], the Explorers through the whole bit there, through the scouting experience with Mr. Clarence Crook [ph.] who was the scoutmaster.  And after he died, then Ted Moran [Theodore E. Moran] was the scoutmaster.  Ted Moran was an exec at--was it Sears [Roebuck and Co.]--that's where his daughter, Joyce [Moran], is at--Sears right now.  But Ted Moran was someone we, we looked up to a lot because he was the first successful executive-type person that I'd ever met.  He had, he had an office job and he came to meetings in a shirt and a tie.  And I didn't realize the significance of it at that time, but as I grew older, he was really the first professional person that I met that I realized was a professional besides a doctor or what-not--the dentist that we might have had gone to.  But he was just another wonderful person who had a big impact on my brothers and I as we were growing up.
Speaker 2: Now you're saying he was involved with you with the Scouts--
Speaker 1: With the Scouts.
Speaker 2: --Boy Scouts, okay, so he was a Boy Scout leader?
Speaker 1: He was a Boy Scout leader.  After Mr. Crook died, then Ted Moran took over the troop there at Coppin [Memorial AME Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 209666
Speaker 1: Now, what age were you when you first became a Boy Scout?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I started as a Cub Scout so I guess I would have been about eight or nine, um-hm, beginning my scouting experience.
Speaker 1: And you went how far in the and--
Speaker 2: Up to just--the rank just below Eagle is Life Scout--I believe it was.  And I was two merit badges short of Eagle Scout.  And I, for some reason, just didn't get those two last merit badges, but ended up to Life Scout then.
Speaker 1: What do you think about your scouting experience that you, you know, you remember that was, you know, valuable or, you know, impact?  Was it mainly the interaction with Clarence Crook [ph.] and Ted Moran [Theodore E. Moran], or did you actually go to camp with the Scouts?
Speaker 2: I went to camp a number of times.  The first time was Camp Owasippe [Owasippe Scout Reservation] up in Whitehall, Michigan [sic. Twin Lake, Michigan].  And it was the first time I'd been away from home.  And I got sick and I had a very high fever as I recall.  And the boys--rest of the boys went off on a hike of some kind.  And I was left behind there in the tent.  It was a raised floor tent arrangement.  And I was the only person left back there at the camp.  And I just remember laying there all by myself and hearing animals come through the campsite.  But I was so groggy from the fever, I couldn't get up and do anything.  I just, you know, lay there and, and I don't know if I was shivering from the fever, or from fear of the animals.  But that was my first camping experience--first time away from home.  The other camping experience was when I was being inducted into the Order of the Arrow [OA, National Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America] which was a segment of the, the Boy Scouts.  And there was an initiation that you had to go through, which I think would be probably against the law today.  But part of it was in the evening, as the sun was going down, the boys were loaded up in the back of a truck.  And we were taken out into the woods, and we were given a sheet of paper and one match without anything to light it with, but one match, and one sheet of newspaper.  And we were taken off the truck, one by one, and led off into the woods, and left there.  And then, they'd take another boy off somewhere else and leave him there.  And we were to spend the night in the woods by ourselves with this piece of paper and this one match, and to find our way back to the camp in the morning just to see how we had--how well we learned our survival skills, and our ability to find our direction using the stars and the moss on the side of the trees and what-not.  That was scary.  I was probably twelve years old at the time.  And to spend the night under a tree in, in the woods, and then to wake up the next morning not knowing where the heck you were, and knowing you had to find your way back.  Well, I was fortunate.  It only took me like four or five hours to find my way back to the camp.  But some boys didn't make it back until late into the evening--wandering around.  And then once you find your way back, you were then assigned to dig tree stumps out of the ground which was an awful task.  And you were only fed crackers and water during the day.  But tree stumps, meaning going down into the roots beneath the tree to get the, you know, to uncover the roots, and then chop the roots off to get the stump up under the ground.  What the point of what was, I'll never know what that skill that was to instill in us.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: You know, it's pretty amazing when you hear these stories--only crackers and water--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, (laughter).  Sounds like the chain gang but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, but those, but out of those pro-, you know, one, you got to experience the outdoors, I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a, as a [Chicago, Illinois] city kid?
Speaker 2: Yes, things that we never would have gotten to do, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And just the discipline, people talk a lot about the Scouts--
Story_ID: 209667
Speaker 1: I want to take you back, though to--the elementary school was [William W.] Carter [Elementary School; Carter School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And any--were there any teachers that influenced you that you remember during your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: The one I remember the most is Mrs. Beulah [Louise] Dorsey [Bell].  She was my third grade teacher, and I found out that she's still alive.  She lives down in South Commons at 28th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue].  But she was--she, she encouraged me a lot to do more than what the kids were probably doing at the time.  And through her, I got introduced to the library, to the Hall Branch Library [Chicago, Illinois], and I would go down to the library every Saturday.  I would ride the bus down there or I, or I could walk there sometimes.  You could ride the bus for seven cents at the time.  And I would go there every weekend and check out the maximum number of books out of the library.  And Ms. [Charlemae] Rollins was the head librarian there at the Hall Branch.  She went on to become, you know, quite well-known because of the collection that she assembled there.  But I had devoured almost all of the children's section, entire children's section, at the library there.  And Mrs. Dorsey saw to it that I participated in different activities and programs that were outside the school.  And that--some of which I believed she paid for on her own to to help me and my brothers, too, for that matter.
Story_ID: 209668
Speaker 1: I was asking you about, you know, [William W. Carter] Elementary School [Carter School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] and you were talking about Mrs. Beulah [Louise] Dorsey [Bell].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, and that you got introduced to books and you were reading everything in the library.  And tell me, because I'll go back to your friends in a minute, but tell me about--what about books, what about, that appealed to you and, and why did you like reading so much?
Speaker 2: Well, it was taking me off into a different, different world.  I got involved with the different series of books, you know, like 'The Black Stallion' [Walter Farley].  There was a series of those about the West and other series.  And before television, of course, we did have a radio which was just phenomenal to sit and listen to the radio with your family.  But it was introducing me to things that, that we didn't know anything about and it was just fascinating.  And I would--wanted to make sure that I read all of my books before I had to return them to the library.  And so, my father [Joseph Williams] would come in and tell us to turn off the light and go to sleep, but I would be under the cover, under the blanket with my Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] flashlight, still reading my books to--because I just enjoyed them so much.  I can't, I can't tell you why I was so fascinated with them other than, you know, the, the way it just introduced me to new things.
Speaker 1: And the--was there any one that you had that was favorite?  Was it 'The Black Stallion'?
Speaker 2: 'The Black Stallion' series--I enjoyed the, the most--the horses.  And, and through that, my brother, George [Williams] and I, we learned how to ride, living there at [East] 56th [Street] and [South] Michigan [Avenue].  There was a stable in Chicago [Illinois].  At that time, there were bridle paths throughout the Chicago Park District parks.  And there was a stable on--it would have been [East] 48th [Street] and [South] St. Lawrence.  And we would walk over there and rent a horse out of the stable there, and we'd ride through the park, Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], at the time.  This would have been in the, in the early '50s [1950s].  So for a dollar, you could rent a horse for an hour and go in the bridle paths.  And then we outgrew that.  And we went out to the Dan Ryan Woods [Chicago, Illinois] to rent horses and ride through the forest preserve.  And we had almost talked my mother in allowing us to buy a horse because you could keep horses at that time in your garage in the city.  It was still legal.  And there was a big double garage next door which, at one point, had been a stable.  And we were trying to save our money to buy a horse to keep here in the city.  And, and my--one of my first regular jobs was on a milk truck--milk wagon, rather, which was pulled by a horse.  And, and then I did that every morning before I went to school.  The milkman would come and pick me up, and I'd go on the wagon before school, and he would have me run these half-gallon jugs up to the third floor.  And I was probably like six or seven years old at--no, seven or eight (unclear), seven or eight years old at the time.  And the horse--I'd run back and jump on the wagon.  And the horse--when he was feeling the motion of you getting back on the wagon, then the horse will start automatically and go to the next stop and stop.  And then you'd run the milk up and get back.  He'd feel the wagon shake, and he'd go to the next stop.  But he let me, you know, act like I was driving the, the horse and feed the horse.  And so, I just loved horses at that time then.
Speaker 1: And what, what made, what, what--you said, you almost got the horse, so what happened?  Your mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] caboched it?
Speaker 2: My mother, yeah, she, she wised up at the--we might have been able to buy the horse--save enough, but to be able to--the upkeep.  And she had enough mouths to feed.  She wasn't going to take on a horse, so.

Speaker 1: Which of your brothers were you most--you were closest to?  I assume Helen [Williams] did--was, had left the--
Speaker 2: She left the brood at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My--I was closest to the--George [Williams], my oldest brother.  He was now living out with my aunt in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] on 111th Street.  And I would go out there from [East] 56th Street--would ride a street car, bus, and a bus to get to where George was living.  And I'd go out there on a Friday evening.  And he had a paper route that he delivered, the [Chicago] Herald American, and we would deliver the papers that evening.  And then, Saturday, we'd go and collect.  We had to go behind each week and collect the small amount of money from the customers.  And then we would go--after we finished collecting, we'd go to the movies at the State Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] there on 111th [Street] and [South] Michigan [Avenue].  This was a routine every Saturday.  We'd go to the State Theatre, and then we'd stop at the White Castle there on 111th and, and State, and have some of those five-cent hamburgers at White Castle, and then go back and, and collect from his customers again.  But that was a routine every Saturday.  I'd make this long trek out to Morgan Park which was, at that time, just kind of wide open spaces.  You would have--this was in Chicago [Illinois], of course, but you would have pheasants going across the lawn.  You would--could always see snakes across the sidewalk or rabbits.  And the local store, it's called Filmore's Grocery [ph.], had the sawdust on the, on the floor that they used at the time to keep the, the dust there.  And he kept pigs in the--behind the store.  And oftentimes, the pigs would come inside the grocery store.  And this is, this is now in the early '50s [1950s], mind you.  And I remember that very well and, and enjoyed going out there because he'd--we'd be awakened by roosters on the, on the block there which was just, you know, from living where we were at 56th and Michigan, there were no livestock.  But, you know, you ride a streetcar, a bus, and a bus, and you were, you know, amongst chickens and hogs, and no cows.  But, you know you're--it's like being in the middle of a farm somewhere--and this is Chicago still.
Speaker 1: You know who talked about that was Senator [HistoryMaker Emil] Jones [Jr.].  He talked about growing up in Morgan Park and how it was very rural.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you don't think of Chicago like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 209670
Speaker 1: Let's also have you talk about some other memories of, you know, family times and sort of growing up--any other things that, you know, in terms of sort of a typical day or holidays, you know, that you remember or, you know, any other events.
Speaker 2: Well, holidays for us were mostly the--and Thanksgiving and Christmas with the big dinners and big.  And they were relatively small, but big for us, because we had a very small apartment that we lived in.  But they were fun times because the family would get together.  And once in a while, there would be a friend of the family that would come by, and the house would be hot and steamy because the kitchen was going full blast, all the burners going, and the apartment was heated by radiators.  Half the time, it just, just--all the windows would steam up and, and you couldn't see out.  But you--it, you know, all these people there, and it, just the sounds and sights and the smells, and this hot, steamy apartment.  But we could just hardly wait until all the, you know, the great foods were put on the table.  And you would eat--the adults would be the table and, and the kids would be scattered around the room because the table wasn't large enough to hold everyone.  And you'd be eating off of your lap, or off a tray of some kind, or sitting on the floor.  But it didn't make any difference because that was, you know, that was just the greatest thing.  And then, we would, like most evenings, but when we had large groups together, just sitting there listening to the radio after dinner with 'The Shadow' and 'The Green Hornet' and 'Fibber McGee and Molly,' and the others where you could--you had to use your imagination, of course, listening to the radio.  And that was just some of the greatest times, I think, just with, with the family, unlike what we see today.  But we would sit that for three or four hours--the family just listening and talking about the radio.  And since we didn't have other experiences that they could share with us, like I try to do with my children, we would talk about what we were hearing and understanding on the radio.  Because my father [Joseph Williams] was a welder, and he didn't have things that he--or my mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] was a domestic, she cleaned houses in, in Glencoe [Illinois] and Wilmette [Illinois], and so, we talked about, you know, things that we heard on the radio.
Speaker 1: That was a coming together?
Speaker 2: That was a coming together--sitting on, the boys sitting on the floor, and my father and mother in a chair.  And we just, you know with--with an arm on their knee, just listening to the radio, and just imagining, you know, the scenes or where the people were that were the actors on the radio.
Story_ID: 209671
Speaker 1: Your friends--you were saying that, you know, you lived in a small apartment, but there were some that, you know, had the whole floor.  They had the whole apartment.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And will you talk about, you know, who they were.  You were mentioning one, you know, earlier.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, we lived in this building which was a kitchenette building.  But my father [Joseph Williams] had taken one whole side and put a door there, and so we occupied one whole side.  It was still chopped up because there were like three kitchenette units on the side.  It was never converted back to an apartment, but we had our private space, but it was really kind of convoluted.  But I--we had a, a friend, Randall [ph.] Waugh, W-A-U-G-H--lived at 57th [Street] and [South] Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] on the second floor.  And they had the most beautiful home, and it was just a flat in a six-flat building but they had carpet.  They had a dining room with a table with six or eight chairs around it.  They had a living room with, with plastic stuff covering the sofa.  His father was--worked on a beer truck as I recall.  I don't know if he was a driver or a helper.  And his mother was a school teacher.  And so, apparently, they made enough to afford this gorgeous apartment that they lived in.  And Randall and his sister were there.  And we loved going over there because it was like going into another world--just, just phenomenal.  And, and it's around that, that we began to realize that there's something beyond, you know, listening to the radio and reading the books.  And then Randall and his family, there's something beyond what, what we were experiencing.  Of course, we never felt sorry for ourselves, because we were never hungry.  And we would always--we never had a bad day, but we just realized that there was other things out there.
Story_ID: 209672
Speaker 1: My father [Joseph Williams] would take me with him, at one point--when you go shopping, he would go to Goldblatt's downtown [Chicago, Illinois].  There was a--Goldblatt's had a grocery store in its basement when it was on South State Street.  It was a Hillman's [Food Store].  Hillman's was in the basement of the Goldblatt's department store.  And we would ride the "L" [elevated train] downtown and he would do the shopping, and that was phenomenal.  And we didn't do anything except the store and right back, but then I realized that there's, there's really something really, really different out there when we would do that, and he would--did, he did all the shopping.  I don't know why that was, but he did the shopping, and I was made a part of that expedition.
Speaker 2: Well, can you talk about him and the store because it was--it had everything, right?
Speaker 1: It was, as I said, down in the basement there and you didn't have carts, the shopping carts that they have today.  And so, he would go up and down the aisles to get the groceries.  And then he would come back and put them--and I was to watch the groceries that he was assembling.  He'd stack up them there somehow or another, and I would stand guard over the groceries until he got ready to check out.  And then, we'd get these shopping bags and get back on the "L" and go home.  But that was just a great experience.  And, and through that travelling when he became ill, and even after he died, then I was at about nine years old or so.  But when he became ill with cancer, then I was expected to go and handle the family business, like for the building that we had--when there was a vacant apartment, it was rented through putting an ad in the Chicago Defender newspaper.  And then I would hop a jitney cab on Indiana [Avenue] and ride the jitney down to 35th Street, and take the ad up to a little window there in the Defender office, and put the ad in and get the change and bring it back.  In those days, you could send a child out across town and not worry about them.  You can't do that today.  But that was a part of my responsibility to go off and take care of the Defender.  I had to go and pay the light bill or the gas bill for my parents.  And they would, you know, give me instructions as to where to go and then that became part of my routine periodically or once a month.
Story_ID: 209673
Speaker 1: Now, what was the young Ed [HistoryMaker Edward J.] Williams like?  What were you?  Were you quiet?  Were you rambunctious? Were you know, a loner?  I mean, you know, were you gregarious?  I mean, what were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--I think, quiet.  I think I've been quiet all of my life but I like to participate in activities, and with friends.  I'm not a loner, but I am often not the first one to speak.  I--we always liked to have fun to do things as a group.  I was probably more studious than most of my playmates.  If grades were any indication of that, I think that would be the case because all through [William W. Carter] Elementary School [Carter School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois], I was always on the honor roll.  Every, every marking period, I was on, on the honor roll with the comments from the principal, Ms. [Chesna C.] Weisberg, or whoever the homeroom teacher was.  So that was always something I was--I strived for at that time with perfect attendance at school.  And even through high school, when I began to be a bit more active in doing things that--with--I was--became friends with a couple of guys.  I became very close friends with two guys who were the most popular guys in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois].  And they allowed me to hang out with them which was just a real thrill.  It was Fred Dupree [ph.] and Fred Van Metre [ph.], and they were really popular with everybody, with the teachers, with the girls, with the athletes.  And they treated me just like I was, you know, one of them, which I never understood but it was genuine.  And so, we just had a lot of fun together with--so I began to go to the different dances and the parties and the skating parties and, you know, and just began, began experience a different part of growing up through them.
Speaker 1: Were you, were you an internal child at all?  I mean, did you live sort of inside yourself, or did you dream of what you wanted to be or, you know?  I mean, in the books that you read, were there things that you were, you know, thinking that you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I internalized a lot.  When I was sixteen, I had the beginnings of an ulcer.  And the doctor--he more than treating me, he spoke with me and said, "You know, you can turn this around because you're internalizing things too much.  It's stress that's doing--what you're thinking--whatever you're thinking, too much."  And I learned early on after that experience how to deal with issues which helped me throughout my whole life as to how to take things serious that were to be taken serious, but be able to set them aside appropriately.
Story_ID: 209674
Speaker 1: What was actually happening in your head, I was asking, you know, did you dream, or what did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, dream--well, I wanted to be a foreign news correspondent.  Now, I can't tell you exactly why, but that was what I fantasized about because it would take me far away.  It would allow me to write which I enjoy doing, writing and reading, and it was just, you know, just one of those way-out kinds of things that children often dream of--not a fireman, not a policeman, but a foreign news correspondent.  And I carried that with me for I don't know six or seven years as to what I was working towards.  And it finally left, but, but that was the first thing ever I thought I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Did you--was there a foreign news correspondent that you wanted to emulate or be, or do you know why that even came?
Speaker 2: I don't know why because that was a part of my thinking even before there was the television in our home.  And so, you know, you begin to realize there is such a thing as a correspondent.  But then, I don't know if I heard on the radio or read in one of my books.  But that's something I'd picked up and something that I fantasized about, and I knew that's what I wanted to me when I grew up.
Speaker 1: So you, the thought--you were very well aware of the world outside you then or wanting to in some, some respects.
Speaker 2: In some respects.
Speaker 1: Were you, okay, were you reading newspapers a lot at that time?
Speaker 2: I started reading the newspapers at, at that time through the activities with the Boy Scouts [of America].  I was asked to participate in different things, like at the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] department store was a job I--I got a job.  But I was selected to be the president of South Side department store for a day through by Boy Scout involvements, and in high school as I was a sophomore, I was asked by the Urban League to give a talk to other students.  And I had my picture in the newspaper and the whole bit--
Story_ID: 209675
Speaker 1: Through my involvement at the church through Sunday school, I was selected to represent the church in a Bible study contest on television.  And we prepped for that for several months and, and had this contest which was televised, and I won that contest.  And so, I was being introduced to other things through my involvement with the church and through Boy Scouts [of America], and through others who had supported me.
Speaker 2: Like what denomination was your church?
Speaker 1: A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 2: It was A.M.E., okay, so what was was--it was a--
Speaker 1: Coppin Chapel--
Speaker 2: Coppin [Memorial AME Church, Chicago, Illinois], okay, Coppin, I mean--
Speaker 1: --African Methodist Episcopal church, yes.
Speaker 2: --okay, sure, sure.  And were you influenced, would you say you were influenced by the A.M.E. tradition?
Speaker 1: I loved the church.  I realized that there were differences in churches.  There was a young lady that I started dating as an early teen and she was Catholic.  And there was a major difference between the church I went to, and the church she went to.  And I enjoyed my church better (laughter), because Catholic churches were even more traditional in those days.  And then on a corner from us at 55th [Street] and [South] Indiana [Avenue], there was what they call a Sanctified Church [Original Church of God].  And I realized there was a big difference between the A.M.E. church and the Sanctified church.  And I realized that I was somewhere in the middle at A.M.E. between the Catholics and the Sanctifieds.  You know, our services were lively, but the Sancti--, they were rambunctious at the (laughter) at the Sanctified church.  And the Catholic church were--they were very, very conservative and to an extreme.  But there's wonderful people there at the church.  As I said earlier, we were next door to the church, so we were there at the church a lot.  And it was a very much a part of our lives and, you know, we would be at all day Sunday, of course, and the different evening events, whether it was Bible study or, or working with Ms. Bayham [ph.] with the programs and operettas that she worked with us on or the scouting activities.  So, a lot evolved around the church.  And I can't say that I was or am very religious but we were active in the church.
Speaker 2: Do you remember who the minister was at the time--his name?
Speaker 1: The minister was Reverend [J.L.] Roberts.  And then, it was Reverend--he went on to be a bishop.  And then, Russell [S.] Brown went on to be a bishop.  I'm missing one.  Rev. [S.S.] Morris [Jr.]--they all went on to be bishops.  And, apparently, that was where, you know, they move you through the--it wasn't, what is, you know--through the church hierarchy.  And apparently there was one of the larger churches, and that was kind of the launching pad or stepping stone for ministers to go on to be elevated to bishop.  And so, we had a number of pastors that came through there at that time.
Story_ID: 209676
Speaker 1: Were there ever instances where people questioned whether you were black growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, all the time--not in the neighborhood so much where we lived, but whenever I went out of the neighborhood, that was always an issue.  But because we grew up in this tight little circle, people knew my family and they knew my brothers and whatnot, so they just assumed correctly that I was black.  But when I started working at the bank--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to go that far ahead--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I'm still in the earlier years.
Speaker 2: Earlier stages, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't recall experiences that I had as growing up because I was always with friends or brothers, or in the neighborhood where people knew the family.  So I do not have earlier experiences of people questioning me, or who I was or my background.  I don't have those, those recollections.
Speaker 1: And no, no, untoward comments towards you or anything--nothing like that?
Speaker 2: Nothing towards me personally or individually, you know, you--we would have the kinds of problems you'd have growing up with bullies and things like that.  But I never perceived that I was being singled out any more than anyone else at that--the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were you aware of your--of a color difference?  Were you aware in that way as a child?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I wasn't aware of it until I was well into high school.  It was just never, never an issue.  And my mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] and I were the same complexion.  My brothers were fair-skinned--they were brown, but fair-skinned. My father [Joseph Williams] was dark-skinned.  But it was just this hue of people.  And so I guess--no, I was never conscious of it, never made conscious of it by anyone until, you know, you became older which was great--unusual, but great.
Story_ID: 209677
Speaker 1: Next door to us [in Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois] was a couple, Dr. and Mrs. Mathias [ph.].  He was a physician, and she was a school teacher, and they owned the six-flat building next to us.  Now, what was significant about this was their building was all flats.  It wasn't a kitchenette building.  It wasn't chopped up into small units.  And they were very nice people.  I was never in their home, but she would invite us to her back porch across the fence there.  And, you know, she would treat us to lemonade and things like that.  But the Waughs were the first family where we realized that it was a difference in economics.  But they, you know, didn't make us sit on the doorstep or anything like that, we'd go in and be part of the family (laughter)--
Story_ID: 209678
Speaker 1: Do you know much about your--where the Asian heritage comes from?
Speaker 2: It's from my mother's [Lillian Watkins Williams] father, my grandfather, because as you know in throughout the South and in the West, Chinese were brought over as laborers, and, you know, suffered the same economic status as the blacks did at the time.  So it was from that side of the family that--and it just came out a bit stronger in me than it did in my brothers.
Speaker 1: Did your mother, did she know that, that would have been her father, father or grand-, your grand-, let's see--
Speaker 2: Her, her father--
Speaker 1: Her father--
Speaker 2: My grandfather, yes.
Speaker 1: --right, your grandfather.  Did she talk much about him?
Speaker 2: No, not much at all, because he died when she was three.  And so, she didn't know much about him at all, so just other than things that she might have heard from her sister, who is like four years older than her.  So, you know, not much history there at, at all.
Speaker 1: And what about that history though, in terms of Asian labor--I mean, Chinese laborers?  Can you talk a little more about it?   Do you know much about that?
Speaker 2: Not much--
Speaker 1: You say, as you know but--
Speaker 2: Well, I say, as you know, I know you know.  But, but it's--as I've gotten older, I find myself being brought into a different world.  And I'm allowing it to happen.  I probably resisted it early on because I didn't understand it, but I have become very active in the Asian community today.  And I've gotten in last year, I think six awards from different Asian groups because of things I've done in that community.  And it is--it's something I'm very comfortable with now.  It was something that I denied early in my life, or ignored--I shouldn't say, just ignored, like it wasn't there except when someone would bring it up.  But now, it's something that I do.  And so, I pay attention now to things that are Asian, Chinese.  And I have not done any study, but I have read that the Chinese were brought over as coolies to work on the farms and plantations as cooks, as laborers on the railroads.  They were very active in building the railroads going West and really lived the same life as the blacks did at the time.
Speaker 1: And do you know--so your mother had--because she was so young, so it doesn't really, you don't know much of that whole--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you know, of that, or even where your family may have been from.
Story_ID: 209679
Speaker 1: Let me ask--your father [Joseph Williams] passing away, what do you--he had been sick how long?
Speaker 2: He had been diagnosed with cancer about twelve years before he died, and it was in his leg.  It was in his leg, and he was told that if you let us amputate your leg, we can solve the problem, but he said, "No."  And so, he would go back out to [Edward] Hines [Jr. Veterans Administration] Hospital [Hines, Illinois] once a year or so, and they would take more, you know, cut more out, and, finally, it started working its way into his upper body, and then he died in 1956.  I remember the night, because my mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] was at the hospital.  And my brothers and I were sitting out on the back porch.  It was a summer evening and it was dark and the stars were very bright, and we were just sitting there silently on the second floor porch.  And then the phone rang and my mother said that he passed.  And, uh-hum, we wanted to go up to the hospital.  We couldn't because it was at Hines in Maywood, Illinois [sic.], Hines Hospital.  And he was a veteran, so he had a veteran's burial.  And we--he had bought a car a year before he died--a 1956 Chevrolet Nomad station wagon.  We never owned a car, but he wanted to have a car before he died.  And so he bought this car and, you know, we would go out riding in this beautiful car that we--all of a sudden, you know, I don't know where he got the money.  But we got this 1956 Chevrolet Nomad, blue, and it was turquoise and white.  And when he died, though, we had to sell the car to pay some of the bills because it just, you know, he had no insurance.  But the car went when he went.  But he received a soldier's burial, and they covered the costs--a good part of the cost of that.  And we stayed there at [East] 56th [Street] and [South] Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] where we're living for a bit longer until my mother decided to sell that building.  And then she bought a smaller property further south on the 700 block on 92nd, 700 East 92nd Street.  But he--there were several things I recall.  He was trying to do, before he died--one was to get the car, and the other was to go home, back to Maryland to see his family.  He went by himself.  And I remember that he went and got lots of small bills, dollar bills.  And he wrapped a fifty or a hundred around these wad of bills that he had in his pocket when he went back home.  So it looked like he had a lot of money, where really he probably had $120, but it looked it like a lot more than that because of the way he wrapped this large bill around these singles or five's, whatever they were.  I never will forget that.  But, apparently, he did what he wanted to do and before he died: he provided for the family with this kitchenette building, and he got this car and he enjoyed this car before he died, and he went back home and played big-shot, and then he died shortly thereafter.
Speaker 1: Now, so really, your father, he was sick for most of your growing up--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in many ways if he had suffered with cancer for twelve, you know, for twelve years--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 209680
Speaker 1: Do you remember his [Williams' father, Joseph Williams] death and what impact it had on the family?
Speaker 2: I remember the events leading up to his death because for--I can't recall how many months.  But for months before he died, he was home and with my mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] looking after him.  And he was in great pain.  And I do remember at night when we were trying to fall asleep, you could hear him moan in pain.  That was very, you know--that's indelible.  And so, we had months of, of that with him at home, dying at home of cancer, and my mother trying to see after him, and also going--trying to keep her job because she was housekeeper for two families up in the North Shore [Illinois], and then coming back to see about the boys.  So it was a bit of a strain--not a bit, it was quite a strain on the family at the time when he became very ill.  And you could, you know--the odor of the cancer, you know, it was very noticeable and that someone was dying.
Speaker 1: And so when, so do you think your mother was prepared for it?  I mean, since she had such a large because she has, you know, three boys, right--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --at this point that she's still raising.  And so, what do you think?  She went through her own sort of turmoil or was she prepared at that point because she--
Speaker 2: As I recall, she was prepared.  She didn't break down.  She just, you know, she took care of what needed to be done.  She made the decisions about the funeral, the burial, what we had to do.  We had to sell the car [Chevrolet Nomad station wagon].  We had to do different things to get the bills paid and make sure that the family was able to stay together.  But I don't remember her going off and, you know, into a corner or breaking down or even crying very much.  It was something we all were prepared for.  We knew what was going to happen but, you know, when it happens, it, you know, it's still at the rush of it all.  But she was very strong throughout this entire process as she was through everything that was ever thrown at her.
Story_ID: 209681
Speaker 1: --when did you move to the 700 block of [East] 92nd Street [Chicago, Illinois], East 92nd, were you, 'cause you were fourteen when your father [Joseph Williams] passed away?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We moved there very shortly after that because I was--I guess, a sophomore or so in high school, because I was going back and forth to Englewood [High School; Englewood Technical Prep Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So I was--I guess around sixteen or seventeen when we moved out to 92nd Street.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to junior high?
Speaker 2: I started at Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: But isn't--Tilden Tech is a high school?
Speaker 2: It's a high school.
Speaker 1: So, too, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I did two years at Tilden, and then transferred to Englewood for my last two years.
Speaker 1: And Tilden at that time was it--it was more white, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: It was mostly white.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was 90 some percent white and but I went there with a couple of my friends.  And there were--we weren't the first black kids there, but they were maybe a couple of classes ahead of us.  But I do remember that after school, we got the hell out of the neighborhood real quick.  Then we went straight to the bus line, got on the bus, and got out, and you didn't, you know, walk around the neighborhood.  You didn't go to the--during lunch, you didn't go out to the local restaurant to get your lunch.  You ate lunch in the school.  You didn't roam around the neighborhood pretty much--not, you didn't do it at all.  But I wanted to go to Tilden because it was--they call it Tilden Technical High School.  They have shop classes and what-not and that's what I wanted to do, and was a part of the ROTC [sic. JROTC, Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps] there.  I think that was where Bill Dunbar [ph.]--I don't know if you've run across him, for? Anyway, he was, he was there before me and he was an officer in the ROTC.  He was African American.  But I decided that the school was--that I couldn't do another two years there--that I'd hear about from some of my friends the experience they're having at Englewood High School.  So I transferred over there for my last two years.  And that's where I met Fred Van Metre [ph.] and, and [Fred] Dupree [ph.] and, you know, life (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Life really opened up.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And life (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You were popular.  But you don't know why--because, you know, that's what I'm trying to get a sense of.  You say, you know, you liked the books.  You know, I mean, you were--you knew you were a quiet person.  Yet, you're hanging out with the two most popular guys in school.
Speaker 2: Well, the--I can't explain it, Julieanna [Richardson], and the--growing up in elementary school [William W. Carter Elementary School; Carter School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] and in the neighborhood [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois], I always had a lot of close friends.  And I don't know why, but we just were close--kind of good close friends in, in high school and college even, too, the same situation.  The athletes, you know, I just--athletes, I hung around them.  They, you know, I was a part, I wasn't an ath-, I was not a football player or basketball player, but I was always with them--a part of them.  And I was just always a part of a group of things that were going on--the activities.  But I never considered myself outgoing or a leader so much in those days.  But when I pledged for the [Kappa Alpha Psi] Fraternity, I was made dog number one.  So, I led the line and it was, you know, after that though, that I began to really be a leader in different things.  But those are things I never sought out.  They were just kind of opportunities kind of put there.  And I fortunately recognized them for what they were when they were there and took advantage of them.

Speaker 1: Now, what was Englewood [High School; Englewood Technical Prep Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] at the time--Englewood like at the time?
Speaker 2: Englewood was probably as much black as Tilden [Technical High School; Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] was white.  It was--I guess, known as a party school at the time, and--as opposed to Hyde Park [High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], Hyde Park was our archrival for basketball and football, and Hyde Park was a studious school and Englewood was a party school, and there were gangs; there were factions; there were cliques.  There were all of that.  I remember Mr. Williams [ph.]--I don't remember his first name, but he was a tall, thin fellow.  He was assistant principal.  He was the disciplinarian.  I remember him always coming around, breaking up groups, and making, you know, clearing the hallways and things.  But there was often trouble at the school--fights and--but nothing where people were really hurt, but just fist fights and things like that.  But it was a lot of fun.  It was just, it was great.  We didn't have drugs as part of the school at the time, but there were gangs and there were other rivalries, but nothing where people were really injured as they are being today.
Speaker 1: Are there other names that we would recognize that were in school with you at the same time, because there were three black high schools--Englewood, DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois], and--
Speaker 2: Wendell Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Phillips, Wendell Phillips, uh-hm.
Speaker 2: --Wendell Phillips, yeah, and, you know, Dunbar [Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] came along a bit, a bit later.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: But in high school or elementary school, probably not.
Story_ID: 209683
Speaker 1: --Now I know that you said, you know, "I was thinking I wanted to be a," you know, "a foreign correspondent."  You also--but are, what are--are there any favorite subjects of yours during that time, and were you still maintaining to be a good student, or was social taking over?
Speaker 2: No, I was still a good student even through high school and on into college.  I enjoyed math an awful lot.  Math was one of my favorite subjects, as well as English.  History, not so much, and geography, but math and English and writing, which is something that I have enjoyed an awfully lot still.  But, in fact, I remember in college in my English 101 class, I did a term paper on slavery in the South, and Mr. Richardson [ph.] was instructor.  And he, when he returned my paper, and I still have it at home, it said, "A-plus pending proof of authorship."  I had to prove to him that I hadn't plagiarized the paper.
Speaker 1: This is at Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: At Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 209684
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and how you got there because there was someone who made that possible.
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the numerous jobs I had growing up was with Charles Chisholm who owned several newspaper distributorships, and I started working with him when I was in elementary school at [William W.] Carter [Elementary] School [Carter School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] as a delivery boy.  And my father [Joseph Williams], at that time, had passed, and so, he became somewhat of a surrogate father for me--became somewhat close to him and his wife.  And I worked for him for, you know, eight or nine years in different routes.  He was a graduate of Clark, and he was a football player there in the, in the '20s [1920s].  And he had sponsored a number of athletes from Chicago [Illinois] to Clark--basketball and football athletes.  And I was able to get a scholarship to Clark through Mr. Chisholm.  And it was the only scholarship I had.  So it was easy enough for me to make the decision to go and not that I, you know, wanted to go anywhere else because it was a chance to be away at a residential college full time, four-year college, and a place that I knew I would enjoy, there in Atlanta [Georgia].  And it was just a--it was a wonderful experience, and but it was through his help that I was able to get the scholarship and the job on campus to help, you know, pay the rest of the tuition.
Speaker 1: So that's really your first time outside of Chicago in many--I mean, except for camp [Camp Owasippe; Owasippe Scout Reservation, Twin Lake, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Except for camp, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 209685
Speaker 1: Had your mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] ever taken you back to Mississippi during any of those years?
Speaker 2: Only after I finished college.
Speaker 1: Only after, okay, so this is really your first time in the South?
Speaker 2: First time in the--well, I--not the first time in the South.  My aunt and uncle, they--my aunt who raised my brother, George [Williams]--she and her husband, before he died, would take vacations back to the South.  And on two occasions, they took George and me on the trips to Mississippi.  And I remember--they, they drove down, of course.  We were driving and we had to stop to get gas, and I ran into the washroom.  And my brother, George was--came beating on the door, "Come out, come out, come out, come out."  And he was getting, you know, to get me out of there because I'd gone into the wrong washroom.  I'd gone into the white washroom, and I didn't realize, but he was scared, you know, to that.  I guess as he should have been--as I should have been that, you know, something could happen to us.  But we went on down, and I remember staying on this farm with the--they call it shotgun houses, these straight-through houses, and with the newspaper as wall paper on the walls and what-not.  And it's the first time we'd ever been really around chickens other than we heard out in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].  But the chickens for us were something to play with, and George will be on one side of the house and I'm the other, and I'd throw him chickens across the house to him.  And they told us that they had chickens with broken wings and broken legs for months after we, we left there.  So my experience--that was my first experience in the South to take these two trips with my aunt and uncle and to back to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So, now did you go to Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]--had you been there before you actually went to attend, or did you arrive at the campus, sight unseen?
Speaker 2: I had gone the year prior to enrolling there where Mr. [Charles] Chisholm took a bunch of us down on a tour of the campus--the athletes and, and myself.  We went down and spent two nights there so I had some idea of what it was like before I got there.
Speaker 1: And what did you find it to be like, because, culturally, it's much different?
Speaker 2: It was, it was quite different.  It was a phenomenal experience.  My roommate was from Fort Valley, Georgia.  And it was his first time being in a big city himself, and so here I am from Chicago.  He's from Fort Valley.  He's in a big city.  I'm in a smaller city.  And we're trying to, you know, bring our lives together there for the next however long we're going to be together--is Wallace Rump [ph.].  And he was a football player in high school, but he decided not to pursue that at, at Clark.  He was a math major.  And he was tall and dark, and had two gold teeth, which was all the rage at that time.  That was, you know, and the adornments--instead of tattoos, there were gold teeth--were the adornments of the day.  But we got along just fine.  It was--Clark was affiliated with the Methodist church, and so there was chapel, ten o'clock every morning.  We had to go to chapel.  There, I, as I said, was very much part of the athletes on campus which meant that I, you know, yeah, was around a lot of fun, a lot of activity.  It--my grades were pretty good there.
Story_ID: 209686
Speaker 1: At the time, there was Ben Brown who went on to be the Democratic--was he deputy Democratic national chairman?
Speaker 2: Ben Brown--
Speaker 1: Ben Brown, Benjamin Brown.
Speaker 2: --Benjamin Brown, okay.
Speaker 1: He was, he was the deputy Democratic National Committee [DNC] chair.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: James Felder, who went on to be a congressman in South Carolina--the world got to know him because he was a part of the honor guard for President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy when his body lay in state in the [Capitol] Rotunda [Washington, D.C.].  He was--he was right there, front and center.  And [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was there at, at that time.  [HistoryMaker] Marvin [S.] Arrington [Sr.], who went on to be the most prominent black attorney, was a president of the Atlanta City Council [Atlanta, Georgia] for twenty-two years.  We pledged [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] together.  A number of others, the Long family that--Carolyn [Long Banks] and Wilma Long were part of the city council there.  Bronner--I forget her first name, the hair care products.
Speaker 2: Arthur [E. Bronner, Sr.], is that--well, I forget, you mean, the mother's name--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --or the daughter?
Speaker 1: --the, the daughter, beautiful young lady.  But her family owned that, that business [Bronner Bros.].  So it was, you know, a good, great group of folk there at that time.
Speaker 2: Did you experience at all any about the black society, you know, because had--I'm just trying to understand because some, you know, there is a hierarchy on the--especially on the HBCU campuses [historically black colleges and universities].  Was, was that a factor at all?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it--I became aware of somewhat of a pecking order on the campus.  It was at the Long family's.  Ralph Long had two daughters, and it was obvious that Mr. Long was kind of at the top of the heap there, and at least at the Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] side of the campus complex.  He was not an official of the college, but it was obvious that he carried a lot of influence, that he was a go-to person for anything that happened there, before anything happened on the campus.  I became aware of in the city itself much more than I would have experienced in Chicago [Illinois] that there were distinctions amongst in the black community; that there were different levels that people circulated in.
Speaker 2: And how did you become aware of that? Because this is a world outside of what you've experienced.
Speaker 1: I--through the interaction with the students, the--with the Bronner family and, and other students who were economically better off than some of the others.  They had things that the other students didn't.  They had cars.  They had better clothes.  They had vacations they talked about, you know, they just did things differently.  They had trips, and they rode airplanes, rather than the Greyhound bus, and they just did things that the rest of us only thought about.
Story_ID: 209687
Speaker 1: Now, did you enter as a math maj--what was your major and what were you thinking at that time?  I know you were good in math in high school and I know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I entered as a business major, yes.
Speaker 1: You did?  Okay, that's right.  And that's what you, okay, that's right, that's right.  You got your business degree, okay.  And now, how long were you--you attended Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] from what years to what year but--
Speaker 2: I was there for two years--
Speaker 1: Two years, okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I dropped out.  I got married, and then I worked for several years.  And I later enrolled at Roosevelt and finished at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was really getting married that made you drop out?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  How did your family feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, they never criticized it.  I know that they were disappointed.  My mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] was very disappointed that I didn't finish there because she could see that that was a good experience for me, and it was working financially; we were able to piece it together. So she was disappointed, but she never said it.  But I know that she was that I didn't finish there--
Story_ID: 209688
Speaker 1: You got married.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your wife's name at the time--
Speaker 2: It was Elizabeth [ph.], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Elizabeth, okay.  And so, you decide, okay, you're going to drop out [of Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and do you come back to Chicago [Illinois] at that time?
Speaker 2: Come back to Chicago, and we came back--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where was she from?  She--
Speaker 2: She was from Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So we came back to Chicago, and we had a daughter at that time.  And she had started a singing career.  She was with a small group of, of women who were singing and they had done one, one record together.  And it was--I had started working at a supermarket as a clerk there initially.  And I was asked by Mr. [Charles] Chisholm if I would consider going into the newspaper distributorship business.
Speaker 1: So Mr. Chisholm came back into motion?
Speaker 2: He came back into my life at that point.  The Chicago Tribune had--well, the city is divided up into different franchise areas for home delivery of the newspapers, and these areas are bought and owned by individuals.  And there was an area on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] that they could not get anyone to buy.  And so, he asked me if I was interested.  And I said, I'm interested, but that doesn't mean anything because I can't buy anything.  So, he and the Tribune arranged for me to buy it, even though at that time, I was only twenty years old, so I wasn't old enough to sign, but the Tribune Company [Tribune Media Company, Chicago, Illinois] guaranteed the note at the bank.  I borrowed six thousand dollars to buy this franchise.  That's how bad they wanted some fool to go over there and run this franchise on the West Side for them--
Story_ID: 209689
Speaker 1: So I bought the [Chicago Tribune] franchise, and I got my younger brother, Michael [Williams], after a while to come in and work with me over, you know, with the Tribune franchise.  And so, we had a territory, which was from about 400 North to about 700 South, with Pulaski [Road] being the center part, but from about Central Park [Avenue] west over to about Kostner [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  That was my territory.  And I had the rights to deliver the home delivery Tribune in that area.  This was now in the very early '60s [1960s].  And the drug trafficking is really beginning to heat up.  And I had eighteen or nineteen boys working for me as carriers that time.  And our--the Tribune--the objective was to, by having someone own it, to be able to increase the number of subscribers.  And so, we had to solicit home residents to subscribe to the newspaper.  And so, we were quite successful at that--from taking it from, you know, several hundred newspapers to several thousand newspapers being delivered, because that's how you make your money.  If, you know, you made so much for each paper that was delivered and sold, that's how the boys make their money.  Anyway, had nineteen young men--eighteen or nineteen young men working for me.  And they would come into the office there every morning there about 5:30 to pick up their papers, deliver their papers, and go to school.  And then they would come in the afternoon on Wednesdays to start their collection process.  Again, they delivered the papers, and you had to collect the money on a weekly basis.  Even though it was a dollar and twenty cents, you had to collect it weekly because you couldn't let the bill amount because it would be beyond the reach of people to pay it.  So the boys would go out and collect every week.  And it was our routine, my brother and I, to go back over there in the afternoon to, sort of like ride shotgun on the boys because they were constantly being robbed or beat up by the drug addicts who knew, if they saw a boy walking in and out of a building, in one building into the next, in and out, into the next, that he was a paper boy out collecting for his deliveries.  And they would be, you know, pounced on and robbed. And so, we would go back in the afternoons to be on the street, so the boys could see us.  And they could turn in their money and they could continue, and just for them to know that we were out there.  And that's when, my brother and I, we were carrying guns at the time ourselves because it was really what you had to do over there to survive.
Story_ID: 209690
Speaker 1: Decided to get out of the [newspaper distribution] business and sell it [Chicago Tribune franchise] after a young man was hurt.  The boys earned, by the number of papers they delivered, how well they collected their money, and the--having the fewest number of complaints.  You get certain, you know, amount of money for it, you know, achieving each, each of those.  There was this fellow who was the oldest of the boys.  He was like eighteen or nineteen years old, but he had two artificial legs below the knee.  He, he walked on, on two wooden legs.  But he wanted the largest route that I could give him because he needed to make as much money as he could to help his mother take care of his brothers and sisters.  And so, he had the largest route.  He did the best in his collecting.  He always collected, you know, 80, 90 percent of his money each, each week.  He was never late, never missed a day, got very few complaints--papers not being delivered or wet.  One evening, when he was out collecting, he was jumped on in a hallway there on [South] Independence Boulevard [Chicago, Illinois].  And there was a man with a hatchet who was going to rob him.  And he wrestled with this guy--he had very strong upper body strength.  And he wrestled with this guy in this hallway and was able to get the hatchet away without being hurt too badly, but he did have to go to the hospital.  And so, it was shortly after that, that I made the decision that this was not a way for me to make a living off the backs of these boys because there was nothing we could do to prevent what was happening to them.  And while, by then, you know, it was a very decent living, we were now making, we decided to get out of it.  And when I told the Tribune, they tried to talk us out of it, but we had made up our minds, and they bought it back from me.  And they were not able to sell it to anyone else.  What they had to do was to go to each block, and if a mother had several boys, then they would pay her to be in charge of that block.  So it was a messy arrangement, but that was the only way they could get the newspapers delivered in the community at that time after we sold it.
Story_ID: 209691
Speaker 1: Now, how had Mr. [Charles] Chisholm, how had he found out about this opportunity and--
Speaker 2: Well, he was contacted by the circulation manager for the [Chicago] Tribune.  Mr. Chisholm, by then, had owned five or six different areas, both for the [Chicago] Sun-Times, the Tribune--
Speaker 1: So he was also a newspaper dis-?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that, okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's--'cause I started working for him when I was in elementary school [William W. Carter Elementary School; Carter School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --through his franchise.  But he became quite successful in his business, and he owned franchises for three different newspapers.  And so he was, you know, as far as in the black community, he was the go-to person.  And so, he was asked if he knew of anyone and he recommended me for the opportunity.
Speaker 1: And you--I mean, you're very young, and it's not you've run something before.  Did you have him to rely on to counsel and advise?  Or, you know, was it--I mean, how did--because you said we grew it from a couple of hundred to two, you know, to a thou-, a couple of thousand--
Speaker 2: Couple of thousand, yeah.
Speaker 1: --thousand, right.  And so, I'm just wondering why the success there.
Speaker 2: Well, the success was because I worked for a successful person.  And I worked for him for eight or nine years and I just watched and observed.  And he had me in the office there doing things there as I got older to assist.  And so, I--not that I was being tutored for anything, but I was just working there and, and I just observed and absorbed what was going on, and I wouldn't say it was easy, because it wasn't, but we worked hard at it and we were able to make a go of it--
Story_ID: 209692
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the gangs that were coming into, you know, a stronghold there on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, there were the Vice Lords [Almighty Vice Lord Nation], the [Spanish] Cobras, the--there was a black, a faction of the Black P. Stone Nation [Blackstone Rangers].  But the Vice Lords and the Cobras were the two largest there on the West Side at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I also wanted to know who was the political stronghold over there on the West Side at that time?  And were you--the area that you were in, what area was it actually called?  Is there a name?
Speaker 2: It's--that will be West Garfield [Park, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: West Garfield, okay--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --okay.  But who, who were--was there a--oh, God, what am I?  Oh, I'm drawing a blank--
Speaker 2: I would guess at that time, there was probably a white leadership still in the community because I don't think they got a black alderman until several years after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, [HistoryMaker] Earlean Collins' father [Charlie Branch], he wasn't in power then?  I mean, he was an alderman or a--I think he was.  No, he was--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --he'd been a state, okay, state rep [sic.].
Speaker 2: --he, he was a state, a state rep.
Speaker 1: Was he a state, state rep then?
Speaker 2: I think he was a state rep, at that time, which there were several at that, that time.  But on the West side, I don't believe they were strong political figures.  There were strong community leaders at that time.
Speaker 1: And who were they?
Speaker 2: Well, [HistoryMaker] Danny [K.] Davis was a community leader--he was a community health leader at that time.  There was a fellow, Garland Guice, who headed up an organization, Chicago Economic Development Corporation, was a strong leader.  The lady who died recently--they named a street after her--
Speaker 1: Ar-, not the one, Arse-, no.
Speaker 2: No.  She was--
Speaker 1: Artinson [ph.] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, no, she was with the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, gosh, I could picture her, but I can't think.  Anyway, there was, she was the strongest, the strongest leader at that time.  She died--well, see, about twelve years ago. And there is a street named after her over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 209693
Speaker 1: Can you describe the difference, you know, because here in Chicago [Illinois], you hear South Side [Chicago, Illinois], West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  You had grown up on the South Side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what was--had you, had you had much exposure going up to the culture of the West Side, and was there a difference?
Speaker 2: None whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, can you talk about--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --because it's so stark.  I mean, you don't hear so much now, but when I first came here, that's all you would, you know, hear.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the West--the South Side was comfortable.  It was home.  It was--it looked better.  It felt better.  The West Side was harsher.  The West Side had already, at that time, wide-open spaces where buildings were--had been burned and torn down through urban renewal.  The West Side had a horrible reputation for its gangs and its drug problems.  And it was a place to, really, have a lot of respect for, if not downright fear.  And so, it was difficult going over there, not knowing the neighborhood, the streets, and not knowing anybody over there, and just being, you know, just a long ways from home, and in a business [Chicago Tribune distribution franchise] where, you know, you could really get hurt.  We were very apprehensive at first, but it was a way to earn a better living and so, we did it.  We did--we had a shotgun in the kneehole desk and we carried revolvers whenever we were out in the street.   And we were actually not told directly, but the police, as much as said that, you know, "If you want to exist over here, you've gotta kinda take care of yourself so much."  So that once in a while, we would catch one of these guys who would rob our boys.  And there was a policeman there; his name was Glove [James "Gloves" Davis] because he always wore two leather gloves.  And he told us that, "If you really want to help the situation, have your boys," you know, "greet one of these guys one day before you call us."  And so, he was not telling us directly, but saying that the courts aren't doing very much for these guys, and there's no deterrent for them.  So he's saying, let your boys have at them, and we'll fill out the report to take care of it.  So what he would say--that we'd catch one of these guys, and we had this garage that we rented, and we'd have our boys come in and have a field day with these guys.  And we'd call the police.  The police would come and arrest them and in the report, they said he tried to escape and because, you know, explain the bruises on the guy.  So it was a different kind of life over there.  We were shot at, and we shot back.  There was one day outside the office--we heard a commotion.  It was about one o'clock on Saturday.  And we went out to see what was going on.  It was a crowd of kids there on [South] Springfield Avenue.  And as we got closer, we could see two boys in the middle of this group.  And they were back to back.  And they both had guns, and someone on the side started counting, and they counted ten paces and they stepped them off.  They turned.  They shot back down the street at each other.  They both missed, but when they shot, everyone ran like hell and they scattered.  And I'm not saying that happened every day but--and it was just different.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have to use your gun--you and your--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 1: Did you and your brother [Michael Williams]--did, did you ever have to use your gun ever?
Speaker 2: We did once.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was someone over on [West] Independence [Street], where they robbed one of our boys.  And he started running, and he started shooting at us, and we, we shot back.  We didn't hit him, thank God, but we did shoot back.
Story_ID: 209694
Speaker 1: Now, you said that the [Chicago] Tribune secured the [newspaper distribution] business with the six thousand dollar loan.  I mean, how much were--did you, did you actually end up making money--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and was it, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We had--we made a decent living, you know.  It was a couple of hundred dollars a week--we were making apiece there.  And we had serviced the loan.  We paid the loan down to half-way down with the couple of years that we were there.  But then, we sold it back to them for the amount that we owed on the loan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you and your brother [Michael Williams] decide, okay, this is it.  We're out of here.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And then, what is the decision?  Is that when you go back to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] or not?
Speaker 2: Well, I went back to Roosevelt after I started working at the bank.
Speaker 1: Bank, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But after I sold the Tribune franchise, I didn't work for four or five months because it was--just had to--my hair had started turning gray at the time--just because, it's 365 days a year.  And you're getting up at three o'clock every day going to the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], putting the papers up for the boys.  You're there until nine o'clock to get the complaints.  We'd go home to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and do whatever errands we had to do and what, and then we'd go back to the West Side.  And so, this is every day, every day for two years.  And it's hard.  And then, when you're dealing with the--trying to protect the boys, it, you know, it took a toll on us.  It was, you know, it was time for us to get out.  And so, it--several months before I felt I could go out and look for a job.  And so, I--after a bit, tried to figure out how to get a job.  I was going to different companies downtown, just filling out applications, and someone referred me to the Supreme Life Insurance Company [of America].  They were on [East] 35th [Street] and [South] Indiana [Avenue].  And I had gotten a chance to meet with Earl B. Dickerson who was the chairman there.  And I believe the referral was through--because he was a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity].  I had pledged with a fraternity at Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and I was a Kappa.  And so, I had the meeting with him.  And he had the personnel person give me the employment test.  And he called me back a bit later and said that I had scored extremely high on the test, and that he wished that he could offer me a position.  But there was nothing that they had there that he felt was appropriate.  But he went on and on about the test that I had done and so forth.  He says, "But there's a lender downtown that we work with at a savings and loan that's looking to hire their first Negro."   And he said, "Which I'd like to send you down."  So I went down to this S&L [savings and loan] and met with the person he sent me to, and I filled out the application, took a test.  Two days later, they called me back to come back down and take another test of sorts.  And then about two weeks later, he called me back down and said, "[HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] Ed, we'd like to offer you a job, but we decided not to because we wanted to hire someone who was more typical."  And so, that was kinda like the beginning of it--where if they were going to hire their first Negro, they wanted to get credit for it.  By hiring me, it wasn't going to happen.  And so, I was turned down because I wasn't typical.  But, anyway, that was okay.  It got me to thinking about--okay, they're banks.  They're these kind of places.  And so, then I started filling out applications at banks--the Continental [Illinois National] Bank [and Trust Co., Chicago, Illinois], Harris [Trust & Savings] Bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], and the others.  And the Continental Bank was the first one to call me with the position in 1963.  And that's where I started my career downtown.
Story_ID: 209695
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three [1963], this is, right?  And I want to ask about Earl B. Dickerson and his--what his stature was, you know, within the Chicago [Illinois] community at that time.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And then, I want, you know, ask about Continental [Illinois National] Bank [and Trust Co., Chicago, Illinois].  But what was his, you know, what was his stature and what do you think his contact with the white--overall the white community was?
Speaker 2: Well, he was--everyone and most people knew who he was because this is one of the most prestigious black-owned businesses in the city.  He was in the community and it was--the company was very active in the city and the community, and he had somewhat of a national prominence even before he came back to Chicago to run the insurance company from his legal work.  Also, he was very well-respected.  And when he said, "You're going go down and talk to Earl," then I knew who he was, and I was very excited about that.  So, he was the man in the city.  And, you know, Supreme [Life Insurance Company of America], of course, being just one of several black-owned companies of note at that--there were some on the make, but that was one that was still probably the oldest and most established of its kind and time.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite Earl B. Dickerson story at all?
Speaker 2: Not, not really--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I had just that brief contact with him, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had that brief encounter, okay.
Story_ID: 209696
Speaker 1: So, now, at Continental [Illinois National Bank and Trust Co., Chicago, Illinois]--describe Continental. And, who were the main banks in, you know, in the downtown area at the time when you started?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there were two main banks.  And that was the First National Bank of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and the Continental Bank.  And they were way out in front of the other banks, you know.  There was the two of them at the lead.  And far back was the Harris [Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] and the Northern Trust [Co., Chicago, Illinois], and then below them were other smaller banks.  And so, the Continental was the larger of the two at the time and the most prominent bank nationally.  But they called me to take a position in their trust securities department--it's a trust area.  And it was as a clerk in this caged-in area where I filed maturity ticklers all day long.  I was up and down this ladder.  It was like any old shoe stores that have these ladders that ran around the wall.  You may not remember that, but they had shoes from floor to ceiling, and this ladder was on wheels, on rollers.  And so, I was up and down this ladder all day long filing these maturity ticklers, and this was taking place while I was getting my security clearance because the--on the floor were bearer securities, you know, billions of dollars' worth of bearer bonds.  And so, I was locked up in this chain-link fence area in the middle of the floor while they're doing security clearance, and security clearance, at that time, was more than the fingerprinting that they do today and the credit check and what-not.  And I don't know if it was for everyone, but anyway, for me, it, in addition to the regular stuff, it consisted of a private investigator going out to the neighborhood where I lived on [East] 92nd Street--going to the neighbors with a photograph, saying, "Do you know this young man?" you know, "what do you think of him and his reputation?" and so forth.  So they check your, you know, your character--back in among people who knew you.  But before I got out of the cage there, the--Harris called me about three or four months later, and offered me a position as a teller.  And so, I left there and went over to the Harris for about thirteen dollars a month more.  I got a raise out of it, too, for like $3400 a year.  I started at the Harris.
Speaker 1: And at the Harris, though, you started as a teller, right?
Speaker 2: As a teller.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were you their first black teller?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and as far I know at the time when I started there in 1964, there were just two other black employees at the bank.  One was Millie [ph.], she was a cleaning lady.  And the other is--was a Sharon Eggleston [ph.] who was a telephone operator.  But there were no black tellers at the time.
Speaker 1: And at that time, even down--there probably were very few blacks in corporate.  It's not in--
Speaker 2: Anywhere--
Speaker 1: --anywhere downtown.
Speaker 2: --anywhere downtown--
Speaker 1: --to anywhere downtown.
Speaker 2: --anywhere, yes.
Speaker 1: In the department stores and--right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very, very few.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was only after I started there that, that, you know, blacks began to be hired into various clerical positions.  At the bank, I recall Cecil Coleman [ph.] being hired about a year and a half after I started there.  And he was then given a position in the new accounts area which was out front.  So there were two, or one depending on how I was viewed at the time because many people didn't know unless they knew me personally--they didn't know.  And I know they didn't know because of some of the things that they said around me.  But it was later in my career, I asked the person who hired me--he was in the personnel area, who was by then working for me--asked him if he knew if I was black at the time he hired me.  And he said, "Oh, of course, I did."  And I have never, to this day, known if he was telling the truth or not, but he said, "Of course, I knew.  And I was," you know, "wanted to--we'll give you a chance," and so forth and so on.  But I was never really sure if he actually knew or if he just thought I was Asian and, you know, would be okay to do that, or if he was really breaking, you know, some precedent there.
Story_ID: 209697
Speaker 1: You were a teller [at Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] for how many years--for two, was it?
Speaker 2: For about three years altogether.
Speaker 1: Three years, okay.  And what are the things--you didn't, you know, you say, in something I read, that it wasn't until later that you understood really what banks did, you know, but you were, you know, basically, collecting money.  But I'm trying to understand what you were learning about the bank culture and, and at that time, you know, or about the business community at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, early on, I didn't understand what the banking business was all about.  I just knew that my role was to receive deposits and cash checks, but had no idea what happened to the money once it left my drawer and went up into the bank.  And I knew that there were other parts of the bank, even though I never visited them because if we were out of balance, we had to call someone.  And you'd talk to someone in a different floor, or if there were issues going on and someone would call you, but we weren't, as tellers--we were never exposed to any other part of the bank.  And what I got to know at that time were that there were lots of different positions that people had because my customers, we would talk.  And I got to know about things that other people were doing.  This was, again, my first real exposure to the business world--
Story_ID: 209698
Speaker 1: We were talking about--you know, I was saying, what was happening in the community [Chicago, Illinois] because maybe people in the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] didn't know.  But what was, what does your hiring represent in the community?  And also, when did you start getting involved in activities in the community?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, I--for a year or so within the bank, I was just trying to, you know, maintain my position there.  I also had a part-time job because the bank wasn't paying me enough to take care of the--my daughter and, and family, so I worked part-time in the evening at a grocery store.  But shortly after I started at the bank, I was asked by one of my customers if I would consider volunteering at an organization that he was executive director of a non-profit called Talent Assistance Program, TAP, at 19 South LaSalle [Street].  And he assumed, if you work for a bank, you must know something about banking and finance which I really didn't, I really didn't, but I did work there.  And I agreed after a while to volunteer with that organization as advisor to some of their small business clients.  And so, that was my first experience outside the bank into the community, other than the kinds of things I'd done when I was in the Boy Scouts [of America], you know, with the Urban League or the, you know, other activities that were around the church.  But as far as volunteering, that was a first foray into that, yeah.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about TAP and what, you know, what the program did, and who was in charge of it and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--I think Roscoe Mitchell [Jr.] was the person in charge of it.  And it was funded by a government agency to identify potential black entrepreneurs, and to help them put together a business plan to help them find financing, and to get them started in business.  And they were there at 19 South LaSalle.  And they had people who just walked in off the street, or otherwise referred to them for assistance.  And then, they found or recruited people--the business community to work with them, to mentor them.  And, then TAP would help them put together their business plan and what, what their accounts, that they had on staff there.  My first assignment was with [Sidney Barnes, Jr.] Sid Barnes.  And Sid Barnes was a part--he was a lead singer, male lead singer, with the Rotary Connection, which was--Minnie Riperton--as the group was winding down.  And Sid wanted to go off and, you know, do his own thing--continuing in the business.  He had become successful, aside from the Rotary Connection, in doing radio and television commercials.  The Jewel[-Osco] Food Store commercial was his.  And Fun Town [Chicago, Illinois] out on [East] 95th Street used to be an amusement park out there and he was the voice behind the commercials.  But he wanted to start his own production company over here on [East] 18th [Street] or [East] 19th [Street] and [South] Calumet [Avenue].  And so, I started working with him.  And so, I was maybe like two pages ahead of him in the book because I would try and get information I could, you know, pass through me, back to him to help him put together his business plan.
Story_ID: 209699
Speaker 1: Anyway, [Sidney Barnes, Jr.] he needed money, like everyone needed starting up a business.  And I was just coming out of the teller area at the time, by then.  And I had no lending authority--didn't know anyone as a loan officer.  But I had gotten to meet one of the senior vice presidents whose checks I used to cash as a teller.  And I explained to him how I'd gotten involved, and this person I was working with, and the stage where we were--where this man now needed money to take his production business and get it going.  So he says, "Okay, [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] Ed."  And I don't know why he said he'd do this, but anyway, he did.  We got in a cab, went out to [East] 19th [Street] and [South] Calumet [Avenue] [sic. 1900 South Calumet Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  He met Sid.  They talked about stuff that--I didn't understand what they were talking about.  But he, you know, he was a senior vice president of the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  We got in a cab going on our way back to the bank.  And he says, "What do you think we should do, Ed?"  I said, "Well, I think we should make the loan."  So he says, "What the hell, let's do it."  He made the loan.  And so, Sid got the money he needed to get the records pressed.  The records were then shipped back to his studio.  And he'd gotten the radio to start playing the records that he had cut and for the people he'd signed.  And then, there was a strike, and he couldn't get the records.  I forget now.  He couldn't get the records to the stores.  So, they were being aired on the radio, but they couldn't get delivered to the distribution points.  And so, by the time the strike was over, the music had run its course, and because people couldn't buy it, and the DJs are going on to something else.  And so, the strike lasted, you know, a month and a half or so because he couldn't get it.  Anyway, long story short--he couldn't pay back the loan.  And it didn't break my career though, and they didn't hold that against me.  It didn't hurt me at all.  But that was my first loan at the bank--was--this is it, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, what I find amazing about that--one, you're dealing with the senior vice president at the time, and getting him to go on a car over to look at--was that typical of Harris?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I mean, so how did that--you had the chutzpah enough to ask or I'm--
Speaker 1: I didn't know any different--
Speaker 2: You didn't know any different?
Speaker 1: --didn't know any different.  And I got myself involved with this organization [Talent Assistance Program (TAP)] with this individual.  And I was supposed to be his advocate and so, I had to deliver, or do the best that I could.  And so I tried to carry out that commitment.
Story_ID: 209700
Speaker 1: At this point in time in the banking industry, was there a lot of community involvement, period, or was it something that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no--
Speaker 1: --that's--okay.  I want you--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --I'm trying to get you to put things in--okay.
Speaker 2: There was very little.  This was early in my career.  Later in my career, I was asked to join the bank's foundation, its philanthropic arm.  And at the time, there were like five or six charities that were contributed to.  And the one that was closest to the community was the Salvation Army.  Otherwise, it was the Field Museum [of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois], the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and so forth.  But that was as close as not only the Harris [Trust & Savings] Bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], but any of the corporations got to the community: through the Salvation Army.  And the volunteer work that they would have done would have been on the boards of those major cultural and civic institutions, but really not anything into the community as we would think about it today--nothing whatsoever.  And so I liked to think that it was through my early involvements that the Harris Bank did become aware of the community beyond the downtown area or beyond the North Shore [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you involved with TAP [Talent Assistance Program]?
Speaker 2: I was with them for two or three years.  And then, I started doing some volunteer work with CEDCO, the Chicago Economic Development Corporation which, you know, they spun an awful lot of leaders out of that organization.
Story_ID: 209701
Speaker 1: Now, when you got involved with CEDCO [Chicago Economic Development Corporation], who was, and why--first did you come to be involved with CEDCO?  And if you could, just talk a little bit about--it as an org--you know, how it even came to be because it was federally funded, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was federally funded.  They were located on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] there.  And it was very--it was identical almost to TAP [Talent Assistance Program], but they had a wider reach than, than TAP.  They were out in the neighborhood in the community which made them more accessible, made them more practical, realistic to people because people just didn't come downtown, even to get free assistance.  Downtown was just foreign to the black community at that time.  But because CEDCO was located in the community, they had wider access to current or would-be entrepreneurs.  And so, I was asked by Garland if I would start volunteering with, with them which I agreed to do.
Speaker 1: And who was in--was Garland--who was in charge of CEDCO at that--
Speaker 2: Garland Guice.
Speaker 1: Garland Guice.  Can you talk about him?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, he was another legend of the time as far as the business community was concerned--very respected, very knowledgeable, very innovative--just helped an awful lot of people get started in their businesses, either to grow their businesses or to create their businesses.  He had [HistoryMaker] Jesse Madison working for him.  Jesse went on to run Abraham Lincoln Centre [Chicago, Illinois], as well as the [Chicago] Park District.  Alderman Ed Smith came out of CEDCO.  Sam McGrier who's a SBA [Small Business Administration] district director and others--I mean, just a great group of people that he mentored who went on to various careers, very successful careers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we're talking about the period, you know, 19-, what, 1969, '70 [1970] something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're in the late '60s [1960s] now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 209702
Speaker 1: Up to this point [1960s], in terms of the black business community, there wasn't a lot of outside help or assistance, right?  Either you made it, you know, on your own--I think, I'm not trying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes, I'm agreeing with you.  I'll stop you, yeah, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter), but, no, I want you to, to talk about that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in terms of, you know, where we are, in terms of black business, and how this was sort of a different direction--maybe set the stage for today's black business.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  In the early '60s [1960s], the individuals who had businesses were really self-made.  They did it through their own savings.  They did it through gathering family assets or getting small loans from friends and in family.  Financing was just not available--just to speak of.  Rarely were they able to get financing from a formal institution.  Even credit cards weren't available at that time which is a major way of financing businesses today.  So, the small business help centers were just the godsend, and really the thing that started the, I think, the boom in black business ownership through these free services that were offered.  Businesses that were able to get started didn't last very long.  So the risk that a financial institution would look at would be extremely high, just because you just could look at the record.  And it wasn't one that you would say that this is an area risk that is appropriate for, you know, a financial institution.  But the  Harris [Trust & Savings] Bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], I discovered, had--and I, I can't tell you how it started, but in the early '60s [1960s], they had a guy there working part-time, working with black business people.  It was one of the few banks, and maybe the only bank in Chicago at least at the time that was doing something like that.  And he had as early customers, Willard Payne [Jr.] of Metropolitan Sausage [Manufacturing Company], and most people know Parker House [Sausage Company, Chicago, Illinois], but Metropolitan Sausage was a customer.  Barbara, the advertising--
Speaker 1: Barbara [Gardner] Proctor.
Speaker 2: Barbara Proctor Gardner [sic.] was one of the early customers, as was [HistoryMaker] Al [Alvin J.] Boutte [Sr.] who, you know, had the grocery stores, and went on with the--Independence Bank [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] was one of her early customers and others.  But, you know, the bank had started working with people like that early on.
Speaker 1: And do you know why--what that came out of that?  Was it because of social unrest or do you think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't and I--
Speaker 1: You don't have--
Speaker 2: --I hazard to make something up.  But the leadership of the bank, to me, has always been receptive to stepping out of the box a bit.  I found this to be certainly true since I've been there, and since I've tried to introduce new ideas to the bank.  They've allowed me to suggest things to them with far less paperwork, proving research, documentation than other projects that they might have assumed.  But this--I can't take any credit for this unit that was there, because it was there when I started there, or shortly after I started there.  But it was in existence when I became aware of it, working with business people.
Story_ID: 209703
Speaker 1: So you worked as a teller, you said, for three years, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then, and during that time that, your manager, you had talked about--I mean, you didn't talk about during this interview, but I read that he was, you know, he taught you things, but he was sort of a gentle manager.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My first manager was a white gentleman by the name of Nick Swistewitz, Nicholas Swistewitz [ph.].  And he was the teller manager, and he was retired from the [U.S.] Army.  He had twenty years as a drill sergeant in the Army.  And so, of course, we had to do everything with great precision and on time and just right.  But he was the nicest guy, and you had to do his way and you had to do, you know, like clockwork.  But he didn't yell at us.  He didn't reprimand publicly.  He coached, and he was very supportive, and he was of me, I know, and I'm sure he was of everyone else.  So, I learned an awful lot from him about the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], and what I was supposed to be doing.  And he was very meticulous and thorough with his training.  And he was another who had a big influence because if it wasn't for him, I don't think that I would have gotten quite used to the strange, difficult, new world that I was in--just thrown in with a group of people that I had absolutely no exposure or experience with, previously doing things I knew nothing about.  And, but he made it easier and the people I worked with, too.  Next to me was a white fellow--is Fred, Fred Guzzo [ph.].  And we became pretty good teller mates there, and maybe we related to each other because as it turned--he was gay.  And so, I guess he was having his own issues because this is the early '60s [1960s], and, you know, you didn't come out.  And so, it-- we were able to work together in a very collegial supportive manner.  And that, between Fred and Nick, you know, it helped stabilize me and give me a good foundation there at the bank and--
Speaker 1: Because at the same time, you're living in two worlds.  This is a whole different world that you've not been exposed to.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and everything is really white in that world, right?
Speaker 2: Totally.
Story_ID: 209704
Speaker 1: You go from those three years [as a teller], and then you become a personal banker [at Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Personal banker.
Speaker 1: And that's when you got involved in TAP [Talent Assistance Program]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what is the path--how long were you a personal banker?
Speaker 2: Personal banker for several years, maybe two years.  And then, I'm asked to be assistant manager of a personal banking area, and from assistant manager to manager.  So, since beginning at the bank for the first ten years, I was probably in a different position or different responsibility every eighteen to twenty-four months--from the teller area to a new teller area they were starting up as something as a trial area, to personal banker to, to assistant manager, manager.  So, every eighteen to twenty-four months, I was doing something different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in terms of black hires, what was happening?  Was there a parallel track happening at Continental [Illinois National] Bank [and Trust Co., Chicago, Illinois]?  What--did you have a counterpart there at the other banks?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the, at the Continental Bank, a year or so after I started there, then I became aware of [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris and Ron Grier [ph.] at the Continental Bank, and then followed by [James Hadley] Jim Hadley and others.  The Continental Bank--I think, once the hiring started, were hiring more rapidly into the black community than the other banks.  But the other banks, nonetheless, were also doing it because as I said, Cecil [Coleman, ph.] started at the Harris and there were others.  But at First National [Bank of Chicago], Tucson Hale [ph.] was one of the first blacks I recall they hired over there.  And then, a stream of others, and Gerald [C.] Hines down at the American National Bank [and Trust of Chicago].  He went on to be the president of the Seaway [National] Bank.  But the banks--Harris Bank, in its professional hires, were doing mostly M.B.A.s, bringing them into the corporate banking area--very little hiring elsewhere in the bank.  And there were a number of people who, who came in as M.B.A.s into the commercial banking training program.  They didn't stay very long.  Most of them got through the credit training, worked for a couple of years, and then went on to do other things elsewhere in the country.  But there was the trend in, in most of the banks at the time to, to do most of their hiring through the M.B.A. programs.
Speaker 1: And were, was Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] preferred as a--because I know at First Chicago [Bank], there were a lot of M.B.A.s.  You know, that seemed to be a lot of people going from Northwestern to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to, to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think early on, people were hired mostly out of--well, most of the hiring actually took place outside of Chicago [Illinois].  People came in from universities and colleges outside of the Chicago area.  The--Northwestern came in to being amongst the blacks through the evening program and the first scholar program.  The first (unclear)--they had this first scholar program which allowed people to work and pursue their M.B.A. at the same time.  A number of blacks took advantage of tthat program.  But most of the hires came from outside of the City of Chicago area.
Story_ID: 209705
Speaker 1: You become assistant, you say, manager, and then--
Speaker 2: A manager--
Speaker 1: Manager--
Speaker 2: --in personal banking.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Of a personal banking unit, and meaning I was the manager of an area on the first floor as a part of the personal banking division.  I eventually went on to become the division administrator taking on the responsibility for all the retail banking for Harris [Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] eight or nine years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, as you move up, what things are you learning about that, you know, about the corporate?  And it's a very structured, you know, the corporate America at this point is extremely sort of structured.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  What I'm learning most is that you had to take charge of your career yourself; that you had to--that the bank, except for a very few people, or any company for that matter, was going to design or set out a career for you, or to put you on a track that led you to the upper parts of the bank.  And so, I tried to think about where I wanted to be, and who I needed to get to know to get to my next position.  And so, I was always thinking, you know, a year or two down the road.  And I never thought or even had designs on trying to be the president of the bank because I just--that was just a waste of time to think about that sort of thing.  But I did feel that there was more growth for me there at the company, and I had to figure what are the areas that I can grow into where I would have the skills to do very well in that area, and tried to avoid being placed in areas where it would be very difficult for me to succeed.  And so, I was very fortunate or lucky in that I landed in places that played to my strengths because I didn't have the background or the training for, you know, many of the jobs in the bank, but also very fortunate in that I had very supportive bosses, managers along the way, who did what you'd want a good manager to be--
Story_ID: 209706
Speaker 1: I think I learned somewhat early on, without realizing that I'd learned it, that you can also manage your manager--that you can get your manager to point you in the directions, or do the things that you want him or her to do.  And I can't explain quite how that, but I learned how to do that.  I never had a bad manager because I helped my managers to learn how to manage me as, as an individual and the things that I needed, and it has worked.
Speaker 2: Explain that a little bit more.
Speaker 1: Each manager has his or her own management style, way of doing things--the way they want things done, the way they want to interact with people, how much they share, how much they trust people.  So, each one has their own style.  And they tend to, I think, have the way they interact with, with people, regardless of who they are, that style comes forth across all the people they're responsible for.  But that style may or may not be good for all individuals, all the employees working for that reason.  Some can thrive under certain styles and others perish.  And I have a certain environment in which I found that I can thrive in, and I've been able to get my bosses to understand how best to manage me.
Speaker 2: So, what environment did you find you could thrive in most?
Speaker 1: Where I had people that trust me, but I have to earn that trust, where they know that I am loyal to them, where they know that I understand that I only succeed if you succeed.  And so, the things I do are going to be for the better of our department, our business, and our respective careers. That I am comfortable enough with you to be candid with you, that I will tell you the things that I think you ought to know that you aren't picking up on, that I will not betray confidences of yours or anyone that I might work with--the things that I know. And so, I know--I feel that I've gotten complete trust with the people that I have worked with over the years, and I said, because I don't think they would have told me or share it with me, things that they did unless they trusted that it would never go any further.  And so, my bosses, in some cases, became confidents of mine, where they come to me, and ask, "What do you think I should do?" because they felt I had some insight or contact with other parts of the bank that would--were not accessible to them because they were senior management, and you don't trust senior management.  And so, I, you know, I've enjoyed for the last twenty years at least playing that role to a senior management where they trust me and my opinion and my thoughts, and my ability to help them do things faster because of them having to convince people that this is something that's good for you or good for the company or on the level, or what you see is what you get kinda thing, you know.
Speaker 2: So you found a way of becoming an integral part of the team?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now what--you said, you know, you discovered sort of early on or when you became aware of, what areas were--you wanted to stay away from, and what areas, you know--I mean, you were sort of-- what areas did you, you decide that you did not want to be part of?
Speaker 1: I didn't want to be part of the trust department or longer term in commercial banking.  I wanted to be a part of retail banking, dealing with individuals, dealing with the non-wealthy customers of the bank.  I felt I could better understand, articulate what they--what their needs were, how we could better serve them, what neighborhoods would be important for us to look at, how I helped them solve their problems because I understood their issues.  I didn't understand rich people's issues.  And that worked. It worked.  The bank allowed me to grow within the retail area.  They added more and more on to me: the mortgage area, the small business area.  And so it just came together quite well over the years.
Story_ID: 209707
Speaker 1: So you were talking about, you know, the banks that most blacks--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The blacks banked in just a few banks.  At that time, there were not the number of black-owned banks that we have today.  But I think most blacks who had accounts initially had them at the First National Bank of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And I think that came about because when they migrated to Chicago [Illinois], that was a name that they were familiar with--not necessarily the First National Bank of Chicago, but because it was the First National something--that no matter where they came from in the United States, there was usually a First National Bank of Birmingham [Birmingham, Alabama], a First National Bank of Atlanta [Atlanta, Georgia], and what-not.  And so, when they saw them, they were immediately drawn to it because, I think, in their minds, they probably figured it was affiliated in some way.  It really wasn't because there was no interstate banking at that time.  In fact, Illinois, at that time, didn't even have a banking within state, intra-state, and it was only that one location.  So, First National Bank at one time had more savings accounts under one roof than any other bank in the world because of people coming to Chicago, migrating to Chicago, and going to the First National Bank, opening up a savings account.
Speaker 1: You mean, the black people.  They had more--or savings accounts from, period (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Savings accounts in general, but I think more people--more black people banked with First National Bank than all the other banks put together for many, many, many years.
Story_ID: 209708
Speaker 1: You decide to go back to school.  And do you--was that because you felt you had left things undone, or was it because you felt that would help you in your growth in the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I went back to school because I knew that--well, I wanted to get my degree.  That was something that I had promised my mother [Lillian Watkins Williams] I would do and something I wanted to do personally.  And equally as important, I saw that the, the bank promoted people who had their college degrees--maybe not necessarily M.B.A., but you had a college degree if you were going beyond a certain level.  That was--I don't want to say written, but it was clearly understood.  Today, it's illegal to do that, but I think people--managers who hired looked to see if you had your, at least your, your bachelor's degree.  So I knew I had to do that and it was determined, so I went back to school, night school at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And Roosevelt was-- it's a school that has a lot of significance in the black community, too, that a lot of people have gone there, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, Roosevelt--I chose Roosevelt because it had more working students.  There were more students like me who were working during the day, and going to school in the evening.  But Roosevelt was started as a university to support minorities.  It broke away from the, the Central Y University [sic. Central YMCA College], I think.  And it started up because the Y was not allowing the matriculation of minorities, like some professors there thought they should, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you--how long did it take you to get through the program there going at night school?
Speaker 2: At night, it took me about six years to, to finish up at nights.
Speaker 1: And you finished in--you, 1974, right--
Speaker 2: In '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, definitely in the '70s [1970s], okay.  So you, in the '70s [1970s], you go from--let's see, you go, you're definitely at that point a manager.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, you know, in personal banking.
Story_ID: 209709
Speaker 1: Your outside activities are--have they increased at that point?  Or are you--
Speaker 2: They've increased a fair amount.  I became involved with the United Way of Chicago [Illinois] on one of their volunteer committees, the allocations committee and the new ventures committee, so several of the United Way committees, and there I met any number of people through that.  I was appointed by--this was in 1974 or so, by Superintendent [Joseph P. Hannon] Joe Hannon, superintendent of schools, Joe Hannon, to the desegregation task force.  It was--the city was, was handed a decree--the final way to better desegregate the schools, and so they set up this task force.  There were twenty-five or so of us who were to come up with this plan to present to the superintendent who would then present it to the board and, ultimately, to whatever overseeing agency had to approve it.  And so, we labored twice a week in the evenings after work for over two years to put this plan together.  We presented it, and it was promptly put on the shelf.  Nothing ever, ever came of it.  But through that process, I met, you know, a number of people who worked, had worked with them on--one was, used to run KOCO, gosh, Bob Lucas [Robert Lucas] who ran the Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization [Chicago, Illinois].  I got to know Bob.  Another was Jim [ph.] who went on to be the head of Arthur Andersen [LLP] in Chicago who retired ten years or so ago.  I got to know a number of people through that work--became involved with other boards over time.  It's been maybe twenty boards that I've been on during my career at the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  Most significantly, I worked with the Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois].  I was chairman of the board at Provident Hospital for a period.
Story_ID: 209710
Speaker 1: Were you chairman at the time that they [Provident Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] were going through the financial problems, or was it before that?
Speaker 2: Both.  I--well, when I went on the board, they were having financial problems because they had financial problems for a long time.  But I was chairman of the board at the time we took it into bankruptcy when we found that--we tried to negotiate a relationship with the Cook County [Illinois] because it could no longer exist as a private hospital, and it had to have public support.  And we had worked with the president of Cook County Board [of Commissioners].  And, at the time--and while he was, he could see the benefit of it, it was something he just couldn't make happen--George, George [W.] Dunne.  And so, we went to Washington [D.C.] to meet with HHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] to try and get some relief at that time.  But it just wasn't forthcoming, and the only way to save the hospital and to keep it going was to take it into bankruptcy, and find relief from the creditors.  And so, I was chairman at the time that decision was made.
Speaker 1: Now, that was sort of an emotional time just because the feeling about Provident, you know, that--
Speaker 2: It was very emotional because we were getting pleas from all over the country not to let Provident Hospital disappear.  And we tried everything, everything that we possibly could.  And there just wasn't enough money in the community itself to prop up, you know, a major hospital.  It had to be public monies coming into it.  And the doctors at the time--and I can understand--they were not putting their patients into the hospital.  The doctors began to have privileges at other hospitals.  And so, they put their patients where they knew the hospital was going to be able to be in existence, and be able to take care of their patients.  And so, you know, just--it was a catch-22 there, and so it just got worse.  And so, we made the tough decision.  But we were able to finally get--coming out of bankruptcy, an affiliation with the Cook County where they took it on as a branch of Cook County and agreed by--through contract, to preserve the name and certain of the traditions of the hospital so--
Speaker 1: Now, the time period, that was sort of in the--was that in the mid-'80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: The mid-'80s [1980s], yeah.
Speaker 1: --or, or mid-'80s [1980s], right.
Speaker 2: And the bank allowed me to devote just about full time at, at Provident.  I would come into the Harris [Trust & Savings] Bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] at 6:30 in the morning and would work there until about noon, one o'clock, and go out to Provident, and spend every afternoon out there from one o'clock to seven, eight o'clock at night for several years trying to work through those issues.
Story_ID: 209711
Speaker 1: At this point, who is your champion at the [Harris Trust & Savings] Bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], you know, to allow you that?  At that, now the community, is that--had you, had the community affairs position been created at that point?  No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was in retail banking at that--
Speaker 1: You were still--so why, why was the bank allowing this and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was working for a fellow named Ben [T.] Nelson at the time, and he had some experience lending to healthcare institutions so he understood the problems, and I think he understood the significance of that hospital [Provident Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] at the time, and I think he was quite pleased or proud to have someone at the bank--because I'm working for him--being a part of the effort to try and save the hospital.  So he allowed me to spend, you know, more than--better than half the day, every day, out at the hospital, and cover whatever personal expenses I had associated with that.  And his boss supported that also, so it was really never a problem for me or the bank to, to do that.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And also, the bank had Provident, at some time prior, as a customer even, so there was a relationship going back a number of years with the hospital.  At the time I was there, they were no longer a customer.  They had moved the relationship somewhere else before I became involved, but we did have that history with them also.
Speaker 1: And what, what did you learn from the Provident experience, you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned a lot of things.  One, it--the biggest school I went to was in working with the physicians.  The physicians can make or break a hospital, and they know it.  And the relationship between the physicians and administration was never what it should have been, never what it should have been.  The physicians wanted to run the hospital.  They wanted the administration to turn the hospital operation totally over to them.  And I think we would have done if we felt that that would have saved the hospital, but we were convinced that that was not the best thing to do.  But we were not able to gain the trust of the physicians so that they utilized the hospital to its fullest extent.  The hospital itself was a wonderful facility.  There was nothing wrong with the quality of care at the hospital.  It was a new building we were in.  We had the best of equipment.  We had great staff, but the physicians chose not to utilize the hospital.  Many of them did not--many did, but many, many did not.  And I don't know how we could have turned it around because I tried to use all these skills that I thought I'd picked up over the years at the bank working with different people, different supervisors, difficult customers, the press, and so forth.  But none of it worked with the, with--it just, the lack of trust between the physicians and the staff was just too deep, and the--more history there than I ever knew. I learned that being black, being historically black, was also not enough to convince the powers that be in Washington [D.C.].  They were all very sympathetic to what we were trying to do, but I think they realized that, that it was--the hole was just too deep for them to do a carve-out for that particular hospital because we were not unique with our situation there.  We were the most well-known with our problems but certainly not unique.  So I don't, you know, that I--as I look back on it, I can't think of things that we could have done, should have done differently while I was there. There were many things that probably could have been done, you know, many years prior to that.  You know, they took on too much debt to begin with, I think, with the new building and things like that but, you know.
Speaker 1: And you said you worked on that for like three years?  Was it three--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I was chair for two, two and a half years, but I was on the board for six or seven years.
Story_ID: 209712
Speaker 1: And then after that experience, did you sort of take a break in terms of organizations or did you, you know, continue?  What--
Speaker 2: No, I never took a break because even when I was at Provident [Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], I was serving on other boards.  But I would serve on a board until I felt I had outlived my usefulness, or had--don't want to say lost interest, but outlived my usefulness.   And I would turn it over, hopefully, to someone else at the bank because if I--I usually found it that it was some benefit to have a relationship between the bank and the organization, and I would take on a different challenge.
Speaker 1: All right.  And which--what were some of the favorite boards that you've served on, you know, you mentioned Provident and you mentioned TAP [Talent Assistance Program], but were there others?
Speaker 2: Well, they--my favorite board was and is Neighborhood Housing Services [of Chicago, Inc.], NHS [Chicago, Illinois].  I'm a founding director of that organization.  I've been with them now for almost thirty years.  And I, even after I retired, I've committed to staying with them as a volunteer.  They do affordable housing.  In Chicago [Illinois], they're the largest affordable housing provider in the city, state, maybe even in the country.  And it's something that I have a passion for.  And I--it's one of those non-profits where you can see and feel and touch what you're doing.  There are many things you become involved with, and it's over a period of time that something happens and--but you don't feel like you're really a part of, but you can see the family move into the house.  You can see the children going in the backyard for the first time.  You can see a block change from what it was to what it is today.  And that's something that work at the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] in the mortgage area and what-not that I'd gotten some experience with and maybe some skills.  And so, I've enjoyed that one an awful lot.  The other one that I have worked with that I enjoy currently is the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--totally different but because of the people I work with there, and I enjoy art an awful lot-- that's one that I am still on, even though I've retired from the bank.  Just a--I've tried to help them expand their reach into the black community.  They received a grant several years ago, which mandated that that was what it was to be used for.  And so, we and others tried to devise different ways to increase the usage and involvement of the black community within the museum, and I worked with the nominating committee to try and increase the number of black trustees on the board of trustees there.  So we got Eric [T.] McKissack on very recently as a trustee.  And I've, you know, I've tried to do that with most of the boards that I have been on.  But the Chicago Botanic Garden [Glencoe, Illinois], I'm with, I'm a member of their nominating committee to try and increase their penetration into the community.  And they have the most difficulty of all because they're located out there in Glencoe [Illinois].  They call themselves the Chicago Botanic Garden, but try to convince people that it's for everybody and that you're welcome and what-not and so, but by getting people of the community, from the community, that are officially part of it, you know, will help some.  And by those people that go on the board, finding ways for the garden to come into the city--bring their presence into the city to do a garden on [East] 55th Street, or a garden over on (unclear), you know, in Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  And they've been doing, you know, quite a bit of that recently.

Speaker 1: Once you were in the corporate community, did you ever have a thought about passing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, just asking.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But remember you said (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I probably couldn't pull it off.  What the hell could I pass-- (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I may look like one, but I talk like--so what the hell could I pass for (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I know.
Story_ID: 209714
Speaker 1: At the retirement reception that the [Harris Trust & Savings] Bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] had for me two weeks ago, a large number of people were there.  But only a few people spoke--[Edmund Burke] Ed Burke and the chairman and the president, and my best friend was there.  He is the president of some banks in Omaha, Nebraska, and he was asked to speak.  And they allowed him to do it because he is my best buddy.  And he said a lot of embarrassing things about me, but as he was winding up, he says, "The thing that I have been most impressed about [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] Ed is his involvement and loyalty to the black community.  And I say that because he had options where so many people don't, and but he has been, you know, in the black community."  And that, of course, everyone thought that was so damn funny that--but I had never heard that expressed like that before.  And, no, it has never occurred to me to do something different than what I've done; to pass.
Story_ID: 209715
Speaker 1: You had mentioned earlier in the interview that you heard comments.  You knew--you would hear comments.  And I was wondering, would you be silent during those comments or would you speak out?  And, supposedly, there's a story of legend, but I mean, when you were later in your career, and I think the corporate boardroom--is that true?  You know, that a comment was made, and you identified yourself as African American and there was silence.  Is that, is that the--I don't know--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't in the boardroom because the board--no, it happened early on in my career at the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], and would be with people more or less at my level.  And there was one lady in particular--it was when I was a teller, in my first job as a teller there.  And we were in the rear of the lobby.  And a group of people came in the front door, and she said, "Here come some more niggers." Just like that.  And I was just, you know, flabbergasted because it's just out of the blue, and with no context whatsoever.  And so, it--I didn't know what to do at first.  I didn't do anything at that point because I was just more frightened at first because, you know, that's me, too.  And so, it was a couple of days before I went to her and let her know.  And she--thank God, you know--she reacted graciously.  She apologized profusely--said, "I didn't know. I'm so sorry."  And I don't know if that had any impact on her behavior after that, but certainly with me, it, you know, she did respond appropriately, and we maintained a relationship after that.  There are any number of situations, but another one that sticks out was when I was a banker in the consumer credit area.  There was an attorney with a prominent law firm--was calling, wanted to buy a car, a new car.  And I was taking the information over the phone.  And he said, "I want to buy--want to get a Cadillac," he said, "but not like the ones the niggers drive on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]," (laughter).  And so I left that alone, but I asked one of my supervisors to take that one and to let him go back to his law firm, and let him know that when you talk over the telephone that you got to be careful in what you say, and what--who you're saying it to.  But I chose not to take that one on personally.
Story_ID: 209716
Speaker 1: But there would be other times when you would have a conversation with someone, and you're an officer of the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  And this would be in the early '80s [1980s], '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].  I became an officer of the bank when I was--in the '70s [1970s], and senior vice president in 1980.  But they just assumed that if I'm talking to a bank officer, it's a white person.  And so, they say things as if they're talking to a white person, but why these things have anything to do with the conversation, you'd never know, but there's--there were times when, if it's just someone calling in, and they say something, you just let it go.  You just, you know, it's just not worth trying to get into some explanation with someone you don't know, and they don't know you.  You just let it go.  The situations though that we dealt with in the bank very forthrightly, and I appreciate the bank supporting this, when a customer would say, "I do not want that black person handling my account."  And the bank would support us when we say, "Well, if that's the case, you can't bank here.  And if Mary or Frank are not acceptable to you, then I'm afraid we can't maintain your relationship," and they would let a customer walk out the door rather than accede to that type of request.
Speaker 2: Were you instrumental in that policy?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if there are things like I should take credit for those kind--I really don't know.  But I was certainly around, when these things--and maybe it was because I'm in the room, and certainly when you're in the room, which is so much a part of it, people react and respond and say things differently than they might not normally do.  And so, I think that I had something to do with it, but I never--I don't--very few instances, very few--I won't say never, where I've had to go and directly go to the bank and say, "This is wrong.  We should be doing something differently, because it's impacting people in ways that you don't understand."  I just think that they're smart people and when they are--the managers, when they're in an environment where they know that they can't talk or behave the way the way they might--the way they used to, then they behave appropriately.  They behave differently.  And so, it has worked without having to play the heavy.
Story_ID: 209717
Speaker 1: When you became head of community affairs, what--that was in the--
Speaker 2: In the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Early '90s [1990s], okay.  And why was that position created?  You had already been very active in the community, but why was the position created?  Was it part of the community re--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a new position that was created for the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  I had--
Speaker 1: Was it because of the Community Reinvestment Act [(CRA) 1977]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, because that had already--
Speaker 2: That was--I became--
Speaker 1: That was already happened.
Speaker 2: --the Community Reinvestment Act officer in 1977--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and still carried that position until I retired.  But I had left retail banking--well, the bank did a downsizing in 1991--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ninety [1990] or '91 [1991].  And I was head of retail banking, and retail banking was the area that was most heavily impacted.  But I was asked to start up a business for the bank that had never been done before in a bank.  And as far as we could tell, very few U.S. companies had done anything like this where they would do the outplacement for their employees.  You normally would send them to an outplacement firm, but the bank wanted to do it differently.  And they were--I think it was more conscious than anything else.  They were-felt--it's the first downsizing they'd ever done, and so it played heavily on their consciences.  So they said, "[HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] Ed, here's a checkbook.  We want you to start up this outplacement business."  And so, I went out and rented a different space, hired staff, set up the program, and terminated eleven people in one day, and met them at the front door of the outplacement office the next day, and said, I'm here to help you.  How I ever got myself in that position, I'll never know (laughter), but that was very awkward, and I didn't think that went through very well--how I let the bank do that to me.  But that was a great experience where I was able to run this separate business for the bank--totally separate and apart from the bank.  And I told them, "Once we do this, you fired these people, you cannot ever set foot into this office, because once we get people moving on the right path, we don't want, you know, to rekindle, you know, bad feelings."  So that went very well.  Anyway, long story short, when we closed down that office, and I went back into the bank, I was appointed head of community affairs at that point, and that was because all during my entire life at the bank, I've always been the person that's probably been the most involved in the community.  And the time was right, I think, for the bank to do something like that because of what was going in the banking industry at that time.  And so, that's where I started back and finished.
Story_ID: 209718
Speaker 1: Talk about the, you know, just the changes that occurred in the banking industry, you know, sort of starting in the '80s [1980s] and how that, you know, ended up, you know, what impact it had on the industry overall.
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest impacts, I think, were the failure of some of the major institutions around the country.  And it showed, I think, corporate America that there are other ways to handle your financial transactions than through the bank.  And I think that started the great migration away from the banks when the banks that they had depended on for so many years were no longer there for them.  And so, they--many of them started doing it on their own--issuing commercial paper.  The foreign banks, the Japanese banks, in particular; they came into the United States, and showed that they were equally as adept at handling the things that the domestic banks did.  But that then forced the banks to learn new tricks, that, "We aren't getting our bread and butter clients like we used to, corporate America--then we need to find other ways we can serve them, and so they started information processing--being transfer agents, and doing things for corporate trusts and information processing, doing payrolls and other things where the banks had computers earlier than many corporations, and so they crunched the data for the companies.  But even now, we see that that's not enough, and more and more banks are going back into where they started--working with the consumer.  They find that's as steady as you go.  Consumer was there, is there, and is going to be there.  And so, you have many, many banks now who are leaving.  They're, they're slimming down their corporate staffs, corporate banking staff, and increasing their consumer retail banking areas.  And that will be the trend from--for a long time to come.  They found also that Internet banking and touch telephone, and what-not is--were great ideas, but that's not the way people want to bank.  People want to come in and see the people, make sure the money is there, have a relationship with an individual, and so, we're kinda going full circle, back to where it started--
Story_ID: 209719
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the whole thing with, you know, redlining and the Community Reinvestment Act [CRA] and your work with Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], you know, and the branch being there but, you know, I just would like to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, the, the banks were accused of redlining certain communities going back many years.  And so, the [U.S.] Congress passed a law in 1977, which made it illegal for a bank to not do business in a community.  But, in particular, banks could not avoid doing business in low-and moderate-income communities.  It had nothing to do with race, but it defined it on an economic basis, and it went further, and said that banks have to affirmatively go out into these communities and meet the financial needs.  And that's essentially what it said.  It didn't say how, how many, and what-not.  And so, it was a very confusing law to begin with, because for its, all of its impact, which is one of the most significant in terms of impact on the banking industry, it was the shortest, briefest law.  It didn't say--it didn't give parameters, you know, or statistics, or--so banks had to kind of make it up on their own--what they, what was expected, as did the regulators.  So you had to try and guess, what are the regulators going to be looking for when they come in? Because there was no manual around that.  There were communities that were redlined.  I won't deny that.  I don't know where they were, but it's just, it's--common sense tells you that things like that happened.  And so, the law was necessary and needed, and it's time to solve a problem.  It had a significant impact on communities over the years.  I think what's happened would have happened, but it would have been over a much longer period of time.  I think banks would have realized eventually--there's really money to be made in low-income communities and minority communities.  And they've been bright enough to go into other communities where there's money to be paid, and they're go anywhere there's money to be paid.  But they were forced into low-income communities, even though they didn't want to be there early on.  But they found much sooner that there are opportunities there.  And so, we've seen, over the years, tremendous amounts of money flow into low-income communities through this law, and banks, being very creative and innovative, because now the law says, not only must you serve the needs, but you--the things that you do must be innovative and complex for you to receive a passing grade.  And so, banks each year have to outdo what they did last year.  And so, they're pushing the envelope more and more and the communities are really benefitting from what's currently happening with the administration of this law.
Story_ID: 209720
Speaker 1: Now the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] under your leadership actually went back--I mean, I don't know if this was just coincidence.  I mean, I know that you did a whole study about, you know, what community really to choose.  But it's the community that you--not the same community, but basically, the community with the--
Speaker 2: Well, when the opportunity came up for the bank to open a branch outside of downtown Chicago [Illinois], I suggested to the bank that we consider a low-income community.  We could go anywhere at that point.  And most of the banks in the state went to suburban communities or upper-income communities because that's where you can become most profitable, you know, the quickest.  You go where the money is.  But I suggested to the bank that we think of a low-income community, and they agreed to do that. They agreed to do that.  And they said, "Okay, find the community."  And so, we--an associate of mine went out and looked at any number of different communities.  We went out into all over the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], West Side [Chicago, Illinois], into some of the lower-income community, suburban communities, Maywood [Illinois], Harvey [Illinois], Robbins [Illinois].  We had decided on, ultimately, the West Side, and what led us there was--here's a community where there is no bank, there, and so, if we want to have an impact--let's go where we can have the greatest impact.  You look at some of the other communities.  The suburban communities had a bank or two.  Some of the South Side communities would have a bank somewhere, you know, you could get to--maybe you got to catch a bus, but you could get there.  But the West Side had no bank anywhere within an easy commute.  And so, the bank agreed that we would go there.  We had another thing going for us.  There was a customer that we were working with, and this was a group of white business people who grew up in the community many years ago as a part of the Dutch Reformed Church.  They now live in Barrington [Illinois] and other places, but they still had maintained interest in the community.  They care about the community, and they financed, out of their own pockets, the purchase of a grocery store that had closed, and they wanted to use it as a training facility for the black residents around the store there.  And so, they hired a gentleman who had retired from Illinois Bell [Telephone Company, Chicago, Illinois] and other people from the grocery business to set up this grocery store to run it because the closest supermarket was in Oak Park [Illinois] from West Garfield [Park, Chicago, Illinois] there.  Anyway, they got the store up and running, and they needed to expand-Harris Bank made them a loan.  I decided that it would be a great idea if we worked with our customers.  It's an ideal location, and they'd be perfect partners for our new venture there.  So, we said, we'd put our branch in the grocery store.  We started working with them to draw a design of plans and what-not.  And, and I got a call from the guy who was running it--said, "[HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] Ed, the--I got to come see you"--came down.  He says, "It's not going to work because we find that through a recent audit, we're losing much more money than what we thought.  And we can no longer come out-of-pocket to make up the losses."  So, we were now without a location to do this.  So, I convinced the bank that, you know, "We've told the community we're coming.  So, we've got to find a location in this community.  We can't go back on our word.  We got to come--go now to West Garfield."  And so, I looked and looked and looked.  There's lots of land if you want do one from the ground up, but made no sense because you'd never pay for it.  So, we--there's this shopping, strip mall on 3900 West Madison [Street].  It's not the best, but, you know, it could work.  We bought out a lease there in that mall and put a branch in there, so we could, you know, keep our commitment to the community.  And the bank, you know, stood by that decision the whole time, which, you know.  It's great of them to do that.
Story_ID: 209721
Speaker 1: The importance of a bank, though, in a community is that with, you know, can you talk about that, you know, a community without a bank has some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The--it's--a community without a bank is really not a community.  It's not a whole community.  You sometimes take the bank for granted.  But the bank--first of all, I think, is kind of a symbol to the community that it's alive.  And low-income communities need symbols.  The people need hope.  They need something they can look to, and a bank coming in says, "I have faith in this community," you know, "I want to work with you.  I'll make an investment."  And once the bank goes in, then you see other businesses come, whereas--and a bank can project this feeling of confidence more than most other businesses.  A bakery could go in, or a florist could go in--new, but it doesn't project the same thing.  But a bank sends a different kind of a signal.  And so, we said to the community, "We want to be a catalyst to help in the community rejuvenate itself."  And that was the word we used--a catalyst.  And so, that was, you know, we--and then we tried to find ways to leverage off of our opening up there to get others to come into the community, to make ourselves accessible to the small businesses, and so forth, because we wanted to be--to feel that we played some role in helping that community to turn around.
Speaker 1: Now, is--now the bank in [West] Garfield [Park, Chicago, Illinois], how is it doing?  Is it still a struggle?  Is it--
Speaker 2: It's still a struggle.  It's taking every bit as long as we thought it was going to take, unfortunately.  But the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Company, Chicago, Illinois] was committed to it, you know.  It takes a new branch in a moderate income neighborhood, you know, average income or upper income can turn the corner anywhere from two to four years--become profitable.  We've been there since '94 [1994], and we will approach profitability one day soon, we hope--
Story_ID: 209722
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing--the [Harris Bank] Foundation, when did you take over and become head of the foundation?
Speaker 2: Well, that would have been 1991 or '92 [1992], somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was--you focused your efforts still on that, in that community, right, from a giving perspective--not exclusively but a lot of focus?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  The bank's [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] philanthropic efforts were spread throughout Chicagoland [Illinois].  And the foundation--we did a retreat, and we said, "Well, what is it that we can be proud of that we've done through all these years of giving money away into the Chicagoland community?"  And there's really nothing we could point to say that we played some role in making that happen.  So we says, "That's not the way--we should feel good about giving money away.  Our employees should feel good about, you know, giving away part of the bank's earnings."  We said, "Well, let's find ways in which we can turn that around."  And we looked at any number of different ways.  Maybe we could pay particular attention to an area of need: healthcare or education. Said well, "The government doesn't have enough money to have a significant impact there.  What do we think we can do?"  I said, "Well, maybe we can look at a neighborhood."  And so, we says, "Yes, we can, we have expertise here at the bank where we can, you know, work with mortgages.  We can work with small businesses.  We can, you know, work with the school through our volunteers, and what-not.  So, then we went through the process of trying to identify an appropriate neighborhood.  We looked in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] and Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], and other communities, but Lawndale, North Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] came up.  It survived the screen.  And so, we've been there now for three years.  We said that in order to say that we're going to have this--begin to see any kind of movement, it's going to take five years.  So, we've concentrated the giving in North Lawndale for the past three years.  And I can see it's been very successful--lots of things we can point to, and we don't have to point to it.  You can go into the community and ask, you know, "Have you heard of Harris Bank?"  And the people in the community can tell you the things that they think that we've supported and made happen.
Speaker 1: Now, has organizations like Bethel New Life [Chicago, Illinois]--have they been sort of collaborative partners over there, or are they not really more neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, Bethel New Life is an organization that we worked with making loans to, back in the '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s].  We did loans to them that they couldn't get done anywhere else.  But it was because strong neighborhood organizations, strong indigenous organizations that we said, "This neighborhood makes sense."  They have--we can't go in by ourself--we're outsiders.  They've got to be people in the community that we can work with, partner with, that can help us make this happen.  We're going to work through them because we're, you know, we're not of the community.  And so, we identified Bethel New Life, Lawndale Christian Development Corporation [Chicago, Illinois], and others that we had worked with, and that we knew that were going to be there for the long haul.
Story_ID: 209723
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your views of the banking industry.  This is an industry that you sort of happened into, for all intents and purposes.  And, and yet, it's an industry where you've, you know, where you've enjoyed the profession and a lot of growth.  And I'm just wondering, what are your views about the future of that industry?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think we've seen all the changes that are going to take place in the industry, even though it's reinvented itself several times now.  It's--I'm not sure that I would recommend to my granddaughter that she consider a career in banking because I don't know where it's going to end up.  I think that companies are going to continue to move away from relying on banks the way they used to, which means it's another shortfall that the banks are going to have to find to make up, which means they're going to be pushing themselves off into other things unknown at this point. The industry is going to continue to consolidate, and that we've gone from sixteen thousand banks, now down to something less than ten thousand.  It's going to end up--who knows, you know, five thousand banks in the United States, which I'm not going to say whether that's good or bad.  Canada has, you know, six banks and they do very well--thank you very much.  But it's going to be very, very differently than what we see today.  There is going to be a First National Bank of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], you know, and in every city literally, as opposed to it being there as a different entity.  I think the consumer will still play the major role in banks.  Even the largest bank in the country, Citicorp [Citigroup, Inc.], has greater reliance now on the consumer part of its business than it does in any other part.  And you'll see the combination that's being proposed with Chase [Bank] and First National.  Retail banking is going to be the biggest part of that.  They needed--Chase needed a retail footing, and they'll get that through Bank One [Corporation; JPMorgan Chase & Co.].
Story_ID: 209724
Speaker 1: Now, if you were choose a career today, what would you choose?  If you were starting out, or if you were advising your granddaughter, and she wanted to be in the financial--
Speaker 2: I think the, you know, the world of money management is still going to--there's always going to be a role to be played there.  There's money out there.  And someone has got to advise people on that, so it's--maybe not necessarily the bank, but money management.  I think the, the accounting profession has had its bumps here recently, but that's something that's going to be needed for the foreseeable future when out there.  So, there are parts of the financial world that, that are going to be relevant in growth industries.  You know, banking, if you can enjoy smaller parts of it--you know, people went into banking before because it was glamorous.  It was national, international, but if you can enjoy banking being close to home, on the streets, in your neighborhood, then it can be a career for you.  But it's going to take a different mindset of a person, and so, maybe my granddaughter will be that kind of person.  I don't know, but I, you know, and banking--I'm not writing it off, but it's going to be different from the individuals we've seen in the past who're gonna enjoy it.
Story_ID: 209725
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of the black community, when you look at--because this is the, and even the--we could, you know, talk about the black community in general.  You could talk about Chicago's [Illinois] black community, you know, what you've been a part of for your whole life.  When you look at it, what hopes and concerns do you have for that community?
Speaker 2: The concerns I have would, would be economic.  We, we haven't had as much progress as we should have had--seen, which we should have seen over the last fifteen years.  People have moved into responsible positions.  People have accumulated wealth, but we don't see it going into the community still.  There's more poor people today probably than what we had twenty years ago, and it just shouldn't be like that.  The separation between the haves and the have-nots in the black community is very apparent.  And I don't see anything happening over the short term that's going to close that gap.  We've got to find a way to have the community come back together because if the community is not coming back, you know, we're not doing it, you know, from the inside.  It's hard to expect the problem to be solved from outside of the community.  There's hope there because of what you see happening in many communities, where people are moving back into communities.  There's less displacement as people move back than what we've seen in the past because the city is playing a greater role--seeing that people aren't forced to--that lower-income people aren't being forced out because the taxes, or the other costs remaining there are getting out of sight.  And so, it's forcing appropriately more economic integration within the black community.  So they're not being separated or forced into projects, or out into the, you know, Robbins [Illinois], or other areas outside the City of Chicago.  So I think that there's hope there, but we've got to accelerate that.
Story_ID: 209726
Speaker 1: What about your reconciliation of both your Asian and black side, or--your Asian ancestry because you said, "I've rejected it," at the beginning?  And I've, you know, so I want to know what that whole process was about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's rejection or just ignoring--acting like it wasn't there.  The--because the mirror wasn't in front of me all the time, you could, you, you could, you could ignore it.  But I became involved at the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], again, with starting up affinity groups, and we did the black group back in the early '80s [1980s], and I saw what value that had to its employees of the bank.  And I started up a Hispanic group within the bank which is a lot more difficult to do than the black group.  It took me many months to get the Hispanic group together.  I had tried previously with an Asian group, but was unsuccessful.  I gave up, but I went back to that after I got the Hispanic group up.  Anyway, after several years, I got the Asian group up and going.  My involvement in working with them, supporting them as an affinity group, and with them identifying with me, and then my more identifying with them as a group, encouraged me to become more active in the community.  I was asked to coach chair a dinner, a fundraising dinner for the Asian American Institute [AAI; Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and I don't know how they were sent to me, but I agreed to do it.  And that was--this was in '95 [1995], '96 [1996], my first official involvement with the Asian community outside the bank, and it was very successful, and it felt good.  And from there, I have had other involvements--very actively involved with an Asian community.  And so, I've done both and, you know, it works--it feels good.  You know, as an individual, I guess I feel better about, you know, being able to move in both worlds openly and freely and in helping both communities.  It's a good feeling.
Speaker 1: That's good, you know, because, really, in many ways, we're a United Nations sometimes internally within ourselves.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and the things I've been able to do by bringing the communities together because there's a--do you know the Maple Tree Inn over on [West] Taylor Street [sic. Old Western Avenue, Blue Island, Illinois]?  And there's a breakfast place over there on Taylor Street--great, he's shaking his head over there.  It's (laughter), it's a wonderful place for breakfast.  Lauren Hinson [ph.] owns--she's an African American, and I've gotten to know her over the years.  I've been encouraging her to expand.  Well, one day, we sat down, she sat down at my table.  And she says, "I want to expand, but I want to go into Chinatown [Chicago, Illinois]."  I said, "Why, of all places that you want to take your restaurant to Chinatown?"  She says, "I want to do that. " She says, "It's--I can go anywhere else, I know, but I want to go to Chinatown."  I said, "Okay, you're a smart lady.  You've been very successful here, and so, you know, you've thought this through."  So I--two weeks later, brought in a group of individuals from the Chinatown area, the head of the [Chicago] Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, a Chinese loan officer, a Chinese or a Japanese loan packager.  And, and they all sat down with, with Lauren and, and talked about.  And so, I've been able to do other things like that--to bring the two communities closer together.  I don't know where she is with that decision, but I mean she got good insight, input that she never could have gotten on her own because she could not have assembled a group of people to open up to her about, you know, what difficulty she might encounter, or support that she might enjoy in the community.  So it feels good, yeah--
Story_ID: 209727
Speaker 1: You've retired from the bank [Harris Trust & Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] just, you know, two weeks ago, officially, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you said you're looking forward to retirement, and I assume you'll stay civically active.  But I'm just wondering what your plans are.  What does the [HistoryMaker] Ed [Edward J.] Williams, who's still very young, you know, what does he want to do with his life?
Speaker 2: First of all, I want to get up, you know, at 6:30 rather than 5:30 every day, and that's for starters; I'm tired. But I want to continue to do many of the things that I've always done.  I want to continue to work with organizations, the communities, and I've committed to many of them--I should say, to a few of them to do that.  But I want to be able to do it on my terms now, with the flexibility that retirement allows you to do.  I couldn't have it any other way.  I enjoy it.  I think I've gotten pretty good at it.  And I think there is still a lot more that I can bring to Chicago [Illinois] and the people that need help in Chicago.
Story_ID: 209728
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, to--as one who understood, who cared, who went about trying to do something about the things that he saw out there. I don't want bells and whistles.  I don't need fireworks.  But I want people to think of me as someone that they trusted, that they could rely on--someone who knew how to find resources to benefit them.  And, you know, it's nothing fancy as far as a legacy because I haven't thought about that very much.  That's for, you know, important people to do, and I'm not that.
