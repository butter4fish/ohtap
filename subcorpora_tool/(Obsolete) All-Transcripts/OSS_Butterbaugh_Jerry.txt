 Little Thunder This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, October 18, 2017, and I   m interviewing Jerry Butterbaugh for the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Jerry, you graduated from OSU in 1969, majored in psychology and philosophy, which you turned around and applied to a varied business career. You   ve worked as vice president of real estate and construction for a convenience store chain. You did franchising and business development. You worked in the pipeline industry. Our interview today is going to focus on your undergraduate experiences and your involvement with the Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee  Society , and we   ll talk a little bit about your subsequent experiences. Thank you for coming in today.  Butterbaugh It   s a pleasure being here.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Butterbaugh I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1946. My dad graduated from Spartan School of Aeronautics and had hopes of starting a small airport in Pawhuska, and that did not pan out. By 1948, he was in Shidler and Fairfax, Oklahoma, working in oil fields. I grew up in western Osage County in very much oil territory and went to grade school, junior high, and high school at Fairfax High School, which is now combined with Ralston, is known as Woodland High School.  Little Thunder What did your mom do for a living?  Butterbaugh Mom met Dad during the war years, and a long way to answer your question, she had been a Nebraska farm girl, had gone to business school in Missouri, was working for Swift and Company in Chicago, and met this soldier. They got married in    43, and she continued to work for Swift and Company and Transportation during World War II. Then after marrying Dad, and me being born in 1946, (I   m the oldest of five children) she ended 5  up being mostly a home engineer and seeing that all her kids got educated. (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s a big job. Yeah, I was going to ask where you were in the lineup of children.  Butterbaugh Yes, ma   am, I   m the oldest. Good or bad, I   m the oldest on that one, yes, ma   am.  Little Thunder Did you have any experiences in elementary or junior high that indicated where your interests would lie in the future? Once you got into higher education, did you know that you wanted to pursue higher education?  Butterbaugh The short answer is I thought I did. Growing up where I did, it was rather traditional. You did ranch work, farm work, raised 4-H animals, hogs, so forth, and if you wanted a cash job, you worked in the oil field. I ended up working in the oil field three of the years that I was in high school, and on one year, going on wheat harvest to the north. I thought I wanted to be a petroleum engineer or a mechanical engineer. Obviously, that   s what I could see around me, and that was one of the top ranking positions in the oil industry. I got burned in the summer of 1965, July 30, in an oil field explosion. I lost my face and my arms, and I spent five weeks in the hospital. Six days after I got out of the hospital, I was down here on a Sunday, entering OSU. I was very much an albino, incredibly white. My ears were peeling. My nose, my lips were peeling.  I was fortunate that I had had very little lung damage and no significant eye damage. That became a very momentous moment because for an eighteen-year-old male in 1965, you had the draft hanging over your shoulder. Although I was bright and I had scholarships, going to ROTC and showing up and saying to the instructor,    I can   t wear the uniform,    he said,    We don   t want you anyway,    just looking at me. There were other lessons from that moment. One of those lessons was walking around this campus where everybody stares at you physically. That humanized me to the sense that when I see people that are    different,    having once been there, I have an appreciation for that. The campus was a welcoming, warm place, and I spent    65 and    66 in the College of Engineering. At that moment, OSU   s engineering department was undergoing a major curriculum change.  I was working on the   college department engineering magazine; even attended national convention on that engineering magazine. We had good professors, but the problem that the entire engineering industry had, and engineering education had, was that people were too narrowly focused. They were technically focused, and the curriculum was being changed to say to the engineers,    Go take humanities courses. Become broader. Become broader-based. We need for you guys to be broad-based. We would like to 6  see you have a management channel as well as a technical engineering channel.    That was a major event because once I was in humanities courses and starting to see an entirely different world, my opinions broadened immensely. It also exposed me to a different group of people. That led to 1966-  67, where I am questioning life. I   m questioning the Vietnam War involvement intensely. I ultimately make a change from engineering to the College of Arts and Sciences, and I am a little bit behind in catching up in requirements.  Little Thunder Now, you   re a junior at that point?  Butterbaugh No, I   m a sophomore.  Little Thunder You   re a sophomore.  Butterbaugh I   m a sophomore going through the typical examinations of life. It was a tumultuous time, both in the national community with the Vietnam War, civil rights movement, free thought movement, women   s rights. Any way you looked at it, it was slowly coming to the OSU campus, as well. We had been, as you would expect, a little bit behind the coasts in catching up.  Little Thunder Right. (Laughs) So what were some of the campus activities that you were involved with     Butterbaugh The campus   .  Little Thunder    or organizations?  Butterbaugh The quick answer was that as an engineering student, I was involved in the College of Engineering. I was working with the engineering magazine that freshman year and part of my sophomore year. I also   because of a class I took, either analytical geometry or pre-calc ulus , we had forty-seven students in the class. Six of us had American diplomas, and most of it was international students, and we studied together. It led to a lot of friends. It was a good involvement for me because, once again, it opened my eyes to an entirely different world. Some of those friends lasted all through my college years. In my senior year, I was the honorary president of the Indian Students Association.  I was also involved in IRC, which was International Relations Committee, and they hosted a social tea once a week over in the Student Union. You met people of diverse backgrounds in an informal setting, and it was a marvelous time. I had friends on the more controversial side in Students for a Democratic Society. The best man at my wedding turned out to be Dean Perry. Dean had been president of the Students for a Democratic Society, 7  and most Oklahomans considered that an incredibly radical organization at that moment. There   s other   .  Little Thunder Can you explain what their mission was?  Butterbaugh I don   t know in retrospect I can explain it fully, but there was (was and is) a great liberal movement in this country. It was philosophically an anti-war movement. If you go to its educational underpinnings, its philosophical underpinnings, you come up with a number of great philosophers, religious teachers, ethical teachers, people that spoke on this campus, people like Henry Steele Commager, the historian. I was pleased to have a couple of hours to visit with him when he spoke here. Other people that spoke was Joseph Fletcher. Joseph Fletcher is known as the father of situational ethics, and he was a man that in the   40s,   50s,   60s was for euthanasia, abortion rights. His principles, he had six founding principles, and they were primarily focused on love, that being the major issue decision. It was not sexual love. It was the love in the form of a Christian kind of love. That should be what guides your decision making. In philosophy courses, we were also studying  Dietrich  Bonhoeffer. We were studying  Martin  Heidegger, people that affected World War II immensely in ethical positions, and so it was all coming together as a conversation.  This country, this state, and this campus was facing major change. Oklahoma A M had had an incredibly dark moment in 1951 in what is known as the Johnny Bright incident, which, briefly put, is a situation where there were strong anti-black feelings expressed. This black football player from Drake University played here in OSU, and we went after him and physically harmed him. You then had the civil rights movement coming on. Oklahoma was slow to integrate, slow to participate. By the time I was here, the campus   . I had many friends, including Melvin Wade, who was, I think, president of the African American Student Association, and that was perhaps 350 people. It was also a moment of political change among the campus leadership. When I say that, you   d had a revered president retire, and in 1967, I think it is,    66, Dr.  Robert  Kamm became president. To tie some pieces together, prior to Dr. Kamm being president, he had come to the OSU campus in    58. Before that period, he had been at Drake, which ties back to the Johnny Bright incident.  He was aware of Oklahoma State. He had been prominent on the national scene. He comes in here, vice president for student affairs, and then I think, also, leading College of Arts and Sciences. Following him was Dean  James  Scales, who was a marvelous dean who had come out of Oklahoma Baptist  University , and up here and afterwards would go on to the southeast to be a noted university president himself. I have special feelings and fondness because when I made the change from engineering to arts and sciences, I needed to catch up. I go to Dean Scales and say,    I want to take 8  twenty-two hours this second semester as a sophomore.    He looks up, and he says,    You   ll be in class.    I said,    Yeah.    I ended up having forty hours of class, between all the labs and so forth. I was here. (Laughter) It was immersion at its best, and it was good for me. That was the same moment that I was meeting my wife, too, so it was an intense good moment on this campus. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Tell us that story of how you met your wife.  Butterbaugh It   s now a little bit over fifty years, but in that same analytical calc class, there were six Americans. One of those, besides me, was a red-headed Italian from Newark, New Jersey, named John Tanzola. John was dating a girl named Inez Hochla from Oklahoma City. Her roommate was a woman named Emma Dee Mode, whose father had graduated from Oklahoma State in the late   40s. One morning after class, John meets Inez on the corner of the Library steps out here, and her roommate is with her. That is the first time that I met who is now my wife, and we have, in August, celebrated our forty-eighth wedding anniversary. It all started here at the Library.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. (Laughs) Tell me   . On the one hand, the OSU campus had hosted these really fine minds, philosophers, et cetera, but there were problems that arose because of the OSU campus speakers policy. I don   t know how peripheral those were to your studies, or whether you were involved.  Butterbaugh If you don   t mind, I want to set a little historical context.  Little Thunder Sure.  Butterbaugh The period we   re talking about here at OSU is basically    66,    67,    68. On a national level, the civil rights movement was taking off in the   50s, and you had Brown versus The Board of Education. At the same time, coincidentally and even earlier, you had had the free thought, free speech issues arising. It was driven by many different factors. It was driven through the magazine industry wanting to display more features. It was driven by people wanting to speak. The McCarthy era had just ended, and that effort to control speech, and the Hollywood blacklist. Those things were coming to a conclusion and opening new doors. Part of that was the escalation of the Vietnam War, and it was a condensed period of time. Even though we define the Vietnam War as a twenty-year period from the   50s to the mid-  70s, what really happened was that the US involvement had not been significant. Some eight or nine thousand, perhaps, in the    63,    64 period. It soon, under Johnson, after Kennedy   s assassination in    63, got escalated dramatically. That brought up the discussion that was coming in from the West Coast, from Berkeley, in particular, and East Coast universities, of what constitutes a just war.  9  As a philosophy student, this was a question that showed up as a practical question in ethics courses, in philosophy of religion courses, in everyday conversations. One of the great things about Oklahoma State University was that there was a good, strong dialogue between university professors, teaching assistants, and the students themselves. The Sociology Department is pretty well-documented through the FATAGS situation. We philosophers had the Wittgenstein Club that met every Thursday night with conversations. You had the department head,  Thomas  Mayberry, there. You had  Robert  Radford there, and you had a number of students like Perry, myself, Kosted, that were dropping in. You had this informal discussion focused around one of the principal philosophers of the twentieth century, Ludwig Wittgenstein. At the same time, you would have the informal discussions going on about campus events and about world events, so you got to see your professors as humans. That was a big, important piece. That broadened my education, and that was one of the things that also changed me, yes, ma   am.  Little Thunder Thank you for that information, and especially the free thought, free speech, putting that into context. You mentioned that you also   and, of course, the Oklahoma legislature played a role in the speakers policy when it was challenged, the OSU speakers policy. You also visited the legislature for another reason, and feel free to comment on both.  Butterbaugh Campus life as it is today and was then, as well, is incredibly diverse. You had cowboys that came from ranch country; you had farmers; you had people from the big high schools in Oklahoma City and Tulsa; and you had all kinds of different majors. If there was a different flavor then than today, it was this huge emphasis on ag studies and on engineering studies. Curiously, the hotel and restaurant administration at Oklahoma State was nationally known even then, and its veterinarian college. You had these communities. You also had in the engineering building what was called the architectural pit. You have this basement pit, and because of the time, you have to imagine this place as being any place from twenty to a hundred and twenty students, nearly all males, with desks and drafting tables because we didn   t have CAD camera computers. You would have people sleeping on the floor on mattresses, coming any time of the day.  You would have a few getting sick on Saturday nights, and there were only two or three women participating in that entire architectural engineering department back then. Once again, you have a dialogue going. In that architectural pit, you found an incredible number of GDIs, which is, for lack of a better description, goddamn independents, that lived off campus and thought that way. (Laughter) Once again, you would have all the topics of human life going on. You have these events happening with the professors. As you became aware of the events, the middle-of-the-road people would be maybe the student center, student senate and its participants. You had the 10  fraternity-sorority row, which if you were a GDI, you kind of looked at as privileged and the establishment. Candidly, that group woke up late. You had these major national events happening.  You had all us males, wandering around campus, saying,    Got to keep my grades up because I don   t want to get drafted,    hoping the war would decline or go down before we had to go fight it. You had some people deeply involved with discussions about,    Do I go to Canada,    kind of questions. At the same time, these changes were affecting the state legislature. The publicity was escalating. You had groups all over the state. The Unitarian Universalists in Tulsa with a peace mission were starting to say,    The war is not right.    You had student associations. You had the Methodist center here. You also had a presence of the ministerial alliance on campus starting to stake out philosophical positions and recognize it, not so much because it was becoming popular with the students but because ethically and philosophically, they thought it was the right thing to do.  In that process, the lack of funding for university professors and the fact that we were behind became a major issue. We began to organize the Student Lobby for Higher Education, and we referred to it as SLHE. You   ll see it in the O   Colly sometimes as the Student Lobby for Education or the Student Lobby for Higher Education. Jim Gilchrist was one of the people that participated, along with a person from OU whose name slips my mind. My role in it was a commitment to OSU and a belief that something needed to be done. Specifically, we organized the students to show up at the state House and lobby on behalf of both OU and OSU, saying,    We need to be financed.    (Laughs) Without commenting too much upon political moments, that was fifty years ago. It was 1967,   68, so forth. My role was to be a participant speaker.  What I mean by that is, we needed to recruit people, and so we would go to the major lab lectures, some at the auditorium, some in the college of engineering, some in the business courses, where you could reach two hundred students, three hundred students at one time, and say,    Here   s what this is about if you feel interested.    It was nice to go to the graduate assistants and to the professors and say,    Can I have ten minutes of your course hour?    They were supportive of this. The rules were pretty simple: Keep it non-biased; explain the events; present it as a choice to the students. Once again, the campus rose to the occasion. We did have several hundred, if not thousands, show up on that campus. It drew attention to it, and it was a positive way to address a very basic need of the entire structure here in Oklahoma.  Little Thunder It brought some   was there legislative change?  11  Butterbaugh Yes, the budgets did increase there. I left Oklahoma in 1969 while some of these events were still going on. I   m not tuned with all of them, but my impression is that funding for education grew in the   70s and   80s. Then budget changes and legislative budget changes with the laws made it more difficult to raise funding and raise taxes. Without getting in today   s politics very far, I think there was a magic moment. From a political standpoint, we were as democratic then as we are as a state republican today. Taking the labels away, the fundamental conservatism was somewhat the same. There was a positive attitude on most parents, most voters. These people whose grandparents came out of the Depression, whose parents, like mine, were in World War II, education represented lifting yourself by the bootstraps. To vote on education and funding for education represented a commitment to your own children and family, and I think that moment is probably different now than it was then.  Little Thunder Did you and Emma Dee get married while you were still in school or after?  Butterbaugh I applied for the Peace Corps in 1967. Was accepted to go to India   and I declined going. In that summer of    67, I worked in Seminole, Oklahoma. Met Emma Dee shortly after that, and in the summer of    68, she took a summer job with the Jones Company in Dallas, Texas, a department store company. I had plastic surgery on my left arm in Oklahoma City to get full extension of it, and during recovery, went down to Dallas with the intent to see her for three days and come back to Oklahoma. I ended up staying the entire summer. (Laughter) I got a job with Reddy Ice, and it was swamping a truck, working in this ice plant. It literally was throwing ice, and another man catching it and putting it into storage boxes in front of and in convenience stores. It   s one of those vanities. Late that summer, I did set an ice-throwing record. I threw 4,498 ten-pound bags one day, and a man half my size caught them, which I found amazing. (Laughs)  We finally got a day off, and Emma Dee and I drove down to Austin to see the Texas State Capitol and what it was like. You have a moment in a relationship quite often that   s definitive. We stood in front of the capitol building in Austin. I turned to her, and I said,    Do you want to drive to Mexico and get married?    She looked at me and said,    I want to get married, but my mother would have a fit.    (Laughs) That was the summer of    68. We came back. The ice company had wanted me to stay on; I wanted to finish education. We came back, worked through it. We ultimately get married in the summer of    69, in August of    69. The ice company, I write them, asking for a full-time job, and I get a letter back from 7-11, their parent company. I ultimately interview with the president of 7-11 and am hired on a special program of theirs. That   s how a philosopher and psychologist ends up getting into business. (Laughter)  Little Thunder With a lot of engineering background. 12  Butterbaugh Yes, ma   am. (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s great. What have been a couple of highlight moments of your very diverse business career?  Butterbaugh I spent seventeen years in convenience stores and was fortunate to rise quickly, working for a subsidiary of what is now Kroger, a Dillon subsidiary, and going on to be vice president of real estate and construction at Stop-N-Go Foods owned by Sun Oil. That exposure took me off into Pennsylvania to Philadelphia to their world headquarters. I made a choice when I was thirty-nine, seeing what was happening in the industry, that I didn   t want to be in it. There were major changes. That industry did go through those changes, but it was gut-wrenching. Some very good companies came out of it and succeeded. A friend of mine at that time was Chet Cadieux, who labeled me the Bearded Bard of western Kansas. (Laughter) Of course, he was building QuikTrip and did an excellent job. We shared many podiums at that time. I can   t say enough good things about him. He was progressive.  He was a man who double-staffed stores when other people single-staffed them. That   s a security and safety issue. He was open and progressive in the products he bought. He was committed to large gasoline installations. He did a lot of very smart things for the industry and for that. After making the change out of the convenience store industry, I was interviewed by a headhunter, one of the major ones. I want to say it was Heidrick and Struggles. I asked him at one moment, I said,    My degree is in philosophy and psych. What should I say?    His comeback was very quick,    Say you learned to think.    That, I think, is the best comment I can give any arts and science major. It teaches you to think, if you   ve done some study and actually paid attention in class.  I went on to work for Hardee   s and for Popeyes and Church   s, which was called America   s Favorite Chicken, and to be vice president of national accounts at TCBY. They were all very good years. Often, I would keep a condo or an apartment in Atlanta or Little Rock at corporate headquarters while Emma Dee maintained a house in St. Charles, Missouri. We had a commuting marriage. One decisive moment is at AFC, America   s Favorite Chicken Company, and that was before   . I should backup a moment. Al Copeland of Popeyes fame had bought Church   s. He had overpaid by a hundred million, it went into bankruptcy, and I was part of the team that was brought in to lead them out of bankruptcy. It was also the moment of the O. J. Simpson trials. Here we are, in what   s called Perimeter on the north side of Atlanta, three very tall sky rises out there.  13  We have three floors in this nice, modern building. One floor is Popeyes, one is Church   s, and the next one is us corporate people. We go to lunch. Imagine these middle-aged, white males all going out to lunch together. More than half our staff, because it is Popeyes and Church   s, are black, and the black community has an immense loyalty to Church   s in particular. The announcement of his acquittal comes over at about lunchtime, eastern time. We return to our office, all us white males questioning the legal aspects of this trial. Our staff is in joyous celebration. (Laughter) A party has seriously begun. If nothing else, that, again, is one of those decisive, clear moments when you understand that there was truly another point of view, one that had been sublimated and had almost been kept out of sight. They were very happy people with that verdict, so that is a moment.  I ended up in those years, especially in the sales years, development years, doing twenty-two trade shows a year, which led me to have the hard life of spending five, six weeks a year in Las Vegas, and two or three at Orlando around Disney, and sometimes in Nashville, two or three. It is a caravan of gypsies, but what it also exposes you to is to the citizens of the United States, to the business people, and the number of people that want to start a business. I   m actually proud of that, that the franchise system I was a part of encouraged the foundation. It goes all the way from the McDonald   s franchisees to dealerships and people that are selling feed. There   s all kinds of franchises as a business model that can get them into business. Proud of moments? Yes. I look back and say,    Okay, we created over ten thousand jobs. Some of those are starter jobs, flipping hamburgers. Some of those are serious jobs of business ownership with significant income levels.     I am proud of participating in that, and I philosophically can look at it and say,    Yes, I think I   ve had a meaningful life.    Another piece that arose during the Popeyes and Church   s days, especially, is I   m proud of participating in Habitat for Humanity. I believe in that. I participated in building over twenty homes, some in east St. Louis, some in Atlanta, some in Little Rock. Every one of those, the homeowner, the people who own, they are participating, working. This is one of those great things that any American can participate and do, and something useful helps. The other personal charity that I participated in as a young man that I fully endorse is Big Brothers and Big Sisters. I have had three little brothers in there, one of which I   ve kept in contact with. Once again, this is a thing I think most Americans, with or without money, can participate and do. It contributes to our society. It has a meaningful effect, and I believe in that.  Little Thunder Those are wonderful things to be involved with. As you know, a lot of books have been written about the impact of the  baby  boomer generation on society. Some are positive, and some are negative. What do you think about their contributions overall?  14  Butterbaugh I find the Vietnam War a difficult subject on many levels. My daughters are forty and forty-four, and I think it was probably the oldest one that came home and said they were studying the Vietnam War in high school. This goes on to today. The Ken Burns shows have been very good because they expose something. Many Oklahomans get aggravated, but it exposed what was really happening at this moment. My daughter comes home, talking about this history class and how they   re talking about the war and the people were heroes. I   m having to choose my words very carefully when I   m talking to her. I   m saying,    Look, Hon  , on a personal level, an individual can be uninformed and have come out of an environment that says,    Support your country.    This is what you do. This is your choice. Your country drafts you, needs you, and says,    Come, be a part.       At that moment, that person is doing what they   re supposed to do, maybe with conscious thought, maybe without. If it   s conscious thought and they believe that going to a foreign country and basically stopping a war for freedom, for liberation   .  That   s what North Vietnamese were fighting for, was a civil war, wanting their own freedom to get the French out and then to get the Americans out. If you have a view that says,    I understand all the issues, and I still want to defend my country,    I disagree with that view, but I can respect it. If you were uninformed and you went simply because your family said,    This is the right thing to do,    I feel, I guess, that you should not be praised. I would like to see everybody   . It   s the philosopher in me, coming out and saying,    The unexamined life is not worth living.    I do want to see people examine life and make intelligent choices. If you came to a full understanding of the war and you were anti-war and still went, that   s philosophically a very difficult case to wrestle with. My position, because of the burns, I suspected I would not be drafted. I was drafted. I was told to show up for a physical on August 25 in Kansas City, Kansas, for induction, which was the day after I was getting married in southern Illinois.  I got the physical postponed. I showed up. I had the pin in my elbow, I had the burns, I had the scars and so forth. Of course, they looked at it and said,    We don   t want you.    That puts me in a difficult position, a different position than many of my cohorts at the time. I was a person who did not really have to worry about being drafted, so my views could be independent. They did not have to be too self-centered. I didn   t have to be anti-war because I was afraid physically, and I didn   t have to be pro-war, either. I could try to look at this and say,    What do I believe is right?    We ultimately lost the Vietnam War. It is one of those things that, to live peacefully in Oklahoma, I try not to make a big issue of that. I am not proud of the American role in Southeast Asia, and I think history and the Burns pieces will continue to show that. It is complex, it is difficult, and it did shape our entire generation.  15  Little Thunder When you come back to campus now, see the changes, what are some of your thoughts?  Butterbaugh First of all, in walking to the front of the Library today, I   m looking at that, and I   m remembering events that we had on the greens out there where we gathered lots of people and advocated for free thought and free speech. Some of those questions remain very difficult. I looked at the trees, and I said,    You know, these trees are bigger.    It is more shaded. You   re starting to get more of a feel of the campus that you would if you were east of the Mississippi at the older places, whether you   re at Purdue or Indiana University or Miami of Ohio, so forth. I like the feel of the campus. I deeply respect what the maintenance and the administration has done maintaining that. I also sit in barber shops once in a while, and I listen to people criticize the youth of today, how it   s changing, how they   re not going to amount to anything, so forth. At that moment, my philosophical readings are useful. I tell them,    Look, I can take you to Greek writings from over two thousand years ago where they were criticizing the youth of their day.     Some things don   t change. I like Oklahoma State   s vitality. I like the fact that the vast majority of these students come here for an education. Their head is in the right place. I   m hoping their heart is, too. That   s something only the future will tell. I like the campus. It   s self-maintaining. Some fundamental core that whether you graduated in 1960, 1980, 2000, or next year, it   s very similar. There   s some experiences here that don   t change. I also suspect that even though the technology advanced greatly, that the fundamental part of students coming here when they   re eighteen, nineteen, or twenty and undergoing an educational experience, living on campus, off campus, participating, I think that moment continues to get better. What would I like? I would like to see the State of Oklahoma fund this. I would like to see it be less dependent upon the finances of families. I would like to see education be open and even broader, and so in that small segment, I   m concerned the trends aren   t moving that way in Oklahoma at this time. I sincerely hope those trends get reversed.  Little Thunder Anything else that you   d like to add or share?  Butterbaugh No, not that I can think of off the top of my head. (Laughter) What question should I ask at that moment?  Little Thunder I think that   s a very eloquent thought to close on. I was going to ask about what you felt you carried from your OSU experience into your life. I think we   ve heard a lot of good examples of that.  Butterbaugh For me, personally, on a very personal level, (hopefully it   s obvious in these interviews) what OSU did was give me an opportunity. One person once told me, says,    Jerry, I can get you a job, but it   s up to you to keep it.    An 16  education is the same way. You can have an environment or a location or a place, and OSU is one of those places, one of those settings, that an education is possible. It is entirely up to the student to reach out, grab it, embrace that education. What it specifically did for me was, by choosing to participate in absolutely everything that I saw announced in the O   Colly or conversations I read about, whether it was working in the athletic cafeteria, or carrying old punch cards around this campus, or participating with Dr.  William  Rambo in the Psychology Department in survey creation, the jobs were part of it. The student discussions in Bennett, Parker, and later Hanner  Halls  were another part of it. The conversations with professors were a third part of it. Visits to the Student Union and those discussion rooms were a fourth, great part of it. That, coupled with the ultimate, living off campus as a GDI, was an exposure. It is a menu of life, and what you choose to eat off that plate is entirely dependent upon the student. If I have a message to students, it is reach out, grab it, go for it. You are personally responsible for the education you get.  Little Thunder Thank you very much for your time today, Jerry.  Butterbaugh Thank you.  -------  -------
