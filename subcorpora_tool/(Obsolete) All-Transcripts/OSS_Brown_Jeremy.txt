 Larson  Today is November 11, 2011. My name is Mary Larson, and we   re here  at the Edmon Low Library with Jeremy Brown who has been working, as  part of his duties, as the manager of Willham House. Is that your proper  title?  Event planner for OSU.  Event planner for OSU?  Yes, ma   am.  Before we start out with anything else, can you tell us a little bit about  where you were born and raised?  Yes, ma   am. I   m a native of Florida, born and raised on Amelia Island,  Florida. Spent, really, thirty-four of thirty-seven years there. I did spend  some time in Gainesville, Florida, going to school, and I also lived in  California for a year and a half as part of working for Ritz-Carlton Hotel  Corporation.  Where did you go to school when you were growing up, what high  school?  Nassau Christian Academy, a little private school. It was fun.  Near Amelia Island, there?  Near Amelia Island, yes ma   am. Born and raised, and started  kindergarten, all the way through.  What did you do after you left high school?  5  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  I went to college. I actually began working for the Amelia Island  Plantation. It   s a four-star, four-diamond resort on Amelia Island. I had a  summer job, not an internship, but job, and then went to school for a  year and a half in Gainesville and came back and worked full-time for  the Island Plantation.  What did you do after Amelia Island? Did you go on to Ritz-Carlton  after that, if you could talk a little bit about the progression of your  career?  Sure. Ultimately, we all have a decision we make, whether school or  work is best for us. I enjoyed college, but I enjoyed more working with  people. While going to school in Gainesville, I got a job as an assistant  manager of a suit and sport coat store. Selling clothes is really fun for  me, but in any sales position, there   s that    you   ve got to sell to have a  paycheck/commission.    While I enjoyed helping people with suit sales, I  learned that I really enjoyed helping people with resorts because the  product is already selling itself because it   s quality. Then as customer  service, you   re just delivering on the quality that   s there. So after  working for a year and a half in retail, I went back home and continued  working again for the Plantation and then spent about four to four and a  half years with them working the positions of bell, doorman, valet,  concierge, and then Guest Services Director over all those positions.  That would   ve been quite a position because that   s a well-known resort.  It is, and they do well. Then the other challenge we had during that time  was the Plantation is a condo complex association. The Plantation builds  the condos, sells the condos, then leases the condos to the owners who  buy them, so we   re kind of a property management company. Then  throughout that 1,700 acres are homes that people build, so you   re both  sustaining residencies and being part of a hotel experience, and then we  build a hotel of 240 rooms. It was kind of an all-everything position. I  learned a lot. It was a good experience.  So where did you go after that?  To the Ritz-Carlton. In the world of hotel companies, the Plantation is  great, but they are a one-owner, one-owned property, and so they   ve  achieved four-diamond, four-star status. Being part of the Ritz-Carlton is  not just national brand but an international brand. When I relocated to  Palm Springs, California, with my then-fianc   to be married, I began  working for the Ritz-Carlton and Rancho Mirage Ritz-Carlton in Palm  Valley. I worked for them for a year and a half and then transferred back  to home, which is Florida, for the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island and  worked there for ten years.  6  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  What positions did you have when you were working there?  At the Ritz?  Yes.  Well, working the Plantation, most of my experience was in the front of  the house. This may sound humbling or whatever, but I hated calling the  911 page for all the managers. All the managers would come to your  department, let   s say check-in or check-out, or a big bus pulls in, and  they stand there not having a clue of what to do because they may be a  food and beverage director, but they have no idea how to check a guest  in. I wanted to be more grounded and always had the pursuit of being in  hotel management, and I wanted to be the guy that was calm that could  kind of figure things out and not stand there. That   s unusual because  most general managers of big hotels come up one chain or the other,  either food and beverage or lodging, but I wanted to be both.  I began working food and beverage and started out in room service, the  kind of basic intro 101 of how to do food and quality. It   s a twenty-four  hour operation, so that was breakfast, lunch, dinner, or overnight shift  sometimes, and worked that for a year and a half. Then transitioned to  the caf  , which is a three-meal restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch,  and dinner. No overnight, naturally, but they will open the restaurant at  six-thirty, and one flow of sequence continues into the other until the  evening is done at ten o   clock or later. I was with them for two and a  half years and transitioned from them to manager of Destination  Services, which were coming into booking hotel talent and live bands  and musicians and props and entertainment and tables and chairs and  linens and creating elaborate weddings. Just being all things to all people  as a DMC  Destination Management Company  representative taught  me a lot, however pay was not so good.  I went back to food and beverage and then began working in fine dining  for the restaurant called The Grill. You may or may not have heard of it,  but they are five-diamond, five-star, at a five-diamond, five-star  restaurant. They were the only five-diamond, five-star restaurant to  achieve that quality for eleven years, which no other place in Florida can  say that. That   s amazing when you consider Miami, Orlando, Dade,  South County, and Palm Beach. I mean, it   s really something, but it was  an amenity, if that makes sense to you, so it lost more money than it  gained. So we transitioned to Salt, a fine-dining restaurant, and made it a  four-diamond, four-star restaurant, allowed the guests to dress more  casual who were already coming to the beach anyway and may not have  packed a jacket and tie. That   s when the restaurant did amazingly well.  7  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  So that would be my last four and a half years at the Ritz-Carlton was  spent in fine dining.  Okay. I just wanted to give people a sense of how it was that you got to  this position and what you were bringing with you.  Yes, there   s a lot that I   ve been blessed to do in my life so far. For being  thirty-seven and having sixteen years in hotel resort experience, that   s a  lot.  So how did you end up applying for the OSU position?  It   s kind of a unique story. Applying from Florida to here, there were a  lot of positions available. This particular position was available, of all  things, through temp services, Express Employment. I looked for two  and a half, three months before we arrived, and we moved here, as you  know, for church. I   m also an ordained minister, and I   m a licensed  sommelier. I can bless the wine and pick out a good one at the same  time, (Laughter) so it   s kind of the best of both worlds. We moved here  for ulterior reasons and kept just absolutely pounding the market trying  to find the right job for my family. With all you   ve heard that I   ve done,  there was that    You   re overqualified    for some of these lower positions  or,    Would the hours work with trying to build a church?    was  challenging.  I hate to say my darkest day that was the slightly brightest day. I  thought,    It can   t get any worse. I   m going to a temp agency, and we   ll  see what happens.    I met the manager, and he said,    I have a job at OSU  I never thought I could fill.    I said,    What is that?    He said,    Well, the  Hargises need an event planner,    and I said,    Who are they?    (Laughs)  He said,    Well, they   re the president of Oklahoma State University.    I  said,    Oh, you mean that big college over there?    (Laughs) He said,     Yes, that big college over there.    I interviewed and met Mrs.  Ann   Hargis and Rick Krysiak, the Director of Physical Plant, and they had a  specific need. The house was in a state of disrepair. It   s not that it   s not  of quality because OSU is quality, but when you have a    61 structure  that the president doesn   t have time to be there half the time because of  traveling, and the maintenance people who work the house only work  the house when calls are made, you   re constantly chasing your tail. So  there was a two-prong position. One is,    Handle the events for the  president and his wife, let the guests in and out, and be there for the  catering and set-up and tear-down,    and then there was,    Help us repair  the state of the home.     Right, because my understanding is that there   s really no one that   s  assigned to Willham House just on its own. There   s no staff that   s  8  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  specific to the house.  Right. We have people who it   s their area of emphasis, but our  electricians will do all the other electrician jobs they   re called to do. We  do have someone who   s trained and has been in the house and has the  right people-person skills to be around the president. We have to run  background checks on the people because there are priceless works of  art that are in that home on loan from OSU   s university art department.  You   ve got to have a mixture of all things to be able to be in the  president   s house.  Right. So what charges were you given, if you could talk a little about  the description of your job, your responsibilities, what charges you were  given when you first arrived?  Well, it   s an undefined role, to be quite honest with you, ever-involving,  because you have to walk a fine line. I actually drove by the house  before I took the position. I thought,    Dear God, this place does not look  that good.    (Laughs) It was a January-February time, so the weather   s  poor. It just is not an appealing structure when you look at it. It   s got the  history to it, which is nice, but it   s dated, is the best way of saying it.  The first day I walked the house with Mrs. Hargis, we noticed a lot of  glaring things. For instance, you have a handicapped-accessible  restroom on the second level. You do not have a handicapped-accessible  walk path, nor did you install   not her, but the people   handicapped-accessible  door handles, so if ever a guest would go all-terrain across the  grass to get into the lower basement for an event, you   ve not even made  it accessible for them to enter the structure. That   s a small example of  day one.    What are you all thinking? How do we get this to a state of  quality that wasn   t there?    So structure was a big emphasis from Rick  Krysiak and from Mrs. Hargis of,    Help us repair the facility.     Then the president   s office was handling the catered events, but the  person who was there prior to me had stepped away, and it was an  overbearing stress load for the ladies who were there. With my catering  experience, it was easy for me to assimilate and handle the catering  aspects, and it was part of my job description from the beginning. Our  first big challenge was getting the house into a state that was  presentable, if that makes sense. I mean, I know they had been using it  that way, but there   s a lot of changes we made for the better.  Well, and that   s something that maybe we can talk about a little bit,  about division between public and private spaces. When you got there,  what was public, what was private?  9  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Well, you obviously have the master suite of the Hargises, and that   s a  space that we enter because we have to clean, obviously, her private  quarters. I don   t think, unless it   s a personal friend of hers, guests go  there. I certainly never intentionally have ever taken anyone through that  area. That   s kind of her private space. Really, the heart of what I saw  (and you   ve heard this from being an OSU employee) there   s a big push  for tearing down the Willham House because it is so dated. It isn   t what  you expect a president to be in, especially when you compare the  facilities of Karsten Creek, the OSU football stadium. There   s a level of  quality being established that isn   t there for the president. They   re not  complaining about it. They   re gracious people, but you have to think  long-term. When we hire the next president, and his home is elaborate,  and he   s making whatever money he   s making before he or she joins us,  would they want to live in this house? That   s a part of the problem with  having such a dated structure that we have.  They   ve expanded to it throughout the years, but there   s that mixture of     Do you demo it, or do you build new?    The reason that   s there is the  basement has its limitations. You can only seat forty-eight guests for  dinner. It   s hard for me as an event planner to contact a student group  and say,    You have been chosen to come to the president   s house,  however please keep your numbers below fifty because we just can   t  handle a group of that size.    It   s just, we   re doing things that were never  designed for the structure to happen.  My understanding from talking to other people and talking to Richard  Willham whose parents were there when the house was designed, it was  a much more private space. It wasn   t where all of the events were held  at the time that it was designed.  That   s right. Entertaining by the president has grown tremendously from  president to president because it is an honor for students or faculty or  staff or the community to be invited into the home of the president. It   s a  personal thing that I don   t think was there in the    60s and    70s, not that  they didn   t do it at all, but not to the level that it   s done today.  Yes, I think there   s much more outreach expected of presidents now than  there might have been then.  Sure.  Now, when you first got to the house   just for the record, when did you  actually arrive as an OSU employee?  Well, I don   t think a temp is an OSU employee, but in May.  10  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Okay, right.  I   m not sure.  Well, when did you start with OSU in whatever capacity?  I think it   s February 22 was the first day I walked into the Willham  House, day one, job one.  And that was 2010?  Yes, and that   s through Express Employment, as an Express employee,  contract personnel. I could not attain full-time status with OSU until July  1 of 2010 because that   s when the new fiscal year began and the budget  was there to bring me on full-time. It was a temp role.    Let   s see if this  person works or doesn   t work and how it interworks with the Hargises     because it   s difficult to have people always in your home. Even though  you   re doing great things for the house, there has to be a comfort level  there. That would be awkward if they were in my home as often as was  needed to turn the house around.  When you first arrived, can you talk a little bit about the layout of the  rooms, any special features?  Special being attractive, or special being negative?  Actually, either way, but I   m thinking things that are a little unusual,  maybe like the cabinetry in the hallway or     Well, I really wanted the place to look better as a whole. When you   re  trained at the level that I am, as a Ritz-Carlton employee, you do things  to the level of a five-diamond, five-star resort. It   s ingrained in me. I  can   t pull it out if I wanted to. If I walk into even a restroom and I see  that the counters have a broken caulk line around the sink or on the  backsplash, or the mirror   s been cleaned but it   s not cleaned to the  corners, or the toilet was wiped but the seat   s still dirty from underneath,  those are all things that the Ritz-Carlton has trained us to make sure the  complete look is there. I had to instruct or teach our housekeepers to not  just clean what you see but clean what you don   t. If you   re not touching  an item, then how do you know it   s clean? You can   t assume it   s dust-free  unless you   ve picked the item up and wiped it and then wiped under  it and thoroughly cleaned. There isn   t that level of training in the  position until I arrived. Those are the kind of the things that I see when I  first got there. Does that make sense?  Yes.  11  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  The house, to touch on something that we   re probably going to get to,  the biggest challenge as an event planner for the house is the president   s  personal kitchen space that they have in the upstairs area. They have a  small Dutch oven, and most caterers use hotel pans which are forty-eight  by twenty-four. You couldn   t even fit half a hotel pan in the Dutch oven,  so not only are the caterers naturally cooking 90 percent of the things  off-property, they   re not really able to sustain the level of heat or quality  that they want. Then most events are downstairs, so they and the staff  are trucking everything downstairs as they serve. As the Hargises come  in to get ready for their event, they   re walking through carts and cooks  and servers and personnel. There   s a lot that we were able to accomplish  to give the Hargises, or whoever is the president, their own space. That  was the biggest challenge.  So for people who haven   t been to the Willham House, let   s talk a little  bit about the layout of the top floor and the layout of the basement and  why you have those issues. What rooms   as you walk in the house from  the main entrance, how are things laid out on the top floor?  Well, the main entranceway is open. It was a partition wall (as I learned  from Mr.  Richard  Willham   s interview with you) that was meant to be  a sitting area for the president and the fireplace or their guests. That has  been made open, and it was done before I arrived. The natural  entranceway is an open area that can entertain thirty, thirty-five guests, I  would say. Then as you proceed into their den, small ten-by-twelve  room, I would say, for watching television, kind of relaxing, then you  have the small kitchen area that is all    61. Even the hood of the  president   s home is a    61 hood, still, that still works. It has been  modernized slightly, but I think it   s the original cabinetry. I don   t think  it   s been modified at all. Then you head into their office, or his office.  Then you have the garage and laundry areas. As you come back to the  main heart of the room, the house breaks. I believe it   s east-west. On the  east is the Hargises    suite. I could be wrong about north, south, east,  west, sorry.  Well, no, and I   m not sure. I think it would be the west is the Hargises     suite, and the east     Sun rises in the east and sets in the west, so maybe it   s north-south  because I know it comes up over the front of the     Okay.  Yes. Let   s say north, then. To the north is the guest suites, and to the  south is the Hargises    suite. They had (they being the physical plant)  12  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  renovated their suite, the Hargises    suite, I   m told, ten or twelve years  ago, and it was an addition. It   s kind of boxy, if it makes sense, almost  like a mouse maze, the way it lays out.  And that   s to the left, right after you come into the main entrance.  To the left, yes, ma   am. Then to the right is the guest suite area. There  are two rear bedrooms that, one, has Mrs. Hargis    desk in, and the other  is open for guests to use.  You talked a little bit about some of the previous changes that you knew  had been made. In the time that you   ve been here, what changes do you  know of that have been made to buildings and grounds?  I don   t know if you have enough tape. (Laughter)  Let   s hit the highlights, I guess.  Sure. Well, and this was before I was even hired, but the ADA  accessible walk path was huge, and that decision was made. I sat in on  the meetings of the planning of it, how it was going to be shaped and  curved and layered. It was already approved. I just happened to be there.  That   s huge because now catering companies can come park in the lower  parking lot and enter along the walk path into the lower basement, and  that gives the Hargises their own space, and it gives them direct access  to where most events are held. We changed the carpet in the basement. It  was absolutely dated and dark and stained and reminded me of a  dungeon when we walked into it. We installed new carpeting into the  area and made it look more attractive, not just because it   s new carpet  but the way that we laid out the patterns was almost more like a hotel  lobby so that when you   re setting up tables or chairs or sitting areas, it   s  a more attractive flow.  We added a beverage bar. There was a storage locker that we had for  beverages, and we made that into a drink station with a stainless steel  sink and an icemaker and a coffee maker and added power to a wall. It  sounds kind of simple, but it had to be 220 so that you could have  induction burners available to cook because Mrs. Hargis and the  president enjoy an action station. Instead of just passed hors d'oeuvres at  an event, we then can offer a pasta station or a chili station or an omelet  station for breakfast. It gives us the ability to do more things in  entertainment.  And for people who haven   t been in Willham House, having the caterers  be able to come in on that lower level is huge     13  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  It really is.     because the stairwell is very small and not circular but it has a  landing in the middle there, and it   s not that wide.  Right, and it   s dangerous for servers to carry trays, ascending stairs. All  the food would then come down to the event, so it was a safety issue as  well as form and function.  And for guests, too, because the guests are trying to go up and down the  stairs because if everybody   s coming in through the main door   so this  way you can bring in guests through the main door or through the lower  entrance, and you   re not running into catering at the same time.  Yes. Everything that we   ve done has really made the space function  better. We have not added a new wall or bumped out the existing floor  print of the home itself, the structure. We have just modified things  within the structure to make it more functioning or more attractive.  That   s kind of a nutshell. One of the things that drove me crazy is all of  the bathrooms were painted the same color, all an off-white yellow, yet  each bathroom had a wainsboarding going across the bottom.  Wainsboarding is usually in a room to break up the eye. What did you  install wainsboarding for if everything is the same color? Even working  with physical plant to change each restroom to its own color scheme or  break up the eye in color is a small thing that makes the space look  better, so we   ve done a lot to make the home look better.  And my understanding from talking to Mrs. Hargis is that a lot of this  was done in conjunction with different classes who were able to use the  president   s home as a lab, essentially.  Yes, ma   am. The first one was a light study program that was there  before really any major changes occurred. I came on, and the light  program was finishing in the last month. It was a full semester that it had  happened for, so I just caught the tail end of that light study program. It  takes time for those things to work, but we have changed most of the  photo essence (or whatever the term is) bulbs to a better bulb from that  light study program that puts out more energy and uses less power. So,  those things, you   re right, they do help shape the president   s house.  And it gives students a way to not only see the president   s house but to  use it as a lab, although that makes the president and his wife sound a  bit like guinea pigs. (Laughs) I know Mrs. Hargis had said she wanted  things to be interactive, I mean, that they had both wanted that.  Yes. To her credit, she goes out once a week, and she visits parts of  14  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  campus. I think it   s on Mondays. She   ll go into the engineering lab, and  she   ll go into science labs. If she, in the process of meeting the students,  staff, and faculty, if they need a space to do something, she   s always  willing to offer the president   s house for that space. She wants the home  to have life.  And that   s a much more public use of it than what it was getting in a lot  of its former incarnations, I guess.  Exactly.  Are there any future changes, I mean, any modifications that you   re  looking at of the current house at present?  Mrs. Hargis has asked us and the housekeeper who cleans house,    If  you   re designing this space, what would you do?    I think that   s great  because as a nutshell   there   s a gentleman I met that actually renovated,  or not even renovated, when they built the stadium, he   s the overall chef  of everything. He was able to exactly pick out how he wanted the line  set up, where he wanted the dishwashing, how he wanted the coolers,  what size loading docks. I mean, he was involved in everything because  he had the vision, and they believed in his vision. He can execute the  operation to a level that amazes them. I like that she looks at the staff  that way and says,    How can we make this work better for both you, the  caterers, and the future presidents of Oklahoma State University?     There   s been, going back, that battle between demoing and building  anew. There   s a big thought of retaining the main entrance area where  the hardwood floor is, keeping that as the center of the structure and  adding on (I think we determined that was north) and making the  basement larger and building more guest suites so that when we have the  big donors that come in that want to stay with the president, they have a  more appointed facility to what level they   re used to traveling in.  Because right now, the guest bathroom is the    61 bathroom with    61 tile  and the faucets and features. They   re just not to the standards of today   s  guest travelers. When you have guests that can give you a multi-million  dollar check, you really want to impress them with all things that are  OSU. I believe they are going to expand the house and the basement.  There has been no approval of that. There   s no budget meeting about it  yet. That   s just what the Hargises have said, meeting with the engineers  is,    Let   s make the entertainment area larger so that we can entertain  more guests and not make everyone conform to    It   s fifty or less.        Right, and that   s a very public space, so it   s really general OSU space.  It is.  15  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  It   s not as if they   re enlarging the master suite or something.  Right. They   re trying to make the home more functioning for catering  and also more functioning for bringing in those big donors that make  OSU successful, really.  Now, we talked a little bit about entertaining issues and space. Are there  any other things that you were able to do, either with staffing or layouts  or just little changes in how something was arranged to help facilitate  catering and event planning?  Yes. The previous housekeeper was a fine lady. She was trained by  physical plant to do custodial-level cleaning. With my resort-level  training, I had to work to find the right person who was willing to accept  those new responsibilities, to clean to another level than they had before.  We were able to find Pauline Hall who had worked at the Atherton Hotel  for thirty-two years. Because she is hotel trained, which is many degrees  higher than custodial, she was able to come in, and I was able to train  her on how to clean to a level that Mrs. Hargis wanted the home to be  because she, quite frankly, does not have time to be there to point out  everything that she needs done. Her and President Hargis    travel  schedule is insane, all that they do for OSU, and work with the  Foundation and take trips. It   s amazing how much they   re on the road,  working for Oklahoma State University. That was a big change, and then  giving her the tools to do the job right, and giving her a training  checklist of what to do on a Monday, a Tuesday, a Wednesday, a  Thursday, a Friday.  We installed a deep-cleaning Wednesday so that you would know  throughout a month on that first Wednesday, it   s time to go into the  master suite and pull the bed from the wall, pull the furniture from the  wall, pick up the rug, shake it out, move everything off, clean that whole  area, mop it, sweep it, vacuum it, dust it. You fully detail every area of  that suite, and you know once it   s been done once a month, then on the  next Wednesday, it   s the living room. On the third Wednesday, it   s the  guest suites. On the fourth, it   s the living room, the den area. When you  clean to that level, you don   t have dust bunnies sitting around for six  months or eight months or even longer. It takes time to get the home up  to that quality, but she was able to do that for us. That   s an idea of staff.  What was the other question?  Oh, just with catering or entertaining, was there anything else you were  able to do? You mentioned, I mean, smaller things like having the  beverage station put in and the electrical outlets. Were there any other  things that you were able to arrange or rearrange, anything like that?  16  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  As it pertains to the house?  Right.  There was a folding accordion partition that was on both sides of the  fireplace, so as you ascend the steps, you have the blocks. You don   t see  the back. When we added the beverage counter area, the stainless steel  area I mentioned before, we took that locker storage and put it behind  the brick wall. Well, that   s also where the tables and chairs, at one time,  were kept. Thankfully, we ordered new tables and chairs because the  tables were    60s or    70 models. They honestly were about 125 pounds  apiece, and so as you are rolling these heavy oak tables, if it fell over, a  lady could not pick it up and put it into the right position. There was a  safety concern.  We ordered Mity-Lite chairs, and we demoed that accordion door that  wasn   t needed in the first place because you had one that was blocking  the space. We added a set of western doors so that servers can come and  go, and you   re not always seeing into the back of the heart of the house  as chefs are plating up or cooks are breaking down things. It   s, in a way,  cosmetic, but it   s also more, in a way, function. We just made things  function more.  Well, especially the western doors for servers because that   s a lot easier  than having those     Accordion doors, yes.     accordion doors. You need to be able to have easy access to and from  when you   re carrying trays.  And you need to be able to see either the feet or the head of someone  coming in so there isn   t that collision as you go back and forth. There   s  been a good number of changes, but the space is functioning to a level  that has never been before. The more important thing is we   re  entertaining on a level that no president has done so before. We average  eighteen to twenty events per semester or greater. When you think of all  of the days the Hargises are already on the road doing other things, most  of these events happen on a Monday and a Tuesday night. We do have,  from my position as the University Club manager, dinners at the  president   s house with Ann and Burns Hargis, and we have the  Foundation using the home much more now, whether it be on the lawn  for a tent event or a distinguished alumni breakfast.  The house is really a full-time position, as a catering manager that I am,  17  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  because of all the different things. President Hargis    confidence in the  house has risen to a level that when he has a dignitary visiting from  somewhere else and he has all the options of Ranchers Club or lunch at  one of the local businesses or dinner in Oklahoma City, one of his first  thoughts now is,    Well, let   s have it at the house,    because there is such  a quality there. You can have a private conversation and not be in a  public setting and discuss things. Of all the changes we   ve made, there   s  also a lot of little subtle differences like that that help make his job as  president easier.  Just talking about staff, now, as we said earlier, there aren   t people who  are exclusively attached to the house, but what positions do you  coordinate with in your work? It sounds like different people at physical  plant.  Yes, ma   am. Well, there was the housekeeper. Pauline Hall was a full-time  housekeeper for the president   s house, but she also cleaned on  campus the president   s office and was associated with the Atherton  Hotel. Her main area of emphasis was the Willham House, so she is that  one dedicated employee. We have a groundskeeper, Kim Ward, who  was hired since I was there. I was not part of the hiring process, but she  has done an outstanding job as the director of grounds for Willham. And  then she works within her own physical plant people, coordinating the  grass being cut, hedges being trimmed, edging, blowing, mowing, all  those kinds of things, and the changings of the flowerbeds that happen  three, four, five times a year, depending on what needs to be done.  Then there   s a maintenance man that   s assigned to the president   s house  who doesn   t office there, and he will do other projects on campus. If we  have a call, we get consistently the same person because (I think you can  sidebar this) you have to have background screenings on these people  because they   re working around expensive art, and they   re around the  public, and you   ve got to make sure they look right. We have some  people, that   s their direction. That   s what they do. If I got a call from  Mrs. Hargis now that the washing machine was broken, then I call this  one person, and his name is Nate Nichols. He goes out, and he   ll work  on that repair item, and he has a key for the president   s house. There   s  only a few people on campus that have a key and access into the  president   s house.  Okay. Now, we   ve talked a little bit about events at Willham House.  What are some of the annual events that you know of?  We don   t really have an annual event.  Okay.  18  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  I just had a meeting yesterday with Mrs. Hargis and the ladies of the  president   s office, and we consistently are striving to bring in new guests  all the time. There was a unique story. Dennicia  Craft , who works at  the OSU Football stadium, (she   s actually, I think, Mike Holder   s  assistant) has been here thirty-three or thirty-eight years. She had never  been to the president   s house until two nights ago when we had an  athletic appreciation event. That touches Mrs. Hargis    heart in a big way  because she wants the home to be seen by as many people as possible, to  have that chance to interact with them on a personal level. We don   t  have a repeat, for sure.  If I had to pick the closest thing, we have students called President   s  Partners, formerly President   s Posse. They sign up through SAB   Student Alumni Board , and they are assigned to work the presidential  events with us, and they will come out and be the guides or the door  openers or the coat checkers. What it does is it allows our guests to ask  current questions of current students in their positions because a lot of  what we have aren   t just students that come to the house. They   re board  of directors, they   re people of all levels, and they want to know,    Hey, if  I   m giving to OSU, what   s your feedback on your current quality of  education?    That   s the primary reason they came to be part of  President   s Partners.  Okay. What are some memorable special events that you can think of  that have been held at Willham House since you   ve been there?  Memorable to me, or memorable as to the impact of Oklahoma State  University? Like, what   s   give me the guidance, if you would.  Either way, actually. I mean, things that stood out to you that either on a  personal level made an impression or that you thought were particularly  outstanding.  Well, we hosted Wondertorium. That   s a new area of student building     not student, but for the children of Oklahoma State, children of  Stillwater, really, not just OSU. Mrs. Hargis is on the board, I think, of  Wondertorium. Her and President Hargis are on many honorary boards  within Stillwater and within Oklahoma City and other communities. At  the Wondertorium event the whole idea is to gain money or gather  money to help support the building, and there was a lady there who  signed up to sponsor a whole room of toys and things for children. You  like to be a part of those impactful life-changing moments, and that   s  kind of a group that comes to mind.  What was also really fun, we had an Easter party at the president   s  19  Larson  Brown  Larson  house, and we brought out the Easter Bunny and Pistol Pete and had  slides and did an egg hunt. President Hargis and Mrs. Hargis really  enjoyed   they created that event to target the neighbors of the Willham  House because they   re so busy they don   t really see them, but they want  to be endearing to the community. They brought out their kids and their  grandkids and their family, and it was a family fun day. It was really  good to have that. I   m sure there   s more I can think of, but those are two  things that come to mind.  Yes. Now, in talking about how things are hosted at Willham House, I  mean, is there an application process, or is it just interactions between  students and the Hargises, or student groups will make a request?  It can be anything. It can be Mrs. Hargis touring on Mondays, sees a  group that has done something that has caught her eye. A great example  is, I think it   s the national meat judging team that we have. They   re  national champions. She was at home reading a paper, and the paper said  that    OSU   s agricultural students win third national title,    in this area or  something. Those national titles   although football and basketball and  those things are the big things that sell the t-shirts and the hats and the  memorabilia, having the overall national titles is huge to our program at  OSU. And so, just from her reading the paper, she says,    Jeremy, would  you contact them? Look at our calendars and see a date that we can  bring them in and say,    Thank you for all that you do.        There isn   t a specific route. Do we field calls at the president   s house  from groups that want to come and be entertained by the Hargises?  Absolutely. Sometimes President Hargis can be meeting with someone  during the course of a normal meeting like the Foundation and say,    Hey  Jeremy, can you make an event happen for thirty people in two days? I  want to acknowledge that they   re coming over for the great job that  they   ve done hitting this goal, raising money for the Foundation.       Yes,  sir, we   ll make it happen.    It   s from all areas. There isn   t a specific.  What we have done since I   ve been hired, it seemed to me, not to  generalize, in my first semester working, there wasn   t necessarily a  calendar of events. There was,    This person   s called the president   s  office. They   d like to come. President Hargis has agreed.    I felt like I  was always chasing my tail because not laying myself out for success as  events, it was more read and react. So after our first semester, we were  able to sit down, have a logistics planning meeting, and figure out what  groups do we want to have, what dates are available, and bring them in  that way, not that pop-ups don   t still occur.  So you were able to put together more of a game plan?  20  Brown  Larson  Brown  Exactly. We just had a meeting yesterday and selected, I think it   s  sixteen groups, and we have twenty-one possible Monday-Tuesdays that  the Hargises plan on being here. It always changes, phone calls made,  they   ve got to be somewhere. There   s only, of the upcoming semester,  only twenty-one days that we have that we can do things with. So that   s  part of the challenge, and then being ready for whatever pop-ups occur.  Now, we   ve talked a little bit about some of the things that have been  addressed, some of the weak points of the house. What do you think are  the best points of the house, the way it is right now?  Well, it   s the catch twenty-two. Because it   s smaller, it   s a more cozier  environment. I   ve heard this in event planning: You   d rather have 50  people in a small room than 150 people in a ginormous room and feel  like no one   s there. Once you hit twenty-five, thirty upstairs, you   ve  filled the room. It   s a funner party because conversations are flowing.  It   s easier to play live instrument music upstairs because it fills the room  very well. That   s a positive to it. The same with the basement. When  you have forty-eight guests for dinner and you   re elbow-to-elbow in that  space, you can stand up and make a presentation or discuss a wine, or  President Hargis can address students who are there, and his voice  naturally fills the space well. That   s one of the more attractive things, I  think. Then parking is very well there because you have the lower area  and you have the upstairs area. It fits well for the size of who we are and  what we do.  I think one of the fun things about my position is I get to meet the level  of dignitaries that come to Oklahoma State University, and that   s an  honor in itself to meet celebrities and meet people and to know that my  job is impacting people who may remember this memory or moment for  the rest of their lives. A funny story, side note, we had a young man who  came to the president   s house. He   s now in politics. I can   t remember his  official title, but he had came to the house before I was hired. There   s a  sliding glass door that   s upstairs that goes from the main living room to  the outside patio. In the midst of conversation he basically did the bird  thing and walked right into a glass door. (Laughs)  So it   s really funny because here   s this man who   s now in politics that  comes back, and he keeps looking over at this door. He says,    Mrs.  Hargis, you were here. Do you remember a student walking into a  door?    She was like,    Yes I do. It was so funny, and I felt so bad at the  same time.    He was like,    I was that student.    She was like,    Oh, man   We need to put a fleur-de-lis sticker on there or something so you see  it,    because when you clean that well you just can   t see it sometimes.  (Laughter)  21  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  Larson  Brown  It   s that kind of funny moment that, I won   t say shaped a life, but it   s a  funny thing. I think for all the talents I   ve worked in life, you   ve got to  be multi-faceted to be able to be the president   s event planner because  you   ve got to meet people and be able to treat them, the delegates or the  stars, as if they   re people and not lather all over yourself and get in a  tithy or spill extra coffee or do the things that sometimes people will do  when they become star struck. People are people, and if you treat them  that way, they respect you so much more than if you   re shaking like  crazy and can   t function.  Besides the bird-door story    (Laughter)  Isn   t that funny?     any special recollections or any stories about Willham House that  you   d like to relate that we haven   t talked about?  Such as?  I mean, just any memorable stories or any odd     I   ve got to think about that one.  Okay.  I don   t know. Any odd things. There   s so much that   s happened.  I was going to say they don   t necessarily have to be odd, but, I mean,  this would be kind of like the special events, too. Anything that was just  particularly memorable or anything that maybe someone said about the  house or expressed about the house that you kind of thought,    Oh, I  hadn   t thought of it that way before.     Well, it all depends on who you meet, and that   s the challenge in the  community. There are people who have lived in this city their whole  lives, and when they see the president   s house, they see a beautiful  home. It looks regal to them from the street. It has that big floor-to-ceiling  glass, and it   s two stories, and the structure to them looks  magnificent. Then there   s that level of giver that visits the president   s  house and thinks,    Whew, this is really behind the times. You all  deserve something better.    It   s walking that fine line of wanting to be all  things to all people. If we demo the house, there   s going to be an outrage  to some extent in the Stillwater community. If we don   t do it, then it   s  embarrassing to bring someone who has a billion dollar mansion into it  and say,    Be our guest tonight.       How does this thing work? I   m not  used to a    61 faucet?    (Laughter) I   m exaggerating slightly, but it   s hard  22  Larson  Brown  for the Hargises to walk that perfect line.  We have so many events, and we   ve had so much success that we   re  always growing, we   re always changing. Part of this position that is not  in the job description was reshaping the way catering is done because  there   s a certain quality that we   re looking for when you   re entertaining  the guests of the president   s house. We really had to kind of shape OSU  Celebrations into providing that quality that they weren   t providing. It   s  embarrassing when you have, as President Hargis said, some of the  items we   re serving, you could get in the food court. We want to have  more unique items than the student or guest wouldn   t necessarily find on  campus, like a chicken popper. I mean, come on. That   s KFC.  Challenging them to step up to another quality level to meet the  Hargises    expectations and myself has been a real blessing. Once they  are achieving that level of success, how much better are they now in the  Stillwater community, serving all their other guests that call for catered  events. Ben Coffin has been a great person to work with at Celebrations,  and he has really created a first-class, as we call it, president   s menu, to  make things better.  Good. Are there any things that we haven   t talked about yet that you   d  like to discuss, anything about room layouts or public/private spaces or  anything about the management of the house that we haven   t touched  on?  Not that I can think of. The people of OSU are really dedicated to doing  whatever the president requests. The people of physical plant, it   s kind  of hard for them because they   re offsite, obviously. Different presidents  have had different policies. For instance, there was a president who  would not allow any physical plant vehicles to come up the drive unless  they had an appointment first. Well, if you think about how much the  Hargises travel, how is it possible for the grounds keeping, the  maintenance, the electrical people, any one of twenty trucks that could  come up the drive on a given day to do things for our property that   s  nine acres of serviceable real estate? I commend the job that they do,  trying to be as politically sensitive as they can be and cater to the  requests of the president   s house and to make the home what it should  be: the pride of Oklahoma State University.  We   ve done a great job changing the way, in small ways, to make it  more attractive, more presentable. I hear that from a lot of guests that  come and say,    I visited five years ago,    or,    I visited two years ago, and  this looks nice. This looks so much better. You guys have done a really  good job making this flow better, making it more functioning, and  making it more appealing.    I guess if I have a one-last-will-and-testament  request, I think it needs a new paint job. I know we take pride  23  Larson  Brown  in OSU orange and brown, but I think that a curb-appeal class, which  we   re actually working on now, would do a real justice to the home. It   s  time to just kind of give it that painting facelift that may make it pop  more from the street. It   s a small thing, but it   s something that makes the  house look more unique.  Thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it and all of your  thoughtful answers. So thank you for your help with this.  My pleasure. Thank you, Mrs. Larson.  -------  -------
