 Sherman and I   m with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Today, as part of the O-STATE Stories Project, I   m  interviewing Don Soergel who was a member of the 1959 OSU Cowboy  baseball National Championship team. I   m glad that you   re here today,  that you   re taking time out  to visit with me . I just want to welcome you  back on campus. First off, I   m going to ask you some questions about  your early life prior to your OSU experience, where you grew up and  stuff like that.  I grew up in Oklahoma City. I went to Capitol Hill High School. After  high school, I went down to OU on a basketball scholarship. I decided I  didn   t want to go to school. I was tired of school so I quit school and  went in the Navy. I spent four years in the Navy, travelled the world, got  to play basketball on an aircraft carrier that took a cruise around the  world.  Oh nice.  A wonderful experience. That   s all I did in the service for four years was  play athletics. There was no war or anything. They put a lot of emphasis  on athletics to take care of people because they had drafted a lot of  people in for the Korean campaign. I didn   t even get out of boot camp  before it was over.  Let   s back up here. What sports did you play while you were in high  school?  I played football, basketball, baseball.  A letter winner for all three?  Yes.  5  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  What was your favorite sport and what were you best at?  Probably baseball.  Baseball?  Yes, and I played it the longest. I played it until I was 36 years old so I  continued to play for a long time. I loved the game and my dad was a  really good athlete. He started me playing baseball when I was big  enough to walk.  So you went to OU on a basketball scholarship?  Yes, I did.  Tell me a little bit about that.  Well, I was an All-State basketball and baseball player. Back then you  could only be All-State in one sport to play, so I played in the baseball  game. But being All-State in basketball, Bruce Drake recruited me to go  to OU and play basketball as well. He told me I   d be able to play  basketball and baseball both there. So that   s what I went to do, but I just  got disappointed with school and didn   t want to go to school anymore  and so I left school and joined the Navy.  What year was this?  This would   ve been 1952.  So you spent four years in the Navy travelling the world. What were  some of your favorite ports of call?  Well, they all have one thing in common.  What was that?  Poverty. There was rich and poor, there was no middle class in most any  country I was ever in. And that   s the thing that probably bothered me the  most, why that was going on, but it was everywhere. I liked Portugal  real well, beautiful area. I enjoyed Italy. I got to see so many things and  go so many places that I never dreamed I   d be able to see.  Did you do the New York celebration? Did they have that back then  where they   d bring in all the ships?  Well, I started in New York. I went aboard an air craft carrier in  6  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Brooklyn, New York. We commissioned the 8th USS Hornet.  Really? The famous Hornet?  Yeah.  Wow.  That   s the ship that I cruised the world in. There were 19 of us on that  ship that were playing basketball and that   s about all we did. I ran an  athletic gear locker, handed out basketballs and baseballs and stuff to the  crew and that   s what my job was. But I played basketball. We would  practice, we had a basketball court in the hanger bay of the aircraft  carrier and we would practice at night because they weren   t using it at  night unless they had night operations for some reason. So we practiced  most of the time at night. It   s interesting bouncing a basketball when the  water   s a little rough.  Yes, I   m sure the different direction angles it.  But it was a great thing for me to be able to do.  So why the Navy?  I flipped a coin to see which branch I was going in. I really hadn   t  planned to go in the Service when I did. But my best friend and his folks  had moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and he was a paint contractor.  We went out to go to work for him and he hardly had enough work for  himself. So we went down to the post office on a Saturday morning and  flipped a coin to see which branch of the Service we   d join and we  ended up in the Navy. And unfortunately he was my best friend and the  last year he was in the Service, he got leukemia and he died in the  Service.  I   m sorry to hear that.  Yes. Great guy.  So you did your time in the Navy. Now how did you come up to OSU  then?  Well, I had a scholarship still to go back to OU, but my brother Dick,  who   s almost four years younger than I am, decided he was going to  OSU. I really looked forward to playing basketball with him so we got  to play baseball and football together. I ended up not playing basketball.  But he played all three. Dick played all three. He and I got to go to a  7  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  bowl game in football and got to win the National Championship in  baseball, so it was a really good deal.  So you played football too?  Yes.  What bowl game was that?  It was the one and only Bluegrass Bowl in Louisville, Kentucky. And  the high temperature was seven degrees.  Yes, I was just going to ask about that.  And the field we played on was a Kentucky Colonels baseball field and  of course it was just ice.  Oh really? A sheet of ice?  Yeah and so they decided we couldn   t play in cleats because they  wouldn   t even go in the ground and they put us in tennis shoes and, of  course, you still couldn   t get any footing but your feet froze in those  tennis shoes. But we got through it. It   s the coldest I   ve ever been.  (Laughter) That   s what I hear about that bowl game. Now what  positions did you play in football?  I played end. I was a receiver.  Both ways?  You had to play both ways back then. Yes, I did play both ways. I  wasn   t big enough to play defense but you had no choice. They tried to  hide me everywhere they could.  Now was it easy to shed those crimson and cream colors for OSU  colors?  Yes.  It was alright?  Yes. And you know, I so looked forward to playing with Dick. And  that   s the whole thing and it was great. We were so fortunate.  How many years did you play with your brother then?  8  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Three.  Now was that a little odd because you were the older brother?  Most everybody knew that. Because the coach was Cliff Speegle and, of  course, his brother was my basketball coach in high school, and Dick   s  also. So they all knew us, it worked fine. No problems.  Now you being an older member of the baseball team, was that an odd  thing? Were you more mature or what was that dynamic?  Well yeah, I   m sure I was.  Plus you had worldly experience.  That   s exactly right. But it hardly ever came up. You know, when you  play you play. You play to win and that   s it.  Talking about your OSU experiences, what did you major in here?  Well, I started out in Education and I thought I wanted to coach and  teach. Then I kind of got discouraged with that a little bit and  changed  to the School of Business . I made the grades and I had enough hours but  I had gone to Omaha to play in the College World Series baseball   tournament  and I ended up going back there to go to work for  Carpenter Paper Company. I went immediately from college to working  for Carpenter Paper Company in Omaha, Nebraska. I spent two years  there.  Did you ever get your degree?  No, I just never have. I guess I didn   t feel it was that important because I  worked 33 years for Carpenter Paper Company. I started out as a sales  trainee, and I retired as a Vice President of a division. So I had a good  career.  That   s good. That   s all that counts, as long as you have a good steady  career and you liked it and show up every day.  I loved it. It was great.  So where did you live when you were here on campus?  I lived at Bennett Hall.  Who were your roommates?  9  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Harry Taylor was my roommate at first. Harry was a tennis player up  here and we were there for four years.  Same roommate for four years? Same room or did you move up?  No, we lived in Bennett Hall the whole time and back then they would  let you have your room back. So that   s what we did.  Did you enjoy living over there?  Oh, I don   t know what to say about that other than the fact that it was a  place to live. I got married before I graduated and we lived in the  University Housing Apartments and they were brand new back then.  That was neat.  Did you meet your wife here?  Yes, I met her out at the swimming pool in Stillwater.  Oh, really?  Crystal Plunge, I believe it was.  Yes, yes.  That   s exactly where I met her.  And how did that go?  Well, her   it   s kind of an interesting deal, she knew who I was. The  reason she knew who I was was because at one time her mother lived  with and worked at The Daily Oklahoman with my aunts. I had two  aunts and they all lived together and they all worked at The Oklahoman  and Times back then. She knew of me, so it wasn   t anything that   when  she saw me at the swimming pool, she knew who I was and we just took  it from there.  So what was your dating life like? What   d you do? Where   d you take  her?  Oh, there were a lot of activities. They had a lot of really good talent  come on campus and put on shows back then and we went to a lot of  those. She was a Zeta  Tau Alpha  and so she had a lot of functions that  we went to. That   s really primarily what we did. They had some places  you could go dance and that   s what we did.  10  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Did you join a fraternity?  No, I was rushed pretty hard because my dad went to OSU early on for  awhile, not very long and he was a Sigma Nu. So the Sigma Nu   s rushed  me pretty hard, but I really just didn   t want to be in a fraternity.  Now what else did you do on campus for fun? Even though you were  busy with athletics.  Well, like I say, when I was dating they had a lot of good talent shows,   and we went to all the OSU basketball games and wrestling matches .  Like who did you see?  Oh golly, I can   t remember all of them. But it was quite a bunch and  they would have shows in the auditorium and they were really good.  That   s good.  Kay Kaiser I think was one of them. And that   s a long time ago.  (Laughs)  Like big bands? Like the jazz big bands?  Yes, they had some big bands.  Did country western singers roll through here?  They had some, yeah. I can   t remember who they were but they had  some.  What positions did you play for baseball?  Well, I played third base the first year I played. We had a lot of  infielders and no outfielders. So they moved myself and our shortstop to  the outfield. I played left field the next two years that I played.  Were you a starter on the team?  Yes.  Did you like playing left field?  Sure. I didn   t care where I played, just so I played.  What was the difference between the baseball life and the football life?  11  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Was baseball more relaxing to you?  Well, baseball   s a lot busier schedule, you play a lot more games in  baseball than you do in football. You just play one game a week in  football. The practices are certainly a lot easier because the football  practice is rough and tough. One year I had to go to football practice and  then put my baseball stuff on and go to baseball. Had to do both.  Oh, during the spring time?  Yeah, and that   s a hassle. That   s a job. But we got it done.  What kind of stats did you compile? Do you remember any of your stats?  Well, I never played baseball anywhere and hit under .300.  Oh, wow.  So that was my strength. I was a good hitter. I couldn   t run. I was slow.  Now were you a power hitter or were you     Yes, I hit quite a few home runs.  Did you work out underneath Gallagher Hall here?  Sure did.  Can you describe those experiences for me?  Oh, boy. Well, you know it was so dirty down there back then and you  always had people down there doing something else. They had a big  batting cage down there and we   d get in the batting cage and they had a  guy throwing the baseball and we   d take hitting practice. After that all  you   d do is run around and around that dirt track. So it wasn   t a lot of  fun. And sometimes they had   on one wall they had diamonds. And you  would practice throwing to that diamond and get the ball off the wall. It  would come off the wall pretty hard if you threw it hard.  Like fielding practice?  Yes. And that   s what you did.  When did baseball season start? When did you first have to start  practice?  12  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  April. Sometimes if the weather was good enough, sometimes we got a  little bit in March but most of the time April.  Now tell me, I heard stories about these inter-squad games. Were they  as intense as I   ve heard?  Pretty much so, yes.  Why was that?  Well, because you made the ball team that way. You have to  perform   under game conditions. You can go out there and catch ground balls and  fly balls and take batting practice all day long but that doesn   t make you  a ball player. Because baseball is a game that people don   t realize, you  have to know what you   re going to do before it happens. Because it   s  too late if you have to think about it. So you   re always thinking a play  ahead. You   ve always gotta know what you   re going to do with that ball  when it comes to you. And that   s the real difference I think. Basketball  and football are reactive sports. Baseball you   ve got to know what  you   re going to do before it happens or you can   t get it done.  Can you describe what Coach Toby Greene was like? What do you  remember about him?  He was a tough guy. He made the rules and he set the rules and you went  by the rules. That   s the way he was. Toby was a great athlete. He played  at Phillips University up in Enid. I went to a banquet one time and sat by  a guy that played tackle when Toby was a defensive end. This guy told  me,    I had the easiest job on the team, I didn   t have to do anything.  Toby did it all.    He wasn   t very big, but he really was a good athlete.  Now did he respect you because you served in the military?  I don   t think that was ever brought up. There   s no need, too many other  things were more important than that.  How did you travel to away games?  Cars.  Your cars?  Yes.  Now did you make money off that? Because I heard     13  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  No. I rode almost every trip that we took with a guy by the name of Ray  Bond, who was our catcher. Ray drove and I think he did make some  money driving his car. But it certainly wasn   t any more than he probably  should   ve made because of the upkeep. You   re going to wear a car out a  lot quicker if you have to drive those trips like we went on all the time.  We went on some pretty good trips. The Big Eight back then was pretty  spread out.  It still is.  Yeah, it still is. You played a single game on Friday and a double-header  on Saturday most all the time. Pretty tough schedule really. But I sure  liked it.  You sure liked it?  Oh, yeah. I loved it.  Did riding with fellow players create more camaraderie amongst the  team?  Oh, I don   t know that it did. I   m sure it didn   t hurt anything but it was  just one of those things that you did because it was the only way to do it.  Because it was necessary.  That   s right. That   s exactly right.  Now, I hear the baseball team was a pretty sociable bunch of guys. I  hear it was good time baseball parties. Can you describe any? Tell me  about those.  I   m afraid I can   t   you got me, I don   t remember baseball parties.  Alright. I just heard that after games they would go out.  I don   t recall that.  What were Coach Greene   s coaching strengths like?  I think he was a great judge of talent. I think he could tell if you could  play. He recruited people and I can   t remember anybody that he  recruited that wasn   t a ballplayer. So I think he could really judge talent.  He scouted our next opponents. I   ve never seen anybody able to do what  he did, run a play and he   d write down where everybody went.  14  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Oh wow.  He was amazing. We might have a twenty page report on the team we  were going to play the next week from him.  Now you were on the    58 team. Can you describe that    58 season for  me?  You mean the    58 baseball season?  Yes.  Well, I can tell you we got rooked.  Yes, that   s what I heard.  We went to Missouri. That was the darndest thing I   ve ever been  through. We played a game and we got beat. They had one really good  pitcher and he beat us 2 to 1. The next morning, at 8 o   clock in the  morning it was sprinkling and the Missouri coach was at our hotel door  saying,    We   re not going to be able to play today, it   s too wet.    We  couldn   t do anything about it, we just went home. And that was I think  our best ball team.  Even better than the    59 team?  I sure do. See, the    59 team was a lot of new guys. This team was  veterans. And we lost five guys that went to pro ball off of that team.  Because of the bonus contracts?  Yeah, that   s right. We had Jerry Adair and let   s see, Tim Green and we  had of course Joel  Horlen , the pitcher. But there were five guys that  signed pro contracts.  Now did you have that sense that you guys were slighted in 1958?  I sure did.  Did that provide any motivation for the upcoming    59 team?  Oh, I   m sure it did, but a lot of those guys didn   t play the next year. We  had a lot of new players.  What were your expectations for the    59 season?  15  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  I don   t think my attitude was ever different. I played to win and I always  felt like we had the ability to do so.  Can you describe how you guys won the Big Eight?  Well, the Big Eight was like the Big XII in a lot of ways because it was  so even. Any team could beat any other team, really. And, of course, it   s  all about pitching. We were blessed with some really good pitchers. We  had Dick and Horlen and Roy Peterson. And boy, that   s pretty tough to  beat. That   s what it   s all about. Ray Bond was our catcher and he was a  really, really smart catcher. A lot of college teams, the catcher doesn   t  call the pitches. But he did, he called all the pitches.  Oh wow, I didn   t know that.  He was that sharp. He was really a good catcher. He knew hitters, I  guarantee you he could find your weak spot.  What was the strength of your team?  Oh, I think pitching.  Pitching for sure?  Oh, yeah.  Let   s see, now also getting to the championship, can you describe that  for us? How you guys got there, not like driving, but like     Well, we went through a tough Big Eight schedule. I think you have to  have some luck in there as well. I think we had a little bit of that, but we  were a good team. And pitching is what it   s all about in baseball. We  had three really good pitchers.  Now once you got to the College World Series, what was that  atmosphere like?  Oh, it   s great. Omaha probably did as good a job at putting on a College  World Series as any place you could ever go. Because those people  really love baseball up there. They fill that stadium I mean to tell you,  they fill it up. They   re really neat people. They become a part of it when  you   re there because they learn who you are. They learn your name and  they   ll yell at you and they   ll talk to you and it   s a great atmosphere.  Now were you guys expected to win?  16  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  No.  Who would you consider was the favorite?  Well, the Arizona States and those people. You know, those are the  people that were touted to win the College World Series. Arizona,  Arizona State, Southern Cal, those teams, because they play long and  man they   ve got two seasons out there. We were not expected to beat  them, but we sneaked up on them a little bit.  What was the highlight of the Series for you?  Well, winning. That   s the whole thing. And of course, I went two years.  We went back the next year and we came in third.  I was going to ask you about that.  Yeah, we came in third. I did get to hit a home run in the College World  Series and that   s a thrill.  In    59 or    60?  In    60, but that was a thrill. I just can   t tell you how exciting it is to be in  that College World Series. It   s just a neat experience. There   s nothing  like it in amateur baseball.  When you lived up in Omaha, did you go to the College World Series?  Oh, yeah.  Every year?  Oh, yeah, I went any time I could. It   s a great show.  Is that a different feeling as a player or is it even more special because,     Hey I was in those guys    shoes   ?  No, because when you played, you were always thinking,    What do we  need to do to win the ballgame?    So that   s the way I look at a ballgame.  I   m not just a spectator. I kind of get into it, and I probably always will.  Do you remember your stats for the    59 Series?  Oh my, no. I sure don   t. I probably could dig them up somewhere but I  don   t remember them.  17  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  I   m sure the NCAA has them somewhere.  Yeah, I don   t remember them. I did decent though.  Can you describe the Championship game for me?  Gosh, fifty years ago. Oh my.  Because it was a payback game since you guys lost to Arizona, I   m sure  there was that feeling.  Oh, yeah.  How did you lose to Arizona the first game? Do you remember that?  Well, if I   m not mistaken, we just didn   t get the hits. Their pitching was  tough. Pitching   s always tough in the College World Series, and that   s  what wins ballgames. Don   t let anybody kid you, pitching   s what wins.  Now I   m sure that added an extra sense of joy because you guys beat  them again to win it.  Oh, wonderful. (Laughs) You bet. That   s a great, great feeling, because  you know you   re playing the best when you get to that pinnacle. When  you   re in the final game of the College World Series, that   s the best it  gets. It doesn   t get any better than that.  Now when you guys won, what was the reception like back in Stillwater?  Oh, wonderful. Just great, yeah. They really put it out for us. We had  parades and the whole thing. It was a wonderful experience.  Since you played in 1960, was there an extra burden since you were the  defending champions?  I didn   t ever feel that way. One of the things that happened is   I don   t  know whether you knew or not, but Dick got an infection in his knee and  he was not able to play. That was a bummer, it was really, really tough  because he was a heck of a leader as well as being a good pitcher. So we  missed that. But I think when you get to the finals in the College World  Series, anybody can win.  The best pitching usually wins the College  World Series.   It   s all about momentum too.  That   s right, oh yeah.  18  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  You look at Fresno State last year and it was all about momentum.  Yes. I guess you can say that. But by the same token you   ve got to have  the players. If they   re giving it all, you   re probably going to be okay. It   s  a great experience though.  Entering your second World Series were you guys expecting to repeat?  Sure. (Laughs)  Were you ranked number one then?  No, we were not. Our pitching was still our strength, but we didn   t hit  well at all. Just one of those things that happens to you sometimes.  Now is that still disappointing?  Sure. It always will be. Anything that I ever lost is disappointing.  See that   s something that Coach Greene probably instilled in you.  Oh, I guarantee you he did.  All through high school , we won so much  that you didn   t have any place in your life for losing. I played on so  many good teams and you expected to win. It   s really disappointing  when you don   t win and I tell you, you replay them a lot of times  in  your head .  So did you play minor league ball after?  No, I had some opportunities to do that but you know, my dad had  played pro baseball. He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals back when  Pepper Martin played. He was soured on professional athletics because  they kind of treated him wrong. He got some bad advice and he  shouldn   t have taken it, but he did. He was bitter about that and he didn   t  really ever care whether we played professional sports or not because of  that experience. My dad probably was the best athlete in my family. He  was three sports and really good. Played at OCU when they had football,  the Goldbugs. I   ve got pictures of him in a scrapbook. Back then the  helmets were just a piece of leather, he played without a helmet.  He   s a leatherhead   Yeah, but he played without a helmet, he wouldn   t wear one. He  couldn   t hear, he said. So I   ve got pictures of him in that scrapbook  running around without a helmet on. (Laughter)  19  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  How has college baseball changed since you played?  Oh, I think it   s better.  Better?  Sure. I do, I think it continues to get better because I think young people  are playing sooner and they   re getting better coaching and I think  athletics are better now than they were when I played.  Are you a fan of aluminum bats?  No, but that   s the way it is. I used aluminum bats  when I played semi-pro  ball , otherwise I never did use one. We all had wooden bats. I still  don   t like the sound of  aluminum bats .  You don   t like the ping sound?  Ping, no, I don   t. But I can understand it because the expense is just  horrible for those wooden bats because they really got expensive. And  you broke them all the time.  Going back, was it a joy to have played with your brother?  Oh yes, you bet. It was wonderful. I really did enjoy it. Like I said, he   s  almost four years younger than I am so we didn   t get to do much  together until I came back to school and I got to play sports with him.  We really had a good time, it was a pleasure.  Do you have any insights on your brother that you   d be willing to share?  The only insights I   ve got is how good he was. He was not only  physically good but he was mentally great. He was a very smart  ballplayer. He always did things smart. He didn   t have the best fastball  and he didn   t have the best curveball, but he had the best control. He  really studied hitters. He would pitch it where they weren   t going to hit  it anywhere. They might get the bat on it, but it wasn   t going to go  anywhere.  A good spot pitcher?  You bet. Really good. Had great control and he had a real herky-jerky  delivery. That   s why he didn   t play pro ball as a pitcher.  Because mechanically?  20  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Sherman  Soergel  Well, every scout thought that  the pitching  motion that he  ha would  cause him to have  a sore arm all the time and pretty soon he wouldn   t  be able to pitch. They didn   t go after him like they should   ve, I think.  But he was a great pitcher, he really was. He could   ve played pro ball.  I believe we have to get going, but you said you worked for Carpenter?  Carpenter Paper Company.  And you   ve been up in Omaha ever since?  No, I was in Omaha for two years and then I moved to  Shenandoah,  Iowa for nine years . We moved from  Shenandoah, Tulsa, Oklahoma ,  and then to Oklahoma City  for 27 years .  In 2000, we moved to   Hideaway, Texas. We lived in Hideaway, Texas for seven years before  moving back here to Edmond.  So you still follow OSU ball?  Oh yeah, I always did.  What do you think about all the changes that are going on around here?  It   s unbelievable.  The facility is as good as any in the USA.  They   ve  done a great job.  Just you wait until that new baseball facility is built     You know, the one they   ve got now is a super baseball park.  I just want to thank you and congratulate you on making it back here.  Thank you for the interview and thank you for the time today. It   ll add to  our knowledge of the team here and the campus.  Well thank you so much, I   ve enjoyed it.  I appreciate it.  You bet.  -------  -------
