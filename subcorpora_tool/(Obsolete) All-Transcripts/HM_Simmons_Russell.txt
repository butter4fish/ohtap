Story_ID: 13082
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are going to take a look at the history and the impact of the phenomenon known as Hip-Hop, whether it's music, fashion, finance or activism, his footprint is the defining element.
Speaker 2: [Music with photo montage of Russell Simmons and his business ventures].
Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, please help me in welcoming the incomparable, Russell Simmons. (applause)
Speaker 2: Now, this is--.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: --a wonderful, wonderful pleasure, Russell.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's my pleasure.
Speaker 2: Welcome.  We are so happy to have you here.  You know, you have really lifted the bar on corporate America.  Certainly, you could have taken all your success, gone on an extended sabbatical to St. Barths [St. Barthelemy], your favorite place, and just relaxed.  But, no, you're in the front line right now--every time there's a need, you're there.  And you're always on the telephone calling the rest of us, encouraging us to be part of the efforts, and raising money for those efforts.  I just want to say to you on behalf of all of us here this evening, "Thank you for your commitment and God bless you.  You're wonderful." (applause)
Speaker 1: Thank you, Cathy.  (Applause)  Thank you for always being there for us and thank you for a check today.  Did you write us a check today?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did. (laughs) I didn't have a chance--I couldn't get out of rehearsal without doing it, right.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you for the check today.  (laughs) God--God gives all of us resources and, and ideas and, and, and if we don't act on them, then we get stagnant, of course, and we're not happy ourselves.  So it's kind of, you know, you're selfish if--not if you don't share them, but it, if you don't--if you don't share them or do the work that God gives--puts in front of you, then you get stagnant and bored.  So maybe it's selfish of me because I go to work every day.  I feel like I, I work for some very talented and, and important people.  And I just, I'm, I'm their servant, you know.  So it makes me happy, and I'm, and I'm blessed to be able to do the work that I do.
Story_ID: 13083
Speaker 1: We want to start this historical journey with your childhood.  We'd like to know--we know you're born--were born in Jamaica, Queens, New York, but we would like to know about your mother and your father and how they were able to rear, not one, not two, but three successful sons?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother [Evelyn Simmons] and father [Daniel J. Simmons, Sr.] were both--and I was very blessed to have them, they were both educators.  My father was a teacher and my mother worked for the [New York City] Park Department, but taught pre-school.  And they were very nurturing, and we were fortunate to have them.  I think that, you know, a lot of luck was also in the mix.  All of us, you know, saw--we come out of some struggle.  A lot of our friends didn't make it.  And, you know, sometimes little turns in life, little lucky turns keep you on the path.  And so I've been very lucky, and--,
Speaker 1: And blessed.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --and blessed.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, both you and your younger brother have enjoyed tremendous success in the music industry.  Where did the musical talent come from?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think all of us, you know, African Americans, we grow up listening to it, and, and, you know, I just somehow was touched by it enough that it became a passion.  And it--I went to work every day, and, and, you know, it became--like I said, it was a passion, and it was a lot of fun, and I didn't know where my footsteps would lead me.  They were ordered, and they went where they went.  I was--I didn't know what I wanted to do most of my young adult, young life.  And then right about, I think the third year in school, City College [of New York], I was fortunate enough to be in City College, and I discovered hip-hop.  And it was, from then on it was--that was my passion.  It gave me a much better direction.  I'd made some bad choices up to then, but that was really something that gave me an opportunity to, to really put my energy into it, and that was positive.
Speaker 1: Still a very close family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your brother, Reverend Run [Joseph 'Joey' Simmons], is in the house, Chicago [Illinois], Reverend Run, please stand.  Give him some love. (applause) It's really great, isn't it, to see a black family that's had this level of success, still remain this close--baby brother, right in the house.  We love you all. (applause)
Story_ID: 13084
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your childhood a little bit because you--your family moved when you were about eight from Jamaica--.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Queens to Hollis [New York].  What was the difference in the communities?  And why'd they move?
Speaker 2: Oh, they moved--it was a step up, you know, there was some white people there. (laughs) They, they moved out--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No white folks in Jamaica Queens [New York].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They, they moved out immediately after we got there. (laughs) But, you know, I mean, no, it was just--it was a, a little bit nicer.  I mean we, you know, we called it lower-middle class neighborhoods.  You know, back then there was a, a heroin epidemic, and Hollis, Queens--we moved right into what was the heroin capital of Queens.  And a lot of us saw--you know, if you're my age, I mean--I never speak to people my own age. (laughs) Mostly, they don't want to see me. (laughs) But--and I don't want to see them. (laughs) But no, it, it was not--I'm just kidding.  But, you know, it was--our neighborhoods were destroyed back then.  All we had on the corner of Hollis Avenue were brothers from the Nation [of Islam] and the heroin addicts.  And it seemed like that's all that was on that corner on Hollis Avenue.  And it was a neighborhood that was destroyed, you know, at that time, from that kind of epidemic.
Speaker 1: So how did this influence--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was very, very lucky--well, it influenced us because all of our friends died or went to jail.
Speaker 1: I mean, did it bring you three brothers closer together because of the negative influences?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily, no, no, I don't, I don't--we were just, we were just lucky enough, again, to have parents [Daniel J. Simmons, Sr. and Evelyn Simmons] who promoted that in us, you know.  That's, that's the blessing right--you know, (applause) that--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) They were serious about the three of you all being all right, regardless of what was going on in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, and they were committed, they were committed and very supportive.  And, and I was--you know, we were lucky to have them, again.
Speaker 1: So when you were a teenager, you did the things that were going on in the neighborhood, like drug dealing and--.
Speaker 2: We didn't know no better.  You know--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, but you went to the City College of Harlem [sic, City College of New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how'd you get from dealing drugs on the block to college?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was--when you live one block away from that corner, you know, even the peop-, kids don't know.  You don't know what you're risking when you're young.  And a lot of you--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 2: You don't know what--you say, "Well, if I ain't kill nobody," you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You say that about your friends or people--and, and so you--we were just lucky enough--and I tell it, a lot of luck, you know, went into it.  And again, you know, you, you just hang on until you find the passion and something that you can your energy into that's safe and productive.  And that's what I did.
Story_ID: 13085
Speaker 1: And so, in college [City College of New York, New York], you go out one evening and bump into one of the greatest DJs [disc jockeys] ever to have lived--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I went--.
Speaker 1: --Eddie Cheeba.
Speaker 2: --I went, that's right.
Speaker 1: And all of a sudden, did a light bulb go off in your head and you're like, "This has potential."
Speaker 2: There was a, a club, Charles Gallery, in Harlem [neighborhood in New York].  And there was a artist, Eddie Cheeba, and it was before there were rap records.  And he was a great performer, and I saw him.  And my man was promoting these parties.  That was his job, and it, you know, it was--you could get in the club free, you know. (laughs) You, you know, you could--it was, the girls liked the promoter. (laughs) So it was a, it was a good job, you know, and it was a--I had a little--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Good work, if you can get it. (laughs)
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So--but the music, you know, and the artists, the poetry that, what they were doing back then was, was, you know, something I had never seen.  It was--inspired me, and I went to work.  And I mean, you know, I always worked for that cultural thing ever since, you know, and for the people who work in it.
Speaker 1: Now, it inspired you to open your first quote "legitimate" business.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And that was Rush Productions.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Let's take a look.
Story_ID: 13086
Speaker 1: (Kurtis Blow's song 'The Breaks' plays in the background).
Story_ID: 13087
Speaker 1: So just in case you don't know, that eating that apple is called "Keeping it real." (laughs) So let's talk about the incredible history of you teaming, Reverend Run--who was little brother Joey [Joseph Simmons] then, with two other incredible entertainers [Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels and Jason 'Jam Master Jay' Mizell] and forming Run DMC and changing everything that the music industry had been accustomed to.  Share that history with us, please.
Speaker 2: Well, before, before there were rap records, there was these artists, Eddie Cheeba you spoke of and DJ Hollywood and Kurtis Blow, was my first artist in '77 [1977], '78 [1978] before there were records--rap records.  DJ Run was the "son" of Kurtis Blow.  He was twelve or thirteen years old, and he performed with Kurtis and had this whole history, you know, of, of appreciation and working in, in the music business or what we called the music business then.  So he, he was always--he was always a hustler and a rapper and a DJ [disc jockey].  And we made our first record with Kurtis Blow in 1979, and about '83 [1983], he was sixteen or whatever it was, and we recorded--he and DMC would always be around the house rhyming and, and, and writing their stuff.  And I never paid attention to them.  So the guy in the, in the, the video just now, my man [Rudy] 'Spli' [Toppin] was like, "Yo, your brother is hot!" (laughs) My brother, who? (laughs) So they had formed a group, you know, the three of them were together.  And they were just young kids who were do--you know, doing like a lot of young kids.  But they were every day in the attic, and then--practicing, you know.  So they--.
Speaker 1: A gold mine in your living room--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right in the--and I couldn't see it, no--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --that you almost missed, that you couldn't see.
Speaker 2: That's the way it always is, though, right.  So, so we recorded a record which they wrote--and they wrote it.  And we recorded it in 1982, and it came out in 1983.  And that was just like that.  And that, you know, and I--it took me a minute to see how talented they were, you know, I'd always--I knew that Joey was the best DJ around, and I knew that he could rhyme, but I could never imagine that he would be a recording artist, even though I was working with other artists at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, was he bugging you?  Was he saying, "Yo, man, I can do this, I can do this!"
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, but I wouldn't listen to him.  You know, he's your brother (laughs) you don't pay attention.  It was really his, you know, his resilience and, then the way that they--you know, they watched us, and they were inspired.  And Kurtis Blow would come to the house and spend time with us.  And he was always, he was 'The Son the Kurtis Blow', was his name.  And Kurtis Blow's--,
Speaker 1: Oh, that was his stage name, The Son of Kurtis Blow.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah. And Kurtis Blow's first record--there was a, the whole second part of the record--and back then, you know, people stole each other's rhymes.  Somebody write a poem--.
Speaker 1: Yes, and still do as quiet as it's kept. (laughs)
Speaker 2: They still do, but, you know, now they sue each other over it. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Right, exactly. (laughs)
Speaker 2: And Joey wrote this song, "I'm DJ Run on the microphone, a place called krypton was my--", and that was the second half of Kurtis Blow's 'Christmas Rappin''. (laughs) Kurtis don't like when I tell this story.
Speaker 1: I know he doesn't.
Speaker 2: But, you know, since he, he never paid, so we'll make him pay now. (laughs)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right. (laughs)
Speaker 2: So that was--but he wrote, and he would always point to the fact--and Larry Smith, who was a producer on some other records that we had started producing, we had a Jimmy Spicer hit record, and Orange Krush, some other things that we produced together, Larry used to always say, "Let's bring Kurtis to the crib so Joe could eat him up on the mic [microphone]."  We used to have block parties.  And then, you know, it--everybody ganged up on me.  It was really his resilience and his wanting to do it.  It wasn't my vision.  It was his belief in himself, you know, and so--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Wow.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --we recorded him, and the way that--the number of songs they were able to write and the short time it took to make their album, and the way they were able to make their records.  We'd get to the studio, Larry and I, and the records were made--and I was the producer, you know, I'd, I'd wrote a few songs, but mostly they were written before I got there.
Story_ID: 13088
Speaker 1: The success of Run DMC is legendary.  When they went out on tour, it was a concert, the likes of which the entertainment industry had never seen before.
Speaker 2: Oh, they were inspired by a lot of great artists that came before them.  And we talked about Kurtis Blow.  And he was the first--I remember when he went on stage and--with just the turntables and how mad the, the other bands would get because they would come up there with--and the turntables and Davy D. [later Davy DMX] was a fantastic DJ [disc jockey].  And the--it was, people had never seen anything like it.  Young people took to it, and they would get better responses than a big sixteen-piece band, you know, and so Run saw all that, and put all those things together.  And he was the beginning of a transition between the performing art and the recording art.  In other words, the artists who came before him, who made records, their whole job was to perform, and their whole job was to build up a following through their performance.  And so that was their focus, to make--you know, to party and talk about having a good time, and to get crowd response.  But then the songwriting process is a whole different kind of energy.  And Run DMC were in between the performing artists and the ones who, you know, went on to just become great songwriters, and maybe not necessarily great performers.  So these guys had a history of performing art, you know, that was their passion.  And the recording part, you know, they, they moved into that period nicely.  So they, they bridged that gap.
Speaker 1: So now, around 1984, Jazzy Jay introduces you to the producer of his hit single, Rick Rubin--,
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and once again, your life shifts gears and starts going straight up to the stars.
Speaker 2: We managed a lot of artists.  We had Run DMC, we had Whodini, we had Fearless Four and Jimmy Spicer and just, oh, whoever was--just about all of the hot rap artists.  And--.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, at that time, you were "the" largest management company in the business, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that, in that business, yeah, a little business. (laughs) But the--we, we were the largest in that business, but there was no real--Rick Rubin produced a record--I remember listening to the radio, and you know, they'd have this--the, the 'DJ Show' on, you know, on Friday night only, the time you could hear rap records.  And I'd hear all my own records.  Then I heard this record, 'It's Yours', and it was produced--that was a record that had been produced by Rick Rubin--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) For Jazzy Jay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --and I was in the middle of making a record deal.  There were people who were intersted in now giving me an opportunity to create my own--produce my own records and put them out on my own label.  And I was just about to make that deal when I heard this record.  And I heard the record.  I called up Red Alert who was a DJ, who put me with Jazzy Jay, and Jazzy Jay and T La Rock were the artists and the producer was Rick Rubin.  I met Rick Rubin, and he wanted to start a record company.  And he was just another artist, he and the Beastie Boys, I thought I'd manage them, which I was their manager for, for that period.  And Rick would always want to--he wanted to start a label.  And he had produced this one record.  He's very talented.  And he--I went to his, I remember going to his dorm and listening to his drum machine 'cause back then it was only beats.  And he had so many hot joints, one after another.  So we started to work on his label, and I was the manager of his label.  And he kept--he said, "You know, if you give me three grand, then we could put in $3,000 a piece and we could start a company, and you could be my partner on it."  And then he had to convince me again because I was off making my other deal.  And it was his vision, and he had the name 'Def Jam' 'cause he used to think--you know, he was from the suburbs, and he thought def--things were death back then.  You know, bad--good things were def, and he thought it was death 'cause he didn't know no better.
Speaker 1: He thought it was D-E-A-F.
Speaker 2: He thought it was D-E-F.  "You know Rick, it's death."  And he said, "No, but it's Def."  And he had the logo Def--"So we'll just stick with this 'cause it's a hot logo," because it was Def, you know.  Some of the people my age know that things that was good was death, right?  And you didn't know where Def came from. (laughs) But, you know, but Rick also had a big backer.  He loved--when he came to me, he loved what I was producing cause I had made 'Rock Box', I produced 'Rock Box' with Run DMC and records that--'cause he came up with a rock and roll background and a strong appreciation for--,
Speaker 1: He worked with Aerosmith and other folks, right?
Speaker 2: Well, not then, no, he was just a kid.  He had never produced anything except that one record.
Speaker 1: Oh, really.
Speaker 2: He was a child, you know.  He had just pro--he was in, in his first year or second year in college.
Speaker 1: Oh, so that's why they say he was running the record company out of his dorm room.  That was true?
Speaker 2: That's right.  We worked out of his dorm room.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Saved on rent.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So we saved a lot of money on rent (laughs), but we wasn't making no money.  So we had to operate the--like that.  So anyway that became the beginning of Def Jam [Recordings] 'cause LL Cool J sent a tape.  And the King Ad-Rock from the Beastie Boys brought the tape to us, and LL Cool J was from Hollis, Queens [New York].
Speaker 1: Your home neighborhood.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's right.  And his demo [version] was great, but what Rick did, when he went to the studio with his demo, was even greater.  And that was the record we just put out with our own resources.  And we couldn't figure out--we put the record out, and it was selling, the vinyl was in plastic in shrink wrap, but the, we sold the whole box of records--I remember the hot store where DJs would shop, we sold the whole box of records.  And it seemed like, "How--well, how can they buy it?  It's wrapped in vinyl, you know--it's wrapped in plastic."  But it was just, you know--I always tell young people that you don't need any support--with 'Master P' [Percy Miller] and, and what we learned, we put out Kurtis Blow on our own.  And what we learned from LL Cool J and experience, all the way up until Jay-Z [Shawn Corey Carter] and 'Ludacris' [Christopher Bridges] and artists we signed recently, is that they don't need any support from any record company or anybody to validate them.
Story_ID: 13089
Speaker 1: Even radio stations, contrary to popular belief, because what you did--you started an alternative to go straight to the consumers, straight to the clubs, straight to the corner, the barbershop, the beauty parlor--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But that was the artist, the artist was so--they did something that was, you know, they filled a tremendous void.  You know, we started hip-hop--we would listen to 'YMCA' by the Village People on black radio.  We were listening to, "I Love America" by Patrick Juvet.  It was like, you know, we was in Harlem [New York, New York], it's like, "What, what are we listening to?" (audience laughter).  And so that was, you know, it--.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Frankie Crocker [disc jockey] wasn't playing it though, right?
Speaker 2: Frankie, no, Frankie Crocker was--you know, they was the Paradise Garage, and all the--only the gay clubs gave New York disco music.  That's all we had on black radio, and it was, you know, an attempt to cross over or whatever it was, but it was an escape from the 'hood [neighborhood].  And the 'hood felt it and resented it, just the way jazz or blues or rock-and-roll or the way any cultural phenomena starts.  Those who are left behind have to create something for themselves.  And hip-hop was something--.(applause)
Speaker 1: All good.
Speaker 2: So that's what it was.  It was, you know, it was our rebellion, and we do our own--we did our own thing.  And, and that's, you know, and, of course, what young people do today, you know, that whole spirit that they have, you know.  And these are people who are locked out.  We ain't got no successful--artists--rap artists that come out of any success.  They all come out of struggle, even to this day, and that's what gives them that spirit and that energy that makes them so special.
Speaker 1: It seems as if internationally and nationally, other communities seem to understand hip-hop culture a little bit better than our own people.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the first time we got any kind of play, video play was MTV [Music Television, cable network]--BET [Black Entertainment Television, cable network] didn't play rap videos--we never liked ourselves.  I'm sitting in front of you today, and I'm looking at people that, I'd say, about, people my age--you know, I remember when Dr. [Benjamin] Chavis [Muhammed] used Run DMC--and they only sang about going to church and not taking drugs--and he almost got fired for using them to register voters with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  We didn't like no rappers. (pauses) And we still don't. (audience laughter) You know, they still--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's the point (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You know, we carry a heavy judgment once we get over, you know.  That's why I'm like--you know, I try to keep my distance 'cause--well, I can't help it 'cause I'm surrounded by mature people.  But, you know, we get rigid--.
Speaker 1: As we get older.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --and we don't--yeah, we get rigid and we start, you know, we, we think they're curse words or cursed ideas, and they're not.  And we, we don't the way they dress, and we forget, you know, we used to--not me, some of y'all used to wear Dashikis and them--. (audience laughter) And y'all didn't like, you know, if y'all was really part of the [Civil Rights] Movement, you couldn't have liked the status quo much, and your parents didn't understand you, and, and they carried a lot of judgment of you.  And you know, you didn't mean nothing but to make the world better.  The fact that poor people or, or people who are locked out are mostly the big voices in American culture--they should be proud of that.  (applause) You know, 'cause they're saying that for a reason (pauses), they're saying that for a reason, you know, and, and all the things that, you know, they--when you say they're sexists, they ain't sexist as y'all are--I mean not y'all, me too, but people from our generation.  The young people who--when they sexist things on their records, and 'Ludacris' [Christopher Bridges] is a great example, and they talk about him, [conservative, Bill] O'Reilly says how horrible his lyrics are--.
Speaker 1: And got him fired from his endorsements.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they paid him.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 2: And they paid a lot of charities too. (applause)
Speaker 1: They sure did--,
Speaker 2: They won't do that again.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --because you did not allow it to go down.
Speaker 2: But, you know, Ludacris--they say men are very sexist, still today, very sexist--.
Speaker 1: I'll applaud to that. (laughs and applauds) Yes, in-deedy, particularly, our brothers--,
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah, well, not only our brothers, I mean, but we are very sexist, you know, and--but if Luda-, Ludacris--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --and sexy too, I got to throw that in. (laughs and applauds)
Speaker 2: You ain't got to clean it up.
Speaker 1: No, I ain't trying to clean up.  I'm serious about that. (laughs)
Speaker 2: But, you know, Ludacris, they don't like what he has to say, but, you know, he's got more women working and empowered women--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 2: --working around him then--if his father was a member of the clergy or a fireman or anything else, any respectable job, I, I almost can guarantee his father is much more sexist than he's ever been.  And that's, that's a truth, you know, this is the best generation.  They're not as racist, they're not as sexist, they're not as homophobic--none, none of those things.
Speaker 1: And they have a unity--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And they have vision, and, and a hope and respect for themselves, and, and you don't think it, but they got more pride in--you know, they go to school, you know, in their hip-hop clothes.  I don't care if you bust them off or whatever, and they're the coolest people in school and they know it.  You know, and, and they know it all--they know it when they get shipped off to school in Alaska and Paris and France--you know, Germany, wherever you send them, they're the coolest people in school.
Speaker 1: And they look out for each other.
Story_ID: 13090
Speaker 1: But I've got to ask you a question about the hostility in the lyrics.  Why is it that hostility towards women, towards authority, towards parents, church, education, everything that folks our generation and older hold as traditional, black values, why is it so commercially viable?  Why is it so successful?
Speaker 2: 'Cause they see the hypocrisy, they see it--they see something, and they're not any more--if you watch--they say that--or Chuck D [Carlton Douglas Ridenhour] said years ago that this generation's CN-, CNN [Cable News Network]--that was the last generation he said it, but "That hip-hop was the CNN of that generation."  And their stories that they tell about their communities, that news that they distribute is, is the news for those young people.  It can't near--it can't be nearly as, as bad as, as Fox [Broadcasting Company] News [Network] or CNN or any of them. (applause) And we got diversity in rap.  We got, we got lots of diversity in hip-hop, from 'Jesus Walks' [by Kanye West] to what Reverend Run's [Joseph 'Joey' Simmons] new stuff sounds like, to what LL Cool J is talking about, to Will Smith and we can go on and on, and even the ones that you think are, are gangsters, are out registering voters, and really if you listen closely, they're talking about what inspired them to get up and out of their struggle and what makes them give back to those people still struggling.  Their songs are not, you know-they, they don't like the status quo.  They're rebellious 'cause they're young, and 'cause they see that it can be better, not--you know, they don't, this is not rock-and-roll.  These are not affluent kids that come out of, you know--they're just mad at their parents for having money. (audience laughter) These kids are mad the system.  They're mad at the, the lies and they want change.  And they're much more sophisticated, if you listen, than your first impression.
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: So that's it--. (applause)
Speaker 1: And it behooves all of us to better understand them because they are our future.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: We have no choice about that.  The only other option is death, and I don't think any of us want that.  I want to talk about how you transitioned from music into television and into movies.  Fill us in on that because everything that you have done has brought the hip-hop culture into arenas that have, have historically shut us out, ignored us and denied us the opportunity.  But you were like the salmon that swim upstream.  You just kind of put on blinders and said, "We're going for it," and took a whole generation with you.
Speaker 2: The tele--the film and television ideas were because there was a need, a service.  I mean I'll tell you just a little bit later, if I, if we get to talk about this financial service 'cause I can't even count, and why is my biggest company, and the greatest opportunity for me by far, my financial service company.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: What--by far, it's growing quick. It's, it's filled a tremendous void.  And I've always, you know, seen--.
Speaker 1: And what does it do?  Let's talk about it.
Speaker 2: Well, what--well, let me--.
Speaker 1: Because you need money to do the movies and the television and that, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the, the movies, the movies because the artists wanted movies.  They wanted to be in movies.  So we made the 'Tougher Than Leather' [1988].  We financed ourselves in 'Krush Groove' [1985] and these, and then went to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and made movies 'cause we just wanted to express ourselves, you know, you wanted to do it.  And nobody understood it.  And why--the reason we made a record company 'cause nobody let me in, you know, they wouldn't--if not, I would have just made records for somebody if they allowed me to.
Speaker 1: Thank God, they didn't allow you to.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah. (applause) So, I, I just think that what the, the culture needed to expand in these various--in these different industries.  And the artists wanted to do it, and I was their manager.  Mostly, it's a calling, you know, you're, you're there at the door, and there's nobody in front of you that wants to do it for you.  Like, when we did the Hip-Hop Summit [June, 2001], I had the summit, a minister came, and he spoke.  And Will Smith came and [Sean] 'Puffy' [Combs] came, and Jay-Z [Shawn Corey Carter] and all, [Queen] Latifah [Dana Owens], everybody came.
Story_ID: 13091
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What's the purpose of the Hip-Hop Summit [June, 2001]?  People hear that term, but what is it?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the summit's just about using these--let me tell the story 'cause, the minister [Dr. Benjamin Chavis-Muhammed] speaks, and Kweisi Mfume comes, and Hugh Price who's the head of the [National] Urban League at the time, he came, and all the five mayor candidates for New York [New York] at the time, they came.  And, all these people came, and they wanted--some wanted to borrow their energy or use their energy for their movement.  They wanted to tell young people what the young should be doing to advance the older peoples causes, (laughs) as opposed to, you know, what the young people need and what their agenda could be if they would a--and, so that happened, and then I was like, I just wanted the minister to tell you how powerful you are 'cause I always, I always say this, and [Sean] 'Puffy' [Combs] and Jay-Z [Shawn Corey Carter] and these people are more well liked and, and trusted by young people around the world for sure, right?  (applause, laughter).  And so--,
Speaker 1: For sure.
Speaker 2: --And, in America as well, I mean.  They hear, we had--this whole discussion was about they're the leaders.  And they have this great opportunity to lead because people are listening to them and trust them.  And so when the summit's over, says, "See, that's good.  We learned a lot," but we made a lot of promises also.  But we made these promises, "We're gonna do this mentorship thing and we're gonna do this reader program with the Urban League.  And we're gonna get these people to continue to fight the Rockefeller drug laws, and, want to continue to, you know, and get them to register to vote."  So these are promises we made.  And then it's, "Well, well, when is the next summit?" (pauses) Said, "Well, I don't know, I mean when is it?"  And Dr. Chavis helped me to put it together, and so he came to work with me--it was natural.  There--people need it, it was a void, and it was my job.  It was obvious it was my job.  So that's really how all the jobs come into place, film or television, the com-, the comics were everywhere.  Martin Lawrence and Steve Harvey and Cedric ['The Entertainer'] and Bernie Mac and Chris Tucker and these people, they were everywhere.  They were, they were--in their communities, they were stars, but there was no vehicle for their expression.  So it was already hot.  I just was luck--fortunate enough to find a place to put them.  And that's what's been my, my excuse every time.

Speaker 1: 'Def Poetry' won a [American Theatre Wing] Tony [Award, 2003].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean that deserves a big round of applause. (applause) Poetry is one of the things that we do best in our community--,
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: --and have, regardless of the generation.  [William] 'Smokey' Robinson is a great poet.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You were talking about [Reverend] Run's [Joseph 'Joey' Simmons] lyrics and his writing.  That's poetry.  But once again, you saw--.
Speaker 2: We saw young people writing, doing more stand-up poetry with spoken with the spoken word.  It became an important focus for many of these programs.  So we saw it evolve, and, and I watched it over the years and, and it started to look more like every other kid as opposed to being an alternative art form, it became a commercial art form.  It was obvious.  They were talking about the things that were on the minds of most young people, as opposed to the heavy thinkers, 'cause I ain't no heavy thinker.  You know, I miss--and by the time it comes, you know, I'm late.  The comics were there, the poetry was ready to go.  Rap was the hottest thing in Harlem [neighborhood in New York, New York]--I'm giving you examples, this is up--and, you know, that's why I, I do the work, because it's, you know, it's--it just takes a little work now because they've done all the work.  And that's been my, you know, my commitment to keep serving them.  I didn't--listen, Lloyd Banks at twenty-one years old, the day his album was number one in the country--this is a great example, he was in Boston [Massachusetts] at a hip-hop summit.  He was in Boston, and he's twenty-one from south side Queens [New York].  He's what they call a 'gangsta rapper', and his first hit is number one in the whole country.  He's rich, that day forward. (audience laughter) And he's at the Hip-Hop Summit.  He's not doing it 'cause I asked him to be there.  He's there because that's what they're doing this week.  These poets are reflections of what young people are taught.  That's their truth, and he can smell what's in style.  He feels like the people feel.  This is, you know, it's, it's time, you know, it's all about timing and its natural cycle.
Story_ID: 13093
Speaker 1: Something else that was there, that I personally feel is responsible for your incredible humility is yoga.  You were into yoga, and you gave up meat back when the rest of us didn't even have a clue.  We were bragging about "Girl, get me some chit'lins and some cornbread, and I'll be a happy camper."  You changed your diet.  You changed your lifestyle.  You got into improving your health.  How and why?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I went my first yoga class, I went--I was living in, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  It was about eleven, twelve years ago.  And I went there, and it was, it was just 'cause there was so many fine girls in there. (audience laughter).  And--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) In tight body suits. (laughs)
Speaker 2: --And it was just me, it was just me and, and a friend of mine who took me, right, and, and two gay guys and sixty-four or five beautiful women.  And I remember going there that first practice.  And this teacher is a very different kind of teacher, this Steve Ross.  He had been a monk.  He wasn't only a vegetarian, but had been a raw foodist for thirty years, never eaten any cooked food for the last thirty years; very committed, spiritual person.  But his class was a lot of hip-hop music, and, you know, models and actresses, and, and he never talked too much about yoga and what yoga--for those who don't know, yoga means "Union with God."  That's the meaning of yoga.  And the practice of yoga is to bring you to a space where you're, what Christians call "Heaven on earth," what Buddhist call "Nirvana," you know, and some Christians refer to "Christ consciousness."  The space is--the, the yoga practice--and I remember coming out of the first class--I'm a tell you this 'cause it's a funny story.  I remember coming out and for a minute, I, you know, I was not so much anxiety 'cause I used to think anxiety was a driving force in my life, like worry, like--I was constantly thinking--rethinking.  And I came out of class and for a minute, I couldn't think about nothing.  I was just free for a minute.  And I remember saying, "If I keep doing this, I'm a lose all my money." (audience laughter) But nothing could be further from the truth because--.
Speaker 1: I'm surprised you went back to the second class. (laughs)
Speaker 2: But, you know, nothing could be further from the truth, but the truth is, you know, the silence is golden.  I was gonna say that about the poetry.  You know, God is in all of us, and in order to locate him, you need a little bit of silence, and, you know, your religion might tell you something or your, your preacher might--your preacher, your, your politician might convince you of something.  But you know, if you listen to a--the wrong Christian, he'll put, he'll tell you it's okay to put people in ovens.  He'll tell you it's okay to enslave people.  He'll tell you--they'll tell you anything.  And when, when everybody goes along, when you don't become a cultural hero, is one way of viewing it, when you don't have the instinct or the inspiration from God, not the teachers of God, but your connection yourself--if you don't look inside--you know when you look inside.  You know, I don't eat nothing that runs from me (audience laughter), if I could help it.  I don't want to eat any egg, any dairy, anything--I don't want nothing, I don't want to contribute to nothing that promotes suffering, if I can help it.
Story_ID: 13094
Speaker 1: Now, I'm certain that you have opened a door that a lot of folks would like for me to go in, so I can't resist it, when you talk about a lot of beautiful women.  For years you were a world-class playboy, that's common knowledge, but then the game captured the hunter, and the brilliant, the beautiful, the talented, Kimora Lee Simmons said, "It's time for you to become a family man."  You have an incredible family, two beautiful daughters [Ming Lee Simmons and Aoki Lee Simmons].  How has being married and settled and being the father of these two little baby girls, affected your thinking as it relates to hip-hop culture, particularly, the lyrics of the music, the fashion.  How do you see your daughters as they are growing up reacting to and being part of a culture that you are personally an architect of?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, you keep--and there's still a heavy judgment of this culture like, you know, [Rev. Andrew] Andy Young, I was in Atlanta [Georgia], and I wish I could think of some of them songs, some older people here know them. (audience laughter) But Andy Young started to recite the lyrics to some of the songs that y'all grew up with--.
Speaker 1: We can start with Ray Charles in 'Let's Go Get Stoned'--major hit.
Speaker 2: But that ain't nothing to compare to what he said.  I, I couldn't believe it (audience laughter), what the, what the Reverend said--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well, what was it, right, what was it (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Do you remember (unclear) what he said?  You know, I, you know, I want to, I want to promote in my daughter, I want to promote--I want to have a real dialogue with her about what's healthy.  I don't want to be too heavy in the, in restriction.  I want her to feel it and understand why not to do certain things.  I want her to know that the rules, you know, get you paid and happy.  When you know that hard work and dedication and spiritual practice, and these things are the things that make you happy.  If you have faith in those paths, and that's the, the way to go, to be happy, then you follow the path, you know.  And, and heaven here, you know, that old saying about the Buddhist and Nirvana and Samadhi is what the yogis refer to.  When you are present, you know, and when you're seeing--you know, the idea is to see God in everything, not to carry any judgment, but to see--'cause it's always gonna turn bad, you know, whatever you like that's good will turn bad, if you hold on to it long enough.  So you have to have faith in something beyond the physical things that you see every day and that you touch, know that you were always here and will always be here, so that you can learn to get in line, to get in order.  So if my daughter knows that everything is in divine order right now, then she won't want to do harmful things to herself.  And she'll be able to make decisions that won't be based on what the church tells her or what any, any--you know, any, any gang tells her.
Speaker 1: What about what the popular culture tells her?
Speaker 2: Oh, she's knows better--if she has a good heart and connected to that good heart, my point.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Phat Farm [clothing company] because certainly--.
Speaker 2: All right, that good, let's move on. (audience laughter)
Speaker 1: --she's, right.  She's going to grow up and be President and CEO [Chief Executive Officer] of Phat Farm one day.
Speaker 2: She might be.
Speaker 1: Let's take a look at Phat Farm.
Story_ID: 13095
Speaker 1: [A series of photos and interview clips about Russell Simmons's clothing company, Phat Farm]
Story_ID: 13096
Speaker 1: You've opened the door for so many other black designers to become fashion entrepreneurs.
Speaker 2: It's clear to Madison Avenue [advertising district in New York, New York], this is the brand-building community in the world.  If we say that--I'll tell you a story.  Kimora [Lee Simmons] came home once with a--it's been a lot of years now, with a platinum diamond, Franck Muller watch.  I noticed the Reverend [Run, Joseph 'Joey' Simmons] had one, Jay-Z [Shawn Corey Carter] and [Sean] 'Puffy' [Combs] had one, and they were, you know--fully diamonded out, Franck Muller watch.  And then I noticed a couple of months later, I saw it in 'WatchTime' magazine, and in 'Lifestyle' and in 'The Robb Report' and some of those kind of books.  Then I, I noticed--there was a partnership I have with--in four or five businesses, with some people who live in Ocean Park--on Ocean Parkway, in Brooklyn [New York]--the Syrian, Jewish community, and they got it later, and then I noticed the entertainment lawyers got it, and then it became an American brand, Franck Muller.  People are walking around now who got Franck Muller watches, and I know that my wife--remember when she started playing with [fashion designer] Roberto Cavalli, then when she made those [footwear designer] Manolo Blahnik boots, I saw it--I see the affect of, you know, her choices, and choices that we've made over the years in the luxury business.  And I remember a story--I remember [fashion designer] Tommy Hilfiger was doing twenty-five, thirty million dollars, and Grand Puba started to rap about him.  It's a multi-billion dollar company today, as we all know, still a multi-billion dollar company, but the brand was built because the hip-hop community said so.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They fixed [Gianni] Versace.  They reaffirmed Polo [Ralph Lauren], and they were the--they're the best brand-building community, whether--if they like Coke [Coca-Cola], it's cool.  Only eighty percent of the people who buy rap who aren't African Americans and follow these trends that these people set.  So this brand-building community, were building all these--and we had things that they were--I remember about then, I, I met Kimora.  She was nine years old then. (laughs) I met her, she was in the Chanel [Inc.] show, and she had these big, door-knocker earrings, and these big gold--the whole thing that was inspired by hip-hop.  And, and all the designers were inspired by hip-hop and were making these over-the-top things.  And they said that that was hip-hop.  But really, hip-hop was these--back then it was these Egyptian cotton shirts and these khakis and, you know, and this real clean, kind of cool look.  That was what I thought hip-hop was.  So I opened the boutique that represented, really represented the mindset of the people.  And the flag at Phat Farm is upside down--.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's always been, and it has to do with making America better, and the hang tag has always said that.  And it was an idea that took some cultivating because we still only wanted to wear Tommy [Hilfiger] and Ralph [Lauren] and, and Nordica [Corp., ski apparel] and stuff, but over a period--and we made what--see, the thing was, we made it honest.  It had integrity.  It was exactly what they wanted, but the name wasn't quite right.  But it got right, you know.  It was resistance and--well, resilience and lost a lot of money over a lot of years.
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Phat Farm wasn't no success story.  It was six years in--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You mean everything that you've touched hasn't turned to gold overnight?
Speaker 2: No, nothing turned to gold overnight.  You know, a great yogi said, "The imagination is, is God." Paramhansa Yogananda said that.  You may--great yogi, some, most of y'all might not have heard of him, but he's a very famous--in some places, he said, "The imagination is God, but you have to have faith in imagination."  And it takes faith and, and resil-, and hard work and dedication, and it don't never happen on your time.  It happens on God's time. (applause) So it takes--you know, ain't nothing happening--they think you got rich overnight?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It took six years of failure.  I had to, I had--just before I sold Def Jam [Recordings], I had to borrow money to keep Phat Farm open.  It looked good though, right--it was an image thing.  You couldn't--. (audience laughter)
Speaker 1: Because you are a master at branding.  I read an article once that said while every major corporation in America was concentrating on marketing their products and their services, you had already developed branding into a fine art.  How does a black kid from Queens [New York] turn all of corporate America around.  All of us now, the buzz word is branding, branding, branding.
Speaker 2: There's a dramatic difference between marketing and, and the short-term ideas that go along with it.  And brand-building and, and the integrity and the lasting stability that goes with that.  You know, even when you're building artists, Kurtis Blow is the King of Rap.  Kurtis Blow is off in Europe right now, performing somewhere.  And when he comes home, he works at--on the radio, he's Kurtis Blow.  He's still the King of Rap, you know, twenty-five years later or whatever it is.  LL Cool J is real because we made him--we, we, we didn't make him real, we sold what was real.  We wanted to build it with legs, you know, and, and that's the kind of a thing that hip-hop is known now.  We want to keep it real, you know, and that's what the sta-, stability is from integrity.  It's honest.  It's connection.  And that's really what brand-building is about, you know.  We, we said, "Classic American Flava" when we started Phat Farm.  Now, and, and that's thirteen years ago.  "Classic American Flava," that's, you know, how are you gonna be classic, you--don't you know? (audience laughter) But it's still the same catch, catch phrase, you know.  It's--so you have to have faith in that imagination.  You have to freeze it up and see it and stick with it.  You know, people are gonna whisper in your ear.  There's not one--you know how many people told me to quit?  What a waste of time and resources it was to stay on that mark.  Everything takes time, and nothing I did ever happened overnight.
Story_ID: 13097
Speaker 1: What do you want from yourself at this stage in your life?
Speaker 2: That's a good--I just want to be a good servant.  You know, I've given a lot of--I mean this so sincerely--I mean I've been giving a lot--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You are well underway because you are definitely a great servant.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for saying that.
Speaker 1: God is very well pleased with you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Minister [Louis] Farrakhan once said to me, "That you really can judge a person's spirituality by the blessings that Allah showers them with," and even though it might not have been overnight, certainly God is well pleased with you and your efforts.  And so much of it ties in to institution building.  That's what you've been about since Day One.  It's been called a lot of things, but Rush Philanthropic [Arts Foundation], the Hip-Hop Summit, the voter registration effort, and you just don't take a project and toss it out there like so many folks, and unfortunately, so many of our organizations sometimes do.  You institutionalize it, and I know, and perhaps some of our viewers in our audience may not be aware of, but the things that you're sharing with us this evening, you share with young people, you share with the rappers.  I mean it blows me away when I run into a twenty-two, twenty-three year old who challenges me on a philosophical point, and they'll say, "Russell Simmons and I were talking about that.  We were rapping about this, Ms. H. [Ms. Cathy Hughes], and that is an incredible legacy that you're leaving.  I want to talk about, though, your charitable ventures a moment more because it really is important, not just for those of us in corporate America to get involved, but all of us, particularly in black America.  No one's gonna solve our problems for us.  We have to take care of our own.  And you're leading that way. (applause)
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So, of all the things that you're involved in, is there a priority ranking?  Is Russ--Rush Philanthropic number one or explain to me your, your network, please?
Speaker 2: You got it like--I said about the resources, you know, what--there's a lot of things I wish I could solve, you know, our relation--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --let me, I mean if I can go on, you know, our relationship with the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, the lack of sensitivity on the part of our leaders for us, and how, you know, we don't want to be tossed aside and ignored or taken for granted. (applause) And, and the idea that equal, high quality education--I mean there's so many--our people need so much.  The priority usually is where can I really be helpful, more than, you know, what, what I'd like to see the world--how I would like to change the world.  AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome], you know, how bad is it and how little education we promote, and it just goes on.  There's so many things.  So I just do what I, what's in front of me, and when I think--where I have the resources and I have the support systems. (applause)
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Well, Mr. Russell Simmons, this certainly has been an evening of enlightenment and joy.  I thank you so much for sharing--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Thank you.
Speaker 1: --your time with us and helping us to keep our rich history alive for our people and our future generations.  You are an inspiration, and I know, quite sincerely, that in another day and time, you were a great African king.  I applaud you for that. (applause)
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And in your own immortal words, I just want to say one more thing in closing, "Thank you, God bless and good night". (applause)
